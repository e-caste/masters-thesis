00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.720
PROFESSOR: All
right, let's start.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.970
So first of all, I hope you've
been enjoying the class so far.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.590
And thank you for
filling out the survey.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.610
So we got some very useful
and interesting feedbacks.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.240
One of the feedbacks--
this is my impression,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.990
I haven't gotten a chance
to talk to my co-lecturers

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.670
or colleagues yet, but
I read some comments.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.730
You were saying that some of
the problem sets are quite hard.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.430
The math part may be a bit more
difficult than the lecture.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.700
So I'm thinking.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.390
So this is really the
application lecture.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.110
And from now, after three
more lectures by Choongbum,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.490
it will be essentially the
remainder is all applications.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.720
The original point
of having this class

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.910
is really to show you
how math is applied,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.250
to show you those cases
in different markets,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.010
different strategies,
and in the real industry.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.990
So I'm trying to think, how
do I give today's lecture

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.480
with the right balance?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.220
This is, after
all, a math class.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.270
Should I give you more math,
or should I-- you've had enough

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.910
math.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.535
I mean, it sounded
like from the survey

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:43.957
you probably had enough math.

00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:45.790
So I would probably
want to focus a bit more

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.480
on the application side.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.720
And from the survey also
it seems like most of you

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.770
enjoyed or wanted to listen to
more on the application side.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.150
So anyway, as you've already
learned from Peter's lecture,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.680
the so-called Modern
Portfolio Theory.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.729
And it's actually
not that modern

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.470
anymore, but we still call
it Modern Portfolio Theory.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.510
So you probably wonder,
in the real world,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.750
how actually we use it.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.550
Do we follow those steps?

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.870
Do we do those calculations?

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.720
And so today, I'd like to share
with you my experience on that,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.200
both in the past,
a different area,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.825
and today probably more
focused on the buy side.

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:34.210
Oh, come on in.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.496
Yeah.

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:37.870
Actually, these
are my colleagues

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.570
from Harvard Management.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.070
So--

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.360
[CHUCKLES]

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.330
--they will be able to ask
me really tough questions.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.800
So anyway, so how I'm
going to start this class.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.790
You wondered why I handed
out to each of you a page.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.210
So does everyone have
a blank page by now?

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.710
Yeah, actually.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.210
Yeah.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.070
Could also pass to--?

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.090
Yeah.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.900
So I want every one of
you to use that blank page

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.386
to construct a portfolio, OK?

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:15.510
So you're saying, well, I
haven't done this before.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.730
That's fine.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.170
Do it totally from
your intuition,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.120
from your knowledge
base as of now.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.290
So what I want you to
do is to write down,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.360
to break down the
100% of what do you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.640
want to have in your portfolio.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.710
OK, you said, give me choices.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.380
No, I'm not going
to give you choices.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.380
You think about whatever
you like to put down.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.020
Wide open, OK?

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.900
And don't even ask me
the goal or the criteria.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.580
Base it on what you want to do.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.050
And so totally free
thinking, but I want

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.040
you to do it in five minutes.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.460
So don't overthink it.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.167
And hand it back to me, OK?

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.500
So that's really the first part.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.730
I want you to show
intuitively how you

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.140
can construct a portfolio, OK?

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.580
So what does a portfolio mean?

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.070
That I have to explain to you.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.950
Let's say for
undergraduates here,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.790
so your parents give
you some allowance.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.610
You manage to save a
$1,000 on the side.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.310
You decided to put into
investments, buying stocks

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.930
or whatever, or gambling,
buy lottery tickets,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.107
whatever you can do.

00:04:23.107 --> 00:04:24.440
Just break down your percentage.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.430
That could be $1,000, or you
could be a portfolio manager

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.140
and have hundreds of billions
of dollars, or whatever.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.250
Or then and say if they raise
some money, start a hedge fund,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.780
they may have $10,000
just to start with.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.210
How do you want to use
those money on day one?

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.740
Just think about it.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.610
And then so while you're
filling out those pages,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.940
please hand it back to me.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.320
It's your choice to put
your name down or not.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.110
And then I will start
to assemble those ideas

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.720
and put them on the blackboard.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.276
And sometimes I may come back
to ask you a question-- you

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:01.400
know, why did you put this?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.480
That's OK.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.910
Don't feel embarrassed.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.910
We're not going to
put you on the spot.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.440
But the idea is I want to use
those examples to show you

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.420
how we actually connect
theory with practice.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.640
I remember when I was a
college student I learned

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.210
a lot of different stuff.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.530
But I remember one
lecture so well,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.500
one teacher told me one thing.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.030
I still remember vividly well,
so I want to pass it on to you.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.980
So how do we learn
something useful, right?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.560
You always start
with observation.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.940
So that's kind of
the physics side.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.190
You collect the data.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.700
You ask a lot of questions.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.590
You try to find the patterns.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.565
Then what you do,
you build models.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.180
You have a theory.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.620
You try to explain what is
working, what's repeatable,

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.680
what's not repeatable.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.390
So that's where
the math comes in.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.690
You solve the equations.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.720
Sometimes in economics,
lot of times,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.810
unlike physics, the repeatable
patterns are not so obvious.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.611
So what you do after this, so
you come back to observations

00:06:24.611 --> 00:06:25.110
again.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.020
You confirm your theory,
verify your predictions,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.970
and find your error.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.490
Then this feeds
back to this rule.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.530
And a lot of times, the
verification process

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.890
is really about
understanding special cases.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.550
That's why today I really want
to illustrate the portfolio

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.540
theory using a lot
of special cases.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.230
So can you start to hand back
your portfolio construction

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.920
by now?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.880
OK, so just hand back
whatever you have.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.560
If you have one thing on
the paper, that's fine.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.510
Or many things on
the paper, or you

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.360
think as a portfolio manager,
or you think as a trader,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.675
or you think simply as
a student, as yourself.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.740
All right, so I'm
getting these back.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.400
I will start to write
on the blackboard.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.330
And you can finish
what you started.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.210
By the way, that's the only
slide I'm going to use today.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.030
I'm not concerned-- you realize
if I show you a lot of slides,

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.930
you probably can't
keep up with me.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.429
So I'm going to write down
everything, just take my time.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.990
And so hopefully you get a
chance to think about questions

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.490
as well.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.940
OK, I think-- is
anyone finished?

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.574
Any more?

00:10:22.574 --> 00:10:24.538
OK.

00:10:24.538 --> 00:10:26.502
All right, OK.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.580
OK, great.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.841
You guys are awesome.

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:42.390
OK, so let me just
have a quick look

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.930
to see if I missed any, OK?

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.475
Wow, very interesting.

00:10:48.475 --> 00:10:52.860
So I have to say, some
people have high conviction.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.040
100% of you, one of those.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.080
I think I'm not going to read
your names, so don't worry, OK?

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.290
OK I'm just going to read the
answers that people put down,

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.270
OK?

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:16.020
So small cap equities, bonds,
real estate, commodities.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.950
Those were there.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.000
Qualitative strategies,
selection strategies,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.490
deep value models.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:33.120
Food/drug sector models, energy,
consumer, S&P index, ETF fund,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.720
government bonds,
top hedge funds.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.990
So natural resources,
timber land,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:59.890
farmland, checking account,
stocks, cash, corporate bonds,

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.140
rare coins, lotteries,
collectibles.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.700
That's very unique.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:18.340
And Apple's stock, Google
stock, gold, long term saving

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:18.840
annuities.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.210
So Yahoo, Morgan Stanley stocks.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.868
I like that.

00:12:29.868 --> 00:12:32.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.500
OK.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.990
Family trust.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.200
OK, I think that
pretty much covered it.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.810
OK, so I would say that
list is more or less here.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.160
So after you've
done this, when you

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.010
were doing this, what kind of
questions came to your mind?

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.181
Anyone wants to-- yeah, please.

00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:00.127
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] how do I
know what's the right balance

00:13:00.127 --> 00:13:02.091
to draw in my portfolio?

00:13:02.091 --> 00:13:07.010
Whether it would be cash,
bills, or stuff like that?

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.570
PROFESSOR: How do
you do it, really?

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.830
What's the criteria?

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.990
And so before we
answer the question how

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.420
you do, how do you group
assets or exposures

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:22.160
or strategies or even people,
traders, together-- before we

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.530
ask all those questions,
we have to ask

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.560
ourselves another question.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.020
What is the goal?

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.780
What is the objective, right?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.900
So we understand what
portfolio management is.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.880
So here in this class,
we're not talking

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.630
about how to come up with
a specific winning strategy

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.940
in trading or investments.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.390
But we are talking about
how to put them together.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.480
So this is what portfolio
management is about.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.850
So before we answer
how, let's see why.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.880
Why do we do it?

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.790
Why do we want to have
a portfolio, right?

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.100
That's a very, very good point.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:01.840
So let's understand the goals
of portfolio management.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.000
So before we understand goals
of portfolio management,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.655
let's understand
your situations,

00:14:09.655 --> 00:14:10.530
everyone's situation.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.150
So let's look at this chart.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.550
So I'm going to
plot your spending

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.220
as a function of your age.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:47.660
So when you are
age 0 to age 100,

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.549
so everyone's spending
pattern is different.

00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:51.965
So I'm not going to tell you
this is the spending pattern.

00:14:51.965 --> 00:14:54.770
So obviously when
kids are young,

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.650
they probably don't have a
lot of hobbies or tuition,

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.730
but they have some basic needs.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.630
So they spend.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.360
And then the spending
really goes up.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.550
Now your parents have
to pay your tuition,

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.830
or you have to borrow--
loans, scholarships.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.060
And then you have college.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.370
Now you have-- you're married.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.020
You have kids.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.180
You need to buy a house, buy
a car, pay back student loans.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.560
You have a lot more spending.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.120
Then you go on vacation.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.490
You buy investments.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.770
You just have more
spending coming up.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.860
So but it goes to
a certain point.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.610
You will taper down, right?

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.590
So you're not going
to keep going forever.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.075
So that's your spending curve.

00:15:37.075 --> 00:15:38.950
And with the other curve,
you think about it.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.710
It's what's your income,
what's your earnings curve.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.010
You don't earn anything
where you are just born.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.530
I use earning.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.380
So this is spending.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.810
So let's call this 50.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:04.100
Your earning probably
typically peaks around age 50,

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.970
but it really depends.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.700
Then you probably
go down, back up.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.238
Right, so that's your earning.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.240
And do they always match well?

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.410
They don't.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.350
So how do you make
up the difference?

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.690
You hope to have a fund,
an investment on the side,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:30.790
which can generate those cash
flows to balance your earning

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.220
versus your spending.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.980
OK, so that's only one
simple way to put it.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.500
So you've got to ask
about your situation.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.400
What's your cash flow look like?

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.210
So my objective is, I'm
going to retire at age of 50.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.060
Then after the age of
50, I will live free.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.490
I'll travel around the world.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.290
Now I'll calculate
how much money I need.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.712
So that's one situation.

00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:55.170
The other situation is, I want
to graduate and pay back all

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.780
the student loans in one year.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.520
So that's another.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.710
And typically people
have to plan these out.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.740
And if I'm managing a
university endowment,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.430
so I have to think about what
the university's operating

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.060
budget is like, how much money
they need every year drawing

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.530
from this fund.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.670
And then by
maintaining, protecting

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.190
the total fund for basically
a perpetual purpose, right?

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.670
Ongoing and keep growing it.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.920
You ask for more contributions,
but at the same time generating

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.380
more return.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.460
If you have a pension
fund, you have

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.300
to think about what time frame
lot of the people, the workers,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.670
will retire and will actually
draw from the pension.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.810
And so every situation
is very different.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.370
Let me even expand it.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.520
So you think, oh, this
is all about investment.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.110
No, no, this is not
just about investment.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:55.330
So I was a trader for a
long time at Morgan Stanley,

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.690
and later on a trading manager.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.830
So when I had many
traders working for me,

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.640
the question I was
facing is how much money

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.710
I need to allocate to each
trader to let them trade.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.250
How much risk do
they take, right?

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.390
So they said, oh, I have
this winning strategy.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.840
I can make lots of money.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.250
Why don't you give
me more limits?

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.860
No, you're not going
to have all the limits.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.060
You're not going to have all
the capital we can give to you.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.230
Right, so I'm going to explain.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.910
You have to diversify.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:28.800
At the same time, you have
to compare the strategies

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.370
with parameters--
liquidity, volatility,

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.510
and many other parameters.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:39.610
And even if you are
not managing people,

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.200
let's say-- I was going to
do this, so Dan, [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.400
Martin and Andrew.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.330
So they start a
hedge fund together.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.560
So each of them had
a great strategy.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.870
Dan has five, Andrew has
four, so they altogether

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.410
have 30 strategies.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.600
So they raise an
amount of money,

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.420
or they just pool
together their savings.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.150
But how do you
decide which strategy

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.620
to put more money on day one?

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.240
So those questions
are very practical.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.410
So that's all.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.240
So you understand
your goals, that's

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.220
then you're really clear on
how much risk you can take.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.720
So let's come back to that.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.740
So what is risk?

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.840
As Peter explained
in his lecture,

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.150
risk is actually not
very well defined.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.310
So in the Modern
Portfolio Theory,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.580
we typically talk about
variance or standard deviation

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.040
of return.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.380
So today I'm going to
start with that concept,

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.470
but then try to
expand it beyond that.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.920
So stay with that
concept for now.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.380
Risk, we use standard
deviation for now.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.170
So what are we trying to do?

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.195
So this, you are familiar
with this chart, right?

00:20:19.195 --> 00:20:21.880
So return versus
standard deviation.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.190
Standard deviation is
not going to go negative.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.510
So we stop at zero.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.160
But the return
can go below zero.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.970
And I'm going to review one
formula before I go into it.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.380
I think it's useful to review
what previously you learned.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.350
So you let's say you
have-- I will also

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.925
clarify the notation as well
so you don't get confused.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:53.810
So let's say-- so Peter
mentioned the Harry Markowitz

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.560
Modern Portfolio Theory
which won him the Nobel

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.100
Prize in 1990, right?

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.170
Along with Sharpe
and a few others.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:06.890
So it's a very
elegant piece of work.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.550
But today, I will try to
give you some special cases

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.650
to help you understand that.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.780
So let's review
one of the formulas

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.780
here, which is really
the definition.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.920
So let's say you
have a portfolio.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.740
Let's call the expected
return of the portfolio

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:37.420
is R of P, equal to the
sum, a weighted sum,

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.270
of all the expected
returns of each asset.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.830
You'll basically
linearly allocate them.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:58.190
Then the variance-- oh, let's
just look at the variance,

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.480
sigma_P squared.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.810
So these are vectors.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.390
This is a matrix.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.400
The sigma in the middle
is a covariance matrix.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.170
OK that's all you need to
know about math at this point.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.490
So I want us to go through an
exercise on that piece of paper

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.770
I just collected back to put
your choice of the investment

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.270
on this chart.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.059
OK, so let's start with one.

00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:36.725
So what is cash?

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.840
Cash has no standard deviation.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.220
You hold cash-- so it's
going to be on this axis.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.330
It's a positive return.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.290
So that's here.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.290
So let's call this cash.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.280
Where is-- and let's me just
think about another example.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.270
Where's lottery?

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:02.800
Say you buy Powerball, right?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.870
So where's lottery falling?

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.600
Let's assume you put
everything in lottery.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200
So you're going to lose.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:18.770
So your expected value is
very close to lose 100%.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.790
And your standard deviation
is probably very close to 0.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.070
So you will be here.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.620
So some of you say, oh, no, no.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.980
It's not exactly zero.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.020
So OK, fine.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.880
So maybe it's
somewhere here, OK?

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.590
So not 100%, but you still
have a pretty small deviation

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.810
from losing all the money.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.510
What is coin flipping?

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.890
So let's say you decide to
put all your money to gamble

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.620
on a fair coin flip, fair coin.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.320
So expected return is zero.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.278
What is the standard
deviation of that?

00:23:54.278 --> 00:23:55.194
AUDIENCE: 100%?

00:23:55.194 --> 00:23:56.570
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.650
So 100%.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:10.410
So we got the three
extreme cases covered.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:17.460
OK, so where is US
government bond?

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.600
So let's just call it five-year
note or ten-year bond.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.310
So the return is better than
cash with some volatility.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.110
Let's call it here.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.200
What is investing in a start
up venture capital fund like?

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.570
Pretty up there, right?

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.540
So you'll probably get
a very high return,

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.850
by you can lose all your money.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.810
So probably somewhere
here, you see.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.455
Buying stocks, let's
call it somewhere here.

00:24:58.298 --> 00:25:00.580
Our last application
lecture, you

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.830
heard about investing
in commodities, right?

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.850
Trading gold, oil.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:10.610
So that has higher volatility,
so sometimes high returns.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.850
So let's call this commodity.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:19.100
And the ETF is typically lower
than single stock volatility,

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.040
because it's just
like index funds.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.840
So here.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.310
Are there any other choices
you'd like to put on this map?

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:31.470
OK.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:36.220
So let me just look at
what you came up with.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.460
Real estate, OK.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.690
Real estate, I would say
probably somewhere around here.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:54.760
Private equity probably
somewhere here.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.060
Or investing in hedge
funds somewhere.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.000
So I think that's enough
examples to cover.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.060
So now let me turn the table
around and ask you a question.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:13.170
Given this map, how would you
like to pick your investments?

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.880
So you learned about
the portfolio theory.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.280
As a so-called
rational investor,

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.360
you try to maximize your return.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:28.140
At the same time, minimize
your standard deviation, right?

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.260
I hesitate to use
the term "risk," OK?

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.690
Because as I said, we
need to better define it.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.800
But let's just say you
try to minimize this

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.170
but maximize this,
the vertical axis.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.610
OK, so let's just say you
try to find the highest

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.590
possible return
for that portfolio

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.890
with the lowest possible
standard deviation.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.360
So would you pick this one?

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.680
Would you pick this one?

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.920
OK, so eliminate those two.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.270
But for this, that's
actually all possible, right?

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.610
So then that's where we learn
about the efficient frontier?

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.330
So what is the
efficient frontier?

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:18.120
It's really the
possible combinations

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.070
of those investments you
can push out to the boundary

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:27.100
that you can no longer find
another combination-- given

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.760
the same standard
deviation, you can no longer

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.940
find a higher return.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.460
So you reached the boundary.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.890
And the same is true
that for the same return,

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.820
you can no longer minimize
your standard deviation

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.830
by finding another combination.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.645
OK, so that's called
efficient frontier.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.090
How do you find the
efficient frontier?

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.325
That's what essentially
those work were done

00:28:01.325 --> 00:28:04.260
and it got them the
Nobel Prize, obviously.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.110
It's more than that,
but you get the flavor

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.860
from the previous lectures.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.130
So what I'm going to do
today is really reduce

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.500
all of these to the
special case of two assets.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.050
Now we can really derive a
lot of intuition from that.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.930
So we have sigma, R.
We're going to ignore

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.250
what's below this now, right?

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.480
We don't want to be there.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.310
And we want to stay
on the up-right.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.790
So let's consider
one special case.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.210
So again for that, let's
write out for the two assets.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.932
So what is R of P?

00:29:11.932 --> 00:29:19.010
It's w_1 R_1 plus 1
minus w_1 R_2, right?

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:20.816
Very simple math.

00:29:20.816 --> 00:29:24.100
And what is sigma_P?

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.940
So the standard deviation of
the portfolio-- or the variance

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:46.710
of that, which is a
square-- we know that's

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.620
for the two asset
class special case.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:55.840
So let me give you a further
restriction-- which, let's

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:06.860
consider if R_1 equal to R_2.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.830
Again, here meaning
expected return.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.220
I'm simplifying some
of the notations.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:21.210
And sigma_1 equal
to 0, and sigma_2

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:25.956
not equal to 0, so what is rho?

00:30:25.956 --> 00:30:26.955
What is the correlation?

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.310
Zero, right?

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.890
Because you have no
volatility on it.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:41.057
OK, so what is-- what's that?

00:30:41.057 --> 00:30:42.390
AUDIENCE: It's really undefined.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.028
PROFESSOR: It's
really undefined, yes.

00:30:44.028 --> 00:30:44.884
Yeah.

00:30:44.884 --> 00:30:47.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
no covariance.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.080
PROFESSOR: There's no--
yeah, that's right.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.100
OK, so let's look at this.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.970
So you have sigma_2 here.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.345
Sigma_1 is 0.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:03.070
And you have R_1 equal to R_2.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.728
What is all R of P?

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.380
It's R, right?

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.300
Because the weighting
doesn't matter.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:18.170
So you know it's going
to fall along this line.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:22.710
So here is when
weight one equal to 0.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.940
So you weight everything
on the second asset.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:31.170
Here you weight the
first asset 100%.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.120
So you have a possible
combination along this line,

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.160
along this flat line.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.750
Very simple, right?

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.000
I like to start with a
really a simple case.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:53.280
So what if sigma_1 also is
not 0, but sigma_1 equal

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.830
to sigma_2.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:32:00.714
And further, I impose-- impose--
the correlation to be 0, OK?

00:32:00.714 --> 00:32:01.880
What is this line look like?

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.980
So I have sigma_2
equal to sigma_1.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.950
And R_1 is still equal
to R_2, so R_P is still

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:15.750
equal to R_1 or R_2, right?

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.000
What does this line look like?

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.740
So volatility is the same.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.740
Return is those are the same
of each of the asset class.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.500
You have two strategies
or two instruments.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.810
They are zero-ly correlated.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.580
How would you combine them?

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.800
So you take the derivative
of this variance

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.800
with regarding to
the weight, right?

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.870
And then you minimize that.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:33:01.390
So what you find is that
this point is R_1 equal to 0,

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:06.100
or-- I'm sorry, w_1,
or w_1 equal to 1.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.021
You're at this point, right?

00:33:08.021 --> 00:33:08.520
Agreed?

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.460
So you choose either, you will
be ending up-- the portfolio

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.530
exposure in terms of return and
variance will be right here.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.600
But what if you
choose-- so when you

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.612
try to find the minimum
variance, you actually end up--

00:33:22.612 --> 00:33:23.820
I'm not going to do the math.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.930
You can do it afterwards.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.320
You check by yourself, OK?

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:32.950
You will find at
this point, that's

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.760
when they are equally
weighted, half and half.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:49.130
So you get square root of that.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:53.400
So you actually have a
significant reduction

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.780
of the variance of the portfolio
by choosing half and half,

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.060
zero-ly correlated portfolio.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.020
So what's that called?

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.340
What's that benefit?

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.740
Diversification, right?

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.920
When you have less than
perfectly correlated,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.110
positively correlated
assets, you

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.800
can actually achieve the same
return but having a lower

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.110
standard deviation.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.520
I'll say, OK, that's
fairly straightforward.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.679
So let's look at a few
more special cases.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:25.454
I want really to have you
establish this intuition.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:34.780
So let's think about what
if in the same example,

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.330
what if rho equals to
1, perfectly correlated?

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.150
Then you can't, right?

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:49.389
So you end up at
just this one point.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.761
You agree?

00:34:50.761 --> 00:34:51.260
OK.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.002
What if it's totally
negatively correlated?

00:34:59.002 --> 00:35:00.335
Perfectly negatively correlated.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.790
What's this line look like?

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.250
Right?

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.190
So you if you weight
everything to one side,

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.690
you're going to
still get this point.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:33.460
But if you weight
half and half, you're

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.416
going to achieve
basically zero variance.

00:35:37.416 --> 00:35:40.450
I think we showed
that last time,

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:41.790
you learned that last time.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:46.070
OK, so let's look
beyond those cases.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:46.740
So what now?

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:58.980
Let's look at-- so R_1 does
not equal to R_2 anymore.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:11.020
Sigma_1 equal to 0.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.170
There's no volatility
of the first asset.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:15.760
So that's cash, OK?

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.240
So that's a riskless
asset in the first one.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.740
So let's even call that
R_1 is less than R_2.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.530
So that's the-- right?

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:28.170
You have the cash asset, and
then you have a non-cash asset.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.539
Rho equal to 0,
zero correlation.

00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:32.330
So let's look at what
this line looks like.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.971
So R_1, R_2, sigma_2 here.

00:36:58.971 --> 00:37:06.450
When you weight asset
two 100%, you're

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.490
going to get this point, right?

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:15.020
When you weight asset
one 100%, you're

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.940
going to get this point, right?

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:24.440
So what's in the
middle of your return

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.510
as a function of variance?

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.500
Can someone guess?

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.824
AUDIENCE: A parabola?

00:37:31.824 --> 00:37:33.640
Should it be a parabola?

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.655
PROFESSOR: Try again.

00:37:35.655 --> 00:37:36.530
AUDIENCE: A parabola.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:37.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I know, I know.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:38.665
Thank you.

00:37:38.665 --> 00:37:40.270
Are there any other answers?

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.540
OK, this is actually
I-- let me just

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.140
derive very quickly for you.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.736
Sigma_1 equal to
0, rho equal to 0.

00:37:52.736 --> 00:37:53.360
What's sigma_P?

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.240
Right?

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:16.780
And sigma_P is essentially
proportional to sigma_2

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.750
with the weighting.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:21.914
OK, and what's R?

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:30.130
R is a linear combination
of R_1 and R_2.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:37.190
So it's still-- so it's linear.

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:47.060
OK, so because in these
cases, you actually-- you

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:52.220
essentially-- your return
is a linear function.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.000
And the slope, what
is the slope of this?

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.410
Oh, let's wait on the slope.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:04.060
So we can come back to this.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:09.080
This actually relates back to
the so-called capital market

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.515
line or capital
allocation line, OK?

00:39:12.515 --> 00:39:14.890
Because last time we talked
about the efficient frontier.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:25.450
That's when we have no riskless
assets in the portfolio, right?

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:31.860
When you add on cash, then
you actually can select.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.990
You can combine the
cash into the portfolio

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:42.490
by having a higher boundary,
higher Efficient Frontier,

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.240
and essentially a higher
return with the same exposure.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.510
So let's look at a
couple more cases, then

00:39:52.510 --> 00:40:02.280
I will tell you-- so I
think let's look at-- so R_1

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.350
is less than R_2.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.390
And volatilities are not 0.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:13.070
Also, sigma_1 is
less than sigma_2,

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:28.920
but it has a negative
correlation of 1.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.660
So you'll have asset
one, asset two.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:38.720
And as we know, where you pick
half and half, this goes to 0.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.070
So this is a quadratic function.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.950
You can verify and
prove it later.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:54.830
And what if when
rho is equal to 0--

00:40:54.830 --> 00:41:02.840
and actually, I want to-- so
sigma_1 should be here, OK?

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.680
So when rho is equal
to zero, this no longer

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.135
goes to-- the variance can
no longer be minimized to 0.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.470
So this is your efficient
frontier, this part.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.150
I think that's enough
examples of two assets

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.520
for the efficient frontier.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.080
So you get the idea.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.847
So then what if we
have three assets?

00:41:32.847 --> 00:41:34.680
So let me just touch
upon that very quickly.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.880
If you have one more
asset here, essentially

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.020
you can solve the
same equations.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:48.770
And when the-- special case:
you can verify afterwards,

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.580
if all the
volatilities are equal,

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.540
and zero correlation
among the assets.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:42:00.500
You're going to be able to
minimize sigma_P equal to 1

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.550
over the square root
of three of sigma_1.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.050
OK.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.050
So it seems pretty neat, right?

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:13.100
The math is not hard
and straightforward.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.540
But it gives you the idea
how to answer your question,

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:20.570
how to select them when
you start with two.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.580
So why are two
assets so important?

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.270
What's the implication
in practice?

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:31.230
It's actually a very
popular combination.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.180
Lot of the asset
managers, they simply

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.070
benchmark to bonds
versus equity.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.290
And then one famous
combination is really 60/40.

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:42.990
They call it a
60/40 combination.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:46.130
60% in equity, 40% in bonds.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.890
And even nowadays, any fund
manager, you have that.

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:52.140
People will still ask you
to compare your performance

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.170
with that combination.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:59.020
So the two-asset examples seem
to be quite easy and simple,

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:05.440
but actually it's a very
important one to compare.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.700
And that will lead me to
get into the risk parity

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.390
discussion.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:13.330
But before I get to
risk parity discussion,

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:17.080
I want to review the concept
of beta and the Sharpe ratio.

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:28.260
So your portfolio return,
this is your benchmark return,

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.840
R of m, expected return.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:36.520
R_f is the risk-free return,
so essentially a cash return.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:41.150
And alpha is what you can
generate additionally.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:45.650
So let's even not to worry
about these small other terms--

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:48.870
or not necessarily small,
but for the simplicity,

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:50.550
I'll just reveal that.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.660
So that's your beta.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.910
Now what is your Sharpe ratio?

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:15.330
OK.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:21.020
And you can-- so
sometimes Sharpe

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:26.315
ratio is also called
risk-weighted return,

00:45:26.315 --> 00:45:30.380
or risk-adjusted return.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:36.670
And how many of you have
heard of Kelly's formula?

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:39.680
So Kelly's formula
basically gives you

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.460
that when you have-- let's
say in the gambling example,

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.540
you know your winning
probability is p.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:59.600
So this basically tells
you how much to size up,

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.270
how much you want to bet on.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.130
So it's a very simple formula.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:13.010
So you have a winning
probability of 50/50,

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:16.300
how much you bet on?

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.330
Nothing.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:23.850
So if you have p equal to 100%,
you bet 100% of your position.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:28.170
If you have a winning
probability of negative 100%,

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:29.560
so what does it mean?

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.760
That means you have a 100%
probability of losing it.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.290
What do you do?

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.080
You bet the other
way around, right?

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.665
You bet the other side, so that
when p is equal to negative--

00:46:40.665 --> 00:46:42.040
I'm sorry, actually
what I should

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.480
say is when p equal to 0, your
losing probability becomes

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.710
100%, right?

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.370
So you bet 100%
the other way, OK?

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.560
So that I leave to
you to think about.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.200
That's when you have
discrete outcome case.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.900
But when you
construct a portfolio,

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.800
this leads to the next question.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:08.240
It's in addition to the
efficient frontier discussion,

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.000
is that really all
about asset allocation?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.830
Is that how we calculate
our weights of each asset

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:17.270
or strategy to choose from?

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.080
The answer is no, right?

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.765
So let's look at a
60/40 portfolio example.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.220
So again, two asset stock.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:56.150
Stock is, let's say,
60% percent, 40% bonds.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:31.280
So on this-- so typically
your stock volatility

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:35.190
is higher than the bonds, and
the return, expected return,

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:36.530
is also higher.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:41.770
So your 60/40 combinations
likely fall on the higher

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:45.070
return and the higher
standard deviation

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:48.500
part of the efficient frontier.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.760
So the question was--
so that's typically

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.920
what people do before 2000.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.470
A real asset manager, the
easiest way or the passive way

00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:00.100
is just to allocate 60/40.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:05.600
But after 2000, what happened
was when after the equity

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:12.750
market peaked and the bond had
a huge rally as first Greenspan

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:20.150
cut interest rates before
the Y2K in the year 2000.

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:22.900
You think it's kind of funny,
but at that time everybody

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.210
worried about the year 2000.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.490
All the computers
are going to stop

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:32.740
working because old software
were not prepared for crossing

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.920
this millennium event.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.660
So they had to cut interest
rates for this event.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:41.060
But actually nothing happened,
so everything was OK.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.860
But that left the market
with plenty of cash,

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.960
and also after the
tech bubble burst.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.650
So that was a good
portfolio, but then obviously

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:54.300
in 2008 when the
equity market crashed,

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.040
the bond market, the
government bond hybrid market,

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.240
had a huge rally.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:03.610
And so that made
people question that.

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:09.890
Is this 60/40 allocation of
asset simply by the market

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.240
value the optimal
way of doing it,

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.910
even though you are falling
on the Efficient Frontier?

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:18.420
But how do you compare
different points?

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:22.870
Is that simple choice of your
objectives, your situation,

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:28.070
or there's actually other
ways to optimize it.

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.290
So that's where the risk
parity concept was really--

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.340
the concept has been
around, but the term

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:39.210
was really coined in
2005, so quite recently,

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:41.940
by a guy named Edward Qian.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:46.840
He basically said, OK,
instead of allocating 60/40

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.870
based on market value,
why shouldn't we

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:52.060
consider allocating risk?

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.070
Instead of targeting a return,
targeting asset amount--

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:58.020
let's think about
a case where we

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:02.270
can have equal weighting of
risk between the two assets.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:06.780
So risk parity really means
equal risk weighting rather

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.650
than equal market exposure.

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:17.250
And then the further step
he took was he said, OK.

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.980
So this actually,
OK, is equal risk.

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:24.619
So you have lower return
and a lower risk, a lower

00:51:24.619 --> 00:51:25.410
standard deviation.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:29.040
But sometimes you will really
want a higher return, right?

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.570
How do you satisfy both?

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:36.060
Higher return and lower risk.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.460
Is there a free lunch?

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.850
So he was thinking, right?

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:42.370
There is, actually.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:45.366
It's not quite free, but
it's the closest thing.

00:51:45.366 --> 00:51:47.240
You've probably heard
this phrase many times.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.770
The closest thing in
investment to a free lunch

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:55.430
is diversification.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:52:00.720
OK, and so he's using a
leverage here as well.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.540
let me talk about it a bit
more, about diversification,

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.330
give you a couple
more examples, OK?

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:11.230
That phrase about the free
lunch and diversification

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:14.850
was actually from-- was
that from Markowitz?

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:18.620
Or people gave him that term.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:19.800
OK, but anyway.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:24.690
So let me give you another
simple example, OK?

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:34.840
So let's consider two
assets, A and B. In year one,

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:39.970
A goes up to-- it
basically doubles.

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:44.730
And in year two,
it goes down 50%.

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:46.334
So where does it end up?

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.160
So it started with 100%.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.250
It goes up to 200%.

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:10.010
Then it goes down
50% on the new base,

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.650
so it returns nothing, right?

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:12.930
It comes back.

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:21.750
So asset B in year one loses
50%, then doubles, up 100%

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:22.930
in year two.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:30.950
So asset B basically
goes down to 50%

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:35.780
and it goes back up to 100%.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:39.200
So that's when you look
at them independently.

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:44.170
But what if you had a 50/50
weight of the two assets?

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:46.600
So if someone who is
quick on math can tell me,

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.240
what does it change?

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.450
So A goes up like that,
B goes down like that.

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:59.010
Now you have a 50/50 A and
B. So let's look at magic.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:05.520
So in year one, A,
you have only 50%.

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:10.320
So it goes up 100%.

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:17.320
So that's up 50%
on the total basis.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:25.240
B, you'll also weight
50%, but it goes down 50%.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:29.150
So you have lost 25%.

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.340
So at the end of
year one, you're

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:38.620
actually-- so this is a combined
50/50 portfolio, year one

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:39.480
and year two.

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.990
So you started with 100.

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:48.850
You're up to 1.25
at this point, OK?

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:52.600
So at the end of year
one, you rebalance, right?

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.150
So you have to
come back to 50/50.

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:56.580
So what do you do?

00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:01.780
So this becomes 75, right?

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.350
So you no longer have
the 50/50 weight equal.

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:08.750
So you have to sell
A to come back to 50

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:11.810
and use the money to buy B.

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:17.670
So you have a new 50/50
percent weight asset.

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:19.570
Again, you can
figure out the math.

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:23.800
But what happens in
the following year

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.450
when you have this move,
this comes back 50%,

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:29.230
this goes up 100%.

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:36.740
You return another 25%
positively without volatility.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.910
So you have a straight line.

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:43.850
You can keep-- so
this two year is

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:48.560
a-- so that's so-called
diversification benefit.

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:53.120
And in the 60/40 bond market,
that's really the idea

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.670
people think about
how to combine them.

00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:00.900
And so let me talk a little
bit about risk parity

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.370
and how you actually
achieve them.

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:09.380
I'll try to leave plenty
of time for questions.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:17.510
So that's the return, and
so let's forget about these.

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:27.260
So let's leave cash here, OK?

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:35.900
So the previous example I gave
you, when you have two assets,

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:43.170
one is cash, R_1,
the other is not.

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.070
The other has a
volatility of sigma_2.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.820
You have this point, right?

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.960
So and I said,
what's in between?

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.510
It's a straight line.

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.870
That's your asset allocation,
different combination.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.350
Did it occur to you, why
can't we go beyond this point?

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:16.590
So this point is when we weight
w_2 equal to 1, w_1 equal to 0.

00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:21.570
That's when you weight
everything into the asset two.

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:22.940
What if you go beyond that?

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.060
What does that mean?

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:24.750
OK.

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:31.330
So let's say, can we have w_1
equal to minus 1, w_2 equal

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:33.990
to plus 2?

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:37.500
So they still add up to 100%.

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.524
But what's negative 1 mean?

00:57:41.524 --> 00:57:42.580
Borrow, right?

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:48.380
So you went short cash
100%, you borrow money.

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:53.120
You borrow 100% of cash,
then put into to buy

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.020
equity or whatever,
risky assets, here.

00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.540
So you have plus 2 minus 1.

00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:02.130
What does the return looks
like when you do this?

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:10.840
So R_P equal to w_1
R_1 plus w_2 R_2.

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:19.900
So minus R_1 plus 2R_2.

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.220
That's your return.

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.810
It's this point here.

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:28.220
What's your variance look
like, or standard deviation

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.142
look like?

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:34.000
As we did before, right?

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.040
So sigma_P simply
equal to w_2 sigma_2.

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.650
So in this case, it's 2sigma_2.

00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:47.980
So you're two times more
risky, two times as risky

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:53.110
as the asset two.

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:56.310
So this introduces the
concept of leverage.

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:59.580
Whenever you go short,
you introduce leverage.

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:02.170
You actually-- on
your balance sheet,

00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:05.950
you have two times of asset two.

00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:09.370
You're also short one of
the other instrument, right?

00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:11.230
OK so that's your liability.

00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:12.710
So your net is still one.

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:21.470
So what this risk
parity says is, OK,

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:26.140
so we can target on the
equal risk weighting, which

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:31.940
will give you somewhere
around-- let's called it 25.

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:39.690
25% bonds, 75%-- 25%
equity, 75% of fixed income.

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:44.420
Or in other words, 25%
of stocks, 75% of bonds.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:45.970
So you have lower return.

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:51.940
But if you leverage
it up, you actually

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:58.800
have higher return,
higher expected return,

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.500
given the same amount
of standard deviation.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.260
You achieved by leveraging up.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:08.120
Obviously, you
leverage up, right?

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.360
That's the other
implication of that.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.260
We haven't talked about
the liquidity risk,

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:16.210
but that's a different topic.

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:23.905
So what's your Sharpe ratio look
like for risk parity portfolio?

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:12.520
So you essentially
maximized the Sharpe ratio,

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.320
or risk-adjusted return, by
achieving the risk parity

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.340
portfolio.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.090
So 60/40 is here.

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:28.729
You actually maximize that, and
this is-- does leverage matter?

01:01:28.729 --> 01:01:31.020
When you leverage up, does
Sharpe ratio change, or not?

01:01:35.412 --> 01:01:36.876
AUDIENCE: It splits in half.

01:01:36.876 --> 01:01:41.770
So you've got twice the
[? variance ?] [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:46.084
PROFESSOR: So let's look at that
straight line, this example,

01:01:46.084 --> 01:01:46.584
OK?

01:01:51.460 --> 01:02:02.944
So we said Sharpe
ratio equal to-- right?

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:17.200
So R_P, what is sigma_P?

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.555
It's 2sigma_2, right,
when you leverage up.

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:34.474
So this equals to R_2 minus
R_1, divide by sigma_2.

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:41.940
So that's the same
as at this point.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:45.290
So that's essentially the
slope of the whole line.

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:47.010
It doesn't change.

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:50.430
OK, so now you can
see the connection

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:55.280
between the slope of this
curve and the Sharpe ratio

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.670
and how that links back to beta.

01:02:58.670 --> 01:03:00.430
So let me ask you
another question.

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:08.850
When the portfolio has higher
standard derivation of sigma_P,

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:12.544
will beta to a specific
asset increase or decrease?

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:19.240
So what's the
relationship intuitively

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.880
between beta-- so let's take
a look at the 60/40 example.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:28.210
Your portfolio, you have
stocks, you have bonds in it.

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:32.090
So I'm asking you, what is
really the beta of this 60/40

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.740
portfolio to the equity market?

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.300
When equity market, it
becomes-- when the portfolio

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.850
becomes more volatile.

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:43.390
Is your beta increasing
or decreasing?

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.820
So you can derive that.

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:51.240
I'm going to tell
you the result,

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.370
but I'm not going
to do the math here.

01:03:54.370 --> 01:04:06.170
So beta equals to-- [INAUDIBLE]
in this special case,

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:09.271
is sigma_P over sigma_2.

01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:09.770
OK.

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:15.550
All right, so so
much for all these.

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:19.320
I mean, it sounds like
everything is nicely solved.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.100
And so coming back
to the real world,

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.480
and let me bring you back, OK?

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.380
So are we all set for
portfolio management?

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:30.140
We can program, make
a robot to do this.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.880
Why do we need all
these guys working

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.980
on portfolio management?

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:44.800
Or why do we need anybody
to manage a hedge fund?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.390
You can just give money, right?

01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:49.410
So why do you need somebody,
anybody, to put it together?

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:50.920
So before I answer
this question,

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.100
let me show you a video.

01:05:01.581 --> 01:05:05.074
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:04.610
OK.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:13.840
Anyone heard about the
London Millennium Bridge?

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.590
So it was a bridge
built around that time

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:21.650
and thought it had
the latest technology.

01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:26.150
And it would really
perfectly absorb--

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:28.550
you heard about soldiers just
marching across a bridge,

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.900
and they'll crush the bridge.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.190
When everybody's
walking in sync,

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:35.920
your force gets synchronized.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.830
Then the bridge was
not designed to take

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:42.250
that synchronized force, so the
bridge collapsed in the past.

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:45.730
So when they designed this,
they took all that into account.

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:49.510
But what they hadn't
taken into account

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:52.850
was the support of
that is actually--

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:59.450
so they allow the horizontal
move to take that tension away.

01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:02.190
But the problem is
when everybody's sees

01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:07.290
more people walking in
sync, then the whole bridge

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:09.460
starts to swell, right?

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.360
Then the only way
to keep a balance

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.970
for you standing
on the bridge is

01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:17.760
to walk in sync
with other people.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.685
So that's a survival instinct.

01:07:20.685 --> 01:07:22.670
And so I got this--
I mean, that's

01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:25.310
actually my friend at
Fidelity, Ren Cheng.

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:26.910
Dr. Ren Cheng brought
this up to me.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.080
He said, oh, you're
doing-- how do

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.720
you think about the
portfolio risk, right?

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.330
This is what happened in the
financial market in 2008.

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:40.060
When you think you got
everything figured out,

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.460
you have the optimal strategy.

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.820
When everybody
starts to implement

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:50.210
the same optimal strategy
for your own as individual,

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:53.660
the whole system is
actually not optimized.

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:54.950
It's actually in danger.

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.260

01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.680
OK.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.336
These are metronomes, right?

01:08:02.336 --> 01:08:04.816
So can start anywhere you like.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.752
Are they in sync?

01:08:12.752 --> 01:08:13.744
Not yet.

01:08:18.208 --> 01:08:20.192
What is he doing?

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.752
You only have to listen to it.

01:08:41.752 --> 01:08:44.395
You don't have to see it.

01:08:44.395 --> 01:08:46.272
So what's going on here?

01:08:46.272 --> 01:08:49.840
This is not-- metronomes
don't have brains, right?

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.160
They don't really
follow the herd.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.700
Why are they synchronizing?

01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:14.648
OK, if you're expecting they
are getting out of sync,

01:09:14.648 --> 01:09:15.689
it's not going to happen.

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:17.910
OK, so I'm going
to stop right here.

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:19.564
OK.

01:09:19.564 --> 01:09:20.460
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:25.180
You can try as many--
how do I get out of this?

01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:32.410
OK, so you can try it.

01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:36.140
You can look at-- there's
actually a book written on this

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:36.810
as well, so.

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:41.460
But the phenomena
here is nothing new.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:46.649
But what when he did
this, what's that mean?

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:49.479
When he actually raised
that thing on the plate

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:53.149
and put it on the Coke cans?

01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:54.240
What happened?

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.545
Why is that is so significant?

01:09:59.034 --> 01:10:00.700
AUDIENCE: Because now
they're connected.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.600
PROFESSOR: They're connected.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.100
Right.

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.780
So they are interconnected.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.720
Before, they were individuals.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.770
Now they're connected.

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:12.560
And why did I show you
the London Bridge and this

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.360
at the same time?

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.660
What's this to do with
portfolio management?

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.132
What's this to do with
portfolio management?

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:22.802
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
people who are trading,

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:25.385
if they have the same strategy,
[INAUDIBLE] affect each other,

01:10:25.385 --> 01:10:26.843
they become connected
in that way--

01:10:26.843 --> 01:10:27.685
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:10:27.685 --> 01:10:29.317
AUDIENCE: If as
an individual, you

01:10:29.317 --> 01:10:31.150
are doing a different
strategy, if everybody

01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:32.608
has been doing
something different,

01:10:32.608 --> 01:10:35.620
you can maximize
[? in the space. ?]

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.140
PROFESSOR: Very well said.

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:41.720
So if you're looking
for this stationary best

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.920
way of optimizing
your portfolio,

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:47.240
chances are everybody
else is going

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.509
to figure out the same thing.

01:10:48.509 --> 01:10:50.300
And eventually, you
end up in the situation

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.450
and you actually get killed.

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:58.250
OK, so that's the thing.

01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:01.120
What you learned today,
what you walk away was this.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.610
OK, today is not what I
want you to know that all

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:07.750
the problems are solved.

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:12.910
Right?

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:14.451
So you say, oh, the
problem's solved.

01:11:14.451 --> 01:11:16.290
The Nobel Prize was given.

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:18.770
So let's just program them.

01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:22.170
No, you actually-- it's
a dynamic situation.

01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:23.195
You have to.

01:11:23.195 --> 01:11:25.070
So that makes the problem
interesting, right?

01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:27.780
As a younger generation,
you're coming to the field.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.370
The excitement is
there are still

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.390
a lot of interesting
problems out there unsolved.

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:36.300
You can beat the others
already in the field.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.920
And so that's one takeaway.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.240
And what are the
takeaways you think

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.470
by listening to all these?

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.350
AUDIENCE: Diversification
is a free lunch.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.850
[CHUCKLES]

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.850
PROFESSOR: Diversification
is a free lunch, yes.

01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:56.410
Not so free, right, in the end.

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:58.510
It's free to a certain extent.

01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:00.870
But it's something--
you know, it's better

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:02.970
than not diversified, right?

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:04.540
It depends on how you do it.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:07.810
But there is a way
you can optimize.

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:10.920
And so it's-- I want
to leave with you,

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.710
I actually want to finish a few
minutes earlier so that you can

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:15.010
ask me questions.

01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:15.750
You can ask.

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:19.320
It's probably better to
have this open discussion.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:23.710
And so I want you to
walk away, to really keep

01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:27.180
in mind is in the
field of finance,

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:32.730
and particularly in the
quantitative finance,

01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:34.230
it's not mechanical.

01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:37.010
It's not like solving
physics problems.

01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:39.390
It's not like you can get
everything figured so it

01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:41.480
becomes predictable, right?

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:47.590
So the level of predictability
is actually very much linked

01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:48.970
to a lot of other things.

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:51.600
Physics, you solve
Newton's equations.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.480
You have a controlled
environment

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.780
and you know what you're
getting in the outcome.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:59.750
But here, when you
participate in the market,

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.720
you are changing the market.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.620
You are adding on
other factors into it.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:09.180
So think more from a
broader scope kind of view

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:12.860
rather than just
solve the mathematics.

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.860
That's why I come
back to the original--

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.100
if you walk away
from this lecture,

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.520
you'll remember what I
said at the very beginning.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.730
Solving problems
is about observe,

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:25.290
collecting data,
building models,

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:28.140
then verify and observe again.

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:31.230
OK, so I'll end right
here, so questions.

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:37.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just
[INAUDIBLE] question.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:40.600
Does this have anything to
do with-- it kind of sounds

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.026
like game theory, but
I'm not exactly too sure.

01:13:43.026 --> 01:13:45.460
Because you have
a huge population

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.470
and no stable equilibrium.

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:51.130
Does it have anything to do
with game theory, by any chance?

01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:53.088
PROFESSOR: It has a lot
to do with game theory,

01:13:53.088 --> 01:13:55.740
but not only to game theory.

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:59.680
So game theory, you have
a pretty well-defined set

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.150
of rules.

01:14:01.150 --> 01:14:03.760
Two people play chess
against each other.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:07.490
That's where a computer actually
can become smarter, right?

01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:11.760
So in this market situation,
you have so many people

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.610
participating without
clearly defined rules.

01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:20.270
There are some rules, but
not always clearly defined.

01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:26.190
And so it's much more
complex than game theory.

01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:30.510
But it's part of it, yeah.

01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:31.140
Dan, yeah?

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:33.723
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit about why some of the risk

01:14:33.723 --> 01:14:36.046
parity portfolios that did
so poorly in May and June

01:14:36.046 --> 01:14:38.750
when rates started to rise
and what about their portfolio

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:39.750
allowed them do that?

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:41.083
PROFESSOR: Good question, right.

01:14:41.083 --> 01:14:47.840
So as you can see here, what
the risk parity approach does

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:53.250
is essentially to weight more
on the lower volatility asset.

01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:56.610
In this case, the question
is, how do you know

01:14:56.610 --> 01:14:58.340
which asset has low volatility?

01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:02.130
So you look at
historical data, which

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:05.410
you conclude bonds have
the lower volatility.

01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:06.850
So you overweight bonds.

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:08.280
That's the essence
of them, right?

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.140
So then when bonds
to start to sell off

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.190
after Bernanke, Fed
chairman Bernanke,

01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:17.310
said he's going to taper
quantitative easing.

01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:22.954
So bonds from a very low high
yield, a very low yield level,

01:15:22.954 --> 01:15:25.370
the yield went much higher,
the interest rate went higher.

01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:26.390
Bonds got sold off.

01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:30.420
So this portfolio did poorly.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:34.310
So now the question
is, does that

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:39.070
prove the risk parity approach
wrong, or does it prove right?

01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:42.040
Does the financial
crisis of 2008

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.020
prove the risk parity
approach a superior approach,

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.925
or does the June/May
experience prove this

01:15:48.925 --> 01:15:53.640
as the less-favored approach?

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.870
What does it tell us?

01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:56.980
Think about it.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:00.710
So it really is inconclusive.

01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:05.380
So you observe, you extrapolate
from your historical data.

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:10.020
But what you are
really doing is you're

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:15.870
trying to forecast volatility,
forecast return, forecast

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:20.120
correlation, all based
on historical data.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.790
It's like-- a lot of
people use that example.

01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:27.900
It's like driving by looking
at the rear view mirror.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.750
That's the only thing
you look at, right?

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:33.010
You don't know what's going
on, happening in front of you.

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:34.345
You have another question?

01:16:34.345 --> 01:16:36.520
AUDIENCE: Given all
this new information,

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.220
do you find that
people are still

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:43.170
playing similar [INAUDIBLE]
strategy with portfolio

01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:44.590
management?

01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:46.920
PROFESSOR: Very much true.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.480
Why?

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.150
Right, so you said, people
should be smarter than that.

01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:55.350
It's very difficult to
discover new asset classes.

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:58.400
It's also very
difficult to invent

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.780
new strategies in which you have
a better winning probability.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.670
The other risk, the other
very interesting phenomenon,

01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:08.895
is most of the traders and
the portfolio managers,

01:17:08.895 --> 01:17:12.300
the investors, they
are career investors--

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:16.460
meaning just like if
I'm a baseball coach,

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:21.460
I'm hired to coach
a baseball team.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.300
My performance is
really measured

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:27.410
against the other teams
when I win or lose, right?

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:30.470
A portfolio manager
or investor is also

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:32.460
measured against their peers.

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:37.990
So the safest way for them to
do is to benchmark to an index,

01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:39.260
to the herd.

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:43.720
So there's very little
incentive for them to get out

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.080
of the crowd, because
if they are wrong,

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.550
they get killed first.

01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:49.910
They lose their jobs.

01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:53.760
So the tendency is to
stay with the crowd.

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.110
It's for survival instinct.

01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:57.550
It's, again, the other example.

01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:59.410
It's actually the
optimal strategy

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:04.290
for individual portfolio manager
is really to do the same thing

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:06.850
as other people are
doing because you

01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:10.430
stay with the force.

01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:16.217
AUDIENCE: So you said given
that we have all these groups,

01:18:16.217 --> 01:18:18.672
in the end, it's not just
that we could leave it

01:18:18.672 --> 01:18:19.654
to the computers.

01:18:19.654 --> 01:18:20.940
We need managers.

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.680
So what different
are the managers

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.960
doing, other than [INAUDIBLE]?

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.550
PROFESSOR: Can you try to
answer that question yourself?

01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:31.440
What's the difference between
a human and a computer?

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.610
That's really-- what
can human add value

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.940
to what a computer can do?

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.910
AUDIENCE: Consider the factors,
the market factors and news

01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:43.230
and what's going on.

01:18:43.230 --> 01:18:45.340
PROFESSOR: So taking more
information, processing

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:51.010
information, make a judgment
on a more holistic approach.

01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:52.730
So it's an interesting question.

01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:56.500
I have to say that
computers are beating

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.310
humans in many different ways.

01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:04.105
Can a computer ever get to
the point actually beating

01:19:04.105 --> 01:19:06.080
a human in investment?

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.780
I can't confidently tell you
that it's not going to happen.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.640
It may happen.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.500
So I don't know.

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:19.820
Any other questions?

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:20.318
Yeah?

01:19:20.318 --> 01:19:21.568
AUDIENCE: Just to add to that.

01:19:21.568 --> 01:19:25.316
I think there is some more to
management than just investing.

01:19:25.316 --> 01:19:33.066
I think managers also have key
roles in their HR, key roles in

01:19:33.066 --> 01:19:35.190
just like managing people
and ensuring that they're

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:37.790
maximizing their
talents, not just like,

01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:39.640
oh, how much money did you make?

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.540
But I mean, are you moving
forward in your career

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.400
while you're there?

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.267
So I think management has a
role to play in that as well,

01:19:46.267 --> 01:19:47.100
not just investment.

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
that's a good point.

01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:55.300
Yeah.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.120
All right, so-- oh, sure.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:57.620
Jesse?

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.440
AUDIENCE: What is your
portfolio breakdown?

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.960
PROFESSOR: My
personal portfolio?

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.900
Well, I am actually very
conservative at this point,

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:10.820
because if you look at my curve
of those spending and earning

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:16.520
curve, I'm basically trying
to protect principals rather

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.570
than try to maximize
return at this point.

01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:25.480
So I would be sliding down
more towards this part

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:29.500
rather than try to go
to this corner, yeah.

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.110
So I haven't really
talked much about risk.

01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:33.580
What is risk, right?

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:37.500
So I talk about volatility
or standard deviation.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:41.200
But as we all know that, as
Peter mentioned last time as

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.550
well, there are many other ways
to look at risk-- value at risk

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:51.290
or half distribution or
truncated distribution,

01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:55.160
or simply maximum loss you
can afford to take, right?

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.660
But looking at standard
deviation or volatility

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:02.680
is an elegant way.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.310
You can see.

01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:09.170
I can really show you in
very simple math about how

01:21:09.170 --> 01:21:11.440
the concept actually plays out.

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.600
But in the end,
actually volatility

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:18.420
is really not the best
measure, in my view, of risk.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:18.920
Why?

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:24.368
Let me give you another simple
example before we leave.

01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:31.450
So let's say this is over time.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:43.700
This is your cumulative
return or you dollar amount.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.090
So you start from here.

01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:53.489
If you go flat,
then-- does anyone

01:21:53.489 --> 01:21:55.155
like to have this
kind of a performance?

01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:59.230
Right?

01:21:59.230 --> 01:22:00.410
Of course, right?

01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:01.240
This is very nice.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.190
You keep going up.

01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:03.930
You never go down.

01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:08.940
But what's the
volatility of that?

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:12.890
The volatility is
probably not low, right?

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:16.345
And then on the
other hand, you could

01:22:16.345 --> 01:22:26.840
have-- what I'm
trying to say, when

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.010
you look at expected
return matching expected

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:38.190
return and the volatility,
you can still really not

01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:40.630
selecting the best combination.

01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:43.530
Because what you really
should care about

01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:46.540
is not just your volatility.

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:51.820
And again, bear in mind all
the discussion about the Modern

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:54.920
Portfolio Theory is based
on one key assumption here.

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:59.220
It's about Gaussian
distribution, OK?

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.240
Normal distribution.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:04.800
The two parameters, mean
and standard deviation,

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.850
categorize the distribution.

01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:11.780
But in reality, you have many
other sets of distributions.

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:17.400
And so it's a concept
still up for a lot

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.460
of discussion and debate.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:24.710
But I want to leave
that with you as well.

01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:25.690
Yeah?

01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:28.385
AUDIENCE: Just going back to
the same question about what

01:23:28.385 --> 01:23:30.590
these guys were asking
about management

01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:33.060
and how do they add
value, I think the people

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:35.170
who added value-- there
were some people who

01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:38.430
added a tremendous amount of
value in the financial crisis.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:40.400
And they were doing
the same mathematics.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.455
But a difference was in
their expected return

01:23:42.455 --> 01:23:44.910
of various assets was
different from the entire--

01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:46.360
the broad market.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.500
So if you can just know what
expected return is that,

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.810
probably that is the only
answer to the whole portfolio

01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:53.590
management debate.

01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:54.370
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:23:54.370 --> 01:24:00.900
If you can forecast expected
return, then that's-- yeah,

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:01.920
now you know the game.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.760
You solved it.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.605
You solved the big
part of the puzzle.

01:24:04.605 --> 01:24:05.105
Yeah?

01:24:05.105 --> 01:24:07.250
AUDIENCE: What
management does is

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:10.370
how good it can do [INAUDIBLE]
expected return, full stop.

01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.980
Nothing more.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.470
PROFESSOR: I disagree on that.

01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:16.490
That's the only thing.

01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:21.040
Because given two managers, they
have the same expected return,

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.710
but you can still further
differentiate them, right?

01:24:24.710 --> 01:24:25.650
So that's-- yeah.

01:24:25.650 --> 01:24:29.500
And that's what all this
discussion is about.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.940
But yes, expected return will
drive lot of these decisions.

01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.530
If you know one manager's good
expected return, three years

01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:41.122
later, he's going to make 150%.

01:24:41.122 --> 01:24:43.080
You don't really care
what's in between, right?

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.140
You're just going
to ride it through.

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:48.840
But the problem is you
don't know for sure.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:52.287
You will never be sure.

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:53.870
AUDIENCE: I'd like
to comment on that.

01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:54.220
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:55.595
AUDIENCE: What
[INAUDIBLE] looked

01:24:55.595 --> 01:24:58.330
at in simplified
settings, estimating

01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:00.560
returns and volatilities.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.820
And the problem, the
conclusion for the problem,

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:09.770
was basically cannot
estimate returns very well,

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:12.240
even with more data,
over a historical period.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.950
But you can estimate volatility
much better with more data.

01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:19.060
So there's really an
issue of perhaps luck

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:23.160
in getting the return estimates
right with different managers,

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.480
which are hard to prove
that there was really

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.580
an expertise behind that.

01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:33.910
Although with volatility, you
can have improved estimates.

01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:37.290
And I think possibly with
a risk parity portfolio,

01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:40.750
those portfolios are focusing
not on return expectations,

01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:43.870
but saying if we're going to
consider different choices

01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:46.560
based on just how
much risk they have

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.400
and equalize that risk, then
the expected return should

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.116
be comparable across
those, perhaps.

01:25:54.116 --> 01:25:55.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.290
So that highlights
the difficulty

01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:59.840
of forecasting return,
forecasting volatility,

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.440
forecasting correlation.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.780
So risk parity appears
to be another elegant way

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:07.800
of proposing the
optimal strategy

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.122
but it has the same problems.

01:26:10.122 --> 01:26:10.782
Yeah?

01:26:10.782 --> 01:26:12.740
AUDIENCE: Actually, I
also wanted to highlight.

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.930
You mentioned the
Kelly criterion,

01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:18.470
which we haven't covered the
theory for that previously.

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.100
But I encourage people
to look into that.

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.840
It deals with issues of
multi-period investments

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.830
as opposed to
single-period investments.

01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:30.945
And most-- all this classical
theory we've been discussing,

01:26:30.945 --> 01:26:34.600
or that I discuss, covers
just a single period analysis,

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:38.020
which is an oversimplification
of an investment.

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:41.952
And when you are investing
over multiple periods,

01:26:41.952 --> 01:26:45.790
the Kelly criterion tells you
how to optimally basically

01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:47.780
bet with your bank roll.

01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:53.380
And actually there's an
excellent book, at least

01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:56.120
I like it, called
Fortune's Formula

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.510
that talks about--
[? we already ?]

01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:00.830
said the origins of
options theory in finance.

01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:02.760
But it does get into
the Kelly criterion.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:08.780
And there was a rather major
discussion between Shannon,

01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:12.280
a mathematician at MIT, who
advocated applying the Kelly

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:17.139
criterion, and Paul Samuelson,
one of the major economists.

01:27:17.139 --> 01:27:18.180
PROFESSOR: Also from MIT.

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:19.790
AUDIENCE: Also from MIT.

01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:23.710
And there was a great
dispute about how you should

01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:26.339
do portfolio optimization.

01:27:26.339 --> 01:27:27.630
PROFESSOR: That's a great book.

01:27:27.630 --> 01:27:30.090
And a lot of
characters in that book

01:27:30.090 --> 01:27:34.840
actually are from MIT--
and Ed Thorp, for example.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:41.530
And it's really about people
trying to find the Holy Grail

01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:44.540
magic formula-- not
really to that extent,

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:47.910
but finding something other
people haven't figured out.

01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:50.900
But it's very
interesting history.

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:56.830
Big names like Shannon, very
successful in other fields.

01:27:56.830 --> 01:28:01.000
In his later part of his
career and life really devoted

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.915
most of his time to
studying this problem.

01:28:06.915 --> 01:28:08.710
You know Shannon, right?

01:28:08.710 --> 01:28:09.940
Claude Shannon?

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:15.270
He's the father of
information theory

01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:18.520
and has a lot to do with
the later information age

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:23.540
invention of computers
and very successful, yeah.

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:25.980
So anyway, so we'll end
the class right here.

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.810
No homework for today, OK?

01:28:27.810 --> 01:28:31.050
So you just need to-- yeah, OK.

01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:33.100
All right, thank you.

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:27.830
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Let's
move on to our next module

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.080
of the day, which called
People: The Heart of Lean.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.350
What people who
have studied Lean

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.190
and the Toyota production
system in general have found

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.050
is that there's
two major aspects

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.500
of these kinds of systems.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.010
One is this kind of
just-in-time production

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.170
that we typically see,
and which we talked about

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.970
in the new balance plant tour.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.770
But the second and
equally important

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.600
component of these
kinds of systems

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.600
is the respect-for-human
system that exists.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.060
And you heard, again in
our new balance plant tour

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.663
you heard Claudio talk
about the immense respect

00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:02.080
that they have for
their employees

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.230
and how employee involvement
is valued and encouraged

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.800
in his organization.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.120
Now the trouble is
for a lot of folks,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.090
and engineers in particular, is
we think about the people part

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.640
to the problem and
we sometimes sees

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.257
these as really challenging.

00:01:18.257 --> 00:01:20.590
And this is a quote from a
gentleman at Northrop Grumman

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.173
who's fairly high
in their management,

00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:25.660
and he sums it up very nicely
by saying "the soft stuff is

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.885
the hard stuff."

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:29.260
The soft stuff, which is
usually thought of as the people

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.540
issues, is often seen
as some of the hardest

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.920
challenges in an organization.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.210
He's very true.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.160
But it's one of
those important items

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.290
to work on when you think about
making an organization lean.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.990
So in this section
on people we want

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.510
to have you achieve the
following three learning

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.750
objectives.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.240
The first is to
be able to explain

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.350
why people are key to improving
productivity and organization.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.350
The second is to
make you realize

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.710
that effective communication,
shared goals, and knowledge,

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.010
and mutual respect lead
to improved organizational

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.570
performance.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.150
And third, we'd like you
to be able to participate

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.190
as a member of a team
in order to achieve

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.060
a productive and
positive outcome.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.065
So to get us kicked
off on this discussion,

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:14.440
I'd like you to
think and reflect

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.920
on the most important things
that contribute to your job

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.778
satisfaction.

00:02:18.778 --> 00:02:21.070
So whether you're a student
or whether you're currently

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.120
working, think about what it is
that makes you very satisfied

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.770
with your job.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.680
And I'd like to ask
for some volunteers

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.197
to tell me first of all, what's
the most important thing?

00:02:32.197 --> 00:02:33.280
Let's start off with that.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.238
I'm going to start to
make a list on the board.

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:38.942
AUDIENCE: Maybe feeling like
you've made a difference

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.379
at the end of the day.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.534
Whether it be to the
customers or to the staff

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:44.211
that you work with.

00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:45.650
ANNALISA WEIGEL: What else?

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.398
Yes.

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:48.190
AUDIENCE: Felt like
I've learned something.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.957
OK, I've going to
put something up.

00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:53.040
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Learning.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.840
Great.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.590
AUDIENCE: Having control
over the outcomes

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.548
you're responsible for.

00:03:01.984 --> 00:03:02.976
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Yes.

00:03:02.976 --> 00:03:05.460
AUDIENCE: I'd say having
room for creativity.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.280
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Creativity.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.540
In the back.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.414
AUDIENCE: Feeling
respected or valued.

00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:12.820
ANNALISA WEIGEL: What else?

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.760
Yes.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.650
AUDIENCE: Making
connections with individuals

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.793
and the community at large.

00:03:17.793 --> 00:03:18.960
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Connection.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.890
So it's the relationships with
your co-workers, customers,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.380
everybody?

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, with my
patients and med students

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.280
that I work with, but also
connecting with the needs

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.030
of the community in general.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.970
I guess with my colleagues, too.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.440
Though that seems secondary.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.910
ANNALISA WEIGEL: What else?

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.890
Yes?

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.850
AUDIENCE: Acknowledgement
of a job well done.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.260
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Yes?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.180
AUDIENCE: I think a job you can
work to your full potential.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.140
ANNALISA WEIGEL: OK.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.010
Anything else?

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.344
AUDIENCE: Responsibility.

00:03:56.463 --> 00:03:57.296
ANNALISA WEIGEL: OK.

00:03:57.296 --> 00:03:57.796
In the back.

00:03:57.796 --> 00:03:58.910
Yes.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.725
AUDIENCE: I don't require that,
but the financial incentives.

00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:03.600
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Financial
incentive, salary?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.225
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:05.020
Make money.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.853
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Let's
call that what it is.

00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:07.620
Salary.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.260
Great.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.740
We've all got to eat.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.310
Go ahead.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.058
AUDIENCE: Having the time to
do my job right the first time

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:14.600
and feeling like I
didn't wallow away

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.760
in errors throughout the day.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.690
ANNALISA WEIGEL:
So adequate time.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.200
What else?

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.930
AUDIENCE: Working hours.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.180
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Your hours.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.180
So take a look at the
list we have here.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.640
And think if the most important
thing that contributes

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.405
to your own job satisfaction
isn't on this list,

00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:36.780
and you'd like to
raise your hand

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.010
and tell us about
it, that'll be great.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.268
we'll add it to the list.

00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:41.060
Otherwise we might
start to winnow it down.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.032
AUDIENCE: Lack of stress.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.740
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Stress
free environment.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.490
AUDIENCE: Or reduced stress.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.100
ANNALISA WEIGEL:
OK, so low stress.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.350
Reduced stress.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.180
Susan?

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.678
AUDIENCE: Being part of a team.

00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:56.043
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Yes, in back.

00:04:56.043 --> 00:04:57.710
AUDIENCE: It's sort
of related to hours,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.775
but work-family balance.

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.729
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Yes.

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:05.521
AUDIENCE: Feedback.

00:05:06.162 --> 00:05:08.670
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Feedback
from your supervisor?

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.650
OK.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.240
Great.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.920
Do we have any-- one more
burning last suggestion?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.440
Matteis?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.357
AUDIENCE: Environment.

00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:18.648
Working environment.

00:05:18.648 --> 00:05:20.690
ANNALISA WEIGEL: OK, so
take a read through these

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.300
and what I'd like
to ask you to do now

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.960
is each person take a voting
strip of dots they should

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.120
be distributed on your table.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.800
What I'll ask you to
do is just come up

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.640
to the board and place one dot
next to each of your top three

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.140
items.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.740
So you get to vote for 3 as
the most important things that

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.742
contribute to your
job satisfaction.

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:43.700
So when you're ready,
just head up to the board

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.218
and place your dots on the line.

00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:47.510
And, yes, you do have to vote
for three separate items.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.128
You can't put all your three
dots on one particular row.

00:05:52.128 --> 00:05:53.920
So go ahead when you're
ready just come up.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.490
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:07.430
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Has everybody
had a chance to vote?

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.170
Very good.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.130
All right, let's see where
our top vote getters were.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.220
So it looks like work-family
balance is up there,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.120
as is making a difference.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.410
Let's see.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.180
So looks like salary gets up
there, too as our top three.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.240
Excellent, so I think it's
making a difference by quite

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.570
a few lengths there, work
family balance, and then salary.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.750
So let's see how some of
your answers as a class

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.660
compared to some studies
that have been done.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.150
And this is just
one sample that's

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.060
actually been done by Boeing.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.010
It's some of their employee
satisfaction surveys.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.290
And what you see here
on the chart is--

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.010
the x-axis here and the
placement of these items

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.160
shows the correlation or
the strength of association

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.530
with a high performance
work environment.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.950
Really, the things that
are making employees

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.930
perform really well.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.210
And you'll see things
like encouraged

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.150
to come up with new and
better ways to do things,

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.930
involving them in decisions,
improving my skills

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.840
or learning as we
called it here in class,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.520
conditions allow me
to be productive.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.810
We also talked about that.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.520
Someone made that suggestion.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.090
These are all things that
have a much higher correlation

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.870
with having high performance
work environment than things

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.200
on this side.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.000
And notice pay is sort of
farthest from people's job

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.343
satisfaction.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.760
So it just really
goes to show you

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.093
it's not just what you pay
people and then job security.

00:07:52.093 --> 00:07:55.220
But it's a lot of these
other important satisfaction

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:01.383
items that contributes to people
really doing a productive job.

00:08:01.383 --> 00:08:03.050
Now there are several
different theories

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.820
about how workers
are productive.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.280
They relate to the brainstorming
that we've been doing.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.127
The first is usually
called Theory X

00:08:09.127 --> 00:08:11.210
and it was one of the
original management theories

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.060
and it's based on the premise
that workers don't like to work

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.780
so they must be made to work.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.680
So you have to enforce harsh
rules and lots of motivation

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.710
to get them to overcome
this general human desire

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.900
to not work.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.580
Yes?

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.420
AUDIENCE: I have a thought.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.970
As you got salary
and paid, I think

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.299
why this one might
be a bit different

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.740
is because on the
average, I guess

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.950
that the bulk of the workers
are already paid good enough

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.370
to take care of themselves and
their families and all of that.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.420
So if you're paying someone
a salary that is not

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:52.310
able to take care of himself,
or not able to pay his bills,

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.280
I don't think it
won't be an issue.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.350
I think that this might
not be a very good example,

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.730
because if we look at the
average pay and the lowest pay

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.923
they get, it might be
something very tangible.

00:09:04.923 --> 00:09:05.840
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Sure.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.400
And I think I would
agree with you.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.950
That's a function of
some base level of pay.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.640
And perhaps one of the reasons
why salary sometimes shows up

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.950
in this environment is
more important than on some

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.420
of these other surveys
that have been done

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.760
is because we have a number of
students in the room, right.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.260
Raise your hand if
you're a student.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.720
If you're not being
paid much of anything.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.940
And hence, if salary is
really important to you.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.730
But as you suggest, when
you go out in the workforce

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.580
and you are earning a
salary and putting food

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.100
on the table is not
as concerning for you

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.560
as it might be when you're not
getting salary as a student,

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.175
some of these other items
really become important.

00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:40.550
So after a while
if you're trying

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.920
to create a high performing
work organization,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.380
it's not so much
increasing people's pay

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.360
as it is focusing on
making sure there are

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.950
all of these other conditions.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.100
And sometimes people think it's
easier to just pay people more

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.060
and that doing this is harder
but it pays off much higher.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.710
All right, so back to
our worker theories,

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.090
which comes into play a bit
with your comment as well.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.910
So we started at early
management theory

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.130
with Theory X. So
then to counter

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.530
that after a little while
of experimenting with it

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.570
they really came upon
Theory Y, which is

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.790
reflected in Elton Mayo's work.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.040
Where they said, no,
actually workers--

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.780
if you just make them
happy then they're

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.080
going to be really productive.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.050
So this theory out
of that was born

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.150
the whole focus
on human resources

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.190
and human relations
in the workplace

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.050
and trying to create
a happy workplace.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.380
So that was about 1920,
and then around the turn

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.110
of this century,
we have expressed

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.020
by Dick Kleine at John
Deere, his thought

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.630
is that a productive
worker is a happy worker.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.380
So we've got these three
different competing theories.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.450
Of those three, which
do you think most aligns

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.040
with a Lean way of thinking?

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.360
How many people think it's
the first theory, Theory X?

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.000
How many people think
it's the middle one?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.550
How many people think
it's the last one?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.780
Very good.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.250
That's the way we think, too.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.920
We think that Dick
Kleine's thought

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.480
about a productive
worker being happy

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.070
worker really is the
way that things are.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.460
And to try to illustrate some
of the links between employee

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.990
productivity and
company performance,

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.998
we want to take a case study
here on Southwest Airlines.

00:11:14.998 --> 00:11:17.290
And just to give you some
brief background on Southwest

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.780
as a company and
put them in context,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.072
they are one of the best--

00:11:21.072 --> 00:11:22.780
well they really are
the best performance

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.820
of the major US
domestic airlines.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.590
And you can see their
profitability metric here

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.250
on the chart.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.160
Southwest is in blue, which
is far above the red, which

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.290
is an aggregate of all the
major domestic airlines

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.490
and their profitability over
the past couple of decades.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.340
And in addition, Southwest
has made an operating profit

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.600
every year for over 30 years.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.140
Now this is a big
achievement for an airline.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.870
No one else has this record and
many, many times, many years,

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.510
many airlines are at a net loss.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.250
A few more items
about Southwest,

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.340
they are one of the
safest airlines around.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.080
They did have a very
homogeneous fleet

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.968
until they merged
with AirTran, and that

00:12:00.968 --> 00:12:03.010
simplifies some of their
training and maintenance

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.650
and logistics items.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.700
They have never laid
off any employees

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.520
even after the events of 9/11.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.310
They are the most highly
unionized US airline,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.810
even though there's
some perceptions

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.790
out there that there's
no unions on Southwest.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.440
Because, after all,
those Southwest employees

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.607
are so happy and the company
is doing so good surely

00:12:19.607 --> 00:12:20.710
they don't have unions.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.000
That's not true at all.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.560
They're highly unionized they
have a point-to-point, which

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.333
is different than a
hub-and-spoke route structure.

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.000
And many of the other
airlines in the US

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.010
operate on a hub-and-spoke
route structure.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.552
You can think of it
a little bit more

00:12:34.552 --> 00:12:37.920
like a batch and cue
and continuous flow.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.990
A little bit different.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.740
They consistently offer
some of the lowest

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.180
fares that are around.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.940
They're liked by investors
and employees and customers,

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.010
I should say.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.000
And so you might ask
what makes Southwest

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.220
so successful in its business.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.250
And Professor Jody Hoffer
Gittell in her book

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.070
The Southwest Airlines Way
which resulted out of her PhD

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.170
work here at MIT,
she argues it's

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.990
because of Southwest's
organizational competency.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.600
And it's characterized by
shared goals, shared knowledge,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.910
and mutual respect.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:15.070
And she calls these three
things relational coordination.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.760
And she says that shared goals
helps the employees to align

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.590
and prioritize
the organization's

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:25.610
success over doing their job or
succeeding at just their job.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.670
The second item of
relational coordination

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.080
is this element of
shared knowledge.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.140
So if everybody has the
same kind of knowledge,

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.110
then you have visibility
of the overall work process

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.610
and not just your
little part on it.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.027
So you can help see the linkages
between what you're doing

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.660
and what someone
else is doing and be

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.170
able to create overall a more
efficient and effective system.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.950
And lastly, this third element
of relational coordination

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.440
is mutual respect.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.990
And that helps to reduce some
of the barriers between employee

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.570
groups and helps them
cooperate more effectively

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.628
to get the job done.

00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:59.920
And all these three elements
of relational coordination

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.510
really couldn't
happen if it weren't

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.570
for the underlying practice
of effective communication.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.410
This effective communication
is particularly

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.080
one where people are
communicating about the problem

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.380
itself and not really
worried about assigning blame

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.790
when something bad goes wrong.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.550
So if you think in your
own work environment,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.530
you may be able to
think about some people

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.300
that you interact
with perhaps who

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.340
are very good at thinking
just about the problem

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.257
and trying to separate
the people out from it.

00:14:26.257 --> 00:14:28.120
And then you may
also know some people

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.060
who tend to focus more on
blaming somebody when something

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.043
goes wrong and not really
focusing on what went wrong

00:14:34.043 --> 00:14:34.960
and how we can fix it.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.300
But really who might
be responsible for it.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.780
That's not as effective
communication as we could be.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.150
Other elements of what makes
communication effective?

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.170
Frequent, timely, open, honest.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.270
Very, very simple description.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.710
Not as easy to achieve, but very
simple to try to understand.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.940
Now when an organization
has very high

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.520
relational coordination,
professor Hoffer Gittell

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.850
found that high levels of
relational coordination

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.388
do correlate with
performance for the airlines

00:15:07.388 --> 00:15:08.180
that she's studied.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.330
And this graph shows you
some composite measure

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.410
of airline performance.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.700
On the x, she took many
different things into account,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.080
including on time
departures, fewer

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.010
lost bags, things like that.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.100
And then she has
relational coordination as

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.950
measured by another amalgam of
a bunch of different measures

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.870
that she created
in her research.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.520
And each of these
dots is a number

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.828
of different airlines
in different locations

00:15:30.828 --> 00:15:31.620
around the country.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.260
There are two here
shown from Southwest

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.810
and the others are for three
other different airlines.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.190
But you see the general trend.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.410
As we increase
relational coordination

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.590
we tend to see the aggregate
performance increase.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.710
So we've seen how relational
coordination works

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.810
and increases
performance in airlines,

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.700
but you can apply
this concept well

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.530
beyond the domain of airlines.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.380
And it really applies, she
says, in any setting where

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.670
there is task interdependence.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.090
So there may be hand-offs
that take place requiring

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.885
feedback and iterations.

00:16:00.885 --> 00:16:02.510
Or where there is
uncertainty and there

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.140
has to be continual adjustment
of plans and updating.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.180
Or where there are
time constraints,

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.560
and so you can't just wait
while you try to fix a problem.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.360
Now I want you to
think about what

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.390
you think of when your
careers are going to unfold

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.018
and the kinds of industries
you all anticipate being in,

00:16:20.018 --> 00:16:21.560
and tell me if you
think you are ever

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.110
going to spend your time in
an organization that does not

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.410
have one or more of
these elements in it.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.078
I suspect not.

00:16:28.078 --> 00:16:29.870
I suspect you're all
going to find yourself

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.330
in organizations where
these are critical elements.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.640
And so this notion of
relational coordination

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.740
is one that would
translate equally well

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.560
into any environment
where these items exist.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.920
So one example is
health care, obviously.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.520
Another one that we talk
about is product development.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.730
Product development is done by
different kinds of engineers,

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:50.300
typically.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.063
Lots of hand-offs.

00:16:51.063 --> 00:16:51.980
Lots of uncertainties.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.510
Lots of time constraints.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.510
And I'm sure that you can
think of many other situations.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.530
Any come to mind?

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.330
Yes, Fabrice.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.008
AUDIENCE: Government programs.

00:17:03.008 --> 00:17:04.800
Where the government
invests in an industry

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.420
to develop something and all
of the sudden you have said,

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.605
and then everybody has
something different.

00:17:09.605 --> 00:17:10.730
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Excellent.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:11.230
Yeah.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.900
Great example.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.983
There's lots of different
products being developed

00:17:13.983 --> 00:17:15.670
under those circumstances.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.430
All right well let's look at one
particular example translating

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.819
relational coordination into
another particular environment.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.119
Professor Hoffer Gittell
then went and said,

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.030
well let me see if this
really does translate

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.193
into other environments.

00:17:29.193 --> 00:17:31.360
And so she went and studied
health care environments

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.270
to see if these same elements
of relational coordination

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.400
correlated with
elements of performance.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.220
And just as you saw
with the airline chart,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.720
the same kind of pattern starts
to appear in the health care

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.100
industry here.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.250
So it's not only do we
suspect that this notion

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.840
of relational
coordination translates.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.370
We actually have
yet another study

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.230
in another domain,
which does show

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.740
that we see increased levels
of performance with increased

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.790
instances of relational
coordination.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.430
So in order to achieve
relational coordination,

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.060
professor Hoffer Gittell looked
at various practices that were

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.830
in place at Southwest Airlines.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.010
And she identified and
codified 10 different ones

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.670
that underlied being able to
create an environment where

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.830
there was good relational
coordination, which

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.845
then led to having very
good performance outcomes.

00:18:17.845 --> 00:18:18.970
And you can read them here.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.320
There in your notes.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.710
Lead with credibility
and caring.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.110
Hire and training for relational
competence, and not just

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:27.670
for other factors.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.415
Bridging the work-family divide.

00:18:29.415 --> 00:18:30.790
Recognizing that
that's something

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.560
important for employees.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.970
Measuring performance broadly.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.790
Making unions your partners.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.520
Building relationships
with your suppliers.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.850
Keeping jobs flexible
at the boundaries.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.910
In addition, creating
boundaries spanners

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.500
who are crossing different
parts of the organization.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.540
Using conflicts to
build relationships

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.640
and to learn and grow.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.610
And investing in
front line leadership.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.310
That's not the leadership at
the C-suite of the organization,

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.750
but those who are right on the
front lines of, for Southwest,

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.090
maintaining your planes,
manning the gates

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.120
and interacting with
customers and so on.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.450
And then the outcomes that
professor Hoffer Gittell

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:14.930
found relational coordination
leads to is higher reliability.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.410
This was judged for airlines
by better on time performance

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:18.880
and fewer lost bags.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.630
As well as greater customer
satisfaction and shorter

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.690
turnaround time, which is
really important in an industry

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.780
like air transportation, where
you have very expensive capital

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.547
assets.

00:19:29.547 --> 00:19:31.630
And the more time they're
used, the greater return

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:32.980
you're getting on
them, and the more time

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.522
they sit idle at the gate while
they're waiting to be cleaned

00:19:35.522 --> 00:19:37.900
and you're offloading
and onloading passengers,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.770
it's not generating any
revenue for the organization.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.980
To turn to an example
from health care,

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.985
this reflects back on that
chart that I showed you

00:19:48.985 --> 00:19:51.430
two slides ago with
the coordination

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.690
between relational
coordination and performance.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.280
It hypothesizes that
if we were able to make

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.000
a 100% improvement in
various work practices

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.550
that underlie relational
coordination in hospitals-- so

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:08.290
if we were to double our measure
of relational coordination

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.810
our improvement in
these work practices--

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.870
we would have an
almost 50% increase

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.790
in relational coordination,
which would then

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.060
lead to significant increases
in patient satisfaction

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.430
and decreases in
the length of stay.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.440
Which are all very good
things because these

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.380
are what hospitals and health
care settings tend to measure,

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.410
right health care folks?

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.880
You're probably
measured on those.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.600
It's also interesting
to me to note that,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.480
well, just because we increase
our relational coordination

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.206
doesn't necessarily
mean we're going

00:20:36.206 --> 00:20:39.400
to increase people's freedom
from pain or their mobility.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.170
This is a joint unit
that was studied

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.378
in this particular focus area.

00:20:43.378 --> 00:20:44.920
Because these are
really more related

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.795
to the types of treatment
that you're giving,

00:20:46.795 --> 00:20:50.560
but these are elements that
are really being measured

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.510
in the hospital setting.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.350
So just to conclude our
discussion about Southwest

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.852
and the power of workforce
productivity, some

00:20:58.852 --> 00:21:00.310
of the benefits
that you see, we've

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.380
got bigger revenues
that are generated

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.420
from not only
satisfied customers

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.110
but better utilized
capital assets here.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.880
And we have reduced costs
from lower employee turnover.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.760
If they're productive and
satisfied and not having people

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.750
sit idle.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.400
Wasted human resources.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.870
It's a very bad thing.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.540
And lastly, increased
productivity leads

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.040
to happy, satisfied
employees, which

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.832
leads to more increased
productivity, which

00:21:22.832 --> 00:21:24.590
leads to more happy,
satisfied employees.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.930
A very virtuous circle.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.340
So now we'd like to turn from
our case example of Southwest

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.430
and linking employee
satisfaction, essentially,

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:40.560
and productivity to now
talking about working in teams

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.545
and thinking about how teams
can better work together.

00:21:44.545 --> 00:21:46.920
And to start that off we want
to do some active learning.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.180
We're going to have
a class debate.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.730
So the objective
here is you're going

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.490
to have a time
constraint, and you're

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.120
going to have to articulate
a clear and concise message

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.050
on one side of the
debate or the other.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.970
That's your overall objective.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.470
But while you're
doing that, we want

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.980
you to observe a couple of
things about the team dynamics.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.560
We want you to think about
how differing viewpoints

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.960
in your team affect their work.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.970
We want you think about
the processes used

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.190
for your group decision making.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.730
And lastly, we want you to think
about how completing the task

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.160
depends upon the
personal feelings

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.632
of your group and the process.

00:22:22.632 --> 00:22:24.090
So there's two
things you're doing.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.578
One is you're making
this argument.

00:22:27.578 --> 00:22:30.120
And two, you're stepping back
and observing the whole process

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.730
while it happens and taking
notes on both of those.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.730
All right so here is our debate.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.190
So the early bird
may get the worm,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.790
but it's a second mouse
that gets the cheese.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.720
So the birds proposition
here in this debate,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.150
putting it in a Lean context,
early adopters of lean thinking

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.828
gain the greatest
competitive advantage.

00:22:50.828 --> 00:22:52.620
But then there's another
side of the debate

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.870
that goes something like this.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.938
That the second followers,
people who are not the first,

00:22:56.938 --> 00:22:58.480
the second followers
of lean thinking

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.630
gain the greatest
competitive advantage.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.660
So either of those
points could be true.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.490
And we're going to
assign the tables

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.930
to be various points of view.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.410
And you're going to have to
argue for one of these two

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.678
different propositions.

00:23:12.678 --> 00:23:14.220
So I'm going to go
and assign tables.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.620
I'm actually going
to make you birds.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.700
Mice.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.480
Birds.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.380
Mice.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.550
And birds in the back.

00:23:23.463 --> 00:23:24.880
And what do you
have to do, is I'm

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.860
going to give you
eight minutes to work

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.990
on formulating a 60 second
or less argument in support

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.960
of the proposition
you've been assigned.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.050
And you also then have
to come up with a 30

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.540
second or less rebuttal.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.360
Because the format is going to
go you get to make your point.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.850
The birds make their point,
then the mice make their point,

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.770
then the birds get to rebut,
and then the mice get to rebut.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.090
So you have to write two things.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.940
Your proposition and
then your rebuttal.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.820
And they can take no
more than 60 seconds.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.490
And you have eight minutes
in which to formulate both.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.400
And then we're going to have
each team do one or the other.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.500
You won't know which
until we get time and then

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.980
we'll kind of roll dice and
see who gets assigned what.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.832
All right, any questions
about the task asked of you?

00:24:14.832 --> 00:24:15.540
All right, great.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.110
Go to it.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.818
I'll give you eight
minutes on the clock.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.460
All right, time's up.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.730
So now everybody's got their
proposal or proposition

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.490
and their rebuttal formulated.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.370
So we're going to have each.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:39.128
The birds and the mice are
going to give their proposals

00:24:39.128 --> 00:24:40.920
and then we're going
to hear the rebuttals.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.090
And since I don't have
the right number of dice

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.530
to roll for each of situations,
I'm just going to pick.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.350
So I'm going to ask this
table, you guys are birds?

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.030
OK.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.980
I'm going to ask you
to do your proposition.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.860
And you are birds
in the back, too?

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.670
I'll ask you to do
your proposition.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.500
So we'll hear same
thing from both teams.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.790
And I'll ask remainder birds
that you guys do the rebuttal.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.510
And then I'll ask this
team over here, mice?

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.030
I'll ask you to do
the proposition,

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.030
and I'll ask this mouse
team to do the rebuttal.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.220
All right.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.703
So let's have the
birds go first.

00:25:16.703 --> 00:25:18.370
So we'll hear the two
bird propositions.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:18.880
Go ahead.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.680
And I've got you on the clock.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.340
AUDIENCE: So, we
think it's a good idea

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.250
to start early because
it's a continuous process,

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.550
and takes time to implement
and to change your company's

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.120
culture.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.870
So we're talking about
five years earlier.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.720
So the sooner you get
started, the sooner

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.130
you can realize your gains.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.230
You can use creativity
to create the standard

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.674
before other people
really define it for you.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.200
If you start early and you find
you run into some challenges,

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.419
then you have time to go back
and change things and make

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:57.884
it more efficient or
choose a different path.

00:25:57.884 --> 00:26:01.480
You can establish a reputation
as being innovative,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.135
which will not only
encourage people

00:26:03.135 --> 00:26:08.076
to invest in your company but
may also excite your employees.

00:26:08.076 --> 00:26:11.654
Because they'll just be excited
about being on the leading

00:26:11.654 --> 00:26:13.932
edge of something.

00:26:13.932 --> 00:26:16.372
And then it takes time to
change the culture of a company,

00:26:16.372 --> 00:26:19.007
so that's also a good
advantage of starting early.

00:26:19.007 --> 00:26:19.840
ANNALISA WEIGEL: OK.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.940
And just a few
sentences to spare.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.630
Good job.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.640
Let's have the other
proposition for birds.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.150
And please speak up so
everybody can hear you.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.300
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm going
to start with the graph

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.060
that we have here.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.750
So this is time, and
this is productivity.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.610
And if you start with
this company right

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.280
here, which would be the
early bird adopting Lean

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.150
and they improve their
productivity and their employee

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.350
satisfaction and
their efficiency,

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.460
there is virtually no way
that this second company

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.370
that starts at a later time
can ever catch up to it.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.340
And while they start
their innovations,

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.670
we're moving on to
our next innovations

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.730
after we've already
established some brand loyalty

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.890
and got customer allegiance.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.000
We've had the market edge.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.770
At some point, the
market gets saturated

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:12.180
and we've already reached it,
like this graph shows you.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.670
The same thing that our
colleagues were saying

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.960
is that because it
takes five years

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.100
and it's not just an end street.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.450
If we have ongoing
continuous improvement,

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.550
that it's something
that continues moving

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.030
on indefinitely in the future.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.550
In our patients, we have better
recruitment and retention

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.320
of satisfied employees.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.570
Our end product is
better and we can respond

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:33.885
to customer's needs--

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:35.100
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Times up.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.710
AUDIENCE: --quickly.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:37.830
ANNALISA WEIGEL: OK.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.930
Thank you.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.530
All right let's go to our mice.

00:27:45.967 --> 00:27:47.710
AUDIENCE: So, the
first to make it

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.260
work in a sense of the risk
of failure and squander

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.690
time and resources.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.030
Once a plan has been implemented
that is advantageous,

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.790
you see that the stated
inefficiencies of that process

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.090
can be corrected,
redrafted, and implemented.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.050
Gain a competitive advantage.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.620
Also by starting up
later, the standard

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.940
had already been established.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.870
And that way the
implementation time is less.

00:28:10.375 --> 00:28:11.500
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Very good.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.190
Very efficient.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.800
Much less than 60 seconds.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.330
All right, now we've
heard arguments

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.690
on both sides of the case.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.780
So let's hear some rebuttals.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.830
So the mice just went.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.330
So let's hear the
bird's rebuttal

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.782
to the mouse's proposition.

00:28:25.782 --> 00:28:27.490
AUDIENCE: So, certainly
the mice proposed

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.470
that they would learn
from bird's mistakes.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:35.080
But so much of Lean is specific
to individual enterprises

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.510
as it relates to local
politics, the culture

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.270
that enterprise has
in its space that we

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.920
think that it's very specific.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.480
And what we learn in, say,
BI might not necessarily

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.945
be directly transferable
to working with medicine.

00:28:48.945 --> 00:28:50.710
It defends the bird.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:56.880
And our second point is that
by not being an early adopter,

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.620
you're kind of adding
some more time.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.270
You're kind of just sitting
around and waiting and existing

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.070
in a culture of efficiency that
is doing harm to health care

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.690
patients, potentially.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.560
And that's just
unacceptable when

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:14.585
you know that there is better
ways of operating on the daily.

00:29:14.585 --> 00:29:15.710
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Very good.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.490
No pun intended.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.410
All right, let's
hear the rebuttal

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.230
to the mouse's proposition.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:28.580
AUDIENCE: So for the mice, it's
better to be the second adapter

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.690
because you have an easier
time getting buy in.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.990
And that's one of the biggest
hurdles, because people

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.750
see how it's worked in other
industries, other companies,

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.450
so they say, Oh, we can do this.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.910
You can also pick and
choose what you want

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.740
and what you think
will work best

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.720
for your specific situation.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.480
You also have more
experts to learn

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.440
from because you can tap into
the resources and the knowledge

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.310
of the other companies
and see what failed.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.630
And it's always the first
time that takes the most.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.190
And then you're starting
from a higher point

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:08.410
so you can more easily
reach and even surpass

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.830
the point of the birds.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.930
AUDIENCE: And just
to add to that,

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:17.280
they shared with us a
graph showing production.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.215
Today we learned that the
US auto industry compared

00:30:20.215 --> 00:30:21.970
to the Japan auto industry.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:23.802
As 1947, Japan

00:30:23.802 --> 00:30:28.690
[LOUD LAUGHTER]

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.040
AUDIENCE: In the space
of about 40 years,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.890
they have way overtaken
the US industry.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.212
So this is a clear example
that there's always

00:30:36.212 --> 00:30:36.920
room to overtake.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.879
ANNALISA WEIGEL: All
right, and that's actually

00:30:38.879 --> 00:30:39.790
your 60 seconds.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:40.980
OK.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:41.620
Very good.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.120
Excellent.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:51.390
So I'm glad that this has
inspired some fires in you.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.020
So now that you've heard
both sides of the argument,

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.090
I actually would like you
to step aside from your team

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.860
propositions regardless
of what you're

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.498
asked to argue for
your teams and I

00:31:00.498 --> 00:31:02.790
want you to think about the
arguments and the rebuttals

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.110
that you did here.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.080
And think about which
side of the argument

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.302
seemed more convincing
to you personally.

00:31:09.302 --> 00:31:11.010
So if you could take
out your green cards

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.140
and your yellow
cards, I'd like you

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:17.210
to think if you really believe
the bird argument or the mouse

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.710
argument.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.530
So if you feel you
believe the bird argument,

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.430
raise up a green card.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.388
And if you feel you
believe the mouse argument,

00:31:22.388 --> 00:31:23.560
raise up the yellow card.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.435
Go ahead raise it up.

00:31:24.435 --> 00:31:26.490
We just want to get
a sense of the room.

00:31:32.334 --> 00:31:35.256
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:46.517 --> 00:31:48.850
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Do we have
everybody making a decision?

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.450
Somebody lost the green cards.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.200
All right, so it looks
like-- look around.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.040
We've got more green
cards than yellow cards.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.720
But still, we got maybe
4 to 1 green to yellow.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.520
So it seems like
overall you all feel

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.360
that the bird argument,
the early adopters of Lean,

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.550
have the greatest
competitive advantage.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.690
And there's no right
and wrong to this,

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.410
and it's largely dependent
on your context and situation

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.720
and there may be circumstances
where it's better

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.070
for an organization to wait.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.710
The organization is, say, in
the middle of big transition

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:24.520
to a new product.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.870
That just might not be
the right time to start.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.140
It may not be advantageous
for them to think

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.303
about being an early adopter.

00:32:31.303 --> 00:32:33.220
But there are certainly
are lots of advantages

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.710
for an organization who's ready
to adopt Lean to adopt it.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:39.010
So you might say that if
you're ready, if you're able,

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:41.410
if it's a good time and
if you don't adopt Lean,

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.260
that's not so good.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:42.760
Right?

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.920
But necessarily being
an early adopter

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.590
doesn't have to help
you but it certainly

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.950
can be a very good thing
for an organization.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.200
So now let's turn from
thinking about the outcome

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.408
of this debate and whether
you thought about yourself

00:32:55.408 --> 00:32:56.578
as a bird or a mouse.

00:32:56.578 --> 00:32:58.120
Let's think about
the team experience

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.710
itself, which was
the other element

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.252
I asked you to
reflect upon as you're

00:33:01.252 --> 00:33:03.470
going through this exercise.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.960
So think about
this common dilemma

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.460
that we find ourselves
in when we're

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.980
working in teams of your
personal views versus the team

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.330

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.000
Think about your
exercise here, was there

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.610
adapting that you did or
was there compromising you

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.280
saw taking place in the team?

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.860
How were the personal feelings,
attitudes, and perceptions

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.030
of others handled?

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.830
How did you feel
was handled for you?

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.560
Did you feel anybody
else maybe being

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.120
uncomfortable in that situation?

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.270
What about the
wordings of statements?

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.200
Did you, as a team, argue
about how you worded things?

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.790
Did that make a difference?

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.590
What was the process
used for your group

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.697
to decide and
discuss and present?

00:33:41.697 --> 00:33:42.530
Was there a process?

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:43.488
Did you think about it?

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:45.250
How did it unfold?

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.870
And how satisfied were
you with the team outcome?

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.010
And I'd like to take maybe
three minutes for each group

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.660
to discuss it
within their group.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.243
And then we'll take
one or two minutes

00:33:54.243 --> 00:33:57.663
to kind of give some open
commentary on these issues

00:33:57.663 --> 00:33:59.080
as you discuss
them in your group.

00:34:01.987 --> 00:34:03.820
If I can have everybody's
attention, please.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.850
We'll get back to sharing our
discussions with the class

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.135
so we can all benefit from
the table discussions.

00:34:09.135 --> 00:34:10.510
Table discussions
are a great way

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.110
to get more people
talking at once.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.929
So if we just had
a class discussion,

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.449
we would get one fifth
the kind of conversation

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.210
that we get going on
with all the tables.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.627
So now I'd like to hear though,
about some of the richness

00:34:20.627 --> 00:34:22.330
of the conversations you had.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.630
So first on items of the dilemma
of the personal versus team

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:26.170
views.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.300
Which tables felt
that they experienced

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.350
some of those things?

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:31.411
Yes?

00:34:31.411 --> 00:34:32.994
AUDIENCE: Well at
the start, I sort of

00:34:32.994 --> 00:34:35.770
had a different opinion
from the rest of the team.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:41.280
Because we were assigned to a
particular side of the coin.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.512
We just had to work together.

00:34:43.512 --> 00:34:47.302
We didn't-- ten seconds I was
convinced I was in the group.

00:34:47.302 --> 00:34:48.219
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Tory?

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.469
AUDIENCE: I think we came
to a very similar conclusion

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:54.280
of saying had it been maybe
a topic like politics, where

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.770
everybody has a view but
you're just meeting people

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.716
and you want to be
respectful of other people.

00:34:59.716 --> 00:35:01.770
So you might have had
a little more conflict.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.940
Whereas here, since we
were given our conclusion,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.310
everyone was just
trying to quickly find

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.620
ways to support that
conclusion together.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.370
ANNALISA WEIGEL: And
this table over here?

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.620
Where you guys had an even
split of yellows and greens

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.860
in your personal votes?

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.970
AUDIENCE: No.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.504
AUDIENCE: We were all yellow.

00:35:18.504 --> 00:35:20.662
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:20.662 --> 00:35:23.120
AUDIENCE: We worked so well
together that we were actually,

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.120
truly, convinced.

00:35:28.055 --> 00:35:29.180
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Excellent.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:34.170
Let's talk about the
process that you used.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.100
We just had a big lecture on
process before this, right?

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.930
And seeing life as a process.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.630
What process did you use?

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.550
AUDIENCE: We had a good process.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.370
I mean, everyone had to give
their opinion initially.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:50.370
We had input from everyone
before coming to a consensus.

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:52.280
So it wasn't like
someone just came up

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.330
with the final solution.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.520
I mean, we have to listen to
everybody's point of view.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.760
And maybe because our
group is small, maybe

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.250
it was more effective,
we were able to come

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.280
to a very quick conclusion
based on different input

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:04.928
from everyone.

00:36:04.928 --> 00:36:06.845
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Other
reflections on process?

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.560
AUDIENCE: I guess it was
not explicitly delineated,

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.950
but we split up our time into
three different sections.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:21.240
One was just anyone who just
chimed in with their own answer

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.250
supporting the case.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:25.290
Two was looking and
anticipating rebuttals,

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.227
and three was just
writing it all down.

00:36:27.227 --> 00:36:28.352
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Excellent.

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:32.080
And did you come up with
a written statement?

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we did.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:35.742
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Excellent.

00:36:35.742 --> 00:36:39.467
[CLASS TWITTERING]

00:36:39.467 --> 00:36:41.300
ANNALISA WEIGEL: How
about your satisfaction

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.700
with the team outcomes.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:48.816
Anybody unsatisfied or
satisfied with the team outcome?

00:36:48.816 --> 00:36:50.528
I'm going to hazard
a guess on balance.

00:36:50.528 --> 00:36:52.070
People seemed
satisfied because there

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.810
wasn't a lot of
storming out of the room

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.070
and yelling and shouting.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:59.210
But, if you had any complaints
however small about your team

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.200
outcomes.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.580
If you wanted to voice that.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.200
AUDIENCE: Don't get me wrong.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.992
We were mice, but by
the time we were done,

00:37:03.992 --> 00:37:07.243
we were all pretty much
agreed on the bird view.

00:37:07.243 --> 00:37:09.410
AUDIENCE: I think we started
out with the bird view.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:11.230
We forced ourselves to
go to our mice view,

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.855
and then we came
back to bird view.

00:37:12.855 --> 00:37:14.480
AUDIENCE: Because as
soon as we started

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.733
talking about a rebuttal
we realized, yeah.

00:37:18.912 --> 00:37:20.870
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Which
is why good debate teams

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.300
work on their rebuttals a lot.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.060
OK so let's use this
exercise then to jump off

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.240
into our last segment of
slides here in our people

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:34.010
module focusing on team
elements and team skills.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.530
And this chart is our
transition to just remind us how

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.300
people are the heart of Lean.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.540
Because we have the tasks, which
are what the people are doing.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.190
And you all just had a
task in your exercise.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.315
The processes are how people
are doing their tasks.

00:37:47.315 --> 00:37:49.482
And we talked about what
your process may or may not

00:37:49.482 --> 00:37:49.982
have been.

00:37:49.982 --> 00:37:51.232
But it's all about the people.

00:37:51.232 --> 00:37:52.640
The people are doing the tasks.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.170
The people are
doing the process.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:57.470
And they set within various
organization structures

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.020
that are what enable them to
do their processes and tasks.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.270
And that's all embedded in
a particular organization's

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:08.690
culture, which has attributes
about it that further influence

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:13.410
and enable a person's ability
to do their tasks and processes.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.980
Many of the work that
people do are in teams

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.480
and they're collaborating.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.300
And there's really three
elements of collaboration.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.670
There's not just the
thing you're doing,

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.830
but there's how you're
doing it and then there's

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:28.718
this thing we call affect, which
is the feelings about the work.

00:38:28.718 --> 00:38:30.260
And this is what
the people bring to.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.720
And it's based on your
prior experiences.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.220
It's based on the
culture that you

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:38.300
sit in, organizational,
national, ethnic, et cetera,

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.033
on your own biases that you
bring to what you're doing.

00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:42.950
And it's also based on
your current experience

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.180
and where you are.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.930
And it's both the process
as well as the feelings

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.760
or the affect that
are supporting

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.400
the task actually getting done.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.080
When you're
collaborating in teams,

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.780
and you're bringing all these
elements together of process,

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.190
task, and affect.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.320
There's a lot of benefits
to collaboration.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.020
You get-- I think most of you
would recognize these-- you get

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.230
more ideas, new ideas,
multiple areas of expertise

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.030
to bring to bear on the problem.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.320
Work is shared.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.600
It should result in some
stronger problem solving

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.540
abilities and should improve
things like design work

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.150
and other kind of
creative tasks.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.900
But there's also a lot of
challenges that are involved

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.130
in collaborating with teams.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:23.672
And I'm sure you've
all run into some

00:39:23.672 --> 00:39:26.173
of those over the course of
your school and work time.

00:39:26.173 --> 00:39:27.590
So what are some
of the challenges

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:31.770
you run into when you're
trying to collaborate?

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.660
AUDIENCE: The workload
isn't shared evenly.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.702
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Not shared
evenly in a workload.

00:39:35.702 --> 00:39:36.610
What else?

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.400
AUDIENCE: I think diversity
can bring new ideas.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.040
But if our group size
was larger, I mean,

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.010
it's hard to accommodate
everyone's ideas.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.810
So somebody might
view that, oh my ideas

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.390
didn't get into the process.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.900
ANNALISA WEIGEL: So it can
be inefficient and unwieldy?

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.407
AUDIENCE: It takes
time to develop

00:39:55.407 --> 00:39:56.948
a consensus in a big team.

00:39:56.948 --> 00:39:58.490
ANNALISA WEIGEL:
More time consuming.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:01.610
Yes.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.830
AUDIENCE: We were talking
about how as we go in,

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:07.400
the people that we're working
with may not be skilled.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.010
May not know how to work
in this sort of model.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.260
That they're used to just
being told what to do.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.120
I see that on a micro
level with patients,

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.960
but also if you try
and ask your staff

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:22.160
to be more of a contributor,
and be more responsible

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.940
and also take on
more credit, they

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.607
may be like, what are
you talking about?

00:40:25.607 --> 00:40:27.620
I punch in, I punch out.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.280
I'm not a member in that way.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.700
So you have to retrain them.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.340
ANNALISA WEIGEL:
People just may not

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:34.130
have the skills to collaborate
in teams that they need.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:37.833
Either by training or
just by expectations.

00:40:37.833 --> 00:40:39.500
These are some of the
common challenges.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.650
I'll just list for you on
the rest of the slide ones

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.930
that we think are
prominent as well.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.517
Different goals and values.

00:40:46.517 --> 00:40:48.350
We just talked about
not being skilled in it

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:49.790
or practiced in it.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.680
Sometimes you run
into ego issues

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.350
and people are defensive
about their particular work

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.950
or their ideas.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:59.000
Their preconceived notions that
get in the way of teamwork.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.710
And then there's
differing work styles

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.377
that you try to bring
together in a team

00:41:02.377 --> 00:41:03.890
and that can be
counterproductive

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.240
to your efficiency.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.790
Or maybe somebody worked in
a bad team situation before

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:11.000
and that's just really hindering
their ability to work together

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.153
productively in future teams.

00:41:13.153 --> 00:41:14.570
So then, with all
these challenges

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:16.370
how do you meet them?

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:17.850
What are some of your thoughts?

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.840
AUDIENCE: I think
setting out ahead of time

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.220
what the expectations
of teamwork

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.900
are, and just kind
of lay out for people

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.788
how do you work with a team?

00:41:29.788 --> 00:41:31.270
Like respect others.

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.565
Listen first, speak later.

00:41:33.565 --> 00:41:34.375
Things like that.

00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:35.500
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Excellent.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.395
So clear rules and education.

00:41:38.395 --> 00:41:40.270
AUDIENCE: I think shared
knowledge and shared

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:44.140
goals can add a lot to the
relational coordination,

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.680
because this is how you
share your goals with others

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.580
and try to convince them to
come to the same conclusion.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.775
Otherwise, I mean, everyone
feels that I had my own ideas.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.190
AUDIENCE: Something important.

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.410
The diagrams you always
show about collaboration,

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.020
is always-- the puzzle pieces
always fit perfectly, which

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.320
I think is a misrepresentation.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.220
You have to accept that puzzle
pieces won't fit perfectly,

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.570
and there's someone who's going
to make a decision in the end.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:14.510
And if there is a culture
of mutual respect,

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.760
the person making the decision
will respect the people

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.780
that brought in
suggestions and vice versa

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:23.700
and that's just
the nature of life.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.950
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Establishing
that expectation is important.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:29.560
AUDIENCE: Things
like ongoing training

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.200
and starting off
with something small

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:37.390
that you can have an obvious,
tangible result with guaranteed

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:38.000
success.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.060
So that they can learn the
process and feel good about it.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.820
And then keep continuously
doing ongoing training over time

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:52.320
to improve their ability
to do it and remind them.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.670
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Excellent.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.010
Again really excellent ideas.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.527
Let me spell out
some others, some

00:42:58.527 --> 00:43:00.360
that are duplicate of
what we just discussed

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.070
and some which are new.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.110
So long the lines are
trying to make it explicit

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.540
and trying to train people
and set expectations,

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.250
you may want to try to do those
also in writing and not just

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:09.750
verbally.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.167
Sometimes seeing
things in writing

00:43:11.167 --> 00:43:14.880
can really help people
understand what's going on.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.010
Considering alternate
ideas or solutions

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.990
and not jumping to
consensus prematurely

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:22.590
can be one way to meet the
challenges of collaboration.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:25.020
Paying careful attention to
process is really important.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.770
If people understand the process
is very clear and very fair,

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.500
then when they express opinions
that are counter to what

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.390
the rest of the group
does want to do,

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:34.740
and the group goes in
a different direction,

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.490
at least that person
has felt that they've

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:41.250
had their due process and they
haven't been short changed.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.860
The next point voicing
disagreements constructively,

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.320
directly, and explicitly
is really important.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.270
Because you're not
all going to agree

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.930
except for certain groups in
this particular exercise, where

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:52.380
you've all coalesced
on a certain point.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.815
But in your work
environments, you

00:43:53.815 --> 00:43:55.565
are going to have times
when you disagree.

00:43:55.565 --> 00:43:57.280
And learning how to
do that productively.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.510
So that you're focusing
just on the disagreement

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.250
not on the person that you're
having that disagreement with

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.880
will help you get to a
solution more productively.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.630
Lastly, give positive feedback
directly and explicitly too.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.150
So how many times a day
do you say to a colleague,

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.712
that was a great job.

00:44:13.712 --> 00:44:16.170
And then think of how many
times you make critical comments

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.570
about a peer's or colleague's
work or suggestions

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:19.840
for improvement.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.590
Especially at MIT,
we have a reputation

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:25.170
for being a praise
free zone here.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:28.170
Lots of criticism.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.550
It's very important
that you also

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.843
reinforce the positives
in collaboration,

00:44:31.843 --> 00:44:34.260
because that's going to foster
the team being able to work

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.230
productively together.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.360
Now in organizations,
you're going

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.260
to find many entities
are organized

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.930
in teams of various sorts.

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.800
And this diagram
helps orient you

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.200
to some of the previous as
well as current structures

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.000
that we find in a lot of the
complex engineering system

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.520
kinds of industries.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.320
Usually, the organization
is broken down functionally.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.890
There may be a design
function, there

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:03.390
may be an operations
function, there

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.580
may be a maintenance function.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.980
Or it may be a structure
function, a thermal function,

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.750
and so on.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.028
And it used to be that
groups worked independently,

00:45:13.028 --> 00:45:14.820
and whenever you had
yo collaborate somehow

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.860
between, say, function
one and function two,

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.740
the interface took place
between the top people.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.330
But it was usually
the folks down here

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.070
who were doing all
the work and needed

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.397
the answers from these people.

00:45:24.397 --> 00:45:26.730
But they had to work all the
way up through their bosses

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.313
to communicate with
that person's boss

00:45:28.313 --> 00:45:30.170
to work all the way
down through the chain.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:33.180
So that's kind of the old style,
the way organizations worked.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.460
And then a couple
decades ago, we

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.340
introduced the concept of
integrated product and process

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.250
teams, which really took
essentially the folks doing

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.070
the work down here and
put them into a team

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.890
so the communication could
happen directly between people

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:49.350
who were doing the tasks
and not really up and down

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:50.820
a chain of communications.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.130
There, it really didn't
matter that this person knew

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.180
what the question
was that they're

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.520
asking had to be passed along.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.570
They're just relaying it.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.950
It's much better if you
can have direct interaction

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.372
between people.

00:46:00.372 --> 00:46:02.080
So this kind of an
organization structure

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:05.400
has helped increase the
effective communications

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.190
and the ability for
teams to work together

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.500
in these complex enterprises
that we see today.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:16.260
But being on an IPT
or an IPPT, you're

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.530
now asking people who are in
this part of the organization

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:23.700
to have teamwork and leadership
skills that they might not

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.850
have needed to have in our
old kind of organization

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.768
where the leadership was
largely done at the top.

00:46:29.768 --> 00:46:31.560
So this helps us
understand why introducing

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.623
the concepts of
teamwork and leadership

00:46:33.623 --> 00:46:35.040
and developing
skills around those

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.410
is really important to
do really from day one.

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:39.030
When you join an
organization and not

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:43.400
waiting until you get to be
at the top of that org chart.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.317
Now teams progress through a
number of different stages.

00:46:46.317 --> 00:46:48.150
And there is a lot of
literature about this,

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.490
but in essence when you
first start out with a team

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:52.865
there's a lot of challenges
we just discussed and working

00:46:52.865 --> 00:46:53.460
together.

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.470
And teams take a
little while to grow

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.180
from beginning teams
to what we'd really

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.950
call high performance ones.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.050
And the degree of management
necessary for those

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.630
decreases over time as we get
towards a more high performing

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:04.293
team.

00:47:04.293 --> 00:47:06.210
And their empowerment
and ability to do things

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:07.540
increases as well.

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.480
We find that when we
look at high performing

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.520
teams in a Lean
environment, they have

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.860
these attributes about them.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.970
And we've mentioned
most of them so far.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:18.660
They have mutual respect
for all people and all jobs.

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.100
They encourage contribution
by all the team members.

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.660
We heard Claudio talk about
that in our tour today.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.730
Different opinions
are not only valued

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.010
but they're sought
after and brought out.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.250
There is open and honest
communication and feedback.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:35.340
The goals of the
team are aligned.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:38.400
There is continuous improvement
of both the individuals

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.540
and the team.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.730
Always seeking to
do a better job.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:44.040
And there is a high degree
of synergy and cooperation

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.618
among the members.

00:47:45.618 --> 00:47:47.160
So if you're striving
to put together

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.743
a team that is high
performing, you're

00:47:48.743 --> 00:47:52.442
really trying to work on these
seven particular attributes

00:47:52.442 --> 00:47:54.150
and try and increase
those for your team.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:00.300
So lastly we'll just
conclude with our chart here.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.210
People are the heart of Lean.

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:04.620
With our shared
goals, our shared

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.560
knowledge, mutual respect,
communication, teamwork,

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.190
and leadership.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:13.208
All the hallmarks of a
high performing Lean team.

00:48:13.208 --> 00:48:15.000
And by way of summary
from what you've just

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.280
heard over the past
module on people,

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.730
I'd like you to take out one
of your white index cards

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.850
and take out a
pen and write down

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:26.160
for us what's the most
important thing you learned

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.730
from this module on people.

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:32.070
And on your way
out to the break,

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.930
you can drop that on the back
desk so we can take a look.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.802
PROFESSOR: OK, most
everyone's here.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:25.760
We're still going to take
a few minutes to wait

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.780
for the last few people show up.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.570
I don't have a ton
of announcements,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.264
but if you looked
at the syllabus,

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:36.680
you might notice is there are
a couple days where we have,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.140
I think we've got TBD as the
topic, like to be determined.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.530
What I'd like to do is just
take a quick poll from y'all.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.890
Is there anything that you
are interested in learning

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.720
about in the creation
of video games

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.322
that you either we haven't
talked about in class yet,

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:53.780
maybe we've talked
about it but not

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.800
fully, you've looked
at the syllabus

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.432
and it's not there
on the syllabus.

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:00.890
Or it's something
that you think is

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.760
going to be directly
useful for the games

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969
and you're working on right now.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:06.260
So just putting that out there.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.600
If there's any topics you
might want to talk about,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.260
learn about, let me know.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.520
Yes?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.472
AUDIENCE: You really,
like, in other classes

00:01:18.472 --> 00:01:21.916
you didn't say, really, in
the last class or the last two

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:24.376
classes, say really,
like, what people actually

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.360
do in the industry.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.710
PROFESSOR: OK, so yes.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.376
Cool, so what people
do in the industry.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.390
Cool.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.300
You are in luck.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.620
On December 1st and 3rd.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.140
On the first, we're having
a business in games panel.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.730
So two independent
developers in the area

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.040
are going to come by and
talk about how they started

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.790
their companies,
what do they do,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.770
what's their daily
life, things like that.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.670
And then another
one following that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.260
is the community manager for
Fire Hose Games, Sean Baptiste,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.984
is going to talk to us about
how do they get their games out

00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:05.400
in the world, and how they get
people to play their games.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.250
And how do they
engage their fan base.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.130
And how do they even just
create a fanbase in general.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.747
So that's not on the syllabus,
But we will be doing that.

00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:16.455
Any other topics?

00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:22.110
OK.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.540
I'm going to ask this again in
a couple weeks in case something

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.081
pops up, because
you probably haven't

00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:30.980
done a lot of technical things
with your game engines yet.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.660
So if there's anything
gaming specific

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.480
that you might
want to know about,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.600
either let us know through the
through the video game bosses

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.090
email address, or
let us know in class.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.590
Yeah?

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.496
AUDIENCE: Who will be
giving these lectures?

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:43.310
Like, is this open
to-- can you get--

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.476
PROFESSOR: I can get people.

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:47.410
So I can get people
who are local,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.870
we've got connections
to local industry.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.670
We've got connections
to the people

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.340
who make the tools, in some
cases, depending on the tool.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.420
That's why I'm asking now,
because it gives me time

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.510
to fill new gaps.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.289
Also, it might be something
that we can talk to.

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:03.830
So if there's anything
design-related

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.980
that you think is
useful for your games

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.585
that we haven't
talked about yet,

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:10.500
and you don't see it on
the schedule, let us know.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.430
If there's anything
technical related,

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.776
Drew can come up
and say something.

00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:16.400
The other thing we
can do is if there's

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.025
anything that you
want to do, or if you

00:03:18.025 --> 00:03:21.040
want to set up
office hours in class

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.710
to talk about a certain
topic for your games,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.420
specifically technical issues,
technical questions, that's

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.610
what Drew's here for.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.250
To come and talk with your
group as a whole, or just

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.625
individual members in your
group to talk about the issues

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:34.360
that you have.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.965
So we can do that during
class, during our schedule, one

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:39.460
and a half to two hour
work-in-class periods,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.200
or you can set up work
office hours with him.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.670
Just give people
couple more minutes.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.020
The attendance sheet
is moving around.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.190
So is everybody sitting
with their teams right now?

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.362
It looks like-- I'm going
to go across and just

00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:04.153
try to figure out which
of these teams are.

00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:08.040
So it's the snap team,
is everyone here?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.810
Two, OK.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.960
Which team, this is
forecast-based futures

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.760
over here, right?

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.140
How far do you go?

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.649
John, are you in this team,
or are you in the next team?

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.082
Cool.

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:20.540
Next team over,
which team are you?

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.040
Cholera?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.870
No.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.620
You're in cholera team?

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.790
Were you the island group?

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.880
Animal Crossing one.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.210
Cool.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.360
And then in the front
here we've got heat wave,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.590
and the back it's the
other cholera group.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.710
OK.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.570
I did not get a chance
to play your game.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.104
But I will eventually.

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:41.270
So there's going to be a
little bit of interactivity

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.520
in the talk.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.165
I've given this talk before.

00:04:45.165 --> 00:04:47.040
I rewrote the lecture,
and I haven't given it

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.470
since I rewrote lecture,
so we'll see how it goes.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.644
They're my backup to let me
know if I forgot anything.

00:04:53.644 --> 00:04:55.060
There will be some
reading on this

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.309
I'm going to put into Stellar.

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.567
So if you are
interested in the topic,

00:04:58.567 --> 00:05:00.150
if you have more
interest in the topic

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.480
and you want to
read the reading,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.000
I would highly
recommend it, especially

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.250
if you think you're going
to be in a leadership

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.120
position in the future, or any
kind of managerial position.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.940
Or you're interested
in just psychology,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.040
and how people talk to each
other and work together.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.830
So our three main topics,
this will actually

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.804
be pretty quick on this lecture.

00:05:16.804 --> 00:05:18.262
We're going talk
about, we're going

00:05:18.262 --> 00:05:20.454
to do a really quick
review of Agile.

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:22.120
We're going to talk
about team dynamics,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.990
and we're going to talk about
how do distributed Agile

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.080
teams perform?

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.000
So what are some of
the best practices

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.096
they have for performing?

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.720
And then you're going
to work in class.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.550
You'll have at least two
hours to work in class today,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.550
a little more than that.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.970
So agile processes.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.680
If you forget everything
in this class,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.810
you got into the real world
and somebody asked you,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.340
what is agile?

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.400
I hope you remember this part.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.794
Iterative development.

00:05:51.794 --> 00:05:53.210
Does anybody
consider what they're

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.100
doing iterative development
on their projects right now?

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.500
Are you working in
short periods of time?

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.670
So you broken up your
time in the small sprints.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.150
You can't really read it
that well on the slide.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.100
But are you within that short
period of time designing

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.140
what you're going to work
on, planning how it's

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.329
going to work, doing it, and
then testing it evaluating,

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:17.370
the test and changing it?

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.975
Are you doing all that within
one week, or two week cycle?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.920
Raise your hands yea--
so yes, raise your hands.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.900
No, raise your hands.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.150
It's OK if you say no.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.210
OK.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.740
If you're doing something that
looks like this, then great.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.060
And remember, agile, and in
particular, Scrum processes,

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.560
they're based on
these three pillars

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.620
that Sarah talked about when
we first brought this up.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.766
So the pillar of transparency.

00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:50.390
And what we mean by
transparency there,

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.582
we really just need a
common nomenclature.

00:06:53.582 --> 00:06:55.040
To be honest, I
don't care what you

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.880
call the things
that you use as part

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.790
of your process in your team.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.090
So long as everyone
within the team

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.810
knows what it is, so long
as whoever you're submitting

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.317
those processes to
also know who it is.

00:07:09.317 --> 00:07:11.650
So we're not acting as your
product owners in the class.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.151
But if you had a
product owner, they

00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:14.983
should also know what
you're calling things.

00:07:14.983 --> 00:07:16.700
What you're calling
your product backlog,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.500
what you're calling a
task, how you're estimating

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.070
and how you're doing
your processes.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.239
So everyone on the team
should know it, not just

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:25.530
in a more traditional manner,
a project manager knowing

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.800
what all the processes are.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.940
There's a number of
inspection that's going on.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.692
So through the process,
you are taking a look

00:07:32.692 --> 00:07:34.400
at all the artifacts
that you've created.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.530
So those backlog
items, tasks lists,

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.412
things like that that you're
creating during the process.

00:07:40.412 --> 00:07:42.370
You're inspecting it,
and in particular, you're

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.619
inspecting it during meetings.

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:46.210
So you're taking a look at
what you've done in a meeting,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.840
and talking about it.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.470
So you're not just doing a
process, you're doing a process

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.469
and you're talking about
it, and you're actively

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:54.279
thinking about the process.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.320
And then you're adapting.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:01.060
So based on evidence,
based on changes in needs,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.292
you're changing that process.

00:08:02.292 --> 00:08:04.500
Again, if you're doing any
one of these three things,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.080
you're doing processes well.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.740
You're doing some form
of agile-like process.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.890
That's another thing I hope
you take from the class.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.345
The agile manifesto.

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:20.525
It is a manifesto,
It is an idea.

00:08:20.525 --> 00:08:22.900
It is something that has some
political weight behind it.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.649
It's saying, this is
the way to do things,

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:26.400
this is the right
way to do things.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.170
But it's actually
more vague than that.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.049
It's really just saying,
here are some four key things

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:35.039
that we feel are more important
than other four key things.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.460
So the first item is
individuals and interactions

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.720
over processes and tools.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.120
So we've been talking a
lot processes and tools

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.780
for the first part
of the semester,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.870
now we're going to talk about
individuals and interactions

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.220
between individuals.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.390
So your team members.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.530
All right.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.370
What's a team?

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.870
Anybody give me a
working definition

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.994
for what you'd call a team.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.896
What'd you say?

00:09:03.896 --> 00:09:05.270
AUDIENCE: A bunch
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.519
PROFESSOR: A bunch of puppies?

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.770
Is it a group of people?

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.030
Is it just a group of people?

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.090
AUDIENCE: A group of people
working toward a common goal.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.070
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.070
Anything else?

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.570
So it's a collection
of individuals,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.830
so it's a group of people.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.710
They're working toward
a common purpose.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.220
They have shared responsibility
for common outcomes.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.280
If one of those puppies
trips, that stick

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.380
goes in another puppy's
mouth, and it hurts a lot.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.630
So keep that in mind.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:39.010
Shared responsibility, common
purpose, common outcome.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.120
So teams evolve over time.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.684
And the little bit
of research I'm

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:46.100
going to talk about
actually comes

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.560
from studying group behaviors.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.590
And this is all from
about 1960s and on up,

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.977
and around the 2000s, and
I'll post this reading up.

00:09:56.977 --> 00:09:59.060
There were some studies
showing that this actually

00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.726
works for teams.

00:09:59.726 --> 00:10:02.227
This does work for people
who have a common goal.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.310
But as you get a bunch of
people together, and get

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.530
a small group of
people together.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.404
And in our terms, we're
calling a small group

00:10:07.404 --> 00:10:10.400
of people eight to 10 people.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.350
Maybe a little bit bigger,
but about 10 people total.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.590
They're going to evolve
based on those interpersonal

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.307
relationships.

00:10:17.307 --> 00:10:18.890
So how they know
each other, what they

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.130
talk about, how they talk about.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.190
And their task behaviors.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.680
So we're going to be
talking about not the tasks

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.139
that you're doing in your teams,
but the behavior surrounding

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:30.430
the tasks that you're doing it.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:35.220
So if you're working on a task,
if you are doing some coding,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.952
how are you coding, or
who are you coding with?

00:10:37.952 --> 00:10:39.410
How are you talking
to other people

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.550
about what you're coding?

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.790
And you can apply to
any task that you're

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.020
doing in your teams.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.020
There's a lot of
different theories.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.500
Actually, Wikipedia is
a pretty good nutshell

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.580
of what are all the
different kinds of theories,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.444
and different kinds
of models we can

00:10:54.444 --> 00:10:56.360
use to describe how
groups talk to each other,

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.220
and how groups evolve.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.180
But they all come down
to these common things.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.271
There's a period of
getting to know each other,

00:11:02.271 --> 00:11:04.020
there's a period of
experiencing conflict,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.186
and there's both positive
and negative conflict when

00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:07.830
you're talking with each other.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.760
Your roles shift based on
changing knowledge and changing

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.970
experience.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.630
And hopefully at some point,
there's some kind of consensus,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.450
there's some kind
of moving forward.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.570
Decisions happen here.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.440
The point is, though, what
kind of decisions get made?

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.917
Are they effective decisions, or
are they ineffective, unproven,

00:11:26.917 --> 00:11:28.750
they get made because
you have to make them,

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.230
and you have to move on.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.270
And we're hoping that by
analyzing how your teams work,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.130
you can then move towards having
some effective decision making.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.480
So the model we're
going to talk about

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.780
is Tuckman's model from '65.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.500
It's got four phases.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.170
Forming, norming,
storming, performing.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.545
It's very cutesy.

00:11:48.545 --> 00:11:51.441
It gets used in
training sessions a lot.

00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:53.940
It can just be something that
you can just spit out and say,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.620
and someone says, oh, you're
smart, you know that model.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.540
But maybe you don't know
everything behind it.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.415
I might be more in
the you're smart,

00:12:00.415 --> 00:12:02.350
but maybe you don't know
everything behind it.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.850
I'm still learning
about how this works.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.880
But each phase has
items you can identify.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.740
More useful for us
is this is a model

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.030
you can use to figure out
where your team is right now.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.056
What phase are you in, so
you can then make decisions

00:12:17.056 --> 00:12:18.680
about where you need
to go, and how you

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.888
need to work together better.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.425
So the forming phase
of it is when you first

00:12:26.425 --> 00:12:27.300
are getting together.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.210
Everyone wants to be friendly,
everyone wants to get along

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.880
and to be accepted
with each other.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.640
There might be some serious
problems from the get-go,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.350
but they're usually avoided.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.210
And the team learns about
challenges and goals.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.870
But not much gets done.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.750
There's no real task completion
going on in this stage.

00:12:48.892 --> 00:12:50.600
When you think about
your previous teams,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.975
you've been in
this stage, right?

00:12:51.975 --> 00:12:54.072
When you first got together?

00:12:54.072 --> 00:12:55.530
Say project two,
project three, I'm

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.030
going to ask you some questions
about projects two and three

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.190
as we go forward.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.180
All right.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.120
That's a happy stage.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.960
Then storming happens.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.409
People are able to
express discontent.

00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:08.700
There actually might have
been discontent in phase one,

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.980
but it actually wasn't being
expressed in some form.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.430
In phase two, it's
being expressed.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.780
But how it's being
expressed can be different.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.970
So it could be someone actively
saying, no, you're wrong,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.350
that's stupid.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.302
It could be someone not talking.

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:24.760
But they're feeling
the same thing,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.510
and they're thinking
about the same thing.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.960
It's the same kind of
disconnect can happen.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.687
Opinions tend to get challenged.

00:13:30.687 --> 00:13:32.520
It can be contentious,
it can be unpleasant.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.240
In order to advance past this
stage, what your team really

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.965
need is tolerance and patience
just to get through it.

00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:42.340
But even more
important, you need

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.730
to establish lines of trust
and open communication

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.580
to get through this stage.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.750
This is what we've been
doing for the past first

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.927
of the semester, is
creating processes.

00:13:50.927 --> 00:13:53.010
We've been giving you some
tools that you can use,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.920
so then you can then create
those processes in your teams.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.870
So just a quick hand
raise from teams.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.270
Does anybody think that they're
in this stage right now?

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.450
Do you think, in your
team, you are currently,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.121
you're expressing discontent,
you are creating processes,

00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:12.370
you don't have processors
yet, but you're figuring out

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.650
what your process might be?

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.940
Maybe?

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.610
What do you say?

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.600
You're not sure?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:23.853
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:28.700
Next u p, norming.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.850
So this is where you
have those processes.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.504
Individuals start giving up
their own ideas and goals.

00:14:33.504 --> 00:14:35.670
You're actually moving
toward a team goal right now,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.628
and people are starting
to take responsibility,

00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:38.750
and rules are established.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.250
OK.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.804
Comparing storming
to norming, raise

00:14:41.804 --> 00:14:44.220
your hands if you think your
team is in norming right now.

00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:49.464
OK, yeah.

00:14:49.464 --> 00:14:51.380
Now raise your hands if
you think your team is

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.300
in storming right now.

00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:56.170
OK.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.690
All right, so.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.520
Is anybody performing?

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.580
Are you functioning
as a unit efficiently?

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.790
Are your team members
already autonomous?

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.430
Is descent expected and
addressed right now?

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.380
This is where you
want to get to.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.470
You probably aren't
this far yet.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.780
My bet's you're probably
somewhere in the storming area

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.376
things, maybe getting close
to the norming area things.

00:15:23.376 --> 00:15:26.000
Basically, you're still talking
to each other, you still trying

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.090
to figure out what are the
different ways of communicating

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.430
with each other.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.340
What are the different processes
and rules you might have.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.396
And you might not get
this far in class,

00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:40.520
by the end of the semester.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.270
You might not be fully efficient
by the end of the class,

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.934
and that's OK.

00:15:45.934 --> 00:15:47.350
But if you are,
it's kind of cool.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.399
So the model in practice
tends to be nonlinear.

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:56.690
It gets talked about, and it
was originally established

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.855
as a you go from here, to
here, to here, to here.

00:15:58.855 --> 00:16:00.980
You go through the phases,
at the end of the thing,

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.710
you're done.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.672
Your team's awesome, go you.

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:05.420
What we Actually
see in process is

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.150
that teams tend get in the
forming, they go in the circle

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.240
where they go from
having some issues,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.020
figuring out how to
deal with those issues,

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.222
establish some rules.

00:16:17.222 --> 00:16:18.930
All right, we're going
really well again.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:23.355
New challenge comes up,
we're back in the storming.

00:16:23.355 --> 00:16:24.980
We've put ourselves
in a position where

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.250
we don't know how to
talk to each other,

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.416
or we don't know how to
communicate with each other.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.410
So there's some
problems with the model.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.060
This is really a
descriptive model.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.771
It's a tool for us to use
to see how things are going.

00:16:39.771 --> 00:16:41.520
It's basically a way
to evaluate symptoms.

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:45.600
But there's no
triggers in the model.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.224
We don't know when
those things happen.

00:16:47.224 --> 00:16:49.549
When does your team switch
from storming to norming?

00:16:49.549 --> 00:16:51.590
So this is what I'd like
you to do in your teams,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.940
just take a couple minutes.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.080
Talk about your previous
teams you've been on,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.450
talk about the
team you're on now.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.570
When do you think your team
would move from stage to stage,

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.881
and how could a team
move intentionally?

00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:07.339
And in particular,
think about that

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:08.630
storming to norming part of it.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.819
So what is it going to take
for your team right now,

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.859
or what happened in your
team right now to go from,

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.109
we are having some difficulty
talking with each other,

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:21.230
we have a bunch of opinions,
to we're all on the same page.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.847
Take three minutes.

00:17:22.847 --> 00:17:24.680
AUDIENCE: Just one thing
I want to chime in.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.170
There's a very, very good
chance that your team actually

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.720
is still in forming stage.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.294
And one of the reasons
why very few of you

00:17:32.294 --> 00:17:34.460
might have put up your hands
that you don't actually

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:38.080
want to express dissent,
which is exactly the situation

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.970
that you get in
the forming stage.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:45.540
It is uncomfortable, but
hopefully you can logically

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.390
see the benefits of
being in a team where

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.950
you can talk about the things
that you disagree with, right?

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.140
So it's possible that
you are still in forming,

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.730
and it's good to identify
your teams as, OK,

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.370
this normal evolution
of a team, and that's

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.170
where our team is at right now.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.330
So talk about it
among your team.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.705
PROFESSOR: So take
three minutes,

00:18:05.705 --> 00:18:06.920
just talk to your teams.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.411
I'm going to ask you some
questions when we're done.

00:18:09.411 --> 00:18:23.160
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:31.390
So each group, give me
something you talked about about

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.400
what are the triggers,
what are the things you

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.360
saw as you moved?

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.130
Just let me know which
phases you're talking about.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.070
So go ahead.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.528
AUDIENCE: So we have the
answer to [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:51.444 --> 00:18:55.815
We're somewhere between
storming and norming.

00:18:55.815 --> 00:18:56.940
PROFESSOR: How do you know?

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.370
What caused you to
get there, you think?

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:06.370
AUDIENCE: We got a lot of
the core game squared out.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.870
And that was when we
had the most storming.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:13.370
The reason that I think
we're closer to norming now

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.870
is because it's
like past standard.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.870
Pick them up, [INAUDIBLE]
and marking this done.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.370
Which is faster.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:31.870
On the front end, we're
between forming and storming.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:41.370
Because we're still working
on a lot of design decisions.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.710
PROFESSOR: All right,
so it's big decisions.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.570
How big are those two teams?

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.570
AUDIENCE: Four and four.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.690
PROFESSOR: Four and four?

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.080
OK.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.120
So somebody else next.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.120
A trigger that you saw that
made you go from one stage

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.608
to the other.

00:19:58.608 --> 00:20:01.755
AUDIENCE: I think
as a team, we're

00:20:01.755 --> 00:20:05.069
moved from storming to norming.

00:20:05.069 --> 00:20:10.784
And part of that
trigger was working

00:20:10.784 --> 00:20:12.524
on solidifying our game idea.

00:20:12.524 --> 00:20:15.506
Because at this
point, while we all

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:17.991
recognize that we're
building as a team,

00:20:17.991 --> 00:20:20.637
we all have different ideas
of what this game should be.

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.593
And as we're
solidifying the game,

00:20:22.593 --> 00:20:24.549
we're also getting
ourselves in line

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:28.660
with what we're actually doing,
and how we're going to do it.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.730
PROFESSOR: Do you think that
the task of solidifying the game

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.302
idea is helping you, because
there's this big decision

00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:35.010
you have to make.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.492
Is that helping
you work as a team?

00:20:38.492 --> 00:20:39.700
It's not getting in your way?

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.350
AUDIENCE: I think it's the
fact that as we're doing this,

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.860
we've definitely had this
conflict in our team,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.848
where people were shouting
out different ideas,

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:51.294
and trying to work through it.

00:20:51.294 --> 00:20:53.085
And at first, we weren't
doing the best job

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.326
of getting those ideas
and working through them.

00:20:55.326 --> 00:20:57.567
But I see that now, we're
doing a much better job

00:20:57.567 --> 00:20:59.808
of understanding each
other, and seeing how it

00:20:59.808 --> 00:21:01.302
fits into the bigger picture.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.930
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.650
Next team.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:08.983
A triggering moment that you saw
in this team or previous teams.

00:21:08.983 --> 00:21:12.611
AUDIENCE: So we had a
bigger power team at first,

00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:16.704
and I think that having
the sides split up

00:21:16.704 --> 00:21:21.614
was the way to help us jump
from forming to storming.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:24.232
Because we had to
use scripts in order

00:21:24.232 --> 00:21:27.506
to get our team to get to ideas.

00:21:27.506 --> 00:21:29.961
Also, there were
conflicting ideas

00:21:29.961 --> 00:21:32.823
in terms of where ideas go
in the brainstorming session.

00:21:32.823 --> 00:21:35.370
PROFESSOR: So it's basically
just reducing the number

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.843
of opinions, really, right?

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.356
When that is purely
through people.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.612
AUDIENCE: So with our game,
I think getting us to norming

00:21:51.612 --> 00:21:54.742
was really-- you talked
about assigning tasks.

00:21:54.742 --> 00:21:56.718
But also just the
accountability aspect,

00:21:56.718 --> 00:21:59.682
because instead of
spending time arguing,

00:21:59.682 --> 00:22:03.140
we had a designated
person, or a couple people

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.610
who are capable for
different things.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:11.550
Which allows us to just
not argue [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.240
PROFESSOR: So like
certain people

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.050
have different they
own some subtasks,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.010
or their own subroles?

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.010
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.130
Cool.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.432
In the back?

00:22:20.432 --> 00:22:22.200
What do you think?

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.330
AUDIENCE: I guess what
got us over to storming

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.620
was meeting together as a team
to make design decisions, which

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.620
was like what has
been said there.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:35.100
And I think that the next step
for bringing us over to norming

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.793
would be actually
getting everyone

00:22:36.793 --> 00:22:38.904
to participate in
design decisions.

00:22:38.904 --> 00:22:43.276
Because people have both not
shown up, and not particularly

00:22:43.276 --> 00:22:46.000
shown interest in
getting things going.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.749
So having everyone on
board is [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:49.749 --> 00:22:51.040
PROFESSOR: So that's a big one.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.795
That's a huge
difficulty, especially

00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:55.120
with student projects.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.300
You've got all these other
things going on around you.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.420
Do you think you need everyone
to contribute to the design,

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.516
or do you need everyone to
be on board with the design?

00:23:06.516 --> 00:23:10.428
AUDIENCE: So I understand
some people are just

00:23:10.428 --> 00:23:13.520
less interested in having deep
discussions about the design

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.805
of the game, but
getting everyone

00:23:15.805 --> 00:23:19.927
to both be aware and willing to
participate when they need to.

00:23:19.927 --> 00:23:20.510
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.780
Because yeah, there's
important conversations

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.570
being done that, if they're
not there when it happens,

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.996
they're not going to know where
the status of the game is.

00:23:27.996 --> 00:23:28.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.520
They just need to be
willing to participate.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.606
If they're not there,
take the step of, oh,

00:23:32.606 --> 00:23:33.730
what'd you guys talk about?

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.952
I'm interested in knowing.

00:23:36.952 --> 00:23:38.410
PROFESSOR: Thank
you for that lead,

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.770
because that gets us
to our next stage.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:48.050
So I think we find ourselves
talking a lot about the product

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.350
that we're making.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.170
It's just easier.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.060
It's that hard
thing you can see.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.300
It's being made,
it's being done.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.570
We can play it.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.760
It means we're probably
doing something right.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.402
But it's still very difficult
to talk about the people.

00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:05.610
But we saw been talking
about the people a little bit

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:09.160
here, especially with
accountability in this one.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:09.700
It was good.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.200
Cool.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.940
So that brings me
to the next topic.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.699
Teams are composed
of individuals,

00:24:16.699 --> 00:24:18.240
and each person on
your team is going

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.580
to have a lot of different
factors affecting

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.310
what they do, how they
do it, when they do it.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:27.350
I can't give you the magic
formula to get them motivated.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.750
What I can do is show you
some of the different ways

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.120
that you can try to either
understand the people you're

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.400
with, understand the
people on your team,

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.990
or find things to
talk to them about.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.774
You might notice a
number of these things.

00:24:40.774 --> 00:24:42.190
So to get someone
who's motivated,

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.262
someone who's going to
be able to participate,

00:24:45.262 --> 00:24:46.470
think about all these things.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.380
Think about personal
development.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.600
So you're in a
class, you're here

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.300
hopefully because
you want to learn.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.830
You want to learn a new skill,
you want to try a new skill.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.330
Everyone wants to
learn a new skill.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.680
There might be a skill that they
want to work on on your team,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.570
and I think we've
talked about that

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.330
in the past when we were talking
about the vision statement,

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.970
and people putting down why
they're involved on the team,

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.790
and why they're involved
in this project.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.873
So being aware of that,
and constantly coming back

00:25:09.873 --> 00:25:12.206
to that for each person,
especially if you have someone

00:25:12.206 --> 00:25:14.110
on your team who is
just not participating,

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.899
and you need to figure
out how to engage them.

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:19.440
Think about the
skills that they want

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.814
to bring to the
table, the skills

00:25:20.814 --> 00:25:22.170
they're trying to practice.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:25.510
When it comes to
motivation, it largely

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.212
comes down to
intrinsic or extrinsic.

00:25:28.212 --> 00:25:30.670
The extrinsic might be the
grade that they're going to get,

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:35.430
but it's really difficult
to really hone in on that,

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.360
because the grade's
shared between your group.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.700
So that might not be
the place to look at.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.480
Try to take a look at
the intrinsic things.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:49.060
If they had enthusiasms about
the project at some point,

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.610
try to remember what that was.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.050
Ask somebody else on your team
what that might have been.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.250
See if you can bring
that enthusiasm back

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.940
into the project.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.610
Morale or self-worth.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.380
There's been some
research that shows

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.180
that the reason why people work
well on teams, and the reason

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.700
why we want to work on teams
is because it brings us

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.764
self-worth.

00:26:09.764 --> 00:26:11.680
And in particular, there's
some self awareness

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.870
that can happen by being
on a team, and getting--

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.570
and actually, it links a little
bit to extrinsic rewards.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.140
By getting rewarded, getting
feedback on my performance,

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.400
it's going to help me do better.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.780
Empowerment, giving ownership.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:33.551
So raise your hands if your team
uses assigning tasks or taking

00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:34.050
tasks.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.110
So assigning tasks,
raise your hand.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.680
If your team assigns
tasks to individuals.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.110
That team.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.650
Kind of?

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:43.830
Yeah.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.852
You assign, so there's
one person on your team

00:26:45.852 --> 00:26:47.310
that says you are
going to do this.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.700
Has anybody tried
ownership, where

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:57.130
someone takes a task from a set
of tasks that are available?

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.330
Little, little.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.630
When does that work?

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.580
When does ownership work?

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:05.430
What's that?

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.855
AUDIENCE: When people
are eager to work,

00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:08.760
and they're interested
in what we're doing.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.890
PROFESSOR: So there's some
of those other things.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.490
There's some enthusiasm over it.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.990
Yeah?

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.870
AUDIENCE: It's usually a while
before the deadline, too.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.800
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.300
Yeah?

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:20.940
AUDIENCE: You can
run into problems

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.660
if you say who's going to do
this, and nobody volunteers.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.264
So my experience has
been that it's good

00:27:26.264 --> 00:27:28.429
if people can volunteer
for tasks that they're

00:27:28.429 --> 00:27:31.018
enthusiastic about, but then,
if nobody will volunteer

00:27:31.018 --> 00:27:33.559
to do something that needs to
be done, someone has to step up

00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:35.100
and say, OK, you're
going to do this.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.851
So it's like kind of
a hybrid [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:36.851 --> 00:27:38.600
PROFESSOR: So where
does-- yeah, go ahead.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.982
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
and I think also,

00:27:39.982 --> 00:27:42.402
it depends on if
everyone on a team

00:27:42.402 --> 00:27:45.306
is willing to take ownership
versus, like, only some people.

00:27:45.306 --> 00:27:48.040
Because that'll create
a different dynamic.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.248
There's some people who are
really taking initiative,

00:27:50.248 --> 00:27:52.081
but the others aren't,
so you're still going

00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:53.650
to need to assign them tasks.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.941
So I think something
that's where

00:27:55.941 --> 00:27:58.024
at the beginning ask for
people to take ownership,

00:27:58.024 --> 00:27:59.968
and then the tasks
that are left,

00:27:59.968 --> 00:28:03.880
there's one person who's
going to delegate this out.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.330
PROFESSOR: So at the beginning,
everybody takes on tasks.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.440
And at the end, when
you have the leftovers,

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.440
they get assigned.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:09.940
Yeah, Matt?

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.912
AUDIENCE: One of
the biggest problems

00:28:11.912 --> 00:28:15.363
I've seen with this is
when you're not thinking

00:28:15.363 --> 00:28:16.842
about the game you
are working on,

00:28:16.842 --> 00:28:19.320
especially this is
very easy since we have

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.562
a lot of other work, then things
can stall, because you're not

00:28:22.562 --> 00:28:23.936
thinking about
what kind of game,

00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:25.727
so you're not thinking
about being passive.

00:28:27.994 --> 00:28:30.160
PROFESSOR: So you might not
actually have ownership.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.870
It might look like
you had ownership.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.286
There is the
evidence of ownership

00:28:33.286 --> 00:28:35.500
in that someone said,
OK, I'll take that task.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.950
But there's no follow through,
there's no commitment.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.260
And that gets to the
next one, commitment.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.940
The best way to have commitment
on your team is for one person

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.800
to be committed to
express that commitment,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.240
to express that loyalty.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.990
For everyone else
to see that loyalty

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.420
and see that
commitment, and then

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.670
hopefully they pick up the
ball, and they're like, OK,

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.130
I'm going to be committed, too.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.980
If that second person
doesn't do that, pick it up,

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.810
then it doesn't travel
through the chain,

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.530
it just doesn't happen.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.030
Even though that
one person went out

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.760
of their way to show
that kind of sacrifice,

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.968
it just didn't get picked up.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.560
Do see that chain
happening on your teams,

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.764
do you see it breaking?

00:29:14.764 --> 00:29:16.680
Can you identify where
that breaking point is,

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.880
and can you think
about ways to fix that?

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.010
Trust is a big one.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.750
So raise your hands
if you have worked

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.720
with the majority of
people on your team

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.294
before, in some fashion.

00:29:31.294 --> 00:29:32.460
This class or other classes.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.407
You feel like you
know your teammates.

00:29:34.407 --> 00:29:36.240
Raise your hands if you
feel like you really

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.406
know your teammates, you've
worked with them before.

00:29:38.406 --> 00:29:40.680
High if you really think so.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.640
So one, two, maybe.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.470
One, two, three.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.326
So think about how well
you know each other,

00:29:49.326 --> 00:29:50.950
think about ways you
can figure out how

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.490
you can know each other better.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.870
Social interactions.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.370
Going out for coffee, going out
for lunch, things like that.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.930
Is there something that
you can do that will

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.140
help that kind of thing happen?

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.600
And then here's the big one,
this is the MIT one, stress.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.240
Stress tends to be the negative.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.570
It can be positive, in that
it's the end of the project,

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.390
and it's due, and you just
need to get things done,

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.050
and that could lead to crunch.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.425
But then there's also the huge
negative aspect of stress,

00:30:18.425 --> 00:30:21.390
and that's very much an external
factor, for the most part.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.150
It could be in an
internal factor.

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:27.330
If there's some stress being
caused by internal things

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.200
going on with your team,
it's likely related

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.366
to one of the ones above it.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:38.830
So one way to think
about these 7 things,

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.450
you can think of them in
terms of the desirability

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.754
to learn new skills, or the
desirability to take on task.

00:30:44.754 --> 00:30:46.670
So if you're trying to
come up with strategies

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.250
with your team on how to
solve some of these problems,

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.541
think of it in those two terms.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.410
So how do distributed
teams perform?

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.896
So what do I mean
by distributed?

00:31:01.896 --> 00:31:03.020
What is a distributed team?

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.660
Yeah?

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.721
AUDIENCE: Chopped up into
groups, and each group

00:31:08.721 --> 00:31:10.064
is working on its own secret?

00:31:10.064 --> 00:31:10.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.720
Or just everyone's
all over the place.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.410
It could mean that
you are in Singapore,

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:18.400
and someone else is in Ohio.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.250
You could be separated
by time zones, by oceans.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.750
And really, I think that might
be east campus and MacGregor,

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.704
maybe.

00:31:26.704 --> 00:31:28.120
It could just be
through distance,

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.203
it could be through your
schools, could be through

00:31:30.203 --> 00:31:32.600
your departments,
your majors, whatnot.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.390
There's some kind of boundaries
going on between people.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.515
In this case, it's largely time.

00:31:39.515 --> 00:31:41.140
Some people can work
during some hours,

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.280
some people can't work
during those hours.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.840
So what have you done
so far to fix that?

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.050
And think back on the
postmortems you've given us.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.610
What are some of the strategies
you've already used and seen

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:57.970
used to figure out how to work
across different time periods?

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.794
AUDIENCE: Well, right
now, we're using Slacked,

00:32:05.794 --> 00:32:07.750
which is pretty helpful.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.524
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:09.524 --> 00:32:10.690
PROFESSOR: What's it called?

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.686
AUDIENCE: Slacked.

00:32:11.686 --> 00:32:13.180
It's like Flowdock.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.272
PROFESSOR: It's like what?

00:32:14.272 --> 00:32:15.104
AUDIENCE: Flowdock.

00:32:15.104 --> 00:32:16.020
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.014
AUDIENCE: It's group
instant messaging.

00:32:17.014 --> 00:32:18.008
PROFESSOR: Yay.

00:32:18.008 --> 00:32:20.493
AUDIENCE: And it keeps track
of all our assigned tasks.

00:32:20.493 --> 00:32:22.978
And also, [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:22.978 --> 00:32:25.700
PROFESSOR: Cool. anybody else
using group IM, or an IRC chat?

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.570
Yeah?

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.694
AUDIENCE: We're using
something called [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:30.694 --> 00:32:33.090
which is like a chat
tied to your GitHub.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.198
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:32:34.198 --> 00:32:36.190
AUDIENCE: I think
Skype also just allows

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.680
communication [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.870
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:41.796
OK.

00:32:41.796 --> 00:32:43.670
It's great when it can
hook up to the things,

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:44.870
and it works with your workflow.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.480
It's also just great
to have just period.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.210
If you don't use any of those,
maybe think about Skype.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:49.850
Any other things people use?

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:51.108
Yeah.

00:32:51.108 --> 00:32:54.601
AUDIENCE: In my
experience, let's say

00:32:54.601 --> 00:32:59.092
we're working on something,
and [INAUDIBLE] at that point.

00:32:59.092 --> 00:33:01.337
It would be good to keep
the whole team informed

00:33:01.337 --> 00:33:03.583
of all the programs, what's
happening on your grant.

00:33:03.583 --> 00:33:09.571
So we really like to just use
a Google Doc explaining exactly

00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:10.955
what you have done so far.

00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:11.955
PROFESSOR: So reporting.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.110
I remember some people
had issues with email

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.370
on previous teams.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.110
So anybody still using
email as a primary

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.480
means of communication
on your team?

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.173
How's it working
for y'all so far?

00:33:26.173 --> 00:33:28.298
AUDIENCE: It hasn't gotten
to the hectic point yet.

00:33:28.298 --> 00:33:32.194
We think we started talking
about emailing subgroups more,

00:33:32.194 --> 00:33:34.150
except [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.400
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.520
Are those emails going to
be archived and viewable

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.919
by everyone at a later date?

00:33:38.919 --> 00:33:40.418
AUDIENCE: That would
be a good idea.

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:41.084
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:48.220
And I think that's why we
tend to think about group IMs.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.070
And particularly, Philip likes
IRC for that very reason.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.921
Certain IRC servers will
keep an archive for you.

00:33:53.921 --> 00:33:55.670
Other kinds of groupware
will do that too,

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:56.795
but they tend to be pricey.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.470
Has anybody started using
Trello on your teams yet?

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.499
Yeah?

00:34:04.499 --> 00:34:06.290
Are you using it as a
communication method,

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.600
or as a recording of things?

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.685
AUDIENCE: Recording of things.

00:34:11.685 --> 00:34:14.310
PROFESSOR: Anybody using that as
a communication method at all?

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.547
Trying that out.

00:34:16.547 --> 00:34:18.880
Because I think it can do
email notifications and things

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.320
like that when things change.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.159
Assigning members to
tasks, stuff like that.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:27.250
All right.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:31.179
So again, we got
talking into tools.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:32.940
What other things can we do?

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.150
So another paper that it's going
to be on Stellar if you want

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:39.050
to look at it was
basically a survey

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.971
of distributed teams
using agile processes,

00:34:41.971 --> 00:34:43.679
and giving up some
best practices of what

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.219
worked best for them.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:49.760
And I was nice, and I'm just
give you the summary of that.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.989
So one thing they noticed
is having a one team mindset

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.610
was the thing that got them
through working together

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.260
as a group.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.730
What do we mean by one team?

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:03.085
That the group first
identifies as a team,

00:35:03.085 --> 00:35:04.460
like what we talked
about before.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.920
They all have a goal that
they're going towards,

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.710
they all identify as
going towards that goal.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:13.870
They don't identify as
just an individual group.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:18.130
But that's actually a major
part of their identity.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.890
For them, it's because that's
their 40 hour, 80 hour, 120

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:26.094
hour work weeks.

00:35:26.094 --> 00:35:27.510
Something I think
you you're going

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.860
to have an issue with,
because you're working

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.690
smaller periods of time.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.669
But the way they're able
to do that is they've

00:35:33.669 --> 00:35:35.210
got these frequent
team interactions.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:36.660
And actually, when
they're working

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.720
for a long period
of time, there are

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.604
people who are
working on their own

00:35:40.604 --> 00:35:42.020
in their home or
their home office

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.070
with another team
that's very far away.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:48.090
And yet, these teams
still do a daily stand up.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.540
Does anybody here do a daily
stand up on their teams

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.040
right now?

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.669
So what they're doing is
they're going on video,

00:35:56.669 --> 00:35:59.210
they're talking to each other
for a very short period of time

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.530
about what they've done,
what they're going to do,

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.711
what's in their way.

00:36:03.711 --> 00:36:05.210
The cool thing with
daily stand ups,

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.130
and why they think
this works for them,

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.190
it goes back to
those seven items

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.250
I listed about how you get
people engaged on a team?

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.950
It shows commitment.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:18.650
The fact that there are people
who are showing up to meetings.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.700
There's some kind of
personal sacrifice.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.510
Some people are meeting at a
very strange hour of the day

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.199
that they're not
normally going to meet,

00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:26.990
and they're doing that
because of the team.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:30.280
They're sacrificing something
personal for the team.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.090
Everyone else on the
team sees that, they

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:34.040
see that kind of commitment.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.120
They feel like they need to
reflect that back themselves.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.270
Also trust.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:39.750
And in this
particular case, it's

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.020
the trust of not letting
meetings take too long.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.090
These daily stand ups really
should only take 10 minutes.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.315
An effective team
can do it in five.

00:36:47.315 --> 00:36:49.330
An effective 10 person team.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.100
30 seconds each, go, everyone
says what they've done.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.482
Everyone sees each
other's faces.

00:36:53.482 --> 00:36:55.440
The great thing about
seeing each other's faces

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.211
is you can see what stage of
fear and anxiety they're in.

00:36:59.211 --> 00:37:00.710
And you can then
talk to them later,

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.876
and have some other personal
interactions with them.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.926
The other thing they do,
they do co-located work.

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.550
They've got money
sometimes, so they're

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.185
flying people back and forth.

00:37:12.185 --> 00:37:14.060
But again, they're also
doing co-located work

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.270
by doing things, having Skype
always on in the background

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.630
while they're working together.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.338
But they're not doing
it the entire time,

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.790
they can't afford that.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:27.025
So one thing you can do is to
schedule your co-located time

00:37:27.025 --> 00:37:29.150
at the beginning of the
project, which is basically

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.600
what we've been doing in
class for the past few weeks.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.070
Identifying important
milestones, and making sure

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.090
you've scheduled a co-located
period during that milestone,

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.630
right before that milestone
is going to help you greatly.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.888
Doing insert teams,
and doing video chat.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.360
And here's a big one we haven't
talked about in class so much,

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.550
but I get the impression
that some of you

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.470
might be interested
in this kind of thing.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.790
Having coaches.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.970
So we've already seen
some of the teams

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.200
have a dedicated scrum
master or producer.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.570
Think about having
a dedicated coach.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:04.730
So someone who's
on your team, who's

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:07.100
there to cultivate team spirit.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.440
They're going to emphasize
the importance of one team.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.410
They could be your scrum
master or producer,

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:15.240
but they're not
actually the same role.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.140
The scrum master or the producer
is measuring productivity.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.190
They're measuring tasks on
how well things get done.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.464
The coach is very different.

00:38:23.464 --> 00:38:25.755
They're looking at how people
interact with each other,

00:38:25.755 --> 00:38:27.080
how people talk to each other.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.570
How people work with each other.

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.600
Oftentimes, people who are
naturally inclined to do one

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.870
can be inclined to do the other,
but that's not always the case.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.950
So if you have
someone on your team

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:41.790
who is one of those extroverted,
outgoing, or even introverted

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.010
but really interested in what
individuals do one-on-one,

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.645
and how individuals work.

00:38:46.645 --> 00:38:50.260
See if you can incorporate
some coaching strategies

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.136
with your teammates.

00:38:52.136 --> 00:38:53.885
And again, you can do
one-on-one meetings,

00:38:53.885 --> 00:38:55.500
and we can talk about
this in the future

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.291
if you're interested
in this kind of stuff.

00:38:57.291 --> 00:39:01.820
We can unpack on this topic
and talk about it further.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.730
But I highly recommend it.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.640
So I did mention meetings.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.470
You do have agile
meetings, these people

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.640
have agile meetings.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.120
These are what they are.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:19.360
So who has a formal sprint
process, where you plan

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.115
your sprint before you start?

00:39:21.115 --> 00:39:24.890
So you basically create your
sprint task list at a meeting?

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:26.520
Is everyone there?

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.050
Not everyone's there.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:34.420
AUDIENCE: We have the tasks,
and we've focused [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.952
So we do have a formal
week-by-week, here's

00:39:36.952 --> 00:39:38.410
what we want to
get done this week.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:39.900
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.102
And you had a meeting
to create that?

00:39:43.102 --> 00:39:44.560
Then you have your
daily stand ups.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.144
At the end of the sprint, you
want to have a sprint review.

00:39:48.144 --> 00:39:50.560
Just basically the inverse of
the sprint planning meeting.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.507
You go back and
see what you made.

00:39:52.507 --> 00:39:54.590
Hopefully, you have a build
and you just basically

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:58.060
look at the build, compare the
build to the completed tasks,

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.710
and make sure it matches.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.380
The other meeting that you
may or may not be doing

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.230
is the agile retrospective.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.220
And that's how did
you work this week?

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.800
Is anybody doing
that, is anybody

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.960
at the end of their
sprint, talking

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.142
about the processes of what
you did and how you did it?

00:40:16.811 --> 00:40:17.310
OK.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.020
It's what I expect.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.900
I think you're doing
yourself a disservice

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.941
if you're not doing that.

00:40:23.941 --> 00:40:25.600
And particularly, if
you are doing that

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.650
and you're making that
a face to face meeting,

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:29.130
that's the time when
you can talk about some

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.500
of these interpersonal issues.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.875
That's the time
when you can talk

00:40:31.875 --> 00:40:34.650
about your feelings, that's
the time when you can open up,

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.130
and try to figure
out what is about,

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.850
why are some of these
tasks not getting taken on,

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:44.210
who's not doing them, and what's
in their way from doing them.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:48.392
But really, it's not really
about what's in the way,

00:40:48.392 --> 00:40:49.600
it's difficult to talk about.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.058
It's not about
what's in their way,

00:40:51.058 --> 00:40:52.660
but it might be
about what outside

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.250
of the project and outside of
the team could be in their way?

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.275
And can you work through
some of those issues?

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.976
So I'm done.

00:41:02.976 --> 00:41:05.350
What I'd like you do before
you go and work in your teams

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:08.240
is schedule a sprint
retrospective.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.220
So take a look at
your sprint process.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.220
How long is your sprint?

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.990
Is it one week or two weeks?

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:18.800
We've been assuming
it's one-week sprints.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.610
Schedule a time period
that everyone can attend,

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.856
and an amount of time
that they can attend.

00:41:24.856 --> 00:41:26.230
That they can see
each other face

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.542
to face, but not necessarily
are in the same room.

00:41:28.542 --> 00:41:30.250
If they can be in the
same room, awesome.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.535
If you can't, try
to figure out a time

00:41:32.535 --> 00:41:37.330
that you can chat using Google
Hangout, or some other kind

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:40.469
of face to face video chat.

00:41:40.469 --> 00:41:42.260
Make sure the meeting
is focused on talking

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.500
about your processes.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.052
So don't talk about your game,
don't talk about the work

00:41:46.052 --> 00:41:46.760
that you've done.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.450
Talk about how you
organized yourself.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:54.050
And in particular, talk about
your interpersonal matters.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:56.530
Basically, communicate
about communicating.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:01.280
So talk about how you're
talking to each other.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.865
And yeah, I want to talk to you
about this again in a couple

00:42:03.865 --> 00:42:04.365
weeks.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.500
I think most of you
right now are probably

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.200
in the concepting phase,
pre-production phase right now.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.700
You're still figuring
out your game,

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.762
you haven't quite-- I
guess you guys are actually

00:42:18.762 --> 00:42:20.470
working on your back
end, because someone

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.920
did the initial design for you.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.540
The rest are probably still
working out the design phase.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.430
When I talk about
this again, you'll

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:30.960
likely be in full-on
production mode,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.830
and so some of the activities
I'm going to show you

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:38.570
might hopefully help when
you're doing these meetings.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.235
Any questions?

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.520
OK.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.590
So it's 1:50.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.600
Go ahead and take a
few minutes to break,

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.160
and then the rest of the class
is yours to work in your teams.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.650
But still do this.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:54.000

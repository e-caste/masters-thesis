GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK,
so let's get started.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.600
I'm just trying
to wire myself up.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600
OK.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:39.600
So before we get into
the PowerPoint here.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.620
So basically, what I'm doing is
I'm picking up from the point

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.570
where we left last time,
where we're discussing waves.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.900
And what I would like to do
now is derive a wave equation

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.760
basically, for a
mathematical form

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.930
that should allow us to predict
different kinds of waves.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.459
Of waves, not the waves.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.930
All right, so what
I start with here.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.060
I start with a general function,
psi, of an argument, eta.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:24.080
So for those of you who are not
fluent in Greek, this is psi,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.840
and this is eta.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.340
OK.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.680
At the moment, these
don't necessarily

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.290
have a physical meaning.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.190
But in order to
produce a wave out

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.310
of this function,
what I can do is

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:56.640
I can write it as psi,
or f of z comma t,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.070
equals psi of z minus ct.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.910
OK, now why is that a wave?

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.220
First of all, z now has
become a spacial coordinate.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.980
t, as usual, is time.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.650
So if you actually hide time.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.660
So now time is zero.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.760
Time is a constant or
something like that.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.330
Then you actually have
basically the same argument.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.060
But if you allow
time to increase,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.360
then you can see that
the time increase will

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.060
have the effect of
sliding the same shape

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.350
along the spatial axis.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.560
So for example, let's take this
as our reference point here.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.440
The first peak after
you advance time

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.330
a little further than
this point has moved fast,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.970
has moved to the right.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.780
And how much is this distance?

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.440
Well, anybody?

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.700
This is easy.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.210
I'm just trying to see if the
people in Boston have woken up.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.450
Yes?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.020
Nobody's awake in Boston.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.630
So this distance equals ct.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.910
Because if I set the
argument of this function

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.250
to zero, then basically I
recover my original function.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.510
So basically as I
advance time, the fact

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.010
is that this waveform
moves to the right.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.770
And at the moment, there's
no obvious motivation

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.620
for why I'm going to do
what I'm about to do.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.730
But please take my word
for it for a while.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.620
I'm going to take two
partial derivatives.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:01.560
I'm going to take
df dz, and df dt.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.420
OK, df dz equals basically
c prime, where c prime--

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.800
I use c prime simply to
denote the derivative of c

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.459
with respect to its
mysterious argument.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.200
So that's very easy.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.579
What about the affinity?

00:04:31.058 --> 00:04:31.600
That's right.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.870
I have to apply the
chain rule, because there

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.390
is a multiplicative
argument inside.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.360
So this is going to be
minus c times c prime.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.880
So because c prime appears
in both places over here,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:56.460
I can combine these
equations and say, df over dz

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.700
equals minus 1 over c, df dt.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.760
So that is a partial
differential equation.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.720
And you might say, well, what
I did is a bit stupid, right?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.540
Because I had a relatively
simple explanation

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.290
for the wave.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.110
I actually had the wave
just in front of me.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.200
And what I did is I wrote a
partial differential equation

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.907
which is not very intuitive.

00:05:21.907 --> 00:05:23.740
But the benefit of doing
that is, of course,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:31.060
that the wave that I wrote here
is a very special, very limited

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.420
kind of wave that propagates
without changing shape,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.940
without anything
fancy happening.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.220
We know from experience,
for example, in real life,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.780
if you have ever
seen water waves.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.290
Water waves, they
don't quite propagate.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.700
They change shape in all
kinds of complicated ways.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.820
So even though I
derive this equation

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.355
from that simple shape.

00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:54.730
What we'll see a
little bit later

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.100
that this equation
actually can describe

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.713
much more general waves.

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:01.630
We're not quite done
yet, because the question

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.940
that I derived here applies
for a wave moving to the right.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.420
I can equally well
contribute a wave

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.150
that is moving to the left.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.410
And in this case, what
I would have to do

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.890
is I would have to write
f of z comma t equals psi

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.825
or z plus ct.

00:06:21.825 --> 00:06:23.700
A little bit of thought
will convince you now

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.280
that if you advance
time, then the wave

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.460
will have actually to move to
the left, towards negative z

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.170
in order to maintain
its argument.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.300
And if I do the same game now.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.420
Again, I can write
df dz equals c prime.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.790
That did not change.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.160
This time, df dt
equals plus c prime.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.420
Now, I have another partial
differential equation,

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:59.160
df dz equals 1 over c, df dt.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.540
OK, let me put
back the equation.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:11.200
So this is a wave going
to the left, backwards.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.870
And I had another equation,
df dz equals minus 1

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.790
over c, df dt.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.210
And that is a way of
going to the right.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.260
OK.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.980
You can see very easily that
if you take a second derivative

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.350
of these equations.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.000
Let's go back to the first one.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.530
If you do the second derivative,
d squared f dz square.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.140
You will pick up an extra minus
sign from the same equation.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.520
And you will find that it is
1 over c square, d square f,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.980
dt square.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.275
You can do the same
in this equation.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.610
There's no sign
here to begin with.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.770
But there is one
over here, c square,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.150
d squared f, dt squared.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.640
So basically, this
single equation.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.530
This single equation can
describe both forward

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:37.210
and backward propagating waves.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.730
And this equation.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.679
Actually, it's a three
dimensional version.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.770
Not this one, but it's
three dimensional version.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:52.415
It has the name
Helmholtz wave equation.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.430
And because of Helmholtz,
it's a little bit difficult

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.560
to pronounce.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.240
Actually, that's
not the real one.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.630
Anyway, it's a very commonly
encountered wave equation.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.690
So typically we
simply omit Helmholtz,

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.710
and we say wave equation.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.400
Now, why you might want to
distinguish this as opposed to

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.210
are there other wave equations?

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.210
Yes, there is the
Schrodinger equation.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.410
There is the
Klein-Gordon equation.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.150
For those of you who
do fluid mechanics,

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.110
there is a Korteweg-de Vries
equation, also known as KDV.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.960
There's a bunch of
different wave equations.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.170
So we need some way
to discriminate.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.563
Nevertheless, the
other wave equations,

00:09:40.563 --> 00:09:41.980
they are referred
with their name.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.500
So when you want to refer
to Schrodinger's equation,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.860
you say Schrodinger's equation.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.150
By convention, when
you say wave equation,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.610
you mean this one,
so the Helmholtz.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.950
OK.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.930
So this is all very
nice, but it's actually

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.460
down on your slide.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:04.670
So there's no reason to agonize
over what I did over here.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.480
What I would like to
remind you before I

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.430
move on is for the
simple case of a--

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:20.070
first of all, you
can imagine that this

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.530
is a very general
kind of solution.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.790
Because what is c?

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:29.250
After all, I put up this
strange shape over here.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.670
I didn't say where it came from.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.930
So for that matter, if someone
gives you the wave question,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.300
how can you go
ahead and solve it?

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.080
Well, we're not going to do
this in great detail here.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.750
This is a little bit beside
the scope of the class.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.500
But generally, if you need to
solve a partial differential

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.900
like this one, you need
additional information.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.970
You need the initial conditions.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.030
How did the wave start
at that time equals zero?

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.860
And you also need the
boundary conditions.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.130
So what happens to the
wave as it expands?

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.200
Sometimes, the boundary
condition is at infinity.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.760
Maybe the wave is not bounded.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.705
It can propagate
outwards all the way.

00:11:05.705 --> 00:11:07.080
And that's a good
example of what

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:13.600
happens if you are flying with a
helicopter on top of the ocean.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.048
And you drop a--

00:11:15.048 --> 00:11:15.590
I don't know.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.240
You drop a stone into
the surface of the ocean.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.800
Then the wave that you generate,
the wave that you generate.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.360
To a good approximation, you
can use infinite boundary

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.110
conditions.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.990
Because the ocean is not quite
infinite, but very large.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:37.130
If you generate in a
wave in a small channel,

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.060
then you might have to
include boundary conditions.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.770
Because the wave
will be confined

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.450
by the walls of the channel.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.490
And we will see later
that this is actually

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.320
quite commonly the case.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.040
In optics, we don't
call them channels.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.220
We'll call them wave guides.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.810
But the boundary conditions can
actually significantly alter

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.400
the shape of the wave.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.230
So what I did here is
just to give you an idea,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.070
I quote unquote, "solved."

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.660
Nothing interesting
happens here,

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.720
but this is actually
solution of the wave

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.850
equation with a particular
initial condition, where

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.560
time equals zero.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.250
The wave is a sinusoid.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.320
I said that this is my equation.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.200
And I say that f
of z at t equals 0,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:39.750
equals some sinusoid amplitude
a, and wave number k.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.670
If that is the case,
then by inspection.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.000
I don't have to do anything.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.450
All very important.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.290
And what I did not write
down, but it is implied,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.480
is that the boundary
conditions are free.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.790
So this wave is
free to go as far

00:12:54.790 --> 00:13:00.350
as it pleases without
any special constraints.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:05.410
So if that is the case, then you
can write the solution almost

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.460
by inspection.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:15.250
Half of z comma t equals
a cosine kz minus ct.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.940
And you can see by inspection
here that because of the way

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.230
I wrote it, this
actually satisfies

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.740
both the partial differential
equation, the wave equation,

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.250
and the boundary condition.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:30.560
So therefore, this is a proper
solution of the wave equation.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.740
In fact, I only
wrote half of it.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:38.170
The wave, remember, it can go
forwards, and can go backwards.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:44.540
To cover both cases, I actually
write the solution this way.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.470
With the data that I
have here, actually, I

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.780
don't have enough to specify.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.880
Or actually, in principle,
the wave can go both ways.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.900
I would have to apply to give
you additional information

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.920
to know which actually happened.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.200
The other thing that
I wanted to point out,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.190
which is not really difficult,
but it takes some getting used

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.190
to, is the various
terms that appear

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.740
inside this equation over here.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.850
So the term that we have
been very familiar with

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.670
is the wavelength.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.620
There's another of those
crazy Greek symbols.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.420
It's called lambda.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.960
And the wavelength is
related to the quantity

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:32.430
that we have over here, as
2 pi over lambda equals k.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.980
So lambda is the
wavelength, as I said.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.280
K is known as the wave number.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.960
So the relationship
that they have

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.510
is if you think of the
wavelength as a period--

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.570
which it is, the period of
the wave in the space domain--

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:55.620
then k would actually be
the angular frequency.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.550
But we'll call it wave number
to keep them separated.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.570
OK.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:05.010
Equivalently, you can define
the actual angular frequency

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.760
of the wave.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.300
Usually this goes
by the symbol omega.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.550
And from this
equation over here,

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.550
very simply you can see that
if you wanted to write it

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:25.210
in the form a cosine kz
minus omega t, then clearly,

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.058
omega is the angular frequency.

00:15:27.058 --> 00:15:28.600
And when comparing
the two equations,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.420
you can see that
omega equals kc.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.330
So the angular
frequency, then, is

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:45.060
related to the spatial
frequency, the wave number,

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.960
and the speed of the wave.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.460
And of course, this
is nothing new.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.407
We've seen this equation before,
but we saw it in disguise.

00:15:54.407 --> 00:15:55.990
And that's why I'm
going through this.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.780
Because all the symbols,
they can be played around

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.220
with quite a bit.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.040
So this equation, I can rewrite.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.690
And the [INAUDIBLE]
is like this.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.360
So omega is the
angular frequency.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.110
I also have the
plane, so to speak.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:16.830
Frequency nu, which is
related as omega over 2 pi.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.910
One of them goes
[INAUDIBLE] radians.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:25.060
I'm sorry, it's measured
in full radians per second.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.040
This is omega.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.920
Nu is measured in hertz,
simply inverse seconds.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.600
Bless you.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.350
So I can substitute
in this equation.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.510
Omega is 2 pi times nu.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:41.820
k, according to my equation
over here, is 2 pi up on lambda.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.560
And c is c.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.360
So the two pis cancel here.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.830
The two pis cancel here,
and I end up with equation c

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.190
equals lambda nu, which
I think we've already

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.760
seen a couple of times before.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.120
Who call it the dispersion
relation of the wave.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.550
So this is how all
this came about.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.829
I haven't said anything
new about this.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:09.680
I'm just trying to point
out the different ways

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.460
that this equation
can manifest itself.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.310
And the other two terms that
we encountered last time,

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.829
and I wanted to remind you.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.910
One is the amplitude
of the wave.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.710
This is this
constant a over here.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.590
For some reason, in the slide,
they decided to call it a0.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.590
Anyway, it is the same thing.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:40.360
And also, so we said last
time that in general, the wave

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.160
can also have a phase delay.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.180
So in here, I can not
cite the constant plus

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.060
fee, which does not really
do anything by itself.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.140
All it does if you
wish equivalently,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.840
it shifts the time origin.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.580
So that's a relatively
trivial thing

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.990
because after all, I am free to
start my clock whenever I want.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.330
If I have a wave
that never changes,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.048
I can start my clock
whenever I want.

00:18:06.048 --> 00:18:07.840
So it doesn't really
make a big difference.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.590
But we saw last time that if
you have two waves that are,

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.960
as we said, interference--
or they're simultaneously

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.430
happening, so to speak--

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:19.750
then the relative phase
delay between the two

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.520
can actually be
quite significant.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.010
And I will play
this movie again.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.575
In this case, the two
waves are actually--

00:18:26.575 --> 00:18:29.930
they have the same
phase between them.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.160
In other words, if you
look at the center,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.010
they're both simultaneously
bright or simultaneously dark.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.690
Whereas in the other case,
it's the other way around.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.070
They're off by pi.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.908
So when one is maximum,
the other is minimum.

00:18:42.908 --> 00:18:44.450
I think it is worth
playing this one.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.700
This also has the
interesting effect

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.527
that this can hypnotize you.

00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:55.110
So for those of you who are in
Boston and not fully awake yet.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.890
Yes.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.390
Oh, so when you ask a question,
you need to push the button.

00:19:04.835 --> 00:19:06.210
AUDIENCE: So for
them for now are

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.970
two waves travel in
the opposite direction.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.910
They have same amplitude, about
perfect cancel each other.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.825
So in this case, where
does the energy go?

00:19:15.825 --> 00:19:18.450
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: They don't
quite cancel each other, right?

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.390
So as we will see I will
actually do this in a second.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.935
It's called a standing wave.

00:19:22.935 --> 00:19:24.810
So you will see that
they don't quite cancel.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.720
They just produce a, well,
what is called a standing wave.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.493
So I will get to your question.

00:19:31.493 --> 00:19:33.035
I think it's actually
coming up next.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:41.060
Yeah, so give me a second and
I will get to your question.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.330
So that is a standing wave.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.560
So like your colleague
asked over here.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.800
Suppose that you have a
superposition of two waves.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.440
Now, both are solutions
to the wave equation.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.150
Now, by truce.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:02.820
I don't want to
do the proof here.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.290
It takes three lines.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:09.130
But by its looks, this is a
linear differential equation.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.990
So basically, it means that
if you know one solution,

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.090
you know another solution.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.340
And then you add
these two solutions

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.190
after multiplying by
arbitrary constants.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.650
The result from the
addition is still

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.510
a solution to this equation.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.740
A very fundamental property that
we use again and again later

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.330
in the class.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.310
So that said, suppose
that I pick two solutions

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.290
that I already saw.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.400
One of them is a forward
propagating wave,

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.680
the other is a backward
propagating wave.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.810
So here they are.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.040
The one with the minus
is propagating forward.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.680
The one with the plus
is propagating backward.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.330
So your colleague
here asked, what will

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.568
happen if I superimpose them?

00:20:50.568 --> 00:20:52.110
So one of them is
going to the right.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.988
One is to the left.

00:20:52.988 --> 00:20:54.030
Are they going to cancel?

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.870
What are they going to do?

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.280
OK, so this is a computational.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.100
So perhaps you
should not trust it.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.650
After all, what is this?

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.020
But anyway, this is
what I got in Matlab

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.460
when I simulated this.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.750
OK, let me play this again.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.960
So this is the result
of the two waves.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.497
OK.

00:21:14.497 --> 00:21:15.330
I pushed the button.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.622
I did not play the movie again.

00:21:16.622 --> 00:21:19.640
I revealed the derivation,
but that's quite all right.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.570
Actually, I meant to do
this on the free hand here.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.630
OK, never mind.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.610
Ignore what you
see on the slide,

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.300
and just watch the whiteboard.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.050
I guess I can call it
whiteboard, can't I?

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.610
I mean, it is a whiteboard.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.570
OK, so here are the two waves.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.060
So I actually omitted.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.120
I should have said that not only
are they counterpropagating,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.500
but also, I pick them
both to be harmonic waves.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.140
So that we can do
the math easily.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.330
OK, so let's add this out.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:03.140
So we picked the
identical amplitude.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.530
So one of them will be
written as-- did I use a,

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.740
or was it-- a, yeah, OK.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.630
OK, now, for generality.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.630
I don't really have to,
but for generality, I also

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:24.250
added the phase, a phase
delay field to the first wave.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.680
So this one is forward.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.180
And then I have the
other one, which

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.320
looks very similar, except
for this devious minus

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:38.370
sign that goes backward.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.640
OK.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.560
And the superposition
principle says

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.530
that I can simply
add the two waves,

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.680
and the summation is still a
solution to the wave equation,

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.400
therefore, still a valid wave.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.260
OK, so what is the result?

00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:02.070
So now, I don't know how to
tell you to remember this.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:06.690
Most people look it up
in books of trigonometry.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.750
I have a second mnemonic for
it, but I will not tell you.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:17.950
So there's a mnemonic
that says if you have

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.538
the sum of two cosines equals--

00:23:21.538 --> 00:23:23.080
now, this is a
mathematical property,

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.450
so there's no intuition
to be derived here.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.530
This is just obtained by
trigonometric manipulation.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:36.850
Equals twice cosine, a plus
b over 2, cosine a minus b

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.510
over 2.

00:23:40.782 --> 00:23:41.990
So I never remember this one.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.480
I will tell you
actually my mnemonic.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.570
It's nothing strange.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:54.275
All I remember is that if you
have cosine of two things,

00:23:54.275 --> 00:23:55.040
it equals--

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.380
let me write it cleanly
on a clean piece of paper.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.515
So cosine of two things.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.040
It has a minus sign here.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.475
And sine of two things.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.260
OK, this, you have memorized.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.260
And you can see very
easily that from these two,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.840
you can obtain the
equation we said before.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:49.380
Because, for example, you can
write cosine alpha plus beta,

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:54.150
plus minus beta equals cosine
alpha cosine beta minus

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.660
plus sine alpha sine beta.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.150
OK, so if you add
the term with a plus,

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.650
and the term with a minus.

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:06.120
The sine terms evaporate, and
you end up with the identity

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.120
that they had before.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.600
So this is my mnemonic
for remembering this one.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.530
We will not have to do this
too often because last time,

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.170
if you remember, we
introduced phasors.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.430
We introduced a complex
notation for waves,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.800
so we don't have to deal with
this trigonometry very often.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.353
In this case,
there's no way out.

00:25:24.353 --> 00:25:25.770
Well, actually,
there's a way out,

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.700
but it is simpler
to do it this way.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:36.030
So now, I have
basically a equals kz

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.090
minus omega t plus phi.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:43.960
b equals plus omega t plus phi.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.290
So if you apply my
formula here, you

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.710
will find that the
wave actually--

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.870
OK, the amplitude is the same.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.830
I pick up a factor of two.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.960
So it is two.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.850
And then I have the
cosine of the sum.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.350
So if I sum the two, the
time term will disappear.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.880
So we'll have cosine.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.470
Well, you get twice of it,
but there's a factor of two

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.700
here, so they cancel.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.530
It'll be cosine kz plus phi.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.890
And if I subtract the
two, then naturally,

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.940
the spatial terms and
the phase will disappear.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.080
And I will get the
cosine omega t.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.737
OK, now do I believe Matlab?

00:26:27.737 --> 00:26:29.820
I think I should believe
Matlab, because let's see

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.400
what Matlab saw.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.270
Here, time is frozen.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.220
So you'll see
basically the same term

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.810
where this has been replaced by
constant, because I froze time.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:44.370
So in there, this looks like a
sinusoid of the same frequency

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.170
as we had before.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.900
And actually, of course, you
have no way of knowing that.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.570
But the waves that I
entered had an amplitude

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.830
that was half of this.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.800
So basically, the
factor of two was also

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.325
reproduced by my simulation.

00:26:56.325 --> 00:26:57.930
OK, and if I play
the movie again,

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.750
it is basically like
unfreezing time.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.360
OK, so here, I
have unfrozen time.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.220
And you see that I get
a sinusoidal variation

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.760
in the time domain.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.480
So therefore, that's my
term cosine omega t here.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.680
So basically, the Matlab
simulation is correct.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.690
So we're very happy.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.910
OK.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.960
So now, let me come
to your question.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.690
What happens to the
wave when it vanishes?

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.315
First of all, it
doesn't really vanish.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.373
I don't know how to go back.

00:27:44.563 --> 00:27:45.980
So it does look
like at some point

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.388
the wave vanishes,
and then it reappears.

00:27:49.388 --> 00:27:51.430
OK, it is a little bit
annoying that it vanishes.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.130
But in electromagnetic
waves, and usually

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.380
in other kinds of
waves, we don't worry

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.465
about instantaneous energy.

00:27:58.465 --> 00:28:01.000
We worry about the
average energy.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.130
So what you can see here is that
the average energy is actually

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:06.640
conserved.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.600
Because as the wave oscillates
from a maximum to a minimum,

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.250
it's average energy
remains the same.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.010
Now, you might ask, well,
what happens in between?

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:24.055
I mean, what happens when
this wave has gone to zero?

00:28:24.055 --> 00:28:26.430
Again, I will [INAUDIBLE]
kinds of electromagnetic waves.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.610
What you have done here
is you have basically

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:39.110
launched two waves that are
moving in opposite directions.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.530
So who is providing the energy?

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.560
Well, if you are providing
the energy on one end,

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.100
and someone else is providing
the energy on the other end.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.840
What happens when
the two waves cancel

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.230
is that the energy
is actually stored

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.870
in another place, which does
not show up in this equation.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.690
That's one way to
think about it.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.193
So if you remember
when I saw-- actually,

00:29:12.193 --> 00:29:13.860
you don't remember,
because you were not

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.020
in the class one week ago.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.450
But I showed an example of a
simple harmonic oscillator.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:24.090
So simple harmonic oscillator
goes from zero velocity

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:31.660
maximum potential energy to the
edge, where the velocity now

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.160
is--

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.490
I'm sorry, to the rest position,
where the velocity's maximum

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.670
and the potential
energy has become zero

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:39.780
at the rest position.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.430
So it's the same kind of thing.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:42.908
The kinetic energy disappears.

00:29:42.908 --> 00:29:43.950
Well, what happens to it?

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:45.500
It has become potential.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.130
So it is very similar to this.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.380
The energy has become
potential energy,

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.730
and you don't see it here.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.010
AUDIENCE: OK, maybe a
follow up on the question.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.950
So now, let's
assume the two wave

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.610
are traveling along
the same direction,

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.470
and they are out of phase by pi.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.950
In this case, they'd be a
perfect cancelling each other.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.510
So where does the energy go?

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.300
Just for your information,
the previous answer, again.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.180
Such thing will not
happen in the first place,

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.410
but just not comfortable
with this answer.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.962
So I would like to
know your comments.

00:30:17.962 --> 00:30:19.670
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
[INAUDIBLE] the wave

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.690
start at the pi phase shift.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:28.240
It's equivalent to not having
launched any wave at all.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.750
Whoever launched the
two waves basically

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.730
canceled his own action.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:40.110
So if you think about it
physically, what happened?

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.910
First of all, have the two
waves been launched at infinity,

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:44.870
or at the finite time?

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.930
AUDIENCE: So for the [INAUDIBLE]
have, and as that equal zero.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:55.360
And this wave traveling
to the positive direction

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.850
and continuously.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.530
Now, I'm not sure another wave
added them [INAUDIBLE] that

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:01.880
equals minus 10.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.040
But this show is that
we've only lasted

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.390
for three period for the input.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:10.100
So as we are traveling
into a positive direction,

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.890
it is going to cancel three
periods out the previous wave,

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:13.390
right?

00:31:15.942 --> 00:31:18.400
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Now you're
making it a little bit more

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:18.940
complicated.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.990
Because what happens to
the edges of the wave?

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:25.150
Are you multiplying
by a boxcar function?

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.020
What happens later?

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.090
You're not given
enough information

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.920
to answer the question.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.650
Because then we had three
periods cancel, but then

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.700
what happens later?

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.960
Did you just stop the wave?

00:31:48.287 --> 00:31:49.870
AUDIENCE: I'm still
not so sure, yeah.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.480
That's why I check.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.370
Yeah, thanks.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:53.690
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: The
question's a bit ill defined,

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.960
I guess.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.920
So I can not answer it.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.420
But I can tell you this.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.510
Suppose that I launch a
wave at some time, and then

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:07.250
a certain time later,
I launch the same wave

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.943
with biphasic trait.

00:32:09.943 --> 00:32:12.110
So there's no doubt that
the two waves at this point

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.050
will cancel.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.660
So what happened to the energy?

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.320
Well, it is equivalent to
thinking that I did not really

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.460
launch a second wave
with a pi phase shift.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.423
But I actually
turned off the swings

00:32:27.423 --> 00:32:29.590
that was producing my first
wave in the first place.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.090
There might be a tangent
or something like that,

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.020
but in fact, I've just
canceled the wave.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.630
So simply stop the
flow of energy.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.590
Everybody happy
with this answer,

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.440
or should we discuss this?

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.755
And I think to realize that
actually this is interesting,

00:33:07.755 --> 00:33:10.050
that we brought up energy.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.960
In the standing wave, the energy
is actually not going anywhere.

00:33:18.315 --> 00:33:19.940
Well, that's one way
to think about it.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.230
It's not going anywhere.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:22.730
Or you can think
about it in the way

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.397
that the energy is
going back and forth.

00:33:42.273 --> 00:33:43.440
I did not realize, actually.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.965
I did not the phasors
last time, did I?

00:33:46.965 --> 00:33:47.465
Did I?

00:33:47.465 --> 00:33:48.455
I guess I didn't.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.460
So I guess I pulled a fast one.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.250
A few minutes ago, I was
talking about the difficulty

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.710
of trigonometry.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.240
And I said that's why I
introduced phasors last time.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.230
I was mistaken.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.929
I had not introduced
any phasors last time.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:13.835
I'm introducing phasors now.

00:34:13.835 --> 00:34:16.210
And the reason, of course,
that we're introducing phasors

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.690
is because we don't
want to have to remember

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:22.810
complicated identities
like this one.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.159
By the way, another
point that I would

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:32.429
like to bring up before
I move on to phasors

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:37.110
is that the wave
that I'm showing here

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.199
is actually very different
than the traveling wave that

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.822
led us to the wave equation.

00:34:42.822 --> 00:34:43.780
You'll agree with that.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.360
That looks very
different, both in the way

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.650
it behaves with time
and space, and the way

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.639
it looks like an equation.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:56.600
Yet, it still originated
from the same wave equation.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.190
So this is actually the power of
partial differential equations

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.870
and superposition.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:05.770
That I took two solutions
with my partial differential

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.005
equation that were not
particularly interesting,

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:10.560
I superimposed them, and
then all of a sudden,

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.390
I created another
solution, which

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.180
is still a very valid wave,
but we have totally different.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.040
It is a stationary wave.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.230
It has this oscillation,
and so on and so forth.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.150
So that is why we bother to
write this partial differential

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.840
equation, because it
allows us to generate

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.117
a much richer set
of waves that are,

00:35:33.117 --> 00:35:34.700
of course, very
important in practice.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.382
Standing waves
happen all the time.

00:35:38.382 --> 00:35:39.715
OK, so now, let's go to phasors.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:49.750
OK, so just like before,
I wrote two waves

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.667
that were propagating
in opposite directions.

00:35:52.667 --> 00:35:54.250
Now, what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:59.110
to write two waves that are
phase shifted by pi over two.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:05.465
So one of them is cosine
kz minus omega t plus phi.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.920
And the other is
phase shifted by pi

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.550
over 2, which means instead
of a cosine, it is a sine.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:26.570
OK, both are valid solutions
to the wave equation

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.410
with different
initial conditions,

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.830
but that doesn't bother us.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:32.300
They're still valid solutions.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.955
Therefore, their superposition
is also a solution.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.610
And I said before that when
you do a linear superposition,

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:45.440
you can also multiply the
waves by arbitrary constants.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.210
I said this a little
bit fast, but I hope

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.670
that remember that I said it.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.250
In fact, in this class, we
have evidence of what I said

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.320
and what I did not say.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.590
Then go back to the video and
see if I said it, and I did.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.820
So I will pick a very
particular constant,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.890
which may sound like a crazy
choice, but I will pick it.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:07.690
And that is the imaginary
constant, i, also known

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:12.900
as one of the two
square root of minus 1.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.360
OK, what is this now?

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.580
So the first confession
that I will make

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.210
is that it is not
physical anymore.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:23.280
There's no such thing
as a complex wave.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.290
The waves that we see
around us are real.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.290
They can be measured
by instruments,

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:32.030
such as oscilloscope, scanners,
I don't know what else.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.110
They're real.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.410
As far as I know, nobody has
ever measured anything complex.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:41.190
However, what I'm doing here
is mathematically correct,

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.560
even if it has no
physical meaning.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.040
And as it turns out, it
provides a huge mathematical

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.090
convenience.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:52.380
So I'm justified in doing it
as long as I remember what

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.450
is the physics that is behind.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.040
And the physics
that is behind it

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.240
is that every time I
see a wave like this,

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.490
I have to remember that
the physical quantity is

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:04.720
the real part.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.700
So the physical wave--

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.480
the one that I can
actually measure, observe,

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.170
generate with natural means--

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:17.550
is the real part.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.890
The imaginary part is
something that I added

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:23.190
for mathematical convenience.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.520
And it isn't reality because
I forget whose formula.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.840
It is called the De Moivre.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.760
Anyway, one of those.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.000
D-E?

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:44.620
Moivre, yeah.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.100
AUDIENCE: De Moivre.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.642
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
De Moivre, yeah.

00:38:46.642 --> 00:38:48.520
OK, I got it right.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.430
So De Moivre, then, if
I remember correctly,

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.430
that's how you spell it.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:03.180
De Moivre says that this thing
here is a complex exponential.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:14.060
So that's very nice
because for example,

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:18.660
if you have to multiply two
cosines, it's a big pain.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.660
You have to remember the trig
to multiply two exponential.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.340
It is trivial.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.850
You just add their phases,
I mean, their exponents.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:31.960
So a lot of inconveniences
to be to be expected.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.940
So this representation, it
comes with different names,

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.090
which are sometimes
used confusingly

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:41.460
in an interchangeable way.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:45.240
So some people call
this a phasor notation.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.760
I prefer to call this the
complex representation

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.820
of the wave.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.170
It becomes a phasor
when we drop--

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.060
I'm going to do
something nasty here.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.400
OK, remember that I can
write this as a project.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:03.540
So I can write this as e to the
ikz, e to the minus i omega t,

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.020
e to the i phi.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.840
OK.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.660
If you recall during the
beginnings of the class,

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:18.820
we saw that the wavelength
in the middle changes.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.896
But there is a property of
the wave that does not change.

00:40:22.896 --> 00:40:24.550
And that property,
if you recall,

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:28.200
is the temporal
frequency, omega, or nu,

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.580
which are related by two pi.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.280
That is true in linear media.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.500
Of course, there is
a class of optics

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.390
called non-linear, where
actually, the frequency can

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.890
change.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:42.890
It can double, or it can
half, or [INAUDIBLE] of things

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:43.655
can happen to it.

00:40:43.655 --> 00:40:46.280
But in this class, we don't deal
with these complicated things.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.620
We just deal with linear optics.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.260
So in linear optics,
the temporal frequency

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.730
of the light, no matter
what happens to the light.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.050
If it goes through
glass and reflects,

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:58.220
and all kinds of things.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.690
The temporal frequency
remains the same.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:04.970
So when we deal with optical
waves of a single frequency--

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:10.340
that is the quality's fixed
and the medium is linear--

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.860
then this term is
actually superfluous.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.880
We don't have to remind
ourselves that the light goes

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.920
like e to the minus omega t.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.410
It does, but we don't
have to write it.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:25.010
Because if we keep writing
it, it clutters our equations.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.510
So we simply drop it.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:30.590
We drop it.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:31.770
Very important to remember.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:33.830
We are allowed to
drop it if we know

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:37.340
that we have a single color in
our system, a single frequency.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.780
If there is multiple
frequencies,

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.040
we can not do that anymore.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.790
Because then these frequencies
have to adapt in a certain way,

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.000
and you have to keep track
of their additive phases.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.880
So we can only drop
this term if we--

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.570
two conditions.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.820
If we know that we
have a linear medium,

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:57.530
and a single frequency light
propagating in that medium.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:03.090
So in my terminology, at
least, after we drop this term,

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:04.740
then it becomes a phasor.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.750
So what is left?

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.830
e to the ikz plus 5.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.450
That, I call a phasor.

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:12.040
And you notice
what happened there

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.990
is I only left the spatial
dependency of the wave

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.800
plus the phase delay.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.220
The temporal variation is--

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:21.760
it's hidden.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.450
It is not gone.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.710
It is just hidden.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:29.440
OK, now let's see
this in action.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.860
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to rederive the standing

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.750
wave, but using the phasor.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.970
So you can see how nice
and simple it comes out,

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.260
and we don't have
to agonize over it.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:43.380
But before I do it, I actually
have to solve a little problem.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.970
And the problem is that I
did this very nice derivation

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:49.630
for the phasor of the
forward propagating wave.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:54.940
What about the phasor for the
backward propagating wave?

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.530
The backward propagating wave
will be something of this sort.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.110
So this will always
forward, right?

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.788
Let me write the backward.

00:43:08.788 --> 00:43:10.830
I think I have enough
space here, so I can do it.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.240
OK, so the backward
would be something

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:26.770
of the sort of the form
of cosine, az plus omega t

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.303
plus phi.

00:43:29.303 --> 00:43:30.470
And it is very inconvenient.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.960
Because the way I
got the phasor is

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:38.980
I got rid of a term of the
forward to the minus omega t.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:44.200
If I add the
imaginary part here,

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.000
I don't have a term e to the
minus omega t, so I'm stuck.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.850
But I can do some
mathematical trickery.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.138
Now, this is pure
trickery, but it works.

00:43:55.138 --> 00:43:56.430
The trick, it is the following.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:00.270
We know that the cosine
is an even function.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.360
So this is actually identical.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.200
I can replace it,
in other words,

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.080
with the cosine of
the negative element.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.440
No harm done.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.210
It is still a backward
propagating wave.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.140
Nothing has changed.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:20.290
It is the same equation.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:24.540
Now, according to my good
principle here, I add.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.310
That is not the same as before.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:37.430
Because the sign
is an odd function.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.180
But this is a
non-physical term, anyway.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.222
I just put it there for
mathematical convenience,

00:44:41.222 --> 00:44:42.910
so I don't particularly care.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.320
I'm very happy,
because the real part

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.250
is the same as I started with.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.870
What the imaginary part does--

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.660
as long as it's
mathematically convenient,

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.360
I couldn't care less.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.780
OK, so that gives me the
license to write this.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:02.890
Now, this, of course,
equals e to the minus

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:09.440
ikz minus omega t minus phi.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.780
Now very happy, because
I did get a term e

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:16.700
to the minus i omega t in the
phase of this exponential.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.490
And therefore, I can drop
it to produce my phasor.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.400
So the last one, then,
is that the phasor

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:29.960
for the backward wave is e
to the minus ikz minus i phi.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.720
In other words, if I give you
a forward propagating wave,

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.475
and you compute its phasor.

00:45:34.475 --> 00:45:37.100
And then I asked you, well, what
is the phasor for the backward

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.630
propagating wave?

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:41.000
Well, all you do is you flip
the sign and the exponent.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.730
Whoa.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:49.870
Where did this come from?

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:55.790
I think this is an old paper
from some previous lecture.

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.820
But anyway, ignore this.

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:04.750
I have to remember to ask
for a new paper next time.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:06.330
OK, so what I will do now.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.470
Let me reproduce
the standing wave.

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:12.930
So the standing wave is
using the phasors now.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:17.460
It's e to the ikz plus phi.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:24.630
That is the forward wave, plus
e to the minus ikz minus i phi.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.215
That is the backward wave.

00:46:32.215 --> 00:46:33.090
Can I deal with that?

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:33.923
Well, yes, actually.

00:46:33.923 --> 00:46:36.350
Because, again, De Moivre
says that if you add

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.240
two exponential of this form--

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.660
notice they have the same
phase within a minus sign--

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:47.980
I will simply get two
i's cosine az plus phi.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:53.960
So I've got my thing here.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.900
Not quite, though,
because the standing wave.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.960
It had the cosine omega t term.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.460
What happened to
the cosine omega t?

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:06.940
Oh, come on.

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:07.710
OK.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:09.600
What happened to
the cosine omega t?

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:15.943
Well, remember, we neglected
an e to the minus omega t.

00:47:15.943 --> 00:47:17.110
We didn't really neglect it.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:18.985
We hit it, because we
didn't want to carry it

00:47:18.985 --> 00:47:21.660
when we write the equation.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:26.580
First of all, if I don't care
about the temporal variation,

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.470
I don't really have
to do anything.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:29.350
I'm done.

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.070
But if I want to put a
temporal variation back in,

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:36.030
what I have to do is I have
to put back what I took

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:37.510
when it did not belong to me.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:43.520
And what did not belong to me is
this e to the minus i omega t.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.970
OK, I put it back.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.770
Now, that is still
not a physical wave

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:47.910
because it is complex.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:52.270
How can I find the
actual, physical wave?

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.030
Well, I have to
take its real part.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.870
And the real part is easy here,
because the only complex thing

00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:59.350
is this exponential.

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:07.230
So if I take the real part
of this, of all of this now.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:13.930
It would simply be 2 cosine
kz plus phi cosine omega t.

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:14.730
And I'm done.

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:16.670
I've actually produced
my standing wave.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.231
Any questions?

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.540
We're almost done here.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.400
So I have about three minutes.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.730
So I think I'll use them
to finish up this lecture,

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:48.480
so we can move on to
bigger and better things.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.160
The question that I wrote before
is the one dimensional wave

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:51.660
equation.

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.930
Because the waves
that I've written.

00:48:54.930 --> 00:49:00.140
They can only go down
one spatial axis, z.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.780
The more generalized,
of course, situation

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.820
is three dimensional waves.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.880
And what you see here
is the generalized three

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.280
dimensional wave equation,
which, of course,

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.240
I will not derive.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.070
But it can be pretty
easily derived

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:17.230
using the same arguments
that we did before,

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:20.850
except you have to generalize
in the third dimension.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:22.800
And this produces
things that we've

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.200
seen before in
geometrical optics,

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.540
for example, the plain wave.

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.615
Except now, you see
the wave description,

00:49:29.615 --> 00:49:36.530
it is you have alternating
positive and negative--

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.360
how do you call those--
peaks and troughs,

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.010
which are propagating
along an arbitrary angle.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:45.900
Now, they can go in
any angle in 3D space.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.510
So you just see a
cross-section here.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:53.730
Or you can have a spherical
wave, which we saw it before.

00:49:53.730 --> 00:50:00.075
It starts at a given point,
and then radiates outwards.

00:50:00.075 --> 00:50:01.200
So that's a spherical wave.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.740
Well, we're not
quite finished, yet.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.670
But I think we're
almost out of time.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:13.220
So I think I'll stop
here, and we can still

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.090
continue next time.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.940
Are there any questions?

00:50:25.258 --> 00:50:26.800
There's no homework
due on Wednesday,

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.088
so what I would like
to-- you have a question?

00:50:29.088 --> 00:50:30.130
Yeah, there's a question.

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:30.630
Go ahead.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.380
AUDIENCE: How is
the wave equation

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.300
intuitively different from
simple harmonic oscillator?

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:48.200
The variation in space depends
on the relation in time.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.060
So that's coupling?

00:50:51.697 --> 00:50:54.280
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah, the
mathematical answer, of course,

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:54.580
is very easy.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.038
They're simply
harmonic oscillators

00:50:56.038 --> 00:50:57.703
in an ordinary
differential equation.

00:50:57.703 --> 00:50:59.370
This is a partial
differential equation.

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:02.770
But let me think how to
formulate a physical answer.

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:07.950
OK, so the physical answer is
that the harmonic oscillator

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:13.960
is a singly particle
whose position you

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.300
track as a function of time.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:21.690
A wave is a distributed
physical system.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:23.730
So you can think of a wave--

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:25.410
in this case, for example.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:27.180
You can interpret
the physical meaning

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:31.590
of these black and white stripes
as particles which are moving.

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:34.920
For example, the particle
that is on the white stripe

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.120
is moving up.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.940
The particle in the black
stripe is moving down.

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:41.940
If I play the wave
again, what you

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.970
will see that the particles
are kind of executing

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:46.680
a coordinated motion.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.140
Because you have particles that
were down, then they go up,

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.480
and then they go down again.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.120
But they go out in
a coordinated motion

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.040
throughout the entire plane.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:56.750
How do they know?

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:59.000
Well, there is a physical
system associated with this.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.330
For example, this could be a
membrane with the sound wave

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:03.910
propagating on it.

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:06.240
And now the reason that
particles are connected,

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.550
that they execute a
coordinated motion

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:10.950
is because of the
interatomic forces

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:13.320
between the membrane particles.

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.180
If it is an
electromagnetic wave,

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:19.050
then it is a field
that is distributed.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.210
And, of course, it
knows to be connected

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:23.060
because of Maxim's equations.

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.350
There's things like charge
conservation and so on that

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:27.880
force it to act this way.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.790
So a wave is actually
a distributed system,

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:37.230
where the physics force
an extended systems--

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:40.470
particles, or fields, or
whatever the case may be--

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.878
to execute a coordinated motion.

00:52:42.878 --> 00:52:45.420
That's the difference between
that simple harmonic oscillator

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:46.795
where you just
have one particle.

00:52:46.795 --> 00:52:48.378
Now, you can go from
one to the other.

00:52:48.378 --> 00:52:50.370
Imagine you take a single
harmonic oscillator.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:51.120
That's a good one.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.280
So let me draw it here.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.730
Wow, we're actually going
backwards now in the knowledge

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:57.900
that they used in the past.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.640
So you take a simple
harmonic oscillator.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.950
Here it is, a pendulum.

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:05.550
This is a simple
harmonic oscillator.

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:07.742
Then you couple it with
a separate pendulum.

00:53:07.742 --> 00:53:08.700
And how do you couple--

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.117
they're not coupled
at the moment,

00:53:10.117 --> 00:53:12.540
but you can couple
them, for example,

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.110
by connecting the
spring in between.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.520
But that's not quite a wave.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.590
But you can see now that
because I coupled them,

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:22.110
if I kick one of
these, it will also

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:25.560
cause the other one to move,
so they become coordinated.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.830
Well, now, let me generalize.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:32.080
Imagine that I have a bunch
of harmonic oscillators.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.780
And, in fact, I can make them
infinite, and I couple them.

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:38.470
Now, in fact, the system will
become wave like, in the sense

00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:42.440
that if you kick it at one end.

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.810
Let's say not at infinity.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.550
Let's say it starts
actually here,

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:46.950
and then it goes to infinity.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.960
So if you kick it at one
end, then the disturbance

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.810
will actually propagate
very similar to a wave.

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.560
It's a discrete wave,
but it's still a wave.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:59.800
So you can go from one to
the other by introducing kind

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.110
of a coordination mechanism.

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:04.044
So it is the coupling here
that does the coordination.

00:54:11.927 --> 00:54:12.760
Any other questions?

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.570
We can stay here, actually.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:15.653
Nobody claims the classrooms
either here or there.

00:54:15.653 --> 00:54:17.590
So if you have more
questions, I'll

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:19.180
be happy to stay
and answer them.

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:32.750
But about the
phasors, is it clear?

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:35.960
When I was your age,
when I was a student,

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.460
I was also very
upset by phasors.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:40.740
Because they look very much
like mathematical trickery.

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.748
I mean, I'm trying to find my--

00:54:43.748 --> 00:54:46.040
I guess that's one benefit
of this over the whiteboard,

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.190
that I have a history
of what I did.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.910
But yeah.

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:50.410
But the phasors,
they look very much

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:51.740
like mathematical trickery.

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:56.280
I mean, this looks like
someone pulled it out of a hat.

00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:00.200
But the only reason to
justify it in your mind

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.908
is that it provides huge
mathematical convenience.

00:55:03.908 --> 00:55:05.450
Now, this looks like
a trivial thing.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:07.400
I mean, the derivation
of the standing wave

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.670
was maybe four lines with
trigonometry, two lines

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:13.020
with the complex exponential.

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.220
So OK, why mess with
complex numbers?

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.530
Well, try superposition.

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:23.490
If you have several
waves superimposed,

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:26.030
or if you have an
integral, a continuum

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:28.940
of superimposed waves,
which we will see very soon.

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:30.720
Like Fourier
transforms and so on.

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.010
Fourier transforms are extremely
inconvenient if you write them

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:35.960
as cosine transforms.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.060
Big mess.

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.200
If you write them as
complex exponentials,

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.370
it's actually very
simple to do the math.

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:50.930
It is a very, very time
saving tool, basically.

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:53.270
Strangely enough, it
leads to some insights

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:55.180
that real numbers
do not give you.

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:58.010
So that's an
additional convenience.

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.120
We will appreciate that later.

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.690
For now, it is simply the
mathematical convenience

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:06.155
that drives this
mathematical wizardry.

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:14.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:16.830
You're saying [INAUDIBLE]
angular frequency

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:21.850
and the temporal frequency are
different, or it's the same?

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:27.342
Because you initially defined
omega as angular frequency.

00:56:27.342 --> 00:56:29.550
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I
confuse those myself, usually,

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:30.570
the terms.

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:31.530
Usually nu.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:39.620
Usually nu is called
the frequency.

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:43.120
And it is measured in hertz.

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:49.290
2 pi nu is measured
in radians per second.

00:56:52.313 --> 00:56:53.480
Angular frequency, isn't it?

00:56:57.336 --> 00:56:57.836
Yeah.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.013
As opposed to what else?

00:57:10.013 --> 00:57:11.680
I guess I don't
understand the question.

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:28.190
Yeah, what I mean is
that, for example,

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:29.890
take the propagating wave.

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:39.955
The propagating
wave is e to the i--

00:57:39.955 --> 00:57:44.230
let's say forward--
kz minus omega t.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:52.490
The standing wave is cosine
kz e to the minus i omega t.

00:57:56.127 --> 00:57:58.460
I'll step ahead a little bit,
and write something awful.

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:32.230
This is actually a wave.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:35.390
What we'll see is called
a diffraction integral.

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:37.870
And you can see it is nothing--

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:39.850
even though it looks
really complicated,

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:41.170
it is just a superposition.

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:43.000
Because the integral
is a summation.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.250
And then what I have
here is a phasor,

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:47.560
and I put a lot of
these phasors together.

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.970
What they all share is this
term, e to the i minus I

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:52.480
omega t.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:57.147
Actually, to be
strictly correct,

00:58:57.147 --> 00:58:58.480
I should really carry this term.

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.220
I'm not really
allowed to drop it.

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.040
But because it is
the same always,

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.440
I might as well just
as well not write it.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.903
So it basically
saves me writing.

00:59:08.903 --> 00:59:10.570
And also confusion,
because as you know,

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:12.320
the more things you
write, the more likely

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.350
you are to make mistakes.

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:17.710
It is typical in
these derivations.

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:19.960
If you don't need
something, you drop it.

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.578
Because if you start carrying
it around, it involves mistakes.

00:59:23.578 --> 00:59:25.120
So that's why I
would drop this term.

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:34.790
So I can just as well say that
if I have a propagating wave,

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.290
I can just write
it as e to the ikz.

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:39.290
That's a propagating wave.

00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:40.400
I have a standing wave.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.800
I can just as well
write it cosine kz.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:47.140
OK, the e to the i minus i
omega t is implicit, right?

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.640
If I have this
diffraction integral,

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.987
I can just write it
without this term.

00:59:51.987 --> 00:59:53.320
But again, the term is implicit.

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.640
If I have to figure out what
is the temporal variation

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.450
of the wave, I have
to put it back in.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:04.290
And again, I cannot do it if
I have two waves of different

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:04.810
frequencies.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:09.110
If I have e to the i omega.

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.300
Let me write another
superposition. e

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:16.850
to the i k1 z minus
omega one t, plus e

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:22.230
to the i k2 z minus omega 2t.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:25.440
That's still a valid
superposition, right?

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:31.740
Provided that the ratios
of these, k1 over omega 1

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.220
equals c.

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.600
k2 over omega 2 equal c.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.950
Still a valid superposition.

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:39.100
I'm not violating anything.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.770
But I cannot do the
phasor trick anymore.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:45.480
I have to keep the e
to the i omega times,

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.200
or I will make a mistake.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.630
There's one more
case when if you

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:52.215
produce any kind
of nonlinearity,

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:55.650
where well we'll see later.

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:58.930
And again, we're going
a little bit ahead.

01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:01.360
I'm in trouble.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.840
These are from the quiz.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.060
We'll a little bit later.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:10.220
When we try to compute the
flux of electromagnetic energy,

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.630
there's something called
the pointing vector, which

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:19.810
is defined as the electric field
cross with the magnetic field.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:22.690
If you tried to write the
expression for the pointing

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:28.200
vector, you cannot just multiply
the phasors of the electric

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.310
and the magnetic field,
because it's a product.

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:34.330
So you can use phasors only
when you have linear operations,

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:36.660
such as addition or integrals.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.660
In this case, you can't.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.202
We will see what
you do in this case.

01:01:39.202 --> 01:01:42.620
You do a temporal average.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.090
There's a few
cases where one has

01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:48.510
to be careful with this phasor.

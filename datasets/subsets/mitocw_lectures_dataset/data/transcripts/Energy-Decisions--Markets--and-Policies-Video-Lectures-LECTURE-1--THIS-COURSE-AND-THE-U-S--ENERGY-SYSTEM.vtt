00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.240
PROFESSOR: Let's start.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.020
What's energy?

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.770
This being a Sloan
class, we do cold calls.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.380
So I walk up to Eric
and I say, how should we

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.150
define energy for this class?

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.710
AUDIENCE: I would define
energy as currency.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.200
I think it's the
price [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.460
PROFESSOR: Currency.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.480
So we should be doing
monetary economics, as opposed

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.070
to thinking about
electric power and stuff.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.390
AUDIENCE: Well, I guess I
shared my personal view.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.280
As an engineer, I
see energy going

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.063
into everything we manufacture.

00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:07.480
PROFESSOR: But if
it's just money,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.430
then there's nothing
special about this class.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.320
We could just do plain
old price theory,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.700
or we could just
plain old micro,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.120
or we could do plain monetary.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.180
AUDIENCE: Like I can't print
infinite amounts of energy.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.080
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.550
Let's see if everybody agrees.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.290
Julian, where are you on this?

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.850
How would you define energy?

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.470
AUDIENCE: The
ability to do work.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.390
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.760
We're now into basic physics.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.930
Even I remember that.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.770
I am an alumnus.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.650
Perhaps we could be a
little less abstract.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.360
What are some
interesting examples

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.267
that fit under that
very broad 801 heading?

00:01:45.267 --> 00:01:47.100
AUDIENCE: Oh, under
that very broad heading,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.780
I mean, we use energy for a
very broad variety of uses,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.560
from keeping the lights on,
transportation, manufacturing.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.235
It's really kind of integrated
in everything we make or do,

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:04.250
from an economics or
engineering standpoint.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.790
It supports all of
our communications.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.000
Like without energy, or at
least electrical energy,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.160
and petroleum energy, we would
really kind of be nowhere.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.030
PROFESSOR: But we'll probably
exclude the ability to do work

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.940
that you have just personally.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.720
And we'll probably exclude
some forms of energy

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.300
that don't do useful work.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.920
But what you're
saying is there's

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.130
a wide variety of sources
and a wide variety of uses.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.463
That's true.

00:02:35.463 --> 00:02:37.130
But you could probably,
as you just did,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.580
name the principal ones.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.840
Let me ask Sam.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.377
Why are you
interested in energy?

00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:44.960
AUDIENCE: One of the
things I'm really

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.845
interested in new sources
of energy, renewable sources

00:02:47.845 --> 00:02:50.380
and moving away
from fossil fuels.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.528
That's part of the reason
I'm doing [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:52.528 --> 00:02:53.570
PROFESSOR: Step one back.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.310
Why are you interested in that?

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.850
AUDIENCE: I think one of the
main problems we have right now

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.557
with international relations is
sources of oil and petroleum.

00:03:05.557 --> 00:03:07.640
PROFESSOR: So you're
interested in energy security

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.990
kinds of questions.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.680
OK.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.365
Yeah.

00:03:10.365 --> 00:03:12.740
AUDIENCE: Developing nations
that haven't yet [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.700
to their grids.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.486
[INAUDIBLE] newer
sources of energy

00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:20.647
versus old traditional
sources that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:22.730
PROFESSOR: So can you think
about some-- can there

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.310
be some sort of leapfrogging
strategy the way

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.280
developing countries have
bypassed wireline telephones

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.640
and jumped to mobile.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.785
Is there something
like that in energy?

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:34.910
Yeah, we're going to do
less on developed countries

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.450
than I'd like.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.908
But we will do
some, because that's

00:03:36.908 --> 00:03:38.570
a very interesting question.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.320
OK.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.200
A variety of interests.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.550
We had a couple of definitions
of the energy problem.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.930
I'm sorry for the US
focus, but we will broaden.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.230
We had a couple of
definitions of energy problem

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.720
in those answers.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.750
One has to do with the
possibility of running out.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.100
Sustainability.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.327
Another has to do
with environment.

00:04:05.327 --> 00:04:07.410
Are there any other aspects
to the energy problem?

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.980
And energy security,
international dependence.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.980
Are there any other aspects
to the energy problem?

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.487
That people have thought about.

00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:17.070
I mean, if there is
an energy problem.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.600
You hear about it all the time.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.220
Is there anything else?

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.330
Sarah?

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.080
AUDIENCE: Cost and
market efficiency.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.580
Because when you
don't have storage,

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.790
you have things
like wind power that

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.990
can cause a lot of
problems in the market.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.920
PROFESSOR: So there
are two things there.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.010
One is even if we don't run out,
it might get really expensive.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.430
So it's not a question
of, oh my God,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.780
this is the last drop of oil.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.170
It's, oh my God, this
drop of oil is $7,000.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.820
That's a different
kind of problem.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.340
Economists like the second part.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.320
Or think that the
world tends to get you

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.620
to the second kind, not the last
drop, but the expensive drop.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.540
And then the issue of
how do you actually

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.000
do renewables when
renewables don't

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.080
work like dispatchable power?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.580
OK.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.080
Those are energy problems.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.070
Why haven't they been solved?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.820
Yeah.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.950
That was-- either
you're waving for flies,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.940
or you're ready to go.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.930
AUDIENCE: So one of the
problems, like [INAUDIBLE],,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.110
people tend to focus usually
just on the supply side.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.540
But it's actually kind of
both supply and demand.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.560
And the US has one
of the highest demand

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.160
for energy in the entire world.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.910
So the country used to
be a major oil exporter,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.350
prior to World War II.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.030
And now really one of
the major oil importers.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.430
So a big problem
is it's actually

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.650
the mentality of the consumers
in the US, excessive spending,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.910
so on and so forth.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.250
PROFESSOR: Well, apart
from being terrible people,

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.710
which I give you.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.830
I mean, there are
a lot of, you know,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.150
it costs us money to
import all this oil.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.070
It's expensive.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.000
The price varies.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.190
I'll talk about
that a little bit.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.700
Why is this not a problem
that the markets--

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.458
why aren't some of
these problems problems

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:06.250
that markets solve?

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.590
AUDIENCE: I think that there
are huge barriers to entry,

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.583
because the cost of laying
down the infrastructure.

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.750
You talk about the power
distribution infrastructure

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.230
is immense, and it's
something that I

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.880
think only entities such as
the government can afford,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.790
because I don't think that
the private sector would

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.113
be capable of funding such
a huge research endeavor.

00:06:31.113 --> 00:06:32.530
PROFESSOR: Well,
except almost all

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.200
the US power grid is privately
funded and privately owned.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.050
Not all of it.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.460
But most of it.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.190
So we built it before.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.848
But you have a point.

00:06:40.848 --> 00:06:43.390
Where I would go with that, and
I'll spend some time on this,

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.460
is things move slowly in energy,
because of all the capital.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.820
Doesn't mean they don't
move, but they move slowly.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.870
In one presentation, we use the
analogy of turning a tanker.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.190
You can do it.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.690
It's not easy, and
it takes a while.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.000
Jackie, you had a thought.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.935
AUDIENCE: I think there's a
lack of consensus as to what

00:07:02.935 --> 00:07:05.830
should be done, because there's
such a wide variety of opinions

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.360
and interests at state,
political, economic, social

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.510
that there's no way to-- or
there hasn't been a way so far

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.080
to agree on something.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.330
PROFESSOR: So we could maybe--

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.220
two alternative ways
which we heard a lot

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.970
about in the recent past to
deal with the oil use problem

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.840
is drill baby drill,
or conservation.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.410
And you could imagine a world
in which you would do both,

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.940
but you're right.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.870
There's no particular consensus.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.640
Does there need to be
a consensus, though?

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.840
Think about food.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.760
There's no consensus on food.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.560
We don't have a food problem.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.270
But we eat a lot.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.180
And you know, we're leading
the obesity epidemic.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.660
I'm doing my part.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.690
But we don't have a
national food policy.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.710
I mean, we have a farm policy.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.080
But it's been in
place for a long time.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.270
It doesn't actually
do that much.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.850
So why do we need
an energy policy?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.350
AUDIENCE: I think
at the point where

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.000
we are in the energy problem
requires some major steps that

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.100
means government won't
necessarily-- government

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.505
or large businesses, or
some kind of large entity

00:08:11.505 --> 00:08:13.930
will have to be
involved in that.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.070
PROFESSOR: OK, you're worried
about scale questions.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.600
Since you posed the question,
you can answer the question.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.850
AUDIENCE: I think it's not
necessarily of corporations

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.270
not having money to
invest in energy projects.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.950
That's not really true.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.270
But the government is
necessary because most

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.990
of the very, very major energy
problems, the energy projects

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.299
will involve an investment
timeline that will

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.240
take 20, 30 years to play back.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.340
So as people who
run a corporation,

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.180
I mean, they don't have
personal interest necessarily

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.260
[INAUDIBLE],,
because the timeline

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.880
that they're going to be in
that corporation is so limited.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.645
So a big part of it is just
the structure of corporations

00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:55.520
doesn't really favor
that sort of investment.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.690
So the government needs to step
back and think about long term

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:59.620
interests.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.660
PROFESSOR: But we did
build the existing power

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.330
grid and all of the
existing infrastructure

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.310
with private money.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.740
So what's new now?

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.150
AUDIENCE: Well,
I think back then

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.930
also like corporations
tend to be run

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.980
much more by large families.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.010
So in that case, people
did have an interest

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.575
in how companies were
performing over the long run,

00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:22.450
because they're think
about my kids are going

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.800
to take over this company.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.180
And I think about how--

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.800
I mean, like a big part of how--

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.240
PROFESSOR: Well, I give
you that possibility.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.630
But in electric
power, it wasn't true.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.583
Thomas Edison set up
the first company.

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:34.750
It was not a family company.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.550
So electric power
doesn't fit it.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.890
Let me try another line.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:39.928
See what Andrea says.

00:09:39.928 --> 00:09:41.470
AUDIENCE: I was
going to mention also

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.860
that one issue with electricity,
for example, is that once it's

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.200
in the grid, you have no idea.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.450
You can differentiate
whether it comes

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.460
from coal or from nuclear
or whatever source.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.140
So that's an issue in pricing,
which may cause issue--

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.890
which may cause people
not to take initiative

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.040
from different sources to
solve a common problem, which

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.230
could be the grid, or
maybe something else.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.640
And another thing is
that, which is also true,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.450
though, with food, so I got
kind of perplexed with that,

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.290
is that it's an
international issue that

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.690
may involve many players.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.280
So it's hard to have
different countries agree

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.290
upon certain standards.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.970
As we've talked a
lot, we've heard a lot

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.760
about developing countries
versus developed and all that.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.250
PROFESSOR: So we're going--

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.000
let me pursue that a
little bit, because I

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.950
think it takes us down the road
I've been hoping to go down,

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.190
which is why do we
all need to agree?

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.830
We don't all have
common food standards.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.950
We don't all have agreement
on a lot of things.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.910
Why are many countries involved?

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.630
Why might Canada and the US
need to agree on certain things

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.160
related to energy?

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.290
AUDIENCE: Because,
I mean, some issues

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.530
that are coming to
my mind right now

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.630
are, firstly, that you
have the allocation

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.680
of the sources of energy
are given in the world.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.157
So you may have a region of
abundance in some resource,

00:11:08.157 --> 00:11:10.740
and not abundance in some other
resources, so you need to have

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.030
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.270
And the source where you have
them, as opposed to the source

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.230
where you use them
might not be the same.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.580
So then, again, you may have
to [INAUDIBLE] in those two

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.120
countries.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.690
Plus what you do here may
affect-- so if I pollute here,

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.180
it affects what
goes on in Canada.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.060
PROFESSOR: I heard
the magic word.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.970
If we pollute here,
it affects Canada.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:41.270
If we burn coal in Ohio, it
affects people around the power

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.310
plant, elsewhere.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.110
We talked about pollution.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.050
An awful lot of energy
policy is driven

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.280
by environmental concerns.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.460
You will recall
from basic economics

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:59.330
the notion of an externality,
that activity A done by--

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.710
entity A effect's entity
B outside the market.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.700
Climate change, local
pollution of various kinds

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.250
drives a lot of energy policy,
which is one reason why

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.930
people talk about renewables.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.470
Climate change is that issue
writ large, very large,

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.030
and we'll come back to that.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.310
The other way that
concept works is if you

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.500
think about energy security.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.850
So I don't have an SUV.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.940
But if I had an SUV,
I could drive my SUV,

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.200
burn all the gas I wanted.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.790
I would contribute
to oil imports.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.160
But guess what--
and that would make

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.900
us less secure as a country.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.410
But the effective on me of
that insecurity is trivial.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.640
There's an externality
there, it's argued.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.110
If you think about oil
imports as being undesirable,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.250
when I drive, it
affects imports.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.270
Doesn't affect me.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.950
Affects everybody
else in the room

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.120
because they live in a
country that imports more oil.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.170
So the arguments for a lot of
this stuff is externalities.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.980
That we're going to
spend some time on it.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.000
But the reason private-- the
basic reason private business

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.732
hasn't solved all of it--

00:13:03.732 --> 00:13:04.940
there are other problems too.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:10.070
But some of the core problems
are because the market doesn't

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.300
deal with externalities.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.520
That's sort of a definition.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.990
Market doesn't solve pollution.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.520
Market doesn't solve other
kinds of externalities.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.200
If you listen to the
State of the Union,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.492
I'm sure you found it riveting.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.920
The president called, as
he had in prior speeches,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.430
for a clean energy standard.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.980
And the way he had
done it earlier

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.890
was x percent of electricity
has to come from clean sources

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.830
by 2020 or 2030.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.380
Probably not a chance that
Congress will pass that.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.100
But the interesting question is
what might you mean by clean?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.270
And that's the only phrase
he used in the speech.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.330
What do you think
he meant by clean?

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.920
Think about all the ways you
can generate electricity.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.390
Which sources count as clean?

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.085
Yeah?

00:13:58.085 --> 00:14:00.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] definition
he means nuclear as clean.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.190
Not necessarily renewable,
but clean coal cycle,

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.530
and I guess more for the
environmental pollution.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.787
Not necessarily the
infrastructure that--

00:14:08.787 --> 00:14:10.370
PROFESSOR: No, he
means environmental.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.170
Exactly right.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.670
Not clear he means nuclear.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.190
A lot of people don't
think nuclear is clean.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.860
But renewables are clean.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.838
Any other thoughts?

00:14:20.838 --> 00:14:21.630
I don't know what--

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.350
I forget whether
he meant renewable.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.850
Yeah.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.308
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that when you

00:14:25.308 --> 00:14:27.660
don't release more CO2 in
the atmosphere, and then

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.230
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.420
PROFESSOR: What would that be?

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.350
AUDIENCE: Solar power.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.580
PROFESSOR: Solar power.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.720
Renewables in general.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.170
Yeah, I mean biomass
properly done can do that.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.160
It's a little tricky.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.830
There's a little
start-up problem.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.470
I mean, you cut down all
the trees and burn them.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.600
On its face, it's not
a great thing to do.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.100
But if you're
planting, you can keep

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.060
that sustainable after a while.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.500
He actually also meant
some uses of natural gas,

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.420
which get half credit.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.402
It's kind of complicated.

00:15:04.402 --> 00:15:06.860
So it's going to be raise or
lower the price of electricity

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.402
if we did it?

00:15:11.228 --> 00:15:12.270
AUDIENCE: Probably raise.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.980
PROFESSOR: Probably raise.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.840
Because if it was
going to lower it,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.300
you probably wouldn't need a
federal push to get it done,

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.290
right?

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.850
That the market can deal with.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.040
And I'm not quite sure
why I asked that question,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.940
because the obvious
answer is legislation.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.030
So we've fiddled and diddled
with a lot of these questions.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:37.320
And I want to answer
that question myself,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.240
because the question
is, why is there

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.230
a social science class in
the energy studies minor?

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.720
What in heaven's name
does social science

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.040
have to do with what's clean,
what are the reasons why

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.870
we have an energy problem,
what are our concerns,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.710
whether you achieve
that goal or not.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:03.280
I'm going to give you sort of
how those of us who thought up

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.950
this course think
about the energy system

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.170
from a social science
point of view.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.650
This may be my
best graphic ever.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.610
So most of what we talk about
when we talk about energy

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.030
are flows from things
like coal through, say,

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.850
electricity generation,
into the provision

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.050
of energy services like toasting
your toast in the morning.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.730
And an awful lot of
technology is in here is there

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.460
and how do you get primary
energy from the sun,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.700
from coal, from nuclear power,
whatever, how do you convert it

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.130
to something
useful, and then how

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.720
do you get services from it.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.000
And that's great stuff.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.630
I'll have something to say
about what's in that box.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.930
But that's not mainly just
to get systems straight,

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.400
as opposed to devices.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.640
That's not mainly what
we're going to talk about.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.140
We're going to talk about
what drives the flows.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.060
Well, there's a supply side.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.410
You find energy.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.520
You convert it.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.000
Some of that's
done by government.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.480
Some of it's done by
private enterprises.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.670
There's a demand
for energy services,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.810
mainly not for energy.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:14.920
Where does that come from?

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.430
How are those decisions made?

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.530
How are the supply
decisions made?

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.329
So if you think about
devices and systems in here,

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:25.030
what are in the higher
boxes are the decisions

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.650
about how they're operated,
how intensively they're used.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.840
Supply and demand interact--

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.550
too many arrows--
supply and demand

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.530
interact through markets.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.140
The markets, as well as the
decisions on both sides,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.640
affect what's in that technology
box and how it's used.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.800
Stepping back, there
are a whole lot

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.730
of things that I
think of as stocks.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:55.230
Things like reserves of
oil, existing buildings,

00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:00.930
infrastructure, cars, you could
add technologies, that underlie

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.205
the operation of the system.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.110
And that's the
underlay the operation.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.460
They too are shaped by decisions
on the supply and demand side.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.780
How much gasoline you use is
shaped by today's technology.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.860
It's also shaped by past
purchasing decisions of cars.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.900
How much do we use
to heat buildings

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.310
is shaped by the latest
fancy technology,

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.560
and the buildings that were
built a half a century ago.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.590
And what retrofit
possibilities there are.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.622
But that's fun.

00:18:33.622 --> 00:18:35.080
So we're going to
look at decisions

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.520
on the supply and demand side.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:43.830
But those decisions are
affected by regulation.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.340
And the markets are affected
by regulations and laws

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.590
of various kinds.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:57.680
Now, there's a natural tendency
to take those as given.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.040
To say, OK, what I need to know
to operate in this world is,

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.140
well, what are the
laws and regulations

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:08.410
that affect what we can
do in the energy sphere?

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.960
But if you want
to change things,

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.210
and I heard a number of you
wanting to change things,

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.310
that's not good
enough, because what

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.190
goes on in laws and
regulations affects

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.000
what gets done down here,
what's used to do what?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.790
To produce, to convert, to use.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.000
And affects the
kinds of decisions

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.520
that households, firms,
other kinds of organizations,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.050
universities make.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.230
So we're going to spend
a little time saying,

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.750
where do those come from?

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.730
What's the political
process look like?

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.920
Those political processes
are shaped, obviously,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.780
by firms and households
and other organizations.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.510
I will also say, we will--

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.240
so there's a little
political science there.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.990
There will also be a little bit
of organizational behavior here

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.330
and a little bit of
psychology there,

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:13.070
when we look at how these
decisions actually get made.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:20.580
So behind everything are
a set of norms and values

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:26.050
and traditions that really
shape the political context.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:31.152
You listen to any campaign
speech, you hear a lot of that.

00:20:31.152 --> 00:20:32.860
You don't necessarily
hear a lot of-- you

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.120
hear a lot of that, and
then some specific policy.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.090
But you hear a lot of that.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.950
And that's important.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.900
And campaign speeches
in different countries

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.040
say different things when they
sound themes about traditions

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.450
and values and norms.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.710
But the political process
operates within them.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.000
We'll talk about that.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.180
So we want to talk about not
only sort of how systems work

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.940
and how supply and demand
interact in the energy space,

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.400
but in fact, how that
whole structure is shaped

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.180
by, if you will, a higher
order more fundamental--

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.450
the higher order in
the chart processes

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.020
in the political sphere,
in the social sphere.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.700
So the reason why we're
doing social science

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.260
is the system involves people.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:33.460
And social science, economics,
political science, sociology,

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.480
anthropology, social
psychology, things

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.270
I've read about at
least, these are

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:44.250
all ways of looking at
systems that involve people.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.060
And if you want to change a
system that involves people,

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.580
you need to think about
the kinds of things

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.930
we're going to talk about here.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.890
So we're going to try to give
you some basic understanding,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.080
or at least some sensitivity
to the tools that come out

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.480
of the social
sciences that can help

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.600
you understand,
and with some luck,

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.160
can help you drive change.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.400
This is not a
prediction or a course

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.910
where we talk about the
future will look like x.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.340
That's for you guys to decide.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.440
This is a course where we try
to help you shape the future.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.980
The annual energy review comes
out of the Energy Information

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.880
Agency.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.610
It says AER 2010.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:36.590
It's published in 2011,
the latest data, or 2010.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.410
This is energy consumption per
person in the United States

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.310
over time.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:48.590
You will notice that it sort
of peaks in the '70s someplace,

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.120
and is flat.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.122
Now, if you think about
how the cars we drive,

00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:55.830
compare it-- well,
you may not know this,

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.090
but how the cars we drive
compared to the cars folks

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.070
drove in the '70s,
they are bigger,

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.960
and have a lot more horsepower.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.760
And what our homes
look like compared

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.150
to homes built in the
'70s is they are bigger,

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.940
and they tend to be
centrally air conditioned.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.860
If you think about computer
use and appliance use,

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.640
there's a lot more of it.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.900
But energy consumption
per capita is flat.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.880
I'll show you energy
per dollar of GDP,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.800
but you might expect
it to be declining.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:30.190
And what that tells you is first
of all, there is efficiency.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.260
And second of all, if
you think for a minute,

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:37.690
maybe we're doing different
things than we did in the '70s.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.270
Like less manufacturing.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.260
Another graph, I
love this graph.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.170
Impossible to read, I
expect, from the back.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:51.310
But this is energy consumption
per person across the States.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:57.730
And there, on the virtuous
right end is Massachusetts.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.100
How about that,
we are good folks.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.230
Is there anybody
here from Wyoming?

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.730
Anybody?

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.600
Nobody from Wyoming?

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.840
No one will admit to
being from Wyoming?

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.440
All right.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.630
I'm betting against Alaska.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.460
How about Louisiana?

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.530
North Dakota.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.900
Working from the left in.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.610
IA is Iowa, yes?

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:19.480
Iowa.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.480
Anybody from-- surely
somebody is from Iowa.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.280
OK, we have no
Midwesterners here.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.900
How about Texas, South
Dakota, or Kentucky?

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.440
Ah, we have the
Texas delegation?

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.730
OK.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.000
Gentlemen, how come we
use so much less energy

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.570
than you do per capita?

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:38.680
Pickett.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.400
Wyatt?

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.000
Take a run.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.380
What do you think?

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.330
AUDIENCE: We do a lot
of farming in Kentucky.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.163
So that may have
something to do with it.

00:24:45.163 --> 00:24:47.080
PROFESSOR: Farming is
actually a fairly energy

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.940
intensive activity these days.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.160
You're driving a
lot of machinery.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.500
It uses a lot of energy.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.970
So that's one thing.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:54.790
OK.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:55.600
Anything else?

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.072
Yeah, go ahead.

00:25:00.072 --> 00:25:02.280
AUDIENCE: Unlike Massachusetts,
where a lot of people

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.770
walk, especially in
Boston, in South Dakota

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.180
everything's really
spread apart,

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.385
so everybody drives there.

00:25:07.385 --> 00:25:08.760
PROFESSOR: So it's
lower density.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.260
There's probably a lot
more driving per capita.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.480
Yeah.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.235
Matt, you raised--
you identified

00:25:15.235 --> 00:25:16.110
as one of this crowd.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in Texas.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.760
PROFESSOR: It's what?

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.170
AUDIENCE: Air conditioning?

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.340
PROFESSOR: Air conditioning.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.210
Hotter summers.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.030
Probably a lot more central air.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.290
AUDIENCE: Probably
a drive everywhere.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.507
PROFESSOR: A lot more
spread out, yeah.

00:25:28.507 --> 00:25:30.090
It's interesting,
when you first think

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.710
about energy use in
Massachusetts, you might think,

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:33.900
gee, we have cold winters.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.670
We must heat these buildings.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.030
You notice, there's
Hawaii right next to us,

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:42.090
where they don't heat
anything ever really.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.087
So there are lots
of differences.

00:25:44.087 --> 00:25:45.420
And you pointed to some of them.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.430
They're transportation related.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.340
There's also not a lot of
manufacturing in Massachusetts

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.445
anymore.

00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:53.070
So we don't have a
big industrial load.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.655
Yeah?

00:25:53.655 --> 00:25:56.100
AUDIENCE: Wait, so California,
is California right next

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.710
to Massachusetts there?

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah, California.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.428
AUDIENCE: Because California
also there's a lot of farming,

00:26:02.428 --> 00:26:03.967
and we drive a lot.

00:26:03.967 --> 00:26:04.800
PROFESSOR: All true.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.390
But very little
manufacturing anymore.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.760
But you're right.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.920
There are a lot of puzzles here.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.980
I mean, there is Arizona.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.800
And you want to talk about
central air conditioning,

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.530
you have to have central
air conditioning in Arizona.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.610
So whereas northern
California, you still need it,

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:27.930
but it's not desperate.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:28.500
Yeah?

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.120
Jessica?

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.330
AUDIENCE: How does this do
manufacturing, for example?

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.140
Does it ration it to the
state that [INAUDIBLE] done

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.465
and those residents, or to
where the products are made?

00:26:39.465 --> 00:26:39.570
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:40.800
Where the plant is.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.736
AUDIENCE: What about
some of these--

00:26:42.736 --> 00:26:45.980
or the big states
that make electricity,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.990
have big coal plants, big
oil plants, big everything?

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.700
Is that proportioned
for that state, or--

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.575
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It
will be in the state.

00:26:52.575 --> 00:26:53.580
It'll be in the state.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.250
I mean, California is a pretty
light user of electricity.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:57.960
We're a pretty light
user of electricity.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.670
Hawaii is light.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.680
In part, because
those are states

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.630
where it's really expensive.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.120
It's expensive here for
a variety of reasons.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.920
California, heavily
environmental.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.990
Hawaii-- it's Hawaii.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:16.300
I mean, it's all oil-fired,
and the oil comes by tanker.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:16.990
Yeah?

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.407
AUDIENCE: I was going to say
that I assume the differences

00:27:19.407 --> 00:27:23.140
also come from state laws and
regulations and how those few

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:23.850
decision-makers--

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.760
I don't know.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.310
I mean, for example, you
just mentioned [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.095
I assume it might
be just because you

00:27:29.095 --> 00:27:30.580
have different
taxes, so it might

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.190
be more expensive in
certain states, or oil

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.020
might be cheaper
or more expensive,

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.550
gasoline, stuff like that.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:36.790
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:37.270
Some of that.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:37.812
Some of that.

00:27:37.812 --> 00:27:41.220
I mean, we'll talk about some
of the state regulations.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.930
Some of the states, like
California, for instance--

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.430
and Texas, for that matter--

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:49.370
have strong programs
favoring renewables,

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.700
which will add a bit.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.400
But you could imagine, down
the road, it adding a lot.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.160
The environmental standards
are pretty uniform,

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.970
but most of the
electricity generated here

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.770
is generated by gas.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:06.050
And we're at the far
end of the pipeline.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.420
So it's not Texas or Louisiana,
where the gas is there.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.340
It comes by comes by pipeline.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.090
In fact, we import some, LNG.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.080
Liquefied gas.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.550
AUDIENCE: It was
also, per capita,

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.525
places that have a
relatively small population

00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:22.900
for their activity--
like Alaska,

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.825
where there's a lot
of mining and stuff,

00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:27.200
and there's not
that many people.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.040
Doesn't that skew
it a little bit?

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.640
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.480
But if you put two Alaskas
next to each other,

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.240
you would have more people,
but still the same per capita.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.970
So I don't know if there are
scale effects, particularly.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:41.980
I think density works.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.010
Alaska's doing a lot of
energy-intensive stuff.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.470
A lot of travel within Alaska.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:50.200
A lot of heating in Alaska.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.630
I don't think it's
the absolute scale.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.750
I mean, consider Hawaii,
which is also quite small.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.300
But Hawaii doesn't--
they're not mining anything.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.820
There's nothing to mine.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.980
They're not doing a
lot of manufacturing.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.070
They can't drive that much.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.570
OK.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.960
Brendan?

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.668
AUDIENCE: It looks to
me like it's mainly

00:29:10.668 --> 00:29:12.550
red states versus blue states.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.550
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:16.040
Well, hold that for a moment.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.560
We want to get deeper
into the semester

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.310
before we're really political.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:26.870
But-- so this is energy
per dollar of GDP.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.990
And it's been declining
for a long time,

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.010
reflecting efficiency,
reflecting the decline

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:37.940
of manufacturing, reflecting--

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.730
well, those are two big ones.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.490
But probably other
factors, as well.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.100
Efficiency in energy
use, efficiency

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:52.220
in electricity generation,
and other dimensions.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.630
I find this one interesting.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.820
That's BTUs per dollar.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.280
So that's real on real.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.260
This is dollars on dollars.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.290
This is energy spending.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.900
And you'll see,
that's not so stable.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.230
And that's one reason--

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.830
that's one component
of what people

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.350
think of as the energy problem.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.310
I mean, all of a sudden, we're
cruising along fat and happy,

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.240
and boom!

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.550
We move from something
like 8% of GDP

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.610
to something like 14% of
GDP to pay the energy bill

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.390
over a few years.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.350
And then this is--

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.400
come on, where are we?

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.840
This is the recent oil
spike and oil collapse.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.440
This is a law-- we'll talk
about this next Wednesday.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.280
And this is a period when we got
very complacent about energy,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.760
and you didn't hear much
about energy from anybody.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.320
So prices move.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.760
And that is a source of concern.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.290
Let me talk about sources
of energy consumption.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.680
If you extend this graph back--

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.560
way back-- it starts with wood.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.130
If you go back far enough, New
England didn't have forests.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.410
They were cut down for energy.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.060
And gradually, it
dawned on people

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.475
that perhaps that's
not a good way forward.

00:31:18.475 --> 00:31:20.100
They have these
wonderful photographs--

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.660
I'll grab one if I can--

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.220
of Vermont.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.620
Basically, hills of mud.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.880
Hills of mud.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.350
Because the wood was there.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.150
They cut the wood down.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.410
That gave them scrub.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.890
They used the scrub
to graze sheep.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.810
There was a big boom in wool.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:37.680
You graze sheep.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.640
They eat everything.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.230
You get raw dirt.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.970
It runs down when it rains.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.370
We move from wood to coal.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.580
So you would have a wood peak
over here, and coal going up.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.850
But this is since 1950.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:57.020
This renewable energy,
which is pretty high in 1950

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.570
and grows slowly,
is mostly hydro--

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:03.350
mostly big dams built
in the '30s and '40s.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.780
You'll see not too
many built since.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.660
The recent run-up
is other things.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.130
You see nuclear power
go up and go flat.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.500
Coal continues to rise.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.537
Natural gas.

00:32:17.537 --> 00:32:19.120
You might think that
this downturn has

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.960
something to do with policy,
and you would be right.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.040
This has something
to do with prices.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.963
But you see natural gas kind
of flat with a little uptick

00:32:30.963 --> 00:32:31.630
here at the end.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.380
We're going to spend
a lot of time talking

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.170
about that uptick at the end.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:39.470
And oil continues to grow.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:45.950
If you look at
imported energy, we're

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.930
basically pretty
self-sufficient except for oil.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:56.570
A whole lot of this is natural
gas from Canada, which is--

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.270
that's, like, 80% of our
natural gas imports, which

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:02.630
doesn't keep too many people up
nights, unless you're a hockey

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:03.620
fan.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:10.750
But oil, over time, continued
to grow until recently.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.520
And we'll talk about that.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.260
Let me unpack that a little bit.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.730
So since at least
the 1970s, there

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.900
has been this desire to have
energy independence, which

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.840
really means oil independence,
since we're a coal exporter.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.380
Most of our natural gas
imports are from Canada.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.530
And electricity, nothing
happens much across the border.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.550
The main story,
historically, has been,

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.990
OK, we're going
to be independent.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.060
OK, this is going to be great.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.320
And there goes consumption.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:48.630
And in the meantime, production,
depending how you measure it,

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.860
peaked some long time ago--

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.250
not for want of drilling.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.070
The other interesting
fact, again, you'll

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:03.690
notice that little
uptick at the end.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:07.170
That little uptick
at the end is shale.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.389
And if you've been
following the paper,

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:13.440
shale is the big
story in fossil fuels.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.850
It's also a big
environmental story.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.760
And we will spend
some time on it.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.730
But that little uptick--
and there's a similar uptick

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.409
in natural gas--

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:26.670
is a big deal, the
start of something.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.590
This graph won't look
like this in five years.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.230
How's that for complexity?

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:38.139
This is energy flows.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:43.060
And you can spend all
day long looking at this,

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.310
and it would be good for you.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.550
But let me just point
out a few highlights.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.489
Over here, really, is
sort of primary energy.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.920
How many BTUs, with
100% efficiency,

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.440
would there be in the petroleum
we use, the coal we use,

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.900
the gas we use, and so on?

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.650
You see, first of all, that
petroleum and coal and gas

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:03.940
are still the main story.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.730
If you go to the right,
you will also see,

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:18.230
this is how much energy
does useful work.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.710
This is the energy that gets
lost mainly in waste heat.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.510
So anybody looking
at that diagram

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.760
would say, gee, there's
an enormous opportunity

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.330
for efficiency.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:32.640
Now, you could also
see, in electricity,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.580
there's a lot of it wasted.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.810
That's mostly at the
generating station.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.840
And a lot of money and effort
has gone into reducing that,

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.990
but it is not trivial.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:50.090
The other thing to note is due
to breakdown by residential,

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:54.460
commercial, industrial,
and transportation.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.550
It's not quite a third
for residential plus

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:00.520
commercial, industrial,
and transportation,

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.380
but it's kind of close--

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:07.000
ballpark, a third
in each bucket.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.210
Transportation is
obviously almost all oil,

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:15.910
and most of the oil
goes to transportation.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:19.840
You see the beginnings--

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.120
I mean, solar is trivial.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.410
Wind is a lot bigger.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:25.900
It's grown rapidly.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:30.010
Little bit of-- and
hydro is pretty steady.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:32.560
Again, you can stare at these.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.020
It's interesting to look
at this graph over time.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.300
And I'll show you an old one.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.590
But that's sort of the basic
flow outline of the system.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:45.370
That's that red box and
what it looks like unpacked.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.530
There we go.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:52.918
I just find this interesting.

00:36:52.918 --> 00:36:53.960
I did it a few years ago.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.060
This is, who uses industrial?

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.160
On that industrial
box, where does it go?

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.760
What industries use energy?

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.980
And it turns out that a quarter
of it goes to bulk chemicals--

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.410
just heat to drive reactions.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:09.860
Paper gets 10%, oil
refining gets 15%,

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.110
and the rest is pretty spread.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.070
If you look at energy--

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:19.840
BTUs per dollar of value
added, turns out cement

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.540
is very energy-intensive.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.310
As those of you who
know cement will

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.920
recognize, that it's a major
source of CO2 emissions--

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.940
both the energy and the reaction
that that energy produces.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.910
Now, if you look forward--

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:37.060
and we're going to do a fair
amount looking forward--

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.120
this is sort of a
general consensus.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.820
And it underlies, I think,
the reasons why a lot of you

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.320
are here.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.740
You sense this is a place
where change needs to happen,

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.060
of one kind or another.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.910
Again, I didn't make
it a required reading,

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:55.270
but you can look at the
National Research Council report

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.570
that this is from to
see why they think this.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.970
But it's not easy.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.860
Here's what that graph
looked like in 1982.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.260
You know, it doesn't
look that different.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.990
Main difference is, you
could stare at these-- again,

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.010
this will be on Stellar.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.300
It's not as complete.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.820
The main difference
you can see is

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.550
that we used to use
a fair amount of oil

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.750
to generate electricity.

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.730
We don't do that anymore.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.880
We really don't use
oil for electricity,

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.260
for a range of reasons.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.650
It's too expensive,
among other things.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:38.270
And that's-- still,
transportation is mostly oil.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.010
We still use a lot of coal--

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.250
oil, coal, natural gas.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.080
The other stuff is
still pretty-- was

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.280
pretty small, is pretty small.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.940
There's still,
again, this rejected

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.830
energy, useful energy--
waste energy, useful energy.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:56.960
So if you look at this,
you say, my heavens.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.890
Again, you could
look at the flows.

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.800
And this is that they weren't
quite as good at doing

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.480
this graph at Livermores.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.910
They came to be, in later years.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:11.050
You look at it and you say,
the system doesn't move fast.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.490
How can it move?

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:15.860
Well, it could move
if we all decided--

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:20.030
in a lot of utilities, you can
opt to buy green electricity.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:24.590
That is to say, if
20% of the people--

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:28.730
20% of the usage is
green, then the utility

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.420
is obliged to get 20% of its
energy from green sources.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:36.470
We could all say, and your
parents could all say,

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.060
we want green electricity.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.820
Well, if everybody did that,
it would be a big change.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.280
Not quite clear what
the companies would do

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.668
or how they would cope with it.

00:39:46.668 --> 00:39:47.710
It would be a big change.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.120
Is it likely?

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.380
No.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.910
It's expensive.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:55.090
And what I do isn't going
to affect the system much.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:56.820
If we all do it
together, it might.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.810
But that's another story.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:02.460
Suppose we develop
great new technologies,

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.980
which I hope many of you do.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.610
Well, where does
the money come from?

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:11.400
Energy, as a number of
people said at the outset,

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.090
is a big-dollar business.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:19.110
You don't do it at the PC.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.920
Three people in a garage don't
do the Facebook of energy.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.530
I mean, there's scope
for IT of energy,

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:30.960
but if you really want to
change how the work gets done,

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:36.570
you're talking serious R&D.
You're talking serious scaling.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:39.450
Should the government
decide where to invest?

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:40.410
If so, how?

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.000
Can you rely on
large energy firms?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.590
Some of them are really big.

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:49.620
Southern Company is
building a nuclear reactor--

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.210
first in a long time.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:52.800
That's a lot of money.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.040
Intel spends billions
on fabs, so maybe Intel

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.295
should spend the billions.

00:40:57.295 --> 00:40:58.500
Are they going to do it?

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.840
Is Southern Company going
to do something radical?

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.550
Small companies?

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.930
We're going to talk about this.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:09.070
Because the question of,
what kinds of organizations

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.740
are best suited to do
what in the innovation

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.075
process is kind
of important here.

00:41:15.075 --> 00:41:16.450
I mean, if you
think you're going

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:21.260
to revolutionize electricity
generation with $100,000

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.620
and three people, no.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:24.820
No.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.883
You might produce
something basic

00:41:26.883 --> 00:41:28.300
that somebody would
buy that would

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.920
be sold to somebody
bigger that might,

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:37.000
but figuring out how that
process works is important.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.950
Another way to transform
the energy system

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.788
is to really tighten
environmental regulation.

00:41:41.788 --> 00:41:43.330
And if you've been
reading the paper,

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.480
you've been reading about
regulations of coal-fired power

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.160
plants--

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.410
that some of them will
have to shut down.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:54.040
Well, if you really tighten
environmental regulation,

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.420
you would-- could--

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.560
transform the system.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.770
Are there votes for it?

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.320
Is it going to be done at the
state level, the federal level?

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.955
Does it matter where it's done?

00:42:06.955 --> 00:42:08.080
Where are the votes for it?

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.538
How would you get
the votes for it?

00:42:09.538 --> 00:42:11.140
What does the
opposition look like?

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.810
And what about this
regulatory process?

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.340
Has EPA gone wild?

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.500
Have the courts gone wild?

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.750
How does that work?

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.890
There are no laws passed.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:27.440
You have a blocking Republican
coalition in Congress.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.050
And yet EPA is coming out
with these very strong

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.523
environmental rules.

00:42:32.523 --> 00:42:34.190
Where does that come
from-- very strong,

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.600
as perceived by industry.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.140
Where does it come from?

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.630
How is it driven?

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:41.270
Where might it go?

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:46.760
You could imagine the
extension of state programs.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.740
29 states and the
District of Columbia

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.410
now require certain
fractions of energy--

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:54.860
electricity-- to be generated
from renewable sources.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.000
You could tighten those.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.610
California has tightened
it pretty tight.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.620
Texas has been very effective.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.910
Texas has a lot of wind energy--

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.620
an absurd amount of wind energy.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.980
You could imagine-- we got
EPA from a social movement.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.860
We got the Civil Rights
laws from a social movement.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.500
You could imagine a social
movement that would basically

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.905
call for transformation.

00:43:16.905 --> 00:43:18.780
Of course, people would
have to agree on what

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.070
the transformation should be.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:26.580
It would need something
coherent, something simple,

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.880
something like Martin
Luther King's speeches,

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.760
something like
Silent Spring that

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.580
banned DDT because people got
upset that birds were dying.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.600
It would require some
rallying cry like that.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.390
Is it possible?

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:47.100
And finally, how are we
going to do energy security,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.080
and what does it mean?

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:53.000
Suppose we're completely
self-sufficient for oil.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.630
Does that mean we're immune
to international price shocks?

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:58.040
Does that mean closing
the Straits of Hormuz

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.390
would have no effect on us?

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.370
What if the lights
went out in Europe?

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.080
What would that do?

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.120
What if world prices went up?

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:10.060
Would we subsidize oil to
keep domestic prices down?

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.800
So when you think about,
how might transformation

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.650
happen-- oh, and electric
cars powered by coal.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:20.550
I have to say, I love to ask
my environmentalist friends

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:22.890
in the Midwest who have
electric cars whether they're

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:28.530
enjoying their coal-powered
car or not, because it is.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:33.630
So it takes a little
bit of a systems view.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.000
Two observations, and
then I'll let us go.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
And the observations are
that, in this business,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.650
history matters.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.480
And I have to give
you this graph,

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.990
because it's a fantastic--
has anybody read

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:49.740
Tufte, the Visual Display
of Quantitative Information?

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:50.430
Beautiful book.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.170
At some time in
your life, read it.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:56.430
It's a book on, how can
you use visual displays

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:58.530
to get across information?

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:03.330
This shows when capacity was--
when US-generating capacity was

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.360
built and how it's powered.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.730
So you get a whole lot of
information out of this.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.580
You get out of this that
there's a lot of capacity

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:17.430
still running built before
1960, a ton of capacity

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.490
built before 1980, and
a lot of coal capacity

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.860
built before 1980.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.970
The recent capacity over
here is almost all gas,

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.550
although you see a little
coal coming online here.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.590
But it's almost all gas--

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:36.380
and very recently, wind.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:42.360
But there's a lot of money
invested in these plants.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.320
And for at least some
of them, coal is cheap.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.823
The plant's built.
The running cost--

00:45:49.823 --> 00:45:52.240
the cost of buying the coal,
putting it in, and generating

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.440
electricity from
it-- is really low.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.890
So the cost of shutting them
down and replacing them--

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.840
doesn't matter what
they cost to build.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.560
It's a cost of-- the cost
is premature replacement.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.580
Could be very high.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.500
And that's what we're hearing.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:13.760
On the other hand, many of
these are really dirty--

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:19.800
and compared to the new
stuff, really inefficient.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.400
Turning that ship is not easy.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.920
Turning that ship is not easy.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.780
Yeah, all of the
new stuff is gas.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.840
That's just swell.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.340
That is going to continue.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.340
And this is in response
to a bunch of subsidies

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.890
and regulations-- the wind.

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:37.050
But these guys are still here.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.870
They're still here.

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:41.462
Oh, and the nuclear plants--

00:46:41.462 --> 00:46:42.670
it's an interesting question.

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.420
How long will the
nuclear plants stay?

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.220
They've gotten more
efficient over time.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.460
They could run for a while.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.370
Will we build new ones?

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:56.560
Final example of
how history matters.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.135
This is US oil reserves.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.930
We explored for oil
in the lower 48.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:06.700
We explored for oil in Alaska.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.640
We're exploring for oil-- have
explored for oil-- off-shore.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.770
That's US oil
reserves over time.

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:15.280
So it's not that
we've pumped out--

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.100
it's not the difference
between 30 billion barrels

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.892
and, I don't know,
22 billion barrels

00:47:19.892 --> 00:47:21.100
is the amount we've produced.

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.370
No, we've produced a lot more.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:27.550
But after a while, if
you produce a lot today,

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:31.180
it becomes harder
to find tomorrow.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.770
Who knows how much there is.

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:35.260
But what there is,
is hard to find.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.910
We're deep underwater
off Los Angeles--

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:41.500
not off Los Angeles, off
New Orleans-- off Louisiana.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:46.150
That's not cheap to go
down a mile and drill.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.220
That's just not cheap.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.580
It was cheaper in Alaska, here.

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:56.330
But we've pumped a lot
of oil out of Alaska.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.480
So that history, that
decision that we're

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:07.230
going to use domestic oil today,
has implications for tomorrow.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.250
OK, I'm going to stop there.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.880
Oh, and I should
just make the point,

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.910
over the period of this graph,
world oil reserves-- that

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:17.800
actually includes
us, but we're small.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.490
World oil reserves
more than doubled.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:23.040
Because people look
for oil in new places.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.110
People had been looking
for oil in the US,

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.310
and it gets harder to find.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.410
OK.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.590

WEBVTT

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.864
PROFESSOR: All right, I feel
almost as though I should

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:11.265
introduce myself
all over again.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.070
It's been a week and a half
since we had a lecture.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.938
So let me begin by reminding
you of what we were doing.

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:21.842
We had derived all of the plane
groups, and for better

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:24.262
or worse had put
them behind us.

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:27.488
And then we moved into three
dimensions, where things get a

00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:31.125
lot more involved and a lot more
complicated, and to say

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:33.198
the least, a lot
more numerous.

00:00:33.198 --> 00:00:38.654
And the first question we asked
was to say, when we're

00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:43.118
in a three-dimensional space,
we can combine a first

00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:46.838
rotation operation with a second
rotation operation, B

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:51.054
beta If we're to begin by
deriving point groups-- that

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:53.534
is to say, the least [INAUDIBLE]
point in this

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:56.014
three-dimensional space
is not going to move.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.006
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.486
two axes to intersect a point.

00:00:59.486 --> 00:01:01.966
For a space group, they could
be parallel to one another.

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.694
But that's gonna be an infinite
set of symmetry

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:07.422
elements and operations that
extends through all space.

00:01:07.422 --> 00:01:10.398
Then we asked the question--
rhetorically, because you knew

00:01:10.398 --> 00:01:11.886
I was going to answer--

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:18.606
what is the net result of a
sequence of rotating from a

00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:23.070
first object to a second, and
then picking up the second and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.720
rotating it to an angle beta
about second axis.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.150
Begin the third one here.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.832
What is the net effect?

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:34.292
And again, we could do that by
the process of elimination.

00:01:34.292 --> 00:01:38.720
It has to be either translation
or another

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.410
rotation, because these are the
only two generic sorts of

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.116
operations which leaves the
chirality unchanged.

00:01:45.116 --> 00:01:48.560
And I think I convinced you
that indeed there was some

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.530
third axis, C, which rotated
directly from the first to the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.300
third by some different
angle, gamma.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.687
So that is the consequence of
combining the first two

00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:01.683
rotation axes.

00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:10.166
What they would anticipate is
that the location and also the

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:14.158
value of the rotation
[INAUDIBLE] depends on alpha

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:16.653
and beta, and also [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:18.150
at which we combine them.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.645
And that's what we'll see.

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:24.138
You could do this in a number
of ways that if you don't

00:02:24.138 --> 00:02:25.136
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.132
that gamma would turn
out to be a

00:02:27.132 --> 00:02:28.629
crystallographic rotation.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.454
And then your result would be
true, but it would not be a

00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:35.116
rotation operation which could
exist in a three-dimensional

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:36.613
point group.

00:02:36.613 --> 00:02:42.601
So using the genius of
Leonhard Euler and a

00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:45.096
construction known as Euler's
construction.

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:49.088
We set up a little spherical
triangle,

00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:52.581
which we could analyze.

00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:55.575
Let me tell you a little bit
about Euler, because he's a

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.571
remarkable individual.

00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:02.561
The first remarkable feature of
Euler is that he's Swiss,

00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:06.303
and there are not many
world-class famous people who

00:03:06.303 --> 00:03:09.547
are Swiss, simply because the
population is so small.

00:03:09.547 --> 00:03:13.040
The probability of somebody
rising to heights is constant

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.537
among all populations.

00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:16.731
If you have a small population,
there are not

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:18.030
going to be very many.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.220
And to demonstrate that point,
can somebody identify some

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.984
other citizen of Switzerland who
rose to great heights, as

00:03:24.984 --> 00:03:27.414
world-famous as [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:30.330
Think of one other person?

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.250
I'm fairly pressed
to do so myself.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.844
There's my uncle,
but he actually

00:03:33.844 --> 00:03:36.214
didn't amount to much.

00:03:36.214 --> 00:03:41.278
But there's an artist, Paul
Klee, who is world-class.

00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:44.986
He was one of the early
modern artists.

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:48.458
And Switzerland has just
finished constructing a

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:51.599
marvelous museum on the
outskirts of the

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.426
capital city, Berne.

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:55.898
It's a structure that is
supposed to mimic the rolling

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:58.378
countryside of the central
part of Switzerland.

00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:02.594
So it's a series of cylindrical
structures, glass

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:04.330
in front, glass on top.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.315
And it divides the
area into three.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:12.952
Two of them are exhibit spaces
and one is a space for

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.165
scholars and researchers.

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:17.075
And it's an absolutely
marvelous structure.

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:19.985
It appeared in the pages of Time
Magazine when it opened

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:22.410
[INAUDIBLE] about
two months ago.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.622
Anyway, Euler was born
in 1707, so he

00:04:26.622 --> 00:04:28.600
operated a long time ago.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.026
And he died in St. Petersburg
on September 18, 1783.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:43.834
That is exactly 350 years and
one day after my birthday.

00:04:46.762 --> 00:04:48.830
That's another remarkable
thing about him.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.387
He was 76 years old
when he died.

00:04:51.387 --> 00:04:55.711
And that time of primitive
medicine and plague, not many

00:04:55.711 --> 00:05:00.868
people got to live to
their 60s and 70s.

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:07.355
Euler studied at the University
of Basel under the

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:07.854
Bernoullis.

00:05:07.854 --> 00:05:10.220
I think you've all heard
of the Bernoullis.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.548
There's a very famous principle
of physics known as

00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:16.910
the Bernoulli effect, which
stated in its simple practical

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.108
form says that if you have the
Sunday paper on the front seat

00:05:20.108 --> 00:05:23.306
alongside of you, and you
drive your car with the

00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:26.000
windows down, the paper will
blow out the window.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.810
That's Bernoulli's principle
in action.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.228
Euler got his doctorate
from Basel at age 16.

00:05:36.228 --> 00:05:40.218
It sort of leads one to the
rhetorical question, how come

00:05:40.218 --> 00:05:43.608
you guys have been spinning
your wheels for so long?

00:05:43.608 --> 00:05:47.052
But then I said, he was
an unusual individual.

00:05:47.052 --> 00:05:52.464
The Bernoullis went to St.
Petersburg in Russia, under

00:05:52.464 --> 00:05:54.924
Catherine the First.

00:05:54.924 --> 00:05:58.860
Russia was trying very hard at
that time to enter the ranks

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.340
of the Western world
as a full member.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.630
Euler followed them a
little bit later on.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.180
And he succeeded one of the
Bernoullis as a professor of

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.568
mathematics in 1733.

00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:16.970
Then unfortunately, two years
later in 1735, he lost the

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.100
sight of one eye.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.071
And why?

00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.017
Because at that time, astronomy
had been using this

00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:25.945
newfangled telescope which had
recently been perfected.

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:28.400
One of the hottest things going
was studying the heavens

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.364
looking through a telescope.

00:06:30.364 --> 00:06:33.358
And if you wanted to look at the
sun, people knew nothing

00:06:33.358 --> 00:06:36.680
about the damaging effect on
retinas of the sun's rays.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.810
So he lost the sight
of one eye.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.424
1741, he went back to Europe
again, to Berlin.

00:06:43.424 --> 00:06:44.816
Why?

00:06:44.816 --> 00:06:48.435
Because the reigning monarch
in Russia at that time was

00:06:48.435 --> 00:06:53.405
called Ivan the Terrible, and
that says reams about why

00:06:53.405 --> 00:06:55.959
Euler would want to
get out of Russia.

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:59.871
But then 1776, he went back to
St. Petersburg under the next

00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:01.827
monarch, who was Catherine
the Great.

00:07:01.827 --> 00:07:04.272
And that says why one would
be interested to go back.

00:07:04.272 --> 00:07:09.162
Finally, in 1766, he
went fully blind.

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.629
Did that slow him down?

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:13.074
Not one bit.

00:07:13.074 --> 00:07:17.964
He published in his lifetime
800 papers.

00:07:17.964 --> 00:07:20.712
You talk to some big cheese
around MIT, they've published

00:07:20.712 --> 00:07:26.965
maybe 200 or 300 papers, and
that with the assistance of an

00:07:26.965 --> 00:07:30.918
army of graduate students, and
also, one might add, the

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:34.341
assistance of Xerox machines
and word processors.

00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:37.275
So back in the days when you
wrote everything out by hand

00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:41.187
with a [INAUDIBLE] quill pen,
800 papers is an absolutely

00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:44.121
unbelievable accomplishment.

00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:47.560
It took 35 years after he
passed away to publish

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.544
everything that he'd written.

00:07:49.544 --> 00:07:53.020
People had kept busy publishing
what he did.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.812
And among his accomplishments,
he was one of the first people

00:07:56.812 --> 00:08:00.703
to apply real hardcore
mathematics to astronomy, to

00:08:00.703 --> 00:08:02.870
make it quantitative.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.975
He was one of the first to
suggest that light was a wave

00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:10.602
form, and that color was a
function of wave length.

00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:13.398
That was astonishingly
precocious.

00:08:13.398 --> 00:08:16.917
And then, lest he seem like an
egghead who spent all his time

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:21.318
staring through telescopes and
working out theorems to use in

00:08:21.318 --> 00:08:24.741
crystallography, he also wrote
a popular account of science

00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.164
for the general public, which
was published in 1768.

00:08:28.164 --> 00:08:32.565
And that book was published
for 90 years, three

00:08:32.565 --> 00:08:35.499
generations of people kept
gobbling up [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:35.499 --> 00:08:37.000
pretty good.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.980
He impinged upon our own
language and activities in

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.030
several important ways.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:47.170
He was the one who used
lowercase i to define the

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.060
square root of minus 1.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.140
We can thank Euler for that.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.948
He was the person who used
e to define the constant,

00:08:55.948 --> 00:09:06.406
2.71828182845904523536.

00:09:06.406 --> 00:09:09.394
And he was the person
who first used f

00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:11.386
to stand for function.

00:09:11.386 --> 00:09:15.370
So he contributed not only a lot
of good mathematics, but a

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.362
lot [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:17.362 --> 00:09:19.720
So this does not have
to be easy.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.905
Euler was a great guy.

00:09:20.905 --> 00:09:27.720
And this geometry of rotations
about different axes is

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.712
something that also survives in
a mechanism that involves

00:09:31.712 --> 00:09:37.495
achieving angular core rotation
on a axis by rotation

00:09:37.495 --> 00:09:39.836
on two orthogonal arcs.

00:09:39.836 --> 00:09:42.800
And that's something that's
called an Euler Cradle.

00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:51.251
And that is geometry that;s
used in a great number of

00:09:51.251 --> 00:09:52.652
mechanical devices.

00:09:52.652 --> 00:09:56.610
In any case, back to instruction
for our purposes.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:02.126
The thing that we would like
to do is let alpha and beta

00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:05.770
take on all possible
crystallographic values,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:10.711
namely 360 degrees or onefold
axis, although we know that

00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:12.458
that's not gonna work.

00:10:12.458 --> 00:10:14.454
Twofold, 180 degrees.

00:10:14.454 --> 00:10:15.951
Threefold, 120.

00:10:15.951 --> 00:10:16.949
Fourfold, 90.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:20.442
Sixfold, 60.

00:10:20.442 --> 00:10:24.933
And let that give the values
to alpha and beta,

00:10:24.933 --> 00:10:26.430
taking two at a time.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.422
And then let us ask the
question, at what angle should

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:35.412
we combine these two axes
to get gamma to be a

00:10:35.412 --> 00:10:38.406
crystallographic
rotation axis?

00:10:38.406 --> 00:10:44.394
And if it is crystallographic
and not something like 37.9234

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.887
degrees, what are the remaining
axes with interaxial

00:10:47.887 --> 00:10:50.881
angles B and A?

00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:53.875
So this is the problem that
Euler's construction solved.

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:56.869
And I won't go through all
the arguments that we

00:10:56.869 --> 00:10:57.867
need to set this up.

00:10:57.867 --> 00:11:02.857
But what we found after some f
sleight of hand when we were

00:11:02.857 --> 00:11:06.350
working on the polar triangle
with spherical trigonometry,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.340
what we found was the result
that said that if we want to

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.082
combine two axes, alpha and
beta, so that the third one

00:11:15.082 --> 00:11:19.110
turned out to be a rotation of
gamma, then the cosine of the

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:24.130
angle between A and B should
be the cosine of alpha/2,

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:30.609
cosine of beta/2 plus cosine
of gamma/2, divided by the

00:11:30.609 --> 00:11:35.900
sine of alpha/2, sine beta/2.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:41.259
So if you pick your alpha and
beta, and you decide what you

00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:45.251
would want these first two
rotations to turn out to be.

00:11:45.251 --> 00:11:46.748
And generally it's
not gonna work.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.744
But there are a surprising
number of cases

00:11:48.744 --> 00:11:50.241
where it does work.

00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:53.235
So you specify the combination
you had.

00:11:53.235 --> 00:11:58.058
You also determine the angle
between A and C. And you have

00:11:58.058 --> 00:12:02.716
to also determine the angle
between the axes B and C. And

00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:06.209
there are similar sorts of
expressions that one obtains

00:12:06.209 --> 00:12:11.199
simply by [INAUDIBLE] alpha
and beta again.

00:12:11.199 --> 00:12:15.191
So then we set it up just by
looking at all possible

00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:19.682
combinations of twofold, of two
different rotation axes,

00:12:19.682 --> 00:12:23.190
and a third, which the
net effect might be.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.836
We're not interested in
permuting A, B, and C. And A

00:12:26.836 --> 00:12:29.752
equal to C equal to B is just
as interesting or not as A

00:12:29.752 --> 00:12:33.640
equal to B equal to C. We don't
care about permutations.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.500
And we generated-- just
as we [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.386
a week and a half ago-- a set of
combinations that we should

00:12:43.386 --> 00:12:49.870
consider, what the axis A would
be, what the axis B

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.086
would be, and them different
choices for the axis C. So A

00:12:54.086 --> 00:12:54.582
could be 1.

00:12:54.582 --> 00:12:56.070
B could be 1.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.534
And we could look for 1,
1, 1; 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3;

00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:03.510
1, 1, 4; 1, 1, 6.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.990
Those are legitimate
combinations?

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.206
Those are absurd combinations,
because doing nothing about

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.934
the first onefold axis, doing
nothing about the second

00:13:12.934 --> 00:13:17.646
onefold axis could hardly result
in the net effect of

00:13:17.646 --> 00:13:21.366
the 90-degree rotation
by the third axis.

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:24.838
And [INAUDIBLE] suggested is
that sitting around and doing

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:27.814
nothing twice was equal to a
rotation [INAUDIBLE] its

00:13:27.814 --> 00:13:30.294
junctures [INAUDIBLE] we'd find
ourselves spinning on our

00:13:30.294 --> 00:13:31.544
axis like tops.

00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:37.734
Twofold axis.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:40.462
1, 1, 2, we have here,
so we don't have to

00:13:40.462 --> 00:13:42.198
consider 2, 1, 1.

00:13:42.198 --> 00:13:50.254
But we should consider 2, 1,
2; 2, 1, 3; 2, 1, 4; 2,

00:13:50.254 --> 00:13:53.206
1, 6, and so on.

00:13:53.206 --> 00:13:56.035
If we filled out this whole
table, last time you got a

00:13:56.035 --> 00:14:00.832
copy of it and some notes, and
all that remains then is to

00:14:00.832 --> 00:14:02.080
quote [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.570
and see where we get allowable
axial combinations.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:14.005
And not surprisingly, there
are so very, very few.

00:14:14.005 --> 00:14:17.965
And we showed-- again, when we
finished up last time-- that

00:14:17.965 --> 00:14:24.320
you can always take any n-fold
axis that has a C gamma that's

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:31.378
equal to C 2 pi over n and
combine it with twofold axes

00:14:31.378 --> 00:14:36.834
at right angles, provided you
make the angle between the

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:42.786
twofold axes equal 2
of gamma over 2.

00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:47.498
So the crystallographic
possibilities for C are, first

00:14:47.498 --> 00:14:52.706
of all, C could be a twofold
axis, in which case you could

00:14:52.706 --> 00:14:57.170
combine with it a pair of
twofold axes, and this 1/2 of

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.146
180 degrees would also
be a right angle.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:11.058
We could let C be a threefold
axis, in which case the

00:15:11.058 --> 00:15:14.034
twofold axes have to be at
right angles, two- to

00:15:14.034 --> 00:15:15.522
threefold axes.

00:15:15.522 --> 00:15:19.490
And they should be combined at
half the angular throw of the

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.458
threefold axes, which
is 60 degrees.

00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:28.543
Two more possibilities are
four [INAUDIBLE] pair of

00:15:28.543 --> 00:15:30.539
twofold axes at right angles.

00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:33.865
Of the angle between them,
half of the throw of a

00:15:33.865 --> 00:15:36.527
fourfold axis would have to
be equal to 5 degrees.

00:15:36.527 --> 00:15:40.519
And the last one is sixfold
axis with a

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:42.016
pair of twofold axes.

00:15:42.016 --> 00:15:43.513
Add angles to it.

00:15:43.513 --> 00:15:46.507
And a third [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:46.507 --> 00:15:51.996
So notice the insidious fact
that the angle between the

00:15:51.996 --> 00:15:58.982
twofold axes is always a half,
1/2 the rotation angle in

00:15:58.982 --> 00:16:04.471
principal axis C are not equal
to this rotation axis.

00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:10.459
The other thing we saw that is
that these twofold axes are

00:16:10.459 --> 00:16:15.845
different, distinct,
symmetry-independent axes.

00:16:15.845 --> 00:16:20.795
They're different in that the
principal axis C never rotates

00:16:20.795 --> 00:16:24.095
this axis into the second one,
and therefore demands that

00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:28.343
whatever's going on around one
twofold axis be identical to

00:16:28.343 --> 00:16:32.180
what's going on at the other
twofold axis, different in the

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.635
sense that they function in
different ways in the pattern,

00:16:36.635 --> 00:16:41.090
or if you're describing the
symmetry of an object.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.948
So probably the best
demonstration of this is a

00:16:44.948 --> 00:16:50.936
regular prism with a triangular
shape or with a

00:16:50.936 --> 00:16:56.924
square shape or with
a hexagonal shape.

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:04.409
And the adjacent twofold axes
for these prisms would come

00:17:04.409 --> 00:17:09.399
out of the normal to a face.

00:17:09.399 --> 00:17:15.886
And then if the second twofold
axis is going to be 45 degrees

00:17:15.886 --> 00:17:22.872
away from the first, the other
one has to come [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:22.872 --> 00:17:25.367
So yeah, they function in
different ways in the space.

00:17:25.367 --> 00:17:28.194
One is normal to the face of
a regular prism, if that's

00:17:28.194 --> 00:17:29.359
what's in our space.

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:31.355
The other one comes
out of the edge.

00:17:31.355 --> 00:17:40.087
Similarly for a sixfold axis,
a hexagonal prism has one

00:17:40.087 --> 00:17:43.331
twofold axis coming out normal
to a face, the adjacent

00:17:43.331 --> 00:17:45.327
twofold axis coming
out to an edge.

00:17:45.327 --> 00:17:48.321
And as advertised,
that angle is 33.

00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:50.317
So they function in
different ways.

00:17:50.317 --> 00:17:53.250
The only exception to that,
again, is the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.690
threefold axis.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.010
And the twofold axes there,
which were 60 degrees, come

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.706
out of one side from a corner
of the triangular prism.

00:18:04.706 --> 00:18:06.698
On the other side, that
was [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:06.698 --> 00:18:10.682
So all of the twofold axes
were the same thing.

00:18:10.682 --> 00:18:15.164
There's only one independent
kind of twofold axis, just as

00:18:15.164 --> 00:18:18.650
there was only kind of mirror
plane in the combination of a

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.638
mirror plane passing through
a twofold axis.

00:18:21.638 --> 00:18:25.855
The names for these are always,
as we've done in the

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:29.348
past, a running list of the
independent symmetry

00:18:29.348 --> 00:18:30.845
operations that are present.

00:18:30.845 --> 00:18:36.334
So this general one, n, 2, 2,
with the n-fold axis for some

00:18:36.334 --> 00:18:38.330
generic sort of a
twofold axis.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.825
This one would be 2, 2, 2.

00:18:40.825 --> 00:18:43.320
This one would be 4, 2, 2.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.813
And this one would be 6, 2, 2.

00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:50.306
This [INAUDIBLE] with a
threefold axis is, again,

00:18:50.306 --> 00:18:55.046
called not 3, 2, but 3, 2,
because there's only one kind

00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:57.666
of twofold axis, just as
there's only one kind

00:18:57.666 --> 00:18:58.916
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:03.779 --> 00:19:07.771
We pause [INAUDIBLE], see if
you have any questions.

00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:10.266
These are the crystallographic
combinations of this

00:19:10.266 --> 00:19:11.763
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:11.763 --> 00:19:17.252
There is no reason why you
should not in something that

00:19:17.252 --> 00:19:20.495
doesn't have to be compatible
with a lattice, combine an

00:19:20.495 --> 00:19:26.234
n-fold axis of any sort with
twofold axes or right angles.

00:19:26.234 --> 00:19:29.727
And indeed, if I look at my
old friend, the saguaro

00:19:29.727 --> 00:19:34.717
cactus, we can add
anything like 28-

00:19:34.717 --> 00:19:38.210
up to 32-fold symmetry.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.202
This cactus stem had
a 28-fold symmetry.

00:19:42.202 --> 00:19:46.318
It would be a twofold axis
coming out of the string with

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:50.186
one of the ribs, another twofold
axis coming out of the

00:19:50.186 --> 00:19:52.681
crevice between the pair
of these ribs.

00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:55.675
And if I took that thing up,
very carefully because of the

00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:58.170
spines, and with great effort
because it weights several

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:04.657
tons, and rotated it about one
axis, and then rotate it again

00:20:04.657 --> 00:20:07.152
about a second axis, turning
it upside-down, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:07.152 --> 00:20:11.144
axis would be rotation
to 128 [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:13.639
Valid symmetry, but not
crystallographic.

00:20:22.122 --> 00:20:26.120
OK, any comments or questions?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.708
Get to know these results,
because the exercise that's

00:20:29.708 --> 00:20:35.518
going to occupy us for the
next week is going to be

00:20:35.518 --> 00:20:39.004
asking how we can decorate these
frameworks with mirror

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:40.996
planes and with inversion.

00:20:40.996 --> 00:20:44.430
If you want orientation, we
could add another operation to

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.280
the collection of axes
while it pops up.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.530
Where [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.830
Comments or questions?

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:02.927
OK, there are only two other
combinations that are

00:21:02.927 --> 00:21:07.330
crystallographic that
involve directions

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.736
that are not simple.

00:21:11.634 --> 00:21:23.060
And one of them involves a
combination of a threefold

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:29.534
axis with twofold axes that come
out of directions at a

00:21:29.534 --> 00:21:31.028
normal to the face of a cube.

00:21:31.028 --> 00:21:34.763
So these turn out to be very,
very strange angles which make

00:21:34.763 --> 00:21:38.000
no sense at all until
you refer them to

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.494
directions in the cube.

00:21:39.494 --> 00:21:41.984
The direction of the threefold
axis turns out to be

00:21:41.984 --> 00:21:44.474
correspondent with the
angle of a cube.

00:21:44.474 --> 00:21:47.628
The direction of the twofold
axis corresponds to

00:21:47.628 --> 00:21:50.450
the normal two faces.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.446
You can show--

00:21:51.446 --> 00:21:55.015
I did show, and I don't think
anybody really followed me, so

00:21:55.015 --> 00:21:57.422
I had to hand out that
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:21:57.422 --> 00:22:01.406
that if you start with one
twofold axis and one threefold

00:22:01.406 --> 00:22:05.639
axis, what you're going to get
is a threefold axis coming out

00:22:05.639 --> 00:22:08.876
of all of the [INAUDIBLE]
diagonals, but they're all

00:22:08.876 --> 00:22:12.860
equivalent to this
threefold axis.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.844
And twofold axes come out
to normal for all the

00:22:16.844 --> 00:22:17.840
faces of the cube.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.848
So there's only one kind of
twofold axis and one kind of

00:22:21.848 --> 00:22:25.824
threefold axis, so even though
we got this by combining a

00:22:25.824 --> 00:22:27.315
pair of twofold axes--

00:22:27.315 --> 00:22:29.303
I'm sorry, a pair of
threefold axes--

00:22:32.782 --> 00:22:35.267
that's what happens when
you stay up late.

00:22:35.267 --> 00:22:36.261
You forget about this one.

00:22:36.261 --> 00:22:37.752
A pair of threefold axes
at the diagonals

00:22:37.752 --> 00:22:39.243
and one twofold axis.

00:22:39.243 --> 00:22:43.645
And this is the combination
that is called 23, because

00:22:43.645 --> 00:22:47.328
there's only one sort of twofold
axis and one sort of

00:22:47.328 --> 00:22:48.789
threefold axis.

00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:53.590
And I'd like to point out and
I'd like to warn you of traps

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.544
when we come across them, make
sure we don't [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:57.544 --> 00:22:58.038
across them.

00:22:58.038 --> 00:23:04.460
Notice the insidious relation
of this pair of integers to

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.918
the symmetry that we
label [? 232. ?]

00:23:07.918 --> 00:23:12.858
32 is a threefold axis with a
twofold axis normal to it.

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:16.316
23 is this combination
that involves

00:23:16.316 --> 00:23:17.798
corrections in a cube.

00:23:22.738 --> 00:23:26.690
Now, let me pause
parenthetically with an aside.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.160
You might say, how
can this be?

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.642
Here is a cube.

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:35.100
That cube has got a fourfold
axis about it.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.138
Don't call that a
twofold axis.

00:23:37.138 --> 00:23:40.072
A cube has a fourfold axis
coming out of it.

00:23:40.072 --> 00:23:43.495
OK, let me give you an
example in real life.

00:23:43.495 --> 00:23:48.874
There is a fairly common
mineral, iron disulfide--

00:23:48.874 --> 00:23:50.840
pyrite.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.913
This forms nice, shiny cubes,
but the cube faces have

00:23:54.913 --> 00:23:56.380
striations on them.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.314
If you look at them, there's a
set of lines running this way.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.960
And what those lines are if you
look at this crystal face

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.672
with a magnifying glass, is that
these are little steps of

00:24:10.672 --> 00:24:11.912
a second face.

00:24:11.912 --> 00:24:14.392
And this is a face
of the form hk0.

00:24:14.392 --> 00:24:17.368
And this oscillates back and
forth, and there seem to be

00:24:17.368 --> 00:24:19.848
lines scribed on the surface.

00:24:19.848 --> 00:24:22.840
So this sort of a [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.362
crystal growth of one face which
never really develops is

00:24:25.362 --> 00:24:27.060
not that uncommon.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.970
There's a threefold axis coming
out of the corner here,

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:34.577
but this is really a surface
that is left at variant only

00:24:34.577 --> 00:24:36.760
by 183 [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.200
You cannot rotate that
surface 90 degrees.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.438
The orientation of the
lines have changed.

00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:44.681
But there is a bona fide
threefold axis coming up

00:24:44.681 --> 00:24:50.919
there, so these striations, if
I rotate them to this face,

00:24:50.919 --> 00:24:52.915
will go in a way like this.

00:24:52.915 --> 00:24:57.239
This edge turns into this edge,
and therefore the lines

00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:58.404
will run down like this.

00:24:58.404 --> 00:25:01.897
And if I rotate [INAUDIBLE] n by
90 degrees, the striations

00:25:01.897 --> 00:25:07.885
on the adjacent face
will run down.

00:25:07.885 --> 00:25:09.881
So there's a decorated cube.

00:25:09.881 --> 00:25:12.625
And if you rolled it up and say
how can I move this cube

00:25:12.625 --> 00:25:15.869
around and leave its appearance
totally unchanged?

00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:19.861
the answer is, rotate it by
120 degrees [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:19.861 --> 00:25:20.360
diagonal.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.352
But we can only rotate it 180
degrees around the face.

00:25:24.352 --> 00:25:27.346
So there's an example of
a crystal [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:27.346 --> 00:25:30.839
on the arrangement of
rotation axes 23.

00:25:36.328 --> 00:25:43.314
The final one, the highest
symmetry of all, involves a

00:25:43.314 --> 00:25:50.300
fourfold axis coming out of a
direction normal to a face, a

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.793
threefold axis coming out of the
[INAUDIBLE] diagonal, and

00:25:53.793 --> 00:25:57.286
a twofold axis coming out
normal to an edge.

00:25:57.286 --> 00:26:01.111
And if you let these axes work
on one another, there's a

00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:03.773
twofold axis that comes out of
every edge, and a fourfold

00:26:03.773 --> 00:26:05.769
axis that comes out
of every face.

00:26:05.769 --> 00:26:09.761
And this one is named 432,
because it's a combination of

00:26:09.761 --> 00:26:12.256
a fourfold, a threefold,
and a twofold.

00:26:12.256 --> 00:26:14.751
That is the symmetry
to the cube.

00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:19.242
And for crystallographic
symmetries, that's about as

00:26:19.242 --> 00:26:23.234
complicated as it gets.

00:26:23.234 --> 00:26:26.228
Now, if we look at the regular
solids that we've encountered

00:26:26.228 --> 00:26:32.715
here, with symmetry 23, there
is a regular [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:32.715 --> 00:26:34.711
consisting of four
triangular faces.

00:26:34.711 --> 00:26:35.961
That's a tetrahedron.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:47.153
And for 432, one of the
polyhedra that can form from

00:26:47.153 --> 00:26:51.327
the crystal [INAUDIBLE]
is an octahedron.

00:26:51.327 --> 00:26:57.219
These were the lovely solids
called Platonic solids, after

00:26:57.219 --> 00:27:02.129
Plato, that we used as our
trophies early this afternoon.

00:27:02.129 --> 00:27:03.602
So this is an octahedron.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.900
Let me finish up before our
break by asking is there any

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.631
other regular polyhedra that can
result from a combination

00:27:16.631 --> 00:27:19.370
of rotation axes that are
not crystallographic?

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.350
Now, that's a tough
question to ask.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:33.360
You instantly scan your
knowledge of geometry.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.240
Clearly, there are a lot
of prisms [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.160
infinite number of prisms
[INAUDIBLE] n22.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.730
But there's only one other
combination of axes

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.688
non-crystallographic which
results in a regular

00:27:44.688 --> 00:27:46.167
polyhedron.

00:27:46.167 --> 00:27:50.357
And this is a combination,
believe it or not, of a

00:27:50.357 --> 00:27:54.548
fivefold axis with
a threefold axis.

00:28:00.957 --> 00:28:04.901
This is a fivefold axis
and a threefold axis

00:28:04.901 --> 00:28:08.850
and a twofold axis.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:13.060
And these result in a regular
solid called an icosahedron.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.334
And that is so complicated
that I won't

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:24.310
attempt to draw it.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.780
But having said so, it
looks like this.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.250
It has diamond-shaped faces.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:34.200
And there are five of these
that come together in a

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.450
[INAUDIBLE] form.

00:28:38.136 --> 00:28:40.596
So here's one of the [INAUDIBLE]
diamond-shaped

00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:43.712
faces, another diamond-shaped
face, and then the two other

00:28:43.712 --> 00:28:45.516
ones that come in like this.

00:28:45.516 --> 00:28:49.452
So there are 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 faces, so this is the

00:28:49.452 --> 00:28:51.420
orientation of a
fivefold axis.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.356
The twofold axis comes out of
a place where two of these

00:28:55.356 --> 00:28:57.324
edges are shared.

00:28:57.324 --> 00:29:00.840
And the threefold axis--

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.313
[INAUDIBLE] triangular faces.

00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:06.509
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.624
So here's the fivefold axis.

00:29:12.624 --> 00:29:14.588
These are the twofold
axes [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:14.588 --> 00:29:16.552
And these are threefold axes.

00:29:16.552 --> 00:29:18.730
But you know all this.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.307
Is there anybody
who [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:21.307 --> 00:29:25.798
show me that they've never
seen an icosahedron?

00:29:25.798 --> 00:29:28.293
Anybody ever who has not seen--
have you seen it?

00:29:28.293 --> 00:29:29.543
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:32.784 --> 00:29:33.283
Here--

00:29:33.283 --> 00:29:37.024
I spared no expense-- is a live
icosahedron for those who

00:29:37.024 --> 00:29:38.274
would like to look.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.752
AUDIENCE: How many sides
does it have?

00:29:48.752 --> 00:29:50.002
PROFESSOR: He'll count
them for you.

00:29:52.744 --> 00:29:53.243
I don't remember.

00:29:53.243 --> 00:29:55.488
I know the number of faces and
the number of edges, but not

00:29:55.488 --> 00:29:58.732
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:58.732 --> 00:30:00.229
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:00.229 --> 00:30:00.728
faces.

00:30:00.728 --> 00:30:02.724
PROFESSOR: I think it's--

00:30:02.724 --> 00:30:04.221
I'm not sure [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:04.221 --> 00:30:05.219
Not sure.

00:30:05.219 --> 00:30:06.217
AUDIENCE: But you said you
know the number of faces.

00:30:06.217 --> 00:30:07.714
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but I can't
tell you everything I know

00:30:07.714 --> 00:30:08.213
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:08.213 --> 00:30:10.209
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:10.209 --> 00:30:14.201
PROFESSOR: There's another
figure which also has this

00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:16.696
symmetry, and it's
a regular solid.

00:30:16.696 --> 00:30:19.191
And this is called a rhombic
dodecahedron.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.468
And, wise guy, this
has 12 faces.

00:30:30.468 --> 00:30:33.444
And the faces are pentagonal.

00:30:33.444 --> 00:30:39.148
And there are three pentagonal
faces that come together at

00:30:39.148 --> 00:30:43.364
the threefold axis, a fivefold
axis out of each of the

00:30:43.364 --> 00:30:48.820
pentagonal faces, and a twofold
axis out of the edges.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:54.370
The face that this has 12 faces
at regular intervals

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:58.562
leads an entrepreneur who was
familiar with injection

00:30:58.562 --> 00:31:03.030
molding to cast these little
things as a plastic, and then

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:07.169
puts a month of the year on each
of the 12 faces and made

00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:09.930
a nice little desk calendar.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.888
[INAUDIBLE] something that
reminds you of symmetry as

00:31:12.888 --> 00:31:14.860
well [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:23.838
So this has fivefold faces,
12 of them, and that's the

00:31:23.838 --> 00:31:26.328
rhombic dodecahedron as
opposed to the normal

00:31:26.328 --> 00:31:28.320
dodecahedron which
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:33.798 --> 00:31:36.288
AUDIENCE: So are those
both [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:36.288 --> 00:31:37.284
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:31:37.284 --> 00:31:40.272
AUDIENCE: Are those
both [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:40.272 --> 00:31:42.264
The icosahedron, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:42.264 --> 00:31:45.501
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this has a
fivefold axis coming out of

00:31:45.501 --> 00:31:47.244
the pentagonal [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:47.244 --> 00:31:48.240
Is that what you're asking?

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.477
And the threefold axis, there
are three of them that, come

00:31:51.477 --> 00:31:55.212
together, and they do
something like this.

00:32:00.192 --> 00:32:04.425
So here's the threefold, here's
the fivefold, here's

00:32:04.425 --> 00:32:05.675
the twofold.

00:32:09.156 --> 00:32:11.148
Here we have to see
it [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:11.148 --> 00:32:14.634
Look for somebody who's got one
of these desk calendars.

00:32:14.634 --> 00:32:16.128
[INAUDIBLE] used to sell them.

00:32:16.128 --> 00:32:17.378
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.822
OK, this sets up the next
stage of our game.

00:32:26.822 --> 00:32:29.873
We've got these arrangements
of axes.

00:32:29.873 --> 00:32:34.803
And if you count them up on the
fingers of your hands and

00:32:34.803 --> 00:32:37.761
one toe, there are 11 of them.

00:32:37.761 --> 00:32:41.705
There are the axes by
themselves-- onefold, twofold,

00:32:41.705 --> 00:32:43.677
threefold, fourfold, sixfold.

00:32:43.677 --> 00:32:47.621
There are these so-called
dihedral combinations, where

00:32:47.621 --> 00:32:51.565
the only thing that changes from
one to the other is the

00:32:51.565 --> 00:32:55.509
symmetry of the main axis, the
[INAUDIBLE] symmetry, and

00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:58.960
therefore the dihedral angle
between the twofold axes.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:05.658
And these are 222,
32, 422, and 622.

00:33:05.658 --> 00:33:10.598
And then the two cubic
arrangements, 32 and 432.

00:33:10.598 --> 00:33:16.190
So when we return, we'll ask the
question, how can we add

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.097
mirror planes for an inversion
center to this

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:20.350
combination of axes?

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.367
And these are going to give us
new symmetries involving not

00:33:23.367 --> 00:33:27.199
only rotation, but [INAUDIBLE]
help with rotation

00:33:27.199 --> 00:33:30.073
inversion as well.

00:33:30.073 --> 00:33:35.226
And the constraint in doing this
is that we have to add

00:33:35.226 --> 00:33:39.660
the reflection plane and the
inversion center in such a way

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:46.880
that it doesn't create any new
rotation axes, because we have

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.210
systematically derived all of
the possible combinations of

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.202
crystallographic
rotation axes.

00:33:52.202 --> 00:33:56.186
So if the addition of a mirror
plane, creates a new axis,

00:33:56.186 --> 00:34:00.668
that's going to be something
that you already have with a

00:34:00.668 --> 00:34:03.158
combination of a greater number
of rotation axes.

00:34:03.158 --> 00:34:05.648
For example, if you take a
single twofold axis and a

00:34:05.648 --> 00:34:09.632
mirror plane of an angle, that
generated another twofold axis

00:34:09.632 --> 00:34:11.126
90 degrees away.

00:34:11.126 --> 00:34:12.620
But we've already got that.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:19.094
If a mirror plane moves an axis
to an angle that doesn't

00:34:19.094 --> 00:34:22.082
correspond to one of these
arrangements, it's going to be

00:34:22.082 --> 00:34:25.568
impossible, because we have
systematically derived, using

00:34:25.568 --> 00:34:29.054
Euler's construction, all the
combinations of rotation

00:34:29.054 --> 00:34:31.046
operations that are possible.

00:34:31.046 --> 00:34:33.038
So that's going to be
the constraint.

00:34:33.038 --> 00:34:37.520
We want to add mirror planes or
an inversion center in all

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.014
possible combinations.

00:34:39.014 --> 00:34:42.002
And this means we're gonna
need a theorem.

00:34:42.002 --> 00:34:44.492
What happens when you
add a mirror plane

00:34:44.492 --> 00:34:46.500
to a rotation operation?

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.566
We're already familiar
with one of them.

00:34:47.566 --> 00:34:52.030
You take an axis and you pass
an mirror plane through it,

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.502
you get another mirror plane
that is rotated about the

00:34:55.502 --> 00:34:58.974
axis, away from the first,
by half the rotation

00:34:58.974 --> 00:35:01.970
angle of the axis.

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:06.520
So let's take a breather,
and let us

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.620
resume in about 10 minutes.

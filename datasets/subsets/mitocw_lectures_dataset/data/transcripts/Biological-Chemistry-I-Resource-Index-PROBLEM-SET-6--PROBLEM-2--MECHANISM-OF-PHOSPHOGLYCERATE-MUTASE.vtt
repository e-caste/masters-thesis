DR. BOGDAN FEDELES: Hello, and
welcome to 5.07 Biochemistry

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.300
online.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.100
I'm Dr. Bogdan Fedeles.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.250
Let's metabolize some problems.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.830
Today we're discussing
problem 2 of problem set 6.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.990
Here we're going to
explore in more detail

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.170
the mechanism of
phosphoglycerate mutase, which

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.920
is the eighth enzyme
in glycolysis.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.430
It's the enzyme that
catalyzes the conversion

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.820
of 3-phosphoglycerate
to 2-phosphoglycerate.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.130
Generally speaking,
mutases are enzymes

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.900
that catalyze the
shift of a functional

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.540
group between two similar
positions of a molecule.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.540
In the case of
phosphoglycerate mutase,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.820
this enzyme catalyzes
the transfer

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.935
of the phosphate group from
the 3 position of glycerate

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.190
to the 2 position of glycerate.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.730
In 5.07, you will
encounter several mutases.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.860
Similar to
phosphoglycerate mutase,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.020
there is a
bisphosphoglycerate mutase,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.420
which converts
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.480
to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.350
Now, this reaction
is very important

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.020
when it happens in
the red blood cells.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.960
Another mutase
you will encounter

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.470
is in the glycogen
breakdown pathway.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.390
It's called phosphoglucomutase
and converts

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.780
glucose 1-phosphate to
glucose 6-phosphate.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.720
Now finally, the most
intriguing of them

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.540
all is the
methylmalonyl-coa mutase,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.650
which is a fascinating enzyme
that converts methylmalonyl-coA

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.530
to succinyl-coA.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.250
In this reaction, it
rearranges this carbon skeleton

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.360
of the molecule, and it
requires adenosylcobalamin,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.330
which is a co-factor
derived from vitamin B12.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.139
Back to phosphoglycerate mutase,
this is a fascinating enzyme

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.110
because it uses a phosphorylated
histidine in the active site.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.490
And this is actually an example
of a phosphorous-nitrogen bond,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.820
one of the very few
available in biochemistry.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.100
Here is a schematic
of the mechanism

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.500
of phosphoglycerate mutase.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.310
Now, the reaction
starts where the enzyme

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.870
is already phosphorylated.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.430
We'll call it a phospho enzyme.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.260
And the histidine
in the active site

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.380
contains the phosphate group.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.480
Then the enzyme binds the
substrate 3-phosphoglycerate.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.470
And then it's going to transfer
this phosphate group onto the 2

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.400
position, the 2-hydroxyl of the
3-phosphoglycerate to generate

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.860
the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.800
Then the phosphate
at the 3 position

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.740
is transferred to the
histidine to generate

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.440
the product of the
reaction 2-phosphoglycerate

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.130
and regenerate
the phosphoenzyme.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.430
Note that the phosphate group
is in fact not transferred.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.890
This phosphate group
here is not the same

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.050
that ends up on the 2 position.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.740
But rather, this phosphate group
gets transferred to the enzyme.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.080
And the phosphate
group from the enzyme

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.872
ends up on the second
position of glycerate.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.260
As we just mentioned, the
active form of the enzyme

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.632
has already the phosphate
bound to histidine.

00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:30.840
Now the question is, how
did this phosphate get there

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.160
in the first place?

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.370
Presumably, the enzyme is
first synthesized in a form

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.850
that we call apo form, which
does not have the phosphate.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.580
And the phosphate is then
added as a post-translational

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.170
modification.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.710
Now, our problem suggests that
one source for this phosphate

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.780
is phosphoenolpyruvate.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.540
And there's some
experimental evidence

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.580
that phosphoenolpyruvate
can transfer their phosphate

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.970
and phosphorylate the
histidine in this enzyme.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.190
Now, we are asked
to comment on how

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.500
reasonable this proposal is.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.260
We're going to evaluate
the proposed transformation

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.770
between phosphoenolpyruvate
and phosphoglycerate mutase

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.400
from two points of view.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
First of all, is
this transformation

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.830
thermodynamically accessible?

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.990
And second, is this
structurally feasible?

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.690
We know that
phosphoenolpyruvate contains

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.150
a high-energy
phosphate bond that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.540
can release a lot of
energy upon hydrolysis.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.050
Now, if we look
in our book, this

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.400
is the Voet & Voet,
Third Edition.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.240
If we look here,
phosphoenolpyruvate,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.260
it says, releases about
62 kilojoules per mole

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.060
upon hydrolysis.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.510
Now this is significantly
more than what

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.210
energy is released by
the hydrolysis of ATP

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.150
going to ADP, which is only
about 31 kilojoules per mole.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.260
Now, this should not
be surprising to you

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.530
because PEP,
phosphoenolpyruvate,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.790
is used in the last
step of glycolysis,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.620
the pyruvate kinase, to
phosphorylate ADP and generate

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.710
ATP.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.640
So the fact it has a higher
energy of hydrolysis,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.830
it just makes that
transformation

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.900
thermodynamically accessible.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.600
Let's now take a look at
the arrow pushing mechanism

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.860
of how phosphoenolpyruvate
can phosphorylate

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.180
phosphoglycerate mutase.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.880
Here is the
phosphoenolpyruvate molecule,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.600
and here is the histidine in
the active site of the enzyme.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.330
Now, as you know, histidine
has a pKa of about 6,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.150
so an important fraction
of the histidine

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.670
will be protonated
at physiological pH.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.560
However, for this
reaction to work

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.600
we need the histidine
to act as a nucleophile

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.950
to attack the phosphate.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.830
Therefore, we're going to
consider it deprotonated.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.100
Now, the reaction
starts by assuming

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.470
there's a base in the
active site that's

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.100
going to deprotonate
the histidine,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.170
and then it's going to
attack the phosphate.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.640
And finally, the
phosphate group is

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.110
going to leave with the
assistance of a general acid.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.180
So these are the
products that we obtain.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.240
This is the phosphoenzyme with
the histidine that now has

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.070
the phosphate group attached.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.810
And this is the enol
that is released

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.880
from the
phosphoenolpyruvate, which is

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.200
the enol form of the pyruvate.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.900
Now, if we evaluate the starting
material and the product

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.150
in terms of their
ability to stabilize

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.030
negative charge, such as the
charges on the phosphate,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.170
by resonance--

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.440
We notice that there is
no significant difference.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.980
Here we have two negative
charges and one set

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.440
of phosphorus oxygen bonded.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.910
The charge can delocalize
on this oxygen.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.830
We also have this carboxylate
group, which we also have here.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.110
So there's not a lot of resonant
stabilization between starting

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.010
materials and products so far.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.870
Therefore, this reaction
is thermodynamically

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.550
close to neutral.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.960
However, notice the
enol form of pyruvate.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.230
Now this is in fact a
very unstable product.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.460
And it likes to
tautomerize, basically

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.590
isomerize in acid
base conditions

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.260
to the keto form of a pyruvate.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.300
The mechanism would
be, as such, the base

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.130
can deprotonate the enol.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:26.960
And then, the general acid
can protonate CH2 group

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.120
to generate the keto
form of the pyruvate.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.880
It turns out the delta G
for this transformation

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.580
is very negative.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:40.810
Delta G here is approximately
minus 40 kilojoules per mole.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.490
So that means this reaction is
strongly going to the right,

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.770
and strongly favors
the keto form.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.910
So that means per ensemble the
transformation going from PEP

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.950
in our histidine
in the active site

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.850
is going to be strongly
driven to the right because

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.240
of this keto equilibrium.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.830
Therefore, the entire
process shown here

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.930
is expected to be
thermodynamically very

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.190
favorable.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.130
Now let's take a look at some
structural considerations.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.560
In order for PEP to
phosporylate the enzyme,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.380
it has to be able to
reach the histidine that's

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.070
deep in the active site.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.190
Notice that the
2-phosphoglycerate

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.040
is one of the products or
substrates of the enzyme.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.480
And therefore, it fits very
nicely in the active site.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.650
Now phosphoenolpyruvate looks
a lot like 2-phosphoglycerate.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.840
Going to sketch it here, going
to have the phosphate there,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.200
and then there's the double
bond in this position.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.159
So because
phosphoenolpyruvate looks

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.820
a lot like 2-phosphoglycerate it
should have no problem fitting

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.830
inside the active
site of the enzyme

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.120
and reaching the
active site histidine.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.010
Therefore, the chemical reaction
proposed in this problem

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.330
is quite reasonable.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.460
First of all, the
thermodynamics are

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.640
excellent because the hydrolysis
of phosphoenolpyruvate

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.990
gives a lot of energy.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.650
And then the sterics are
also favorable because PEP

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.080
resembles
2-phosphoglycerate, one

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.420
of the products of the enzyme.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.030
Part 2 of this problem asks us
to evaluate the consequences

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.310
on the major function of
glycolysis of this reaction

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.370
that we just discussed--
of phosphoenolpyruvate

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.030
with phosphoglycerate mutase.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.160
Here is the second
half of glycolysis,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.980
going from glyceraldehyde
phosphate, or GAP, all the way

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.520
to pyruvate.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.530
As you know, the main
function of glycolysis

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.850
is to generate ATP.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.640
And for each
molecule of glucose,

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.595
we have a net generation
of two molecules of ATP.

00:09:42.595 --> 00:09:45.400
Now, ATP is produced
in two places.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.080
First, at the
phosphoglycerate kinase when

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.590
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate can
phosphorylate ADP to generate

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.580
ATP.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.920
And then the
pyruvate kinase where

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.720
phosphoenolpyruvate
phosphorylates

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.150
ADP to generate ATP.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.060
Now since we start glycolysis
by investing some ATP,

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.590
we need two molecules of ATP
to phosphorylate glucose.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.170
We recover those
two molecules of ATP

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.540
at the phosphoglycerate
kinase step.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.750
So all the net production of
ATP that we get in glycolysis

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.466
comes from the pyruvate
kinase reaction shown here.

00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:23.880
Now, if
phosphoenolpyruvate is used

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.190
to phosphorylate
phosphoglycerate mutase,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.210
basically, it's going
to react to give

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.700
the phosphate group here.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:38.080
It's going to generate pyruvate
but without generating ATP,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.580
right?

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.910
So the phosphate group goes to
this phosphoglycerate mutase,

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.010
and it generates
pyruvate, but we

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.150
get no net production of ATP.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.540
Now if PEP is used
to phosphorylate

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.760
phosphoglycerate
mutase, it's not

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.500
going to be available for
the pyruvate kinase step.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.230
But we do generate pyruvate,
so the whole transformation

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.230
reaches pyruvate, but without
producing a net amount of ATP.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.230
Of course, this should not
be a significant problem,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.020
as in glycolysis we
only require the enzymes

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.520
in catalytic amounts.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.980
So initially, we're not going to
be generating net amount of ATP

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.530
until we phosphorylate
the entire pool

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.240
of phosphoglycerate mutase.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.505
After that, now we have
phosphoglycerate mutase,

00:11:23.505 --> 00:11:27.210
so PEP is once again available
for the pyruvate kinase

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.760
reaction to generate ATP.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.210
I hope you noticed that there
is a more subtle question here.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.310
If we're going to use
PEP to phosphorylate

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.390
phosphoglycerate
mutase, how are we

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.490
going to get to produce
PEP in the first place

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.750
since we need
phosphoglycerate mutase to go

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.570
from 3-phosphoglycerate
to 2-phosphoglycerate,

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.490
which then produces PEP.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.040
Again, it's kind of like one
of these chicken and the egg

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.690
problems.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.300
As you'll find
out, many pathways

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.050
feed into or intersect
with glycolysis.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.180
And therefore,
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.390
could in principle be
made in other ways.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.550
For example, in
gluconeogenesis you'll

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:14.790
see that pyruvate can lead
to oxaloacetate, which then

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.000
can lead to phosphoenolpyruvate
using this enzyme called

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.560
PEP carboxykinase, or PEPCK.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.070
So there are ways to produce
phosphoenolpyruvate, which

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.920
can then, say, phosphorylate
phosphoglycerate mutase, which

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.290
then allows the glycolysis to
flow through in the normal way.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.120
Well, that's it
for this problem.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.430
I hope you found
pretty intriguing how

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.690
phosphoglycerate mutase works.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.020
Now remember, this is one
of the very few enzymes

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.950
in biochemistry that utilizes
the phosphorylated histidine.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.720
And this is one of
the few examples

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.470
of a phosphorus-nitrogen
bond we have in biochemistry.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.990
Also remember, the
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.980
is the highest high-energy
phosphate compound

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.730
we have in the body.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.180
But all that hydrolysis
energy really

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.610
comes from the keto
enol tautomerization

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:10.730
equilibrium of the pyruvate that
gets released upon hydrolysis.

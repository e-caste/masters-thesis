WEBVTT

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:21.280
ADAM MARTIN: And so today and
for the remainder of the week,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.000
the theme is going to be
the cell division cycle.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.880
And so we're going to really
talk about the cell division

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.770
cycle in every lecture this week
with the penultimate lecture

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.720
talking about how dysregulation
of the cell division cycle

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.170
results in a pathological
condition known as cancer.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.130
OK, so here is now a cell
going through the cell division

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.630
cycle.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.870
It's entered into
mitosis right now.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.130
And these guys here are the
chromosomes of the cell.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.520
And you're going to see them
line up at the metaphase plate.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.920
And eventually
they'll be segregated

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.270
to the two poles of the cell.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.330
And then the cell will
divide along its equator.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.170
OK, so I thought we
could start today

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.280
by just thinking about what
has to happen in a cell

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.000
during the cell division cycle.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.450
What has to happen during this
process in order for the cell

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.040
to replicate?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.430
Yes, Miles?

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.896
AUDIENCE: For all
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:30.896 --> 00:01:34.228
all those have to be duplicated
so that each cell has

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:35.656
a starting number.

00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:38.970
ADAM MARTIN: Mmm hmm.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.230
So Miles suggested
the organelles

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:50.140
have to be duplicated such that
the daughter cells can inherit

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.400
those organelles.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.710
And that's correct.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.690
What else has to happen?

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.240
Anything else have
to be duplicated?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.740
Stephen--

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.198
AUDIENCE: DNA has
to be duplicated.

00:01:59.198 --> 00:02:02.050
ADAM MARTIN: The DNA, the
nuclear DNA, the chromosomes,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.190
have to be duplicated.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.979
So the chromosomes
have to be duplicated--

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.260
duplicated.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.080
What else has to happen
every cell cycle?

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.960
What would happen to the size of
the cell just when it divides?

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.742
Yeah, Udo?

00:02:42.742 --> 00:02:45.160
AUDIENCE: It would grow.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.310
ADAM MARTIN: So Udo is
suggesting that the cell has

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.180
to grow, right?

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.210
Because if the cell didn't
grow, then cell division

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.640
would make smaller and
smaller and smaller cells.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.980
And so another thing the cell
has to do during the cell cycle

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.185
at some point, it
has to grow in size.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.980
OK, and what's the final
point of the cell cycle?

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.565
What happens?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.200
What's kind of the
goal of the cell cycle?

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.670
Yes, Stephen?

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.753
AUDIENCE: Undergo mitosis.

00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:20.850
ADAM MARTIN: To undergo mitosis.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.670
And so the cell has to
physically divide, right?

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.890
The chromosomes have
to be segregated,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.150
and the cell has to
physically divide.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.590
OK, so you can think
of the cell cycle

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.190
as the goal of getting
all these events to happen

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.400
is to get one cell
to become two cells.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.820
So you need chromosome
segregation.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.400
And you want an equal
segregation of genetic material

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.505
into two daughter cells
after the cell divides.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.660
OK, so today, we're going
to unpack the mechanisms

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.170
that allow a cell to
do many of these things

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.670
and how it's regulated.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.640
And one thing to
think about is, what

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.529
is going to determine
whether or not

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:21.209
a cell enters the cell division
cycle and undergoes a division?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.370
What do you think are
some things that cells

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.830
would care about if it's
trying to decide whether or not

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.430
to divide?

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.230
So one thing a cell is going to
care about in a multicellular

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.890
setting is whether it's getting
appropriate communications

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.010
from other cells that
are telling it to divide.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.840
And remember,
Professor Imperiali

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.370
told you about signaling.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.540
And one example was receptor
tyrosine kinase signaling.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.170
And this is just a diagram
showing you the RAS map kinase

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.400
pathway.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.330
And one of the effects
of this signaling pathway

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.560
is to promote cells to enter
the cell division cycle in order

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.320
to divide, OK?

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.070
So this is in a
multicellular organism,

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.880
the signaling is important.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.420
For unicellular organisms, cells
might care about whether or not

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.320
there are nutrients present
or whether or not the cell is

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.050
of the right size, OK?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.320
So cells have to
make the decision.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.570
I'm going to focus mainly
on cell communication

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.490
and how that might change
the cell physiology.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.260
And I want to start
by just giving you

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
a little bit of an overview
of the cell division cycle.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.270
So there are four
distinct phases

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.670
of the cell division cycle.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.010
And I split them
into two classes.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.490
There are phases where things
physically happen to the cell.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.420
And those are S
phase and M phase.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.790
And so during S phase, S phase
stands for DNA synthesis.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.300
And it's during this phase when
the nuclear DNA is replicated,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.440
OK?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.310
And so for each of the
action phases, if you will,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.020
there's some sort
of machinery that's

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.260
involved in changing the cell.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.030
In the case of S
phase, that would

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.610
be DNA polymerase and helicases
that mediate the replication.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:29.150
So helicases, DNA polymerase.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.090
And you remember from
earlier in the semester

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.310
when we talked about
DNA replication

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.140
all of the proteins
that are involved

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.170
in replicating a chromosome.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.370
OK, the other phase where
something really physical

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.725
happens is M phase,
which is mitosis.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.090
And during M phase, this is
when the sister chromatids

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.930
of each chromosome are
separated to the daughter cells.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.260
OK, so this is when chromosome
segregation happens.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.950
And again, during
this phase, there

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.290
has to be some sort
of machine that

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.160
gets activated at this phase
of the cell cycle in order

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.310
to, in this case, physically
separate the chromosomes

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.900
from each other.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:29.550
And that machine in M phase
is the mitotic spindle,

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.850
which you'll recall is a machine
that consists of microtubules.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.610
So these are microtubules.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.650
And in each cell cycle,
these events have to happen.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.080
But they have to
happen in order, right?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.930
You need DNA synthesis before
you segregate the chromosomes,

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.430
right?

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.650
So there has to be
an order to this.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.375
So these other phases
are called gap phases.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.835
And there are two
of them, G1 and G2.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.130
And events happen
during these gap phases

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:19.560
to help to ensure that things
happen in the right order.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.910
And so in G1, the cell has
to decide whether or not

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.010
to enter into the cell cycle.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.540
So some things to consider
here, the one that I mentioned

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.135
before is whether or not there
are growth signals present.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.440
OK, so for a metazoan
cell, it's important

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.460
that the cell doesn't just
divide without any regard

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.830
to what's going on
in the surroundings.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.350
There needs to be a
communication between cells

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.930
such that there's the
proper balance of cell

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.340
division in a tissue
for specific cell types.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.080
OK, so this G1
phase, this is when

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.720
the cell-- if the cell
goes from G1 to S,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.140
this is when the cell
commits to the cell cycle.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.980
So G1 to S, this
is the time when

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.225
the cell commits to going
through the entire cell cycle.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.460
So if the cell passes
this G1 to S transition,

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.820
then the cell has committed to
going through the entire cell

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.800
cycle.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.270
OK, the other phase,
this G2 phase,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.650
ensures that this type
of quality control that

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.890
happens, it has to ensure
that the DNA is replicated

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.700
before the cell
moves on to mitosis.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.850
So you can think of G2
as a phase where there's

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.420
a quality control
mechanism and the cell

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.570
cares about whether or not
its DNA is replicated or not.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.320
OK, so now I want to
tell you basically

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:16.040
the answer as to how this system
works in a eukaryotic cell.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.000
And this system requires
a level of control.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.010
And it requires
a control system.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.190
And what this
control system does

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.860
is to ensure that these
different events that

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.730
happen during a cell cycle
occur in the right order.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.395
OK, so this control system is
going to ensure proper order.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.800
And there are two
main components

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.930
to this control system.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:11:01.200
The first is called cyclin
dependent kinase, or CDK.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.050
And so cyclin dependent
kinase is a kinase,

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.570
so it can post-translationally
modify other proteins

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.370
by adding a phosphate
group to them.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.510
And so it's through
that mechanism

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:25.460
that cyclin dependent kinase can
modify events and control when

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.800
they happen in the cell cycle.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.940
OK, and the other key
component of the system

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.280
is a protein called cyclin.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:41.130
And what cyclin is is it's the
regulatory subunit of the CDK.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.240
So this is the regulatory
subunit of CDK.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.910
And so without the cyclin,
the cyclin dependent kinase

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.280
is inactive, OK?

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.860
So the CDK needs the
cyclin to have activity.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:08.190
So cyclins increase the
activity or activate CDK.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.180
OK, but there are different
flavors of cyclins.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.440
There are actually
many different cyclins,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.660
at least four
classes of cyclins.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.020
And these cyclins appear at
different phases of the cell

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.700
cycle and then go away.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.220
OK, so the cyclins oscillate
that's why they're called

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.470
cyclins, because
they come on and off.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.430
And depending on which
cyclin is present

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.990
determines what CDK is
going to phosphorylate, OK?

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:46.020
So these cyclins also
determine substrate specificity

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.520
of the kinase.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:55.230
So which cyclin determines what
protein the CDK phosphorylates.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.110
So I've outlined three
classes of cyclins here.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.060
Here is a G1S cyclin
in complex of CDK.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:14.500
And then here's an S cyclin
complex with CDK in red.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.630
And so what do you
think the S cyclin

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.730
CDK is going to phosphorylate,
what kind of protein?

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.060
Anyone have a guess?

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.510
Miles--

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.965
AUDIENCE: Helicase.

00:13:27.965 --> 00:13:30.430
ADAM MARTIN: Yes, you're
actually exactly right.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.130
It's going to
phosphorylate and activate

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.070
things that are involved
in DNA replication.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.390
And Miles is right.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.210
Helicase is one of the proteins
that gets phosphorylated

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.820
by S cyclin CDK.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:48.100
And then similarly, M cyclin
CDK, which appears here

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.120
in blue during
mitosis, M cyclin CDK

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.310
is going to
phosphorylate proteins

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.680
that are involved in
forming the mitotic spindle

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.610
so that it induces cell cycle
events that happen specifically

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.500
during mitosis.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.580
OK, so you all see it depends
which cyclin is present

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.060
that determines what cell cycle
events are happening at a given

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.080
time.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.320
And therefore, it's
important that we understand

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.250
how these cyclins appear at
distinct cell cycle phases

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.040
and whether or not that's the
mechanism for the oscillation.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.780
Yes, miles--

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.508
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about [INAUDIBLE] question

00:14:25.508 --> 00:14:28.703
about mitosis [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:33.970
So I know that microtubules make
sure the chromosomes separate

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.140
from the cell.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.305
How does a cell
regulate having half

00:14:38.305 --> 00:14:43.274
of the organelles on each side
[INAUDIBLE] split [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:43.274 --> 00:14:45.940
ADAM MARTIN: Some
organisms employee motors

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.100
such that organelles
are physically sort

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.590
of put in daughter cells.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.100
But I think often it's
just random, right?

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.600
If you dissolve the
organelle and it

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.060
becomes kind of a bunch
of different vesicles,

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.720
then if you just split in half,
there's a high probability

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.720
that each daughter cell will
get parts of the organelle, OK?

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.030
So organelles can
change their morphology

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.000
during the division
process in such a way

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.030
that they're able to be
inherited by both daughter

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.670
cells.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.250
OK, that's an
excellent question.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.820
So it's the cyclins that really
determine what's happening.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.920
And I just wanted
to point out here

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:32.030
that one of the main
transcriptional targets of RTK

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.690
signaling is this G1 cyclin, OK?

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.750
So it's these
signaling pathways that

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.330
lead to the increase
in G1 cyclin

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.540
that start the cell on
this process of entering

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.290
into the cell cycle, OK?

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:55.390
So you get these cyclins
getting synthesized.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.090
And the cyclins appear
in a defined order.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:05.290
OK, so there are
different cyclins,

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:10.000
but they appear relative to each
other in a stereotypical order.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.440
So they appear in order.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.150
And it's that
order of the cyclin

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.790
that defines which cell
cycle events happen

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.590
at what time in a cell.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.220
OK, now I want to tell
you a little bit about how

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.060
the machinery that's involved
in the control of the cell cycle

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.710
was discovered.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.175
And I'm going to
start by telling you

00:16:35.175 --> 00:16:36.550
a little bit about
budding yeast.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.250
And by showing you how
this was discovered,

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.120
it will give you a sense as
to how this system controls

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.400
the cell division cycle.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.800
You'll recall that
budding yeast can

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.040
exist as a haploid
cell in addition

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.700
to existing as a diploid cell.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.070
So there's a
haploid/diploid life cycle.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.390
Also, one nice feature
of budding yeast

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.569
for this particular
question is that you

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.869
can infer the cell cycle
morphology of the yeast

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:17.510
just by looking
at its morphology.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.339
So budding yeast
divides by budding.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.349
And the size of
the bud indicates

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:27.790
what cell cycle phase
the cell is in, OK?

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:36.760
So you can infer
cell cycle phase

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.590
by morphology of the yeast cell.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.170
So for example, if
we look up here,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:54.190
here's an unbudded yeast
cell that's probably in G1.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.830
Here's a yeast cell with
a little teeny bud on it.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.050
That's probably an S phase.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.850
Next to it over here is one
that's a slightly bigger bud.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.800
And here's one with
an even bigger bud.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.720
And that one might
be in G2 phase.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.810
OK, so because this
bud grows in size

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.910
over the course
of the cell cycle,

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.070
you can just look at
a yeast cell and infer

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.120
what the cell cycle phase is.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.690
OK, so I'm going to tell you
about a genetic screen that

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:28.660
was done to look for mutants
that were defective in the cell

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.820
division cycle.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.650
And these are known
as cell division

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.355
cycle, or CDC, mutants.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.500
Now, what type of yeast cell,
haploid of diploid, might

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.350
you want to screen mutants with?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:55.170
What would be the advantages
of either one or the other?

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:55.770
Yeah, Natalie?

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.180
AUDIENCE: Would you do
haploid, because if it's

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.072
a recessive mutation
[INAUDIBLE] expressed?

00:19:01.072 --> 00:19:03.330
ADAM MARTIN: Yes,
so what Natalie

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.870
suggested is to start
with the haploid mutants

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.990
because there's only one
copy of each gene such

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.290
that if you hit it, now you
no longer have a functional

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.640
copy of that gene.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.060
If you started with
a diploid cell,

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.040
you'd have two
copies of the gene.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.610
And you'd have to have two
mutations both happening

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.410
in the same gene, which
would be a rare event.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:30.390
OK, so it's better to start
with a haploid in this case.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.580
Now, what's the problem if
you mutate a gene that's

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.690
involved in the cell cycle?

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.660
What's going to
be the phenotype,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.786
the immediate visible phenotype?

00:19:39.786 --> 00:19:41.830
Is it going to be alive or dead?

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.330
Carmen--

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.050
AUDIENCE: Dead.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.960
ADAM MARTIN: It's going
to be dead, right?

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.690
And it's hard to work with
an organism that's dead.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.430
OK, so what was done is to look
for a particular type of mutant

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.860
which is known as a
temperature sensitive mutant.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.050
And a temperature
sensitive mutant

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.410
is a mutant where
the cell or organism

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.050
is alive and well
at one temperature

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.230
but dead at another
temperature, OK?

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:21.090
And so the screen basically
involved taking yeast.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.880
Here's yeast growing
in a test tube.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.805
And this is now haploid yeast.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.330
And you can treat that
yeast with a mutagen.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.410
It doesn't matter what,
just something that

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:38.520
will induce mutations at a
high rate in these yeast cells.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.620
And then you can
take these cells

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:45.150
and plate them on media
where individual cells will

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.095
grow into colonies.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:56.020
OK, and if you grow it at
22 degrees C for yeast, this

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.750
is the most moderate
temperature you can choose.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.723
So this is what's known as
the permissive temperature.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:10.020
OK, but you can also take
this plate of used colonies

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.677
and duplicate it and grow
it at another temperature.

00:21:14.677 --> 00:21:16.260
And you might get
something that looks

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:21.000
like this, where you see this
colony grew at 22 degrees,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.900
but at 37 degrees
C it did not grow.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.180
And that would suggest
that, then, this has

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.650
a temperature sensitive mutant.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.970
And this temperature
of 37 degrees

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.214
is known as the
restrictive temperature.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.130
OK, so that would identify a
temperature sensitive mutant.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.380
Now, is every temperature
sensitive mutant

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.790
that you identify, is that going
to be a cell division cycle

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.460
mutant?

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.410
Miles, you're
shaking your head no.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.070
Why is that?

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.210
Can you explain your logic?

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:02.060
AUDIENCE: So there could be
a couple different proteins

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.360
[INAUDIBLE] there's
too many mechanisms

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.050
in the cell that could be
dependent on temperature

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.520
to narrow down to just
[INAUDIBLE] mutant cell cycle.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.500
For example, if a
phytoprotein mutant organism

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.590
would mutate [INAUDIBLE]
temperature sensitive,

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.084
without that protein
it would die also.

00:22:20.084 --> 00:22:21.140
ADAM MARTIN: Exactly.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.340
So Miles is suggesting
that if you just mutated

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:31.800
any old gene that was involved
in viability for this yeast,

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.690
and it unfolded at 37 degrees
because you sort of made

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.250
a mutation that
made it unstable,

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.210
then you would identify that as
a temperature sensitive mutant.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.240
So what would be a
good criteria, I guess,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.840
that we could use to select just
the mutants that are affecting

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.480
the cell division cycle?

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.240
Might there be a way
for us to do that?

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.930
I guess I'm asking, can we
narrow down the phenotype,

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:58.500
right?

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.480
Temperature
sensitivity could be--

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.790
by affecting any
process in yeast,

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.200
is there a way we can gear
it towards the cell division

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:05.700
cycle?

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.327
Diana--

00:23:10.327 --> 00:23:12.820
AUDIENCE: Maybe [INAUDIBLE]
specific phase of the cell

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.175
cycle, you could look
at the morphology of it.

00:23:16.175 --> 00:23:19.080
And if all of them
stop at the same phase,

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.383
you might assume
that you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:21.383 --> 00:23:22.800
ADAM MARTIN: All
right, very good.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.200
So Diana is suggesting is that
we looked for a phenotype.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.950
And she's guessed
that the phenotype,

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:34.430
if this gene is involved in sort
of mediating a change from one

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.250
cell cycle to phase to
another, that if you

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:41.360
mutate that, you'd have yeast
that's all stuck in one phase,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.170
OK?

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:47.450
And that's indeed the phenotype
that was screened for.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.650
OK, and so if you just take
a random population of yeast

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.100
that's dividing,
you'll see cells

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.050
that are unbudded, small
budded, slightly bigger budded.

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.720
And if you count the number
of cells, what you'll see

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.750
is that most of your
cells are unbudded.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.370
Some are small budded.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.850
And a larger percentage
are large budded.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.480
And this just reflects the
relative amount of time

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.300
that yeast is in each of these
phases of the cell cycle.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.990
So yeast spends most
of its time in G1.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:24.170
Therefore, if you look at a
random population of yeast,

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.350
you'll see most of the cells
will be in the unbudded state.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:31.550
OK, so this is for
wild-type normal yeast.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.140
Now, what was identified is
a cell division cycle mutant,

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:42.790
CDC 28, which at the
restrictive temperature

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:46.450
causes a train wreck at a
specific phase of the cell

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.980
cycle.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.620
So all of the cells now are
stuck in the unbudded state.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:00.400
And so this suggests
that these cells, when

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.100
they are shifted to the
restrictive temperature,

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.530
are still able to move
through the cell cycle.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.650
But once they get to this
phase, they get stuck.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:20.360
OK, so here there is a
cell cycle arrest at G1.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.870
And they confirmed it was G1
by measuring the DNA content.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.660
And by measuring
the DNA content,

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:33.190
they were able to show
that these cells did not

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.730
duplicate their DNA.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.120
So they didn't even
start to undergo S phase.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.140
They were stuck in G1, OK?

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:50.890
OK, so that suggests that
the CDC 28 gene is required

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.440
for cells to go from G1 to Sl.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.680
OK, so the wild-type
CDC 28 gene is

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.660
required for this transition
from G1 into the S phase.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.370
And it turns out that this yeast
CDC 28 gene is the one yeast

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.210
cyclin dependent kinase, OK?

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.620
So this was sort of
the defining mutant

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.570
for cyclin dependent kinase.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.400
And you'll recall
earlier in the semester

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.160
when we talked about
molecular biology

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.030
that we talked about work
done by Paul Nurse who

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.940
used functional
complementation to clone

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.520
the human cyclin
dependent kinase

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:35.050
by transforming DNA into a
different yeast, fission yeast.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.080
But again, that rescued
the cell cycle arrest.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.810
And that's how the human
cyclin dependent kinase

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.450
was discovered.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.040
And I just wanted
to point out here

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.400
that the work I'm
telling you about

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.520
was awarded the Nobel Prize
in physiology and medicine

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.260
in 2001.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.380
And it was awarded to
Leland Hartwell, Tim Hunt,

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.940
and Sir Paul Nurse.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.920
Leland Hartwell did
the screen that I just

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.100
told you about there
and identified CDC 28.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.880
And we already talked about Paul
Nurse earlier in the semester.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.710
Tim Hunt worked on clams and sea
urchins and identified cyclin.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.900
So this was the
work that identified

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.690
the regulatory machinery
of the cell cycle.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.480
And they sort of
showed that this

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.820
worked in a number of
different organisms.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.830
And they showed that
it was evolutionarily

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.760
conserved from yeast
all the way to humans.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.990
OK, so this is a
conserved mechanism.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:38.640
OK, so there's a mechanism
that actively governs

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.610
the transition from
G1 to S. And I'll

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:46.710
point out this transition
is known as start in yeast.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.215
And it's called the restriction
point in mammalian cells.

00:27:49.215 --> 00:27:51.795
It's kind of the point of
no return in the cell cycle.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.970
But the cell cycle
doesn't just blindly

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.220
charge through the
rest of the way.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.560
And there are certain
quality control mechanisms

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.140
that are in place to
ensure that things happen

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.340
in the proper order and that
the quality of events happening

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.220
is good before the cell
moves on to the next stage.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:17.070
And so I'm going to define a
concept called a checkpoint.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.420
And the checkpoint is a type
of quality control mechanism.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:27.120
And checkpoints operate
in the cell cycle

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:34.830
to ensure that one event
doesn't occur till the preceding

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.780
event happens correctly, OK?

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:47.560
So this ensures
proper order of events

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.140
and ensures that
events happen correctly

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:54.670
before the next subsequent
event has to occur.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.520
OK, so one example of
this is, if you just

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.330
consider S phase and M
phase, DNA replication

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:05.350
has to finish before the cell
starts segregating chromosomes.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:09.310
Otherwise there's going to
be catastrophic consequences,

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:13.510
such as possibly creating
a cancer cell, OK?

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:18.310
So one example of a checkpoint
is called the DNA damage

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.010
checkpoint.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.020
And what the DNA
damage checkpoint does

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:35.340
is it looks to see
if there's DNA damage

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.530
or if the DNA is
still replicating.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.460
And if either of these
cases is present in a cell,

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.555
then it sends a signal.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:57.120
And that signal, in order to
influence the cell division

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.640
cycle, has to interface with the
cyclin CDK control machinery,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.600
OK?

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.800
So this signal will
then inhibit cyclin CDK.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:16.920
And cyclin CDK governs two major
transitions in the cell cycle.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.785
So there are two major what
I'll call transition points.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.210
There's the G1 to S, which
I just outlined over there,

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.400
which is called start.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:35.790
So there's G1 to S. But
there's also G2 to M, OK?

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:39.030
So these, basically, the
transition out of the gap

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.820
phases, those are the
key transition points

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.280
that can be
regulated by the cell

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.720
to either slow things down
to halt the transition

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.590
or just go right through, OK?

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.080
So let me tell you
about an experiment that

00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:00.840
defined the functionality of
the DNA damage checkpoint.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:06.475
And I'm going to tell you about
work done by Weinert and Leland

00:31:06.475 --> 00:31:06.975
Hartwell.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.930
And it was published in 1988.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.100
And they were interested in
what the nature and the function

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.710
of these checkpoints was.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.800
And so you can
take budding yeast.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.260
And you can damage its DNA
by irradiating the cells

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:26.760
with X-rays.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.360
And if you irradiate
the cell with X-rays

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:38.700
in a wild-type normal yeast,
so in the normal yeast that's

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.710
not mutant, then
this damages the DNA.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.580
And the cell stays in G2.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.975
OK, so it stays in G2.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.170
OK, and there's a delay.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.750
OK, so here what I'm
drawing is a G2 delay.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:02.070
So the cell spends an
abnormally longer time in G2

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.875
than it normally would if
you didn't damage its DNA.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.910
All right, and then over time it
will continue in the cell cycle

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.700
and enter into the
next cell cycle.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:20.970
And what's interesting about
this is that these cells live.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.360
OK, so one interpretation
from this result

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.390
is you damage the cell's DNA.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.820
It delayed the cell cycle in G2.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.450
So it didn't rush right
into chromosome segregation.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.960
And that allowed the cell
time to repair its DNA.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.580
And that enabled the cell
daughters to live, OK?

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.050
So that's an interpretation.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:48.270
Now, part of the evidence
for that interpretation

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:52.560
is that Hartwell and Weinert
discovered a mutant called

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.190
RAD 9, so the RAD 9 mutant.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.140
And RAD 9 stands for
radiation sensitive.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.530
This is a radiation
sensitive mutant.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.590
And this particular
radiation sensitive mutant

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.750
disrupted the delay.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:09.930
So it disrupted the
checkpoint here.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.320
So what happens in
a RAD 9 mutant is,

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.300
again, you irradiate
cells with X-rays.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:22.440
The cell goes from
S phase to G2.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:28.770
But this time, there's no
delay, so it goes from G2,

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.830
the poor yeast
charges unsuspectingly

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:36.600
into mitosis with
damaged DNA and divides.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.880
But in this case,
there's a high level

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.220
of death in the
resulting progeny.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.320
So here you have death.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.570
OK, so RAD 9, then,
is a gene that

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:53.710
is involved in promoting
the cell cycle delay such

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:57.200
that the yeast cell has
time to repair its DNA.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.990
And if you remove that delay--

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.045
so here there's no delay.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.810
If you disrupt this delay, which
defines the checkpoint process,

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:09.310
right?

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:13.150
The checkpoint is a process
whereby if there's DNA damage,

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:15.850
you delay the cell cycle
such that the cell has

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.770
time to repair it.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.489
If you don't have that,
it has bad consequences

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:25.210
for the cell and results
in your cells undergoing

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:29.345
premature mitosis before they've
had a chance to repair the DNA.

00:34:35.262 --> 00:34:36.000
Let's see.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.600
I'm going to use this one here.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.030
All right, one thing
you might be wondering

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:47.489
is what causes these cyclin
proteins to oscillate.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.560
And so the last
point I want to make

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.650
is I want to tell you about
the mechanism that allows

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:55.230
these protein oscillations.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.630
And it involves a
mechanism that's

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.540
going to be new
for you, at least

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.740
from the context of this class.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.740
It's a mechanism that's
regulated proteolysis.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.380
OK, so there's a regulated
degradation of these cyclin

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.880
proteins that allows them
to go up and then down, OK?

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.980
So if we consider just one
part of the cell cycle,

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:30.940
well, if I plot the
concentration of cyclin

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.630
and we look at M cyclin
from G2 to M phase--

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.840
so this here is a time axis--

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.970
the M cyclin goes up in M phase.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:46.350
And then it drops precipitously
during mitosis, specifically

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:54.580
at the metaphase/anaphase OK, so
this is for the mitotic cyclin.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.080
And I'm going to tell you
that this precipitous decline

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.690
in cyclin levels is due
to regulated proteolysis.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.580
OK, and it involves a
mechanism that you were briefly

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.400
introduced to by
Professor Imperiali,

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.620
because it involves a small
protein known as ubiquitin.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.180
What ubiquitin is is it's a
small 76 amino acid protein.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.295
So it's a 76 amino acid protein.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.520
But this protein can get
attached to other proteins.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.170
So it's a post-translational
modification.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:43.740
OK, so ubiquitin, which
I'll abbreviate UB,

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:52.385
ubiquitin is attached to
lysines on a target protein.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:07.070
And the attachment of ubiquitins
to lysines of a protein

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.420
has important consequences.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.180
And what Professor
Imperiali told

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.140
you about is when this
happens in the case of protein

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.610
misfolding.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.430
But this ubiquitination
of proteins

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:24.080
also occurs to proteins that
are not denatured or misfolded.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.160
And it's a way of regulating
protein levels in the cell.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.980
OK, so what happens is--

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:36.980
I'll show you a complicated
diagram of what happens.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.650
But I'm really going to focus
on this step right here.

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.600
There's a series
of steps that are

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.730
needed to get ubiquitin to get
attached to the target protein.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.830
I'm going to ignore
pretty much all of that.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.580
But there is an E2
enzyme that becomes

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.980
conjugated with ubiquitin.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:58.545
And then the ubiquitin is able
to be transferred to a target

00:37:58.545 --> 00:37:59.045
protein.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.110
And rather than
make this generic,

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:08.463
I'll let you know the target
protein is going to be cyclin.

00:38:08.463 --> 00:38:09.505
So we'll just say cyclin.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:18.050
And so there's an enzyme
that transfers the ubiquitin

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:24.710
from the E2 to the cyclin, OK?

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.080
And it's
polyubiquitinated, meaning

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.820
there's a chain of ubiquitins
added to the cyclin.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.900
And it's carried out by a
particular type of enzyme known

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.610
as an E3 ubiquitin ligase.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:46.250
And there are hundreds of these
ubiquitin ligases in humans.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:50.180
And different E3
ubiquitin ligases

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.920
confer different specificities.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.800
So they target
different proteins, OK?

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.710
So different E3's target
different proteins.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:04.970
And so this is where the
specificity comes from, OK?

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:08.930
So when a protein in the
cell, misfolded or not,

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.620
is polyubiquitinated
like this, this

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.900
is a garbage tag on
that protein, OK?

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.080
So you can think of
polyubiquitin as a garbage tag.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.390
And once it's
polyubiquitinated, it's

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:30.060
sent to the proteasome, which
Professor Imperiali showed you.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.500
And this is the structure
that degrades proteins.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.270
OK, so if the protein is
targeted for degradation

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:42.170
by putting this tag on it, it's
going to be rapidly proteolyzed

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.760
in the cytoplasm of the cell.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:50.720
All right, now I want to show
you some experiments that

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.520
provided the first evidence that
this regulated proteolysis is

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:59.480
what sort of causes the
cyclin to oscillate, OK?

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.720
And it's going to involve
a new model organism.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.778
Is there anyone here
that has ranidaphobia?

00:40:07.778 --> 00:40:09.560
OK, we all like frogs?

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:15.260
OK, so this model organism
is xenopus laevis,

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.330
or the African clawed frog.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:20.060
And I want to thank my
colleague at UMass Amherst, Tom

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:24.620
[? Oreska, ?] who provided
the slides of frogs for me.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.010
So what's great
about these frogs,

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.410
well, other than
them being very cute,

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:32.900
is that they lay a ton of eggs.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.760
And the eggs are huge, OK?

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.760
So here is a mom, a mom frog.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.850
And then you see all these
circular things all around

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:42.620
the frog are the eggs.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.110
OK, so they're about
1 millimeter in size.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.190
They're huge.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.700
You can collect these eggs,
put them in a test tube.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.590
And you can see all
these eggs that you

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.510
have in this test tube.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:56.390
And then you can
spin the test tube.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:00.320
And by spinning the test
tube in a centrifuge,

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.680
you crush the eggs.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.200
And so that results
in this middle layer

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.680
here, which is cytoplasm, OK?

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.470
And you can remove
it with a syringe.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:19.190
And what you end up with is
a concentrated cytoplasmic

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.690
extract.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.780
So that's all cytoplasm.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.960
OK, so that's a
lot of cytoplasm.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:40.230
OK, so for the xenopus
system, this system

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:43.050
allows you to get this
highly concentrated--

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.440
because it's not diluted.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:48.150
It's the same concentration
as cytoplasm almost--

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:56.700
cytoplasmic extract, which is
known as xenopus egg extract.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.720
OK, and what's amazing
about this egg extract

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.360
is it can go through
the cell cycle

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.980
even though it's not in a cell.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:09.060
OK, so you can get this
extract to essentially simulate

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.470
the cell cycle.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:13.470
OK, so you have to
mimic fertilization,

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.460
because that's when cell
divisions start to happen

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.610
in the normal frog embryo.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:25.290
But once you do this, then you
mimic the fertilization process

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.660
by adding calcium,
and then you'll

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.640
see this extract go
through the cell cycle.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.790
And you can see it by
looking at the morphology

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:35.430
of different structures
in the extract.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:39.210
So this is a nucleus that
has assembled an extract

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.340
around some DNA that was added.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.800
OK, DNA replication can
happen in this nucleus.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.890
Other events that happen in the
interphase of the cell cycle

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:52.530
also happen in this extract.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.830
And if you wait, then
it will go into mitosis.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.620
And you'll start to see
mitotic spindles assembling

00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.590
in the extract.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:04.170
OK, so what's important about
this, this is totally in vitro.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.020
OK, so this is an
in vitro system.

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.660
There are no cells.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:13.620
But you're able to see the
extract go through the cell

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:14.370
cycle.

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:19.020
OK, and if you were able to
look at cyclin, like M cyclin,

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:22.990
you'd see that M cyclin levels
go up and then down and up

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.490
and down.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:27.940
They oscillate just like
they would in a cell.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.650
And this is just a
diagram showing you

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:34.430
that here where mitotic
cyclin, M cyclin, concentration

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:39.260
is in blue and CDK activity
for M cyclin CDK is in purple.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.150
So you see it goes up.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:43.370
And then the cell
enters mitosis.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.930
Early mitosis is in blue.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.280
Late mitosis is an orange.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.420
So you see mitosis happens
when M cyclin is high,

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.060
just like it does in a cell.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.500
And then it degrades.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.030
And then it repeats.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.700
OK, so this is all
outside of a cell.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.650
But you're just
looking in a test tube.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.960
And you can recreate
the cell cycle.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.800
Now, this, because this
is a biochemical system,

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.570
allowed these researchers--

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.210
in this case, the researchers
who did this experiment

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:14.670
were Andrew Murray and
Mark Kirchner at Harvard.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:18.270
And what they did was to test
the role of various components

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:19.970
in this oscillation.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:21.710
The first experiment
they did was

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:25.910
to RNase treat the extract
to get rid of all the mRNA.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:29.720
And if you degrade all of
the mRNA in this extract,

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.580
you no longer get the cycling.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.680
You no longer get
the cell cycle.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.240
So this shows you mRNA is
important or necessary.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:43.420
But you don't know
which mRNA, right?

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:48.860
One hypothesis might be that
you need the mRNA from M cyclin

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.980
in order to produce
cyclin every cell cycle.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.000
And that was their hypothesis.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.120
So what they did to test that
was to degrade all the mRNA,

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.660
inactivate the RNase, and
then add back the mRNA

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.627
to one gene, that
mitotic cyclin.

00:45:05.627 --> 00:45:07.460
And what they saw when
they did that is they

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.310
restored the cell
cycle, suggesting

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:15.980
that this one mRNA, M cyclin,
is sufficient to restore

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:20.090
the oscillation of
the mitotic cycle.

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.070
OK, now, the last
experiment, which

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:25.920
I think is the most important,
shows you the mechanism

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.230
by which the cyclin is going.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.890
Because they added-- and
instead of adding back

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:34.590
the wild-type
mitotic cyclin, they

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:39.020
added back a cyclin mutant that
was non-degraded all by this E3

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.980
ubiquitin ligase mechanism.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:51.580
OK, so if they add back a cyclin
mutant and this mutant has

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:56.380
a deletion in the part of the
protein called the destruction

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.670
box--

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.310
and this is essentially
the part of the protein

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:06.430
that is recognized by the
E3 ubiquitin ligase, OK?

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:11.980
So the destruction box mutant
basically blocks this such

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.130
that cyclin is no
longer polyubiquitinated

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:18.890
and it can't be targeted
for proteolysis.

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:22.760
OK, and in this
case, what happens

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.340
is cyclin levels increase.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.600
And then they stay high
and there's no cycle.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.770
OK, so when you have this cyclin
mutant with the destruction

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.980
box deleted such that
it's non-degraded,

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.845
it's not degraded, you
get a cell cycle arrest.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:48.490
And because this is M cyclin,
the cell arrests in mitosis.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:52.220
You get a mitotic
arrest, a mitotic arrest.

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:59.420
OK, any questions
about this mechanism

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.360
of proteolytic degradation?

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.700
You all see how this--

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:04.820
yes, Malik?

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.313
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
cell [INAUDIBLE] what is it

00:47:09.313 --> 00:47:10.496
physically doing?

00:47:10.496 --> 00:47:12.450
ADAM MARTIN: What is
it physically doing?

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:15.390
It's basically stuck
with a mitotic spindle

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:18.340
and it's not segregating
the chromosomes.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.000
Yeah, so it hasn't
gone through mitosis.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.810
It's stuck in a specific
phase of mitosis.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.460
In this case, it's
stuck in basically

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.100
a metaphase-like state.

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:32.490
One last point I want
to make about this

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:36.760
is that the mRNA for M
cyclin is just constant.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.380
It's always present.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.160
So this is constant.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.920
You have constant mRNA.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.670
CDK is constant.

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:47.610
It's the cyclin protein
that's going up and down.

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:50.250
And it's going up and down
because of this regulated

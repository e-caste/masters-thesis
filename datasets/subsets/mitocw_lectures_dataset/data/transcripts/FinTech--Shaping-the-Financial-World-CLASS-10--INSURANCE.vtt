00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.750
GARY GENSLER:
Welcome to FinTech--

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.650
Shaping the Future of
The World of Finance.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.820
And happy spring.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.540
It's May.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.328
I thought what the heck?

00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:23.870
You've got to be a
little innovative.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.520
Try teaching from outdoor.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.650
So this is not a
virtual backdrop.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.290
If the sun is too much or
the birds are too much,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.100
that's an additional thing
Romain can give me advice on.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.870
Now today we're going to dive
into insurance and technology

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.700
or what some call this little
sector of fintech as insurtech.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.730
But it's not so
little, it's not just

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.930
simply because the excitement is
around payments and challenger

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.330
banks and apps like Robinhood
and the capital markets

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.349
and so forth that we leave
insurtech to the end.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.020
I also think insurtech
is an interesting field

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.370
that it brings all the
pieces together in some way.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.240
It brings together
a part of finance

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.000
that has big legacy incumbents.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.090
In every country
we're in, there is

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.900
this handful of life-insurance
companies and property

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.220
and casualty insurance--
that's those that offer lines

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.220
of insurance on our homes,
our autos, and so forth;

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.150
health-care insurers,
particularly

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.785
in those countries that
have, like the US, big,

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:44.650
open health-care systems.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.740
These insurance companies,
big, legacy companies,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.200
have tended to be a little
behind the curve of technology

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.000
compared to the
Wall Street firms--

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.760
not a lot behind
but a little behind.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.730
And then the insurtech itself,
the fintech within insurance,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.460
has done some really
interesting things particularly

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.280
around alternative data, and
we're going to dive into some

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.040
of these opportunities.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.670
And also they're a little bit
new forms of alternative data.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.680
It's not just about
our credit weighting.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.170
It's about our driving.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.030
It's about our homes.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.940
It's about thinking about can
we underwrite insurance risk

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.100
related to how we live our
lives, how we drive our cars,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.790
how small businesses
are operated,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.180
and whether there's more
information that can be brought

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.350
to bear or not just financial
inclusion but the pricing

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.005
and underwriting of risk?

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:50.880
Of course, we're going
to see the same trends

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.155
about artificial intelligence.

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:56.070
We're going to see some really
important trends around user

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.450
interfaces.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.450
And one of the most interesting
areas around user interfaces

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.550
is what's called
claims management,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.300
an area that hopefully you don't
have to think about too much.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.330
But amongst this
class of 80 or more,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.280
I'm sure that somebody has had
a little fender bender, had

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.860
some scrape up on the roads.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.980
And now that there are
apps that you can just,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.040
on your mobile phone, take
some quick photographs

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.110
and put it right
into the system.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.270
Claims management is changing
quite a bit now as well,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.150
and there's startups in
this space that basically

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.750
say we will get you better
claims management faster,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.320
smoother, and a better user
experience about claims

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.530
management.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.870
So with that, I'm going to try
to upload the slides again.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.910
We can join sort
of the community

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.360
together, sort of videos on.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.640
Please raise your
hands actively.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.990
Romain's going to be watching
for any blue hands up

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.400
also in the chat.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.660
And if the birds
get to be too much,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.040
just know that I'll go
back inside on Wednesday.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.350
Romain, how is it so far?

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.600
TEACHING ASSISTANT: It's fine.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.530
It's very nice.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.700
Don't worry.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.930
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.510
He's assuring me that
I can keep having

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.550
a little bit of
an indulgence here

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.980
in this beautiful
outdoor setting.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.415
And what I'm going to need to
do is go to this Share Screens.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.200
So we're going to talk
a little bit-- we're

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.790
going to start a little bit
about the insurance value

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.840
chain and the sector's
landscape now.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.600
And traditionally
in business schools,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.650
traditionally in worlds of
finance and finance majors,

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.710
there's a lot of time spent on
banking and on capital markets,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.420
and there's some time but
less time spent on insurance.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.750
And so I'm going to just lay
the groundwork a little bit

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.740
about insurance, some
of the challenges

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.620
in the sector itself, and
then get into this field

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.410
fintech and insurance
or what a lot of people

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.290
call insurtech, opportunities,
business models,

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.730
and the startups.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.160
So that's sort of the
goal of the class.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.140
The readings were really
about this area of insurtech.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.310
There was a handful of them.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.008
The Bank of
International Settlement

00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:41.550
reading was really
talking about some

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.900
of the regulatory challenges
and whether insurtech

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.720
will change some of the risks in
terms of regulating this space.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.160
And then a little
reading about Asia.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.322
And if you've not had
the opportunity to look

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.530
at some of the readings
because they were just put up

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.450
last Friday, go back.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.310
Sort of dive.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.520
Take a little look.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.800
And again, we'll
see if anybody wants

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.080
to give a little
view in this field,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.480
but what opportunities in the
current insurance sector--

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.910
or what are the pain
points, you think,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.060
that you might
want to highlight?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.060
And again, this is just to
get a little conversation go.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.410
So Romain?

00:06:27.932 --> 00:06:29.390
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
OK, here we go.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.180
Who will be our first
volunteer for today?

00:06:35.732 --> 00:06:37.940
GARY GENSLER: Has anybody
ever had insurance and felt

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.190
there was a little pain point?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.467
Michael, I see a hand up.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.050
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
As always, Michael

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.950
is helping us out
to get us started.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.275
Go ahead.

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:49.910
AUDIENCE: I think one
of the obvious ones

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.050
is just processing time.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.810
It's just really kind
of through each step

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.365
of the process, underwriting--

00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:59.590
I don't know-- processing,
completing, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.673
it just takes a long time.

00:07:00.673 --> 00:07:02.440
So kind of there's
definitely a lot

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.350
of opportunities for automatic
feedback or leveraging AI

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.620
to really speed that
up for consumers.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.200
GARY GENSLER: So the two sides
of processing-- it's the front

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.890
and when you're actually
trying to get your insurance,

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.890
when you're actually--
it's called underwriting.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.440
The insurance company is
pricing and giving you

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.480
availability of insurance.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.670
And whether it's
life insurance where

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.770
you might have to send
in some medical tests

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.660
and the like,
homeowners insurance,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.020
renters insurance,
auto insurance

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.290
where there's a process
going on at the front end.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.750
And then there's
also the process

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.130
if you have an accident.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.640
Insurance is this product
that basically if you never

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.280
hear from your insurance company
and they never hear from you,

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.650
you've paid a premium to
protect you against a risk,

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.980
but the risk has not
generated a loss.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.850
But then you have the accident.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.580
Then you have the problem.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.680
Then you have to
send in a claim.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.200
And that process
on the back end,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.230
the insurance companies want
to protect against fraud.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.000
They want to fulfill
your claim, but they

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.010
want to protect
against fraud, and

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.390
the claim-adjustment process
is a significant time

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:21.910
and human and paper-based
and sometimes legal-based

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.320
circumstance.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.440
So, Michael, you're right.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.310
Pain points at the front
end, particular pain points

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.100
in the claims-processing side.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.169
Anything else you
want to throw in?

00:08:35.762 --> 00:08:36.554
AUDIENCE: I guess--

00:08:36.554 --> 00:08:38.971
GARY GENSLER: Oh, we've got a
few other hands if you want.

00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:41.100
I mean if you want to--

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.316
AUDIENCE: That's fine.

00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:44.242
I can pass it off
to somebody else.

00:08:44.242 --> 00:08:46.040
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Alessandro?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think another big trend

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:54.410
is we're going to see
different type of insurances

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.360
come to life as more and
more risks are becoming

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.980
quantifiable.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.280
And this leads to a
number of events or things

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.050
we can get insurance on.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.810
So the selection of things
on which we can get insured

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.210
is going to increase
dramatically

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.607
because the quantifiable risks
are getting bigger and bigger.

00:09:12.607 --> 00:09:13.440
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.750
And sometimes it's not
just a new risk in society

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.880
but it's, as Alexandro is
saying, the quantifiability

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.380
of it.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.160
So let's take auto
insurance and a company that

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.790
started a number of years
ago called Metromile.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.140
Simple concept-- what if we
charged automobile insurance

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.510
not by the month but
maybe by the mile?

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.370
Could we quantify that
you've only driven a mile

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.940
and that would be the insurance?

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.940
And if you're a heavy
driver, there's more.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.450
And, in fact, what if the
mile is out on the country

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.730
roads or it's
actually in the cities

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.370
and where you're driving?

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.460
So quantifiability, the
analytics, the computer

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.510
capability, but also the
connections to all of us

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.790
with sensors and the
internet of things.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.342
So I've sort of given a
little bit of a preview,

00:10:08.342 --> 00:10:09.800
but there were some
other hands up.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.280
How have that which we've
talked about all semester--

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.310
machine learning,
alternative data--

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.330
influenced this?

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.760
But a new factor that
we've really not talked

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.480
much about in banking and
challenger banks and payment

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.260
systems is the
internet-of-things devices

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.240
possibly changing the
field of insurance.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.820
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Danielle,
would you like to go.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.600
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.320
And also you just broke up
there, so if you lose me,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.750
sorry about my
internet connection.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.890
So there's an opportunity
for the insurance landscape

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.280
to be changed by alternative
data in that companies can now

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.650
inform their underwriting
process with a lot

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.050
more information, a
lot richer set of data

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.740
than they previously had.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.040
So whereas for health
insurance or life insurance

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.140
you might have had to
fill out a survey--

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.050
people are varying
degrees of honest on those

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.880
kinds of surveys.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.450
Now we're suddenly generating
an extremely accurate picture

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.080
of ourselves almost passively by
everything we do in the world,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.960
and companies can
access that information.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.820
GARY GENSLER: Right,
or can they access it?

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.770
They still have
to have a network.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.080
And what's really
interesting in this space

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.720
is that just as we
saw a data aggregation

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.470
an important feature in the
payment space with companies

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.660
like Plaid and
Galileo and everything

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.970
that they were right
there collecting

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.330
data between the banks
and the payment systems

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.920
and then hundreds or
thousands of fintech startups,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.440
that there were data
aggregators in the middle,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.300
there are data
aggregators in this field

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.770
as well to collect that
data, commercialize the data,

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.030
but maybe stand between
our lives and all

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.940
the sensors and
data-collection efforts

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.680
and hundreds or thousands of
startups on the other side

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.180
as well.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.082
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Nikhil?

00:12:04.082 --> 00:12:05.000
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.730
I think this is more specific
to the health-insurance side

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.670
of things where a lot
of times in health

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.910
insurance, 90% of claims
are auto adjudicated,

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.640
and most of them are based
on statistical methods.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.090
With the influx of AI,
you can review claims

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.790
that you weren't
reviewing before,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.360
and so you could potentially
uncover more fraud, waste,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.970
and abuse than you were.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.280
So this is a market that
they haven't sized yet

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.110
because they don't know
how big fraud might be.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.230
So I think there's a
big trend there as well.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.430
GARY GENSLER: Great point.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:38.510
And sometimes it's not truly
artificial intelligence

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.470
or machine learning.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:44.660
It's just the remarkable ability
to collect, sort, clean up

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.920
the data, standardize
the data that might also

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.640
have a bit of machine
learning on top of it,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.810
but it doesn't have to
be the machine learning.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.300
It's sort of this partnering up.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.130
And then what are some
of the challenges?

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.130
We're going to talk about
some of the challenges

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:06.700
for the startups trying to get
in there-- capital, regulation.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.260
And does anybody have a
view as to the date why

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.360
we haven't seen--

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.550
with some important
exceptions, but we

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.400
haven't seen big
tech firms getting

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.227
engaged in the insurance field.

00:13:22.227 --> 00:13:23.810
Now, there's some
important exceptions

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.550
we'll talk about in
China, by the way,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.670
but why we haven't seen Amazon--

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.670
they're in the credit-card
space-- and Apple

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.980
in payment space but why
we haven't seen big tech,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.220
by and large.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.070
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Laira?

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I just
think that it's mostly

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.910
because there's a lot
of barriers to entry,

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.040
namely as you mentioned,
regulation and also

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.710
lack of expertise, which all
of these insurance companies

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.620
already have.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.960
So I think it's also regulation
and high costs because of lack

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.050
of expertise that prevents these
big tech firms from entering

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.000
into the insurance market.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.970
GARY GENSLER: All right, so
I think that's partly right,

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.800
but I'm also going to
put out the question

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.210
throughout the class and a
thought experience at the end,

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.460
is it just that we
haven't gotten there yet?

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.650
Is it a possibility that--

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:20.240
again, big tech is about data,
networks, and activities,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.420
as the Bank of International
Settlement has written.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.990
And so do they want to
layer another activity

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.090
upon that network--

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.110
upon that network?

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.390
We haven't quite seen it.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.180
I said that with one
important exception in China.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.270
In China a number of
years ago, big tech--

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.560
Alibaba, Tencent
that has WeChat--

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.140
partnered up with one
of the largest insurance

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.900
companies in China,
and the three of them

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.740
started effectively
an insurtech.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.560
It's the world's
largest insurtech

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.180
if we still call it that,
and it was owned and operated

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:06.130
by three very big companies.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.910
Ping An was the
insurance company.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.820
And so it wasn't direct.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.190
It was a joint venture.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.170
But it's a question
of will we see this

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.200
coming into the future or not?

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.160
So let's just sort of
dive into the value chain.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.590
You've got to design a product.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.590
You've got to market it.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.260
It goes all the way
to claims management.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.410
You can be in any
one of these pieces.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.690
This is just pulled from
the Federal Insurance

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.020
Office of the US Department
of Treasury from a report

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.730
last year.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:44.950
But each of these pieces might
have a piece of competition

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.360
and a pain point.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.060
We talked a little bit
about claims management.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.090
Claims management
separates insurance

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.350
from the banking
fintech we've talked

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.200
about, but a lot
of the underwriting

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.520
and the front end--

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.730
designing a product
and the marketing--

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.610
you'll see that an
awful lot of disruption

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.680
is going on at that front end.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.840
Marketing is sales.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.800
It's brokerage.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.790
It's bringing in the customer.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:18.420
It's a better user interface,
a better user experience.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.360
In the underwriting
and rating side,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.612
you can underwrite credit.

00:16:22.612 --> 00:16:23.820
You can underwrite insurance.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.760
It's basically how
much insurance will

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.260
I provide to whom at what price?

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.770
And that underwriting
process ultimately

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.280
comes to administering the
policy and then the claims

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.870
management side of it.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.840
So each of these pieces
of the value chain

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.300
might have pain points.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.850
The front four of these,
designing products

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.630
to policy administration,
actually has a lot of overlap

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.960
with the banking sector--

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.430
not identical.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.380
Important differences.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.440
So what's this sector look like?

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.819
I just list companies on
these several next slides--

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.250
life insurance,
property, casualty.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.099
What I want you to take out
of is not particular names

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:15.240
in your country, whether it's
China Life or MetLife or Nippon

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.270
Life and Swiss Life.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.470
It's that if you look at when
these companies were founded,

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:31.560
many are 20th century, but
many are actually 19th century.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.440
The concentration
and the survival

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.720
the persistence of
insurance companies

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.240
is quite consistent
around the globe.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.140
They talk about the big five
in China, but in any country--

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.800
in any country there's a
handful of insurance companies.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.850
Once you get to about the
top 10, you're at 85% to 90

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.670
plus percent market
share, particularly

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.630
in life insurance and property
and casualty-- a little less so

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.570
in some other fields.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.230
And there's, of course,
health and managed care.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.890
More a feature of the
US health-care system

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.830
where it's private insurance.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.910
And then big diversified
companies across the globe.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:18.410
Diversified simply means that
it's both in life and property

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.010
and casualty and the like.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.590
So it's multiline.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.470
But let's not forget there's
also reinsurance and then

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.850
brokers, and the brokerage side
is an area where disruptors

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.520
have started to say, well,
maybe we can broker insurance.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.720
And by brokering insurance,
it's basically making the sales,

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.800
making the marketing,
but not taking the risk

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.460
onto your own balance sheet--

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.820
benefits administration,
software.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.880
The only companies that
are 21st-century companies

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.780
on this whole sort of review
is in the software and services

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.650
side of things.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:02.230
So that's kind of my
kind of overall point.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.450
US insurance premiums,
just to give you

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.110
a sense of scale the market,
about $1 and 1/2 trillion

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.020
a year.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.930
We talk about the
finance sector that's

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.500
about $7 and 1/2
trillion in the US--

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.750
I'm sorry, 7 and 1/2%--

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.050
7 and 1/2% of GDP--

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.860
overstatement there-- which
is about $1 and 1/2 trillion.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.940
This is consistent
with that size.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.190
These are the
premiums being paid

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.420
into direct premiums written.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.872
The health and life
side of things, just

00:19:36.872 --> 00:19:38.080
to give you a little flavor--

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.750
and these will all be
on Canvas, of course.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.900
By and large, a big part
of the life and health side

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.750
is savings products.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:51.780
There's competition between
life companies and banks,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.640
life companies and
investment-management companies

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.870
on the annuity side.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:01.090
The disruption, so to speak,
has been happening largely

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.530
in property and casualty.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:06.580
But to the extent that insurtech
starts to get into this space,

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.010
I think you will see
more and more disruption

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.890
in the savings-products
side as well.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.920
The companies like Betterment
and all those companies

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.560
we talked about in the
wealth-management side

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.910
or in wealthtech I think you
will see starting to say, wait.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.670
Maybe we can get
into the annuity side

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.580
as well, the annuity
and savings side

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.950
of life-insurance products.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.250
Property and casualty,
just a little breakdown

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.045
here in the US.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.330
And so now we turn to
challenges, pain points.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.590
What do we have?

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.813
This is true of any
incumbent company.

00:20:43.813 --> 00:20:45.730
You could be a company
that's been in business

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.400
for a hundred-plus
years, and you're

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.690
sitting there going I'm selling
through an agent or broker

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.470
network.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:59.120
And the agency and brokerage
network here in the US

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.560
takes a big chunk of fees.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.780
I think on the
property/casualty side,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:10.970
we're probably in the 10% to
13% of premiums on average.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.550
But in some products, it's much
larger, some a little smaller.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.990
The life side, the premiums I
think are in high single digits

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.340
to 10% on average.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:28.170
And while I'm not sort of an
expert of all the fee, that

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:33.560
basically means if you pay
$1,000 for your auto insurance,

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:39.990
$100 plus, $120 is being taken
by those agents and brokers.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.120
Claims administration,
we talked about it.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.340
Very paper and human intensive.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.060
Litigation risk all abound.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.980
Insurance companies are built
up around this legacy tech,

00:21:52.980 --> 00:22:00.360
just like in payments
and in credit.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.260
Of every dollar of premium,
a big chunk is not only

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.330
going to the agents
and the brokers

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.310
but a big chunk is
going, of course,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:13.860
to the whole claims processing
and the whole value chain.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.460
And because it's deeply
regulated, in many marketplaces

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.280
you can't offer a
new type of insurance

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.020
without getting some
official sector approval.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.680
Going through the
product-design phase

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.300
often has legacy and
time delays within it.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.730
And, of course, just
like the other fields,

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.970
there's whole sorts of questions
about user interface and user

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.230
experience.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.720
All of these present
challenges, but they also

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.700
present opportunities.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.717
Romain, any questions?

00:22:46.717 --> 00:22:48.300
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
Not yet, but let's

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.435
wait perhaps a few seconds.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.350
No, I don't see any hands up.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.350
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.340
So insurance and
insurance tech--

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.530
you can sort of say
I want to be involved

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:11.910
in the pricing and underwriting,
the quotes, the policy

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.430
administration, the claims
management, sort of four

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.030
different sectors, improving
the customer engagement,

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.260
lowering operating costs.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.020
Look, of course it
always goes back

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.250
to can you do something
better, quicker, cheaper?

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.730
But as we talked about earlier,
it could be in product design

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.200
as well.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.410
It could be in not just
doing it cheaper in pricing

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.910
but more availability and,
as Metromile has done, really

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:44.520
in using metrics to get
to a new type of product

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.820
itself and the quoting
and issuing of products.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.620
So what are some of
the opportunities

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.420
more specifically?

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.840
I think across
financial technology,

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.110
it's about user interface
and user experience.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.850
So that could be
on the sales side.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.190
It can be in the
account management,

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.350
digital and mobile
phones, but also

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.580
in the conversational interface.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.940
Underwriting, we've talked
about it, really not just

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.180
the machine learning but
the alternative data,

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.650
and then claims processing.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.150
I think these are the big three.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.120
They seem pretty
simple once I say it.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.890
But it's sort of like
thinking about it,

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.320
and if you have
a business model,

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.300
if you're going
into this business

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.600
or you're at Prudential
Life Insurance or Nippon

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.080
Life, it's sort of saying,
how can we use technology

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.700
to enhance user experience?

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.860
How can we enhance basically
the pricing and the availability

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.080
of our product underwriting?

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.390
How do we do the back end?

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.480
The first two, user
experience and underwriting,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.780
very much true in banking tech.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.050
Claims processing,
somewhat unique here.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.400
And it's about data capture.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.800
Now, one part of
the data capture--

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.360
and you can see it here--

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.950
drones, the internet of things,
smartphones, telematics,

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:15.910
wearables.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.020
I'm curious-- Romain,
you'll see if anyone

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.460
will raise their hand.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.590
Has anybody actually
taken insurance

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.700
where the insurance company
has said for your automobile,

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.610
we want to have access
to your driving record

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.760
directly through your
car's telematics?

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.370
Telematics is a word that didn't
exist 30 and 50 years ago,

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.940
or if it did exist, it
wasn't commonly used.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:52.960
It's about all the information
that your car is collecting

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:59.730
on driving in the computers
on board your car,

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.190
and it's not just GPS.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.000
And it can sort of
assess your driving.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.740
Smartphones as well can assess
our driving because smartphones

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.540
are not just locational devices,
but they can get all the ups

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.420
and downs of your driving.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.770
What does that mean?

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.910
That between smartphones
and the computers

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.870
on our cars, a
product can be offered

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.090
that says we know enough
about your driving

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.622
that we will give you fine-tuned
pricing and underwriting.

00:26:34.622 --> 00:26:35.830
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Danielle?

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.705
GARY GENSLER: Romain?

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:43.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I had a
question around Google's deal

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.920
with Ascension to store and
analyze the medical records

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.840
from their hospital network.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.980
And I'm curious if you
think that kind of entrance,

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.750
the big tech into
the medical world,

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.940
is going to be more
common and if that might

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.850
be a potential avenue for those
kinds of companies getting

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.602
the insight into
health data that they

00:27:03.602 --> 00:27:05.310
would need to make
them confident to move

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.360
into insurance?

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.910
GARY GENSLER: I
think you've landed

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:13.620
upon one area that big tech
can be very influential,

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.220
particularly the big AI
companies like Google and Baidu

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.190
in China, to the extent--

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.730
and we'll see there
are some startups that

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:28.260
are entering this field because
they're very good at data

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.720
analytics and machine learning.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.370
And to the extent
that they can be

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.830
data aggregators like Google,
you're absolutely right.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.830
I don't think it's just
health care, by the way,

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.220
but I think health care is a
really important piece of it,

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.210
that many insurance companies,
health-care management

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.200
companies in the US have a
tremendous amount of data,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.110
and they want to make
more sense of it.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.190
And they want to,
with that data,

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.310
provide more fine-tuned
insurance products

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:00.940
but also help manage our
health-care system better.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.170
So I think it is an avenue for
certain big tech companies that

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:09.840
are at the cutting edge of data
analytics and machine learning.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:16.590
Not for every big tech company
but for many I agree with that.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.350
Did anybody have an insurance--
did anybody take out

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.550
an auto insurance?

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.320
TEACHING ASSISTANT: I
think probably Alessandro.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.450
He had his hand up but
probably for a question.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:36.840
AUDIENCE: I had this little
chip or a computer on board.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.120
And basically, yeah,
it traced everything

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.920
that I did with the car, like
where I was, how many miles I

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.270
drove, everything.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:53.375
And it actually helped me to
decrease the cost of insurance.

00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:54.500
GARY GENSLER: There you go.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.190
There you go.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:29:02.050
Now, some of the first
patents filed on telematics

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.840
were in the late 1990s.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.170
But what we found is
it's really changed

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.180
the field of auto insurance.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.910
This little visualization
about insurtech,

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.600
again from the Department
of Treasury study last fall,

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:20.260
I think is just a good
place to pause for a second.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.470
We're not going to
go through every box,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.230
but whether it's
sensors and telematics--

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.220
and this is a big piece
of having those sensors

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:35.260
and telematics there to lower
Alexandro's cost of insurance

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.840
but also for claims management.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.260
If the telematics and sensors
are there upon an accident,

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:47.410
then you can lower a little bit
the cost of claims management,

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.320
and the insurance companies
can have confidence

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.710
the accident actually happened,
potentially figure out

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:59.780
who's at fault, see right
at that moment what's

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.060
going on in that automobile.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.760
Visual computing,
literally downloading,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.680
uploading photographs into
the claims management process.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.020
We've already talked about
machine learning and AI,

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.960
but blockchain technology
I want to touch upon.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.470
Of all the fields of
blockchain technology

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.080
that we generally have
heard about-- and many of

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.380
them are hype versus reality.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:31.440
One field is whether with the
use of blockchain technology

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.770
that we can have an
append-only log that

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.080
is tamper resistant
whether there would

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:42.880
be trust in a field of insurance
called parametric insurance.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.350
In essence, if we had an
automated smart contract

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:52.810
that said that if this
happens, I get paid.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.010
So what's the this?

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:58.780
One field that a group of
students studied last year,

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:03.640
studying it on behalf
of a group in Asia,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.870
was parametric insurance
for airline delays.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:15.760
If you could embed on a
tamper-resistant ledger.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.720
On that ledger, you would
embed smart contracts

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.480
that says if the plane takes off
more than a half hour late, you

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.340
automatically get paid.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.390
A mobile app.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.540
No trying to rely
on the airlines

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.610
whether they're
accurately telling you

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.580
or not that the
plane took off late.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.230
Put it on a
blockchain technology.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.995
Now, maybe you could do it with
a central database as well,

00:31:40.995 --> 00:31:42.370
but there are many
people looking

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.510
to whether to use
blockchain technology

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.630
for parametric insurance.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:49.420
But the sensors and telematics,
the visual computing,

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.460
the machine learning,
those are real.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.380
The Department of
Treasury sort of also put

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.840
something on the edge in terms
of blockchain technology.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.580
Challenges though
abound for insurtech.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.590
There's still the age-old
challenge of funding.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.310
And it's particularly
true in insurance

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.580
because if you take an insurance
risk onto your balance sheet,

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.260
that's a liability of
an insurance company.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.710
That's a liability
that in the future

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:24.710
they have to pay out a
claim on an accident, a loss

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.610
on your home, or on your life.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:31.030
So many companies are
finding challenges.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:35.150
If they're startups, how
can they access capital?

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.180
Now in the banking
sector, you can possibly

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.240
do it through securitization.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.760
You can basically
say I'm not going

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.500
to build my own balance sheet.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.440
I'm going to sort of
rent a balance sheet.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.500
I'm going to lay it off.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:55.390
Similarly here, you can lay off
some risk in the reinsurance

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.430
markets, but it's
not quite the same

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.890
for these insurtech startups.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:06.500
Most challenger banks
partner with some bank,

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.850
get a warehouse line of
credit, and possibly also then

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:15.410
sell their loans after
they're initiated.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.360
Here, it's not as robust.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.590
It's not as developed.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:22.940
But again, many insurance
fintech startups

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.930
are saying do I partner with a
big, dominant insurance company

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:31.140
because I can't build my
balance sheet as rapidly?

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.970
If you choose to be a carrier--

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:36.300
and a carrier is the term to say
you actually take the insurance

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.600
onto your balance sheet.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.060
You have the liability.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.210
Choose to be a carrier, it's
balance-sheet intensive.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.540
Also, just how do you find
your startup run-rate loss

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.270
because all the
startups tend to have

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.720
multiple years of
building out a network

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.620
and building the
platform itself.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.540
Clearly the
competitive landscape,

00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.730
the regulatory frameworks--

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.580
the regulatory frameworks,
do you get licensed?

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.650
Again, similar to
the challenger banks.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.800
Remember we talked about
there's neobanks and challenger

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.480
banks which often people sort
of say in the same breath

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.800
they're the same.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.810
But more specifically,
a neobank is

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.639
something doing a lot
of banking functions

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:20.550
that has not yet gotten
a banking license.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:24.570
Similar here, if you're thinking
about starting an insurance

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:28.050
fintech firm, what type
of licensing will you get?

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.239
Will it just be a
brokerage licensing?

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.710
In various
jurisdictions, you have

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.630
to register to be a
broker or an agent.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.420
Are you actually registering
to take lines onto your balance

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.545
sheet and become a carrier?

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:46.010
And then, of course, user
adoption and the use of data.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.800
And in terms of the
use of data, there

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.260
aren't quite the same laws.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.630
We have the same
conceptual framework

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:56.360
that you have to be
fair and unbiased,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.400
but there aren't
quite the same laws

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.150
like the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act here in the US.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.720
And in terms of the use of
data, as we'll see in a minute,

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.530
if you sign a waiver and say
you can use my driving record

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.540
to give my insurance,
is Alexandro did,

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.850
they can use that data also
on the claims-management side.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.680
It's not just to lower the cost.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.310
It's also to see, if you
call up and say an accident,

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:28.870
they look at the telematics and
say, did this really happen?

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:31.410
So the insurtech landscape--
we're not going to dive

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:34.230
into this slide, but it's
just each of these pieces--

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.480
each of these
pieces, it might be

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.320
that you're trying to go into
the billing and payments, which

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.720
is sort of rudimentary, sort of.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.350
You could be going all
the way to another area

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.110
and say we're going
to be the best data

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.720
analytics on wearables.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.430
And by I mean wearables, how
many people have a Fitbit?

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.800
Does anybody want to talk
about whether you've signed up

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.370
for insurance that
your insurance company

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.325
can get your data
off of your Fitbit

00:36:04.325 --> 00:36:08.480
or off of your Apple watch?

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.450
What you're using
for exercise can

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.995
lower your cost of insurance.

00:36:12.995 --> 00:36:14.375
I'm going to pause, Romain.

00:36:17.915 --> 00:36:19.790
TEACHING ASSISTANT: I
don't see any hands up.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.680
Lindsay, go ahead.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.790
AUDIENCE: Well, I didn't
have like the agreement

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.370
with the insurance,
but what I did have

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:32.440
is that my former employer had
a program where we would connect

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.400
our tracking devices
like for steps and stuff

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.120
with this program that
would give you kickbacks

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.060
if you got so many steps a day.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.960
So I'd get tons of gift cards
because of all the steps

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.070
I tracked in.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.802
And that data I'm sure was
going to the insurance company

00:36:50.802 --> 00:36:52.010
to lower the insurance rates.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.843
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:55.240
So if you got to your
10,000 steps-- or maybe

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.390
they gave you a premium
for 5,000 steps.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:02.680
You got some rewards.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.610
We all know about rewards
programs in credit cards,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:11.830
and that's part of that 2
and 3/4% interchange fees.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:15.550
These rewards by your
employer, ultimately

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.680
the economic incentives
is the employer

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.410
can have lower cost
of health insurance.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:23.770
That data through
the intermediation

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:28.900
of your employment contract was
lowering health-insurance costs

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.670
for some group health insurance.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.650
Now, I think your
employer was also

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.530
doing it because they know if
you're a better health that you

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:37.480
also have fewer days off.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.380
You'll be hopefully
a better employee.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.640
So they're also lowering
some of their costs

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.550
in terms of their direct
costs, but it also

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:52.010
relates to health insurance.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:57.250
So wearables, trackables,
telematics, and the internet

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:57.910
of thing.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:02.820
The internet of thing
is about sensors.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:09.050
And it's about sensors in many
items in our home as well.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.960
If you have a home
security system,

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.420
in the last 5 or
10 years, you've

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.190
been able to tie
that into more data.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:23.870
Now, home security systems
have for decades somehow

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:28.040
had to communicate
through a security company

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.990
to the law enforcement
if the alarm went off,

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:34.910
but I'm talking about
more fine-tune monitoring.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:37.940
And we all are aware, even
though that very few of us

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:43.230
might have it, that you
can have apps on your phone

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.050
that you can communicate
with your home

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:50.250
to turn on your heat or
your air conditioning,

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:54.510
monitor your home,
home-monitoring devices that

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:58.410
makes all of us maybe
more comfortable

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:02.490
that our home is
secure or even to have

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.760
the communication from the
home if, for some reason,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.640
there is a problem in the home.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.220
And there's sensors
on refrigerators.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.110
There's sensors on HVAC,
heating and ventilation systems.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:19.280
There are sensors
throughout houses.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.500
The 2020s, we're going to see
this just absolutely mushroom

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.210
in terms of sensors.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.760
So what's that data do
for the insurance field?

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.480
That's why I think insurtech
and insurance and fintech

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.900
is such an exciting and
interesting place because we

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.110
are basically in a
transformational time

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:42.610
right now in terms of sensor
technology and embedding

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.930
sensors into our economies
not because of insurance

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:53.570
but because many users
want to sort of monitor

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:56.810
either their home, their
automobile, their wearable,

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:58.510
their trackable.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:03.680
And now with this
really challenging time

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.860
around the coronavirus
crisis, we're

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.770
talking about contact tracing.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.710
And all that contact
tracing could also

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:16.130
be fed in, depending
upon the jurisdiction,

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:21.200
depending upon the regulation,
into health-insurance rates,

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:26.650
life-insurance rates, or
any form of insurance.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:32.860
Again, largely dependent upon
the various jurisdictions'

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:37.000
regulatory and legal frameworks.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.040
So what are some of
the possibilities?

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.560
You can become a
licensed insurer.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.770
That means actually
committing balance sheet,

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:48.370
becoming licensed, taking
claims on as a liability,

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.460
managing the asset side as well.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.530
You can be a managed
general agent.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.610
Think broker.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:58.420
This is just a term to
say you could be managing

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.120
agents or brokerage or sales.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.600
Those are kind of
the two big divides.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.910
But you could just be
on the technology side

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.620
or the data-aggregation side.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.310
These are the various
models for insurtech.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:15.140
Some of the startups-- we won't
go through each one of them,

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:20.350
but you're going to see a
common thing in these lists is,

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:24.190
by and large, all
founded in the 20-teens.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:30.060
So this is 5 or 10
years of dynamic change.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.590
You're going to
see heavy emphasis

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.590
on homeowners and autos.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:41.460
So it's in the consumer
space, very similar to credit.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.670
You see a little bit moving
into small business but not

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:48.900
large commercial lines,
though Bold Penguin

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.140
is a commercial
insurance exchange.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.550
A lot is on the front end.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.630
And on the auto side, you also
get marketplace comparisons,

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.970
just like in the credit space.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:03.900
It's basically Expedia
for auto insurance, so

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.900
to speak you could say,
or Expedia for fill

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.100
in the blank insurance.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.730
These are the
marketplace comparisons

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:15.110
like CoverHound and Goji.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:22.910
But throughout, you'll
see home and auto,

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:26.570
small business is
kind of the dominant.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.560
Has anybody used the product
Lemonade for renters insurance?

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.235
Wow.

00:42:36.235 --> 00:42:38.110
TEACHING ASSISTANT: I
don't see any hands up.

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.760
GARY GENSLER: Nobody.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.010
So Lemonade got into
the field basically

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:48.260
to say so many people,
particularly in the US,

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:53.720
are renting, and we just want
some insurance for our objects

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.830
and our things in our homes
in case there's a problem.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:01.400
Or maybe the landlord says you
have to have renters insurance.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:11.800
PolicyBazaar-- PolicyBazaar,
about 12 years old,

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:17.300
one of the largest marketplace
comparison in India.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.360
It is a remarkable platform.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.530
Again, think, broadly speaking,
Expedia for health and life

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.690
insurance where you
can price compare--

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:27.775
PolicyBazaar.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.220
Of these various companies--

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.990
just pause a bit on Root.

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.660
Root uses telematics to
price their products.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.410
Almost every one of the
auto companies on here

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.830
are using telematics
and smartphones.

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.250
Some of them started
on telematics,

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.840
some started more on
the smartphone side,

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.550
but the merger of those two.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:59.220
Tractable in the auto field is
about claims management, just

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.770
solely sort of focusing there.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.140
And I said I was going
to mention about China,

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.510
the last on this
list, and I probably

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.460
will mispronounce how to say it.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:16.430
ZhongAn was formed by
three very large companies.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:20.420
Online property and
casualty in China.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.520
It's gone public since.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.180
It's a very significant
company in China.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.830
It's the only online
insurance company

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:33.390
that got licensing in China.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:34.940
So it chose to get licensing.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.190
It had the backing of
three very large companies

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:38.280
seven years ago.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:43.350
It got said licensing, and
it has a certain advantage.

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:47.160
To my knowledge, I don't think
anybody else has been there.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.910
So it gives you some
of the smattering.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:51.667
I'm going to pause, Romain, to
see if there's any questions.

00:44:56.337 --> 00:44:58.130
Are we good?

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.170
TEACHING ASSISTANT: I
think we're good, Gary.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.530
GARY GENSLER: Health care--

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.920
health-care fintech.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.570
I'd still call it insurtech.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.180
Some people can
call it healthtech.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.360
This is the insurance
side and how technology

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.840
is coming in to disrupt.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:18.595
Again, you could be
in any piece of this.

00:45:18.595 --> 00:45:22.320
I borrowed this
chart FT partners,

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.200
but you could be in
any piece of this

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.222
and say I'm going to
do the payments side.

00:45:29.222 --> 00:45:30.555
I'm going to do the claims side.

00:45:30.555 --> 00:45:33.420
I'm going to be in
benefits management,

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.170
but any piece of this.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:41.340
Again, most of these are in
the US but not all, just some

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.520
of what we're seeing.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.400
American Well is about
telehealth, a very important

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.310
thing now that we're
in a period of time

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.430
that we can't visit
our doctors in person.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:53.960
Again, you'll see most--

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.400
not all of these--

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.150
are in the last 10 years.

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.610
Clover, which is a unicorn--

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:02.470
almost all of these--
not all of these

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:06.720
are unicorns, meaning worth
over a billion dollars.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.750
Clover is about taking
our analytics about how

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:17.480
we live our lives and trying
to underwrite and lower

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.950
the cost to us.

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:22.490
Probably the largest
ones are Bright Health,

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:27.320
which is selling Medicare
Advantage in the US.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.130
On top of Medicare, which
is government provided,

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:34.220
you can have an
augmented program on top

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.980
called Medicare Advantage.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.880
Bright Health, Clover, Gusto.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.880
You'll see also there's a
significant number of companies

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.420
that have got into the
benefit administration.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.850
This is working with
small businesses

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:52.220
to administer their benefits.

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:56.090
Zenefits that was
formed in 2013--

00:46:56.090 --> 00:47:00.990
by 2015, we actually
used Zenefits

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:05.600
on an effort I was involved with
as CFO of the Hillary Clinton

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.290
campaign.

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:08.390
It was a two-year-old
startup, and we

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:14.010
decided to go with benefits
because we could outsource

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:20.175
to this vendor our benefits
administration for our startup.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.830
Now, that startup ultimately
proved unsuccessful,

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:26.490
as you know.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:30.510
But over the course of
time, 5,000 employees,

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:35.760
all that benefit administration,
the health care and so forth,

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.200
Zenefits.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.100
HealthEquity is in this
field through health savings

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.210
accounts.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:45.690
HealthEquity actually
bought in the last two years

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:49.920
a company called
WageWorks that I was--

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:54.670
when WageWorks was a startup
company, I went on their board

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:59.000
and managed the hiring
of a CFO and helped

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.460
WageWorks prepare to go
public as a private company

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.520
as a fintech years ago.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:09.180
HealthEquity bought
that company, WageWorks.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.950
Gusto is very significant
in this field as well.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:16.200
So you have a sense, it's the
marrying of finance and health.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.880
So it can be
through the benefits

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.630
and payroll-administration
side, which is finance,

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:24.540
or it can be directly
marketplace comparisons like

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:29.760
GoHealth, which is similar
to PolicyBazaar in India--

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.115
all of these little
subsectors and slices.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:40.020
Data related is sort of
the last little slice.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:41.850
And this goes to
the earlier question

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:44.220
about Google and health care.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.500
While we haven't
seen big tech there,

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:49.770
I think that we're bound to
because there's so many data

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:51.300
analytic.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.030
Cambridge Mobile
Telematics do not-- please

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:58.110
don't confuse with Cambridge
Analytica but Cambridge Mobile

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.080
Telematics.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.580
You can see there are
data aggregators that

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.410
are collecting telematic data.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:06.800
They're not alone.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.300
And then with that data,
commercializing it to insurance

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:16.380
companies, big insurance
companies as well as startups.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:20.510
StrongArm Tech, one of my
favorites in this field--

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:24.620
they're selling a
product that in factories

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:29.600
if your factory workers will
wear some wearable-- not

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.290
a Fitbit.

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:36.450
Some of it's like around
the midchest range.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:40.160
But if they'll
wear a sensor, you

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:44.060
can lower the cost of
workplace insurance.

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:48.230
You can also, hopefully,
make the workplace safer.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:52.040
So they're selling a safety
device, injury protection,

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.950
but it's about
software and hardware

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:57.830
because they're
selling the wearables.

00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:00.110
And it's called StrongArm Tech.

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:01.400
Will it be successful?

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.830
It's been around nine years.

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:07.490
So what you're seeing
in insurance tech, which

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:13.820
I think is so fascinating and
potentially transformative, is

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:18.870
a whole world of sensors and
collecting alternative data,

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:22.790
whether it's from our cars back
to the telematics, whether it's

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:30.440
from our watches or our
wearables, our Fitbits,

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:36.880
from our smartphones, from the
sensors in our homes, all that

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.310
can sort of collect data,
a little bit of machine

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:41.800
learning-- not
always deep machine

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.790
learning, deep learning,
but some machine learning.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:51.670
Lower the costs, broaden
the inclusion potentially.

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:53.470
And then on the
claims-management side

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:57.590
as well, sensor technology,
collecting the data,

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.590
lowering the fraud,
and the like.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.320
There's one firm that brags
that they have the shortest

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:09.440
claim-settlement period,
that an online app was

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.260
able to get claims settlement
down to less than minutes.

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:19.190
And I think there was one claim
that was settled in seconds.

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:20.910
It was an automobile accident.

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:24.550
It was something they could do
quite quickly technologically,

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:27.807
but I also think that it was
a bit of a marketing thing,

00:51:27.807 --> 00:51:29.640
that they wanted to say
you could get claims

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.730
management down to minutes.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:35.930
So that sort of is a
little bit of review.

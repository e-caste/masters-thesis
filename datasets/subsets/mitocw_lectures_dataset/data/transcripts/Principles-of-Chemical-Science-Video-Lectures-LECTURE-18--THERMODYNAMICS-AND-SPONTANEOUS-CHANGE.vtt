00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I am going to continue our
blitz through a review of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
thermodynamics.
And we are going to start,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
right now, talking about
spontaneous change.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And you all know what
spontaneous change means.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It means some change that
occurs without intervention.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Spontaneous change has a
directionality to it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For example,
if you put a rock at the top of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a hill and you let go,
it rolls down,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it doesn't roll up.
If you put a warm body next to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
a hot body, the heat flows from
the hot body to the cold body,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and not the other way.
If you, for example,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
have a bulb of gas here and a
stop-cock and an empty bulb,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
you open the stop-cock,
that gas flows from the high

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
pressure region to the low
pressure region,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and it does not go the other
way.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
However, spontaneous change
does not have to be fast.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You know that if you take a
bottle of ketchup,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
when it used to be a glass
bottle that you couldn't

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
squeeze, and you turn it over,
that ketchup has a spontaneous

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
tendency to flow out.
But it does not have to be

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
fast.
What is, in chemical reactions,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the key to spontaneity?
Is it the exothermicity?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Well, certainly iron rusts.
You don't have to do anything

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to make it rust.
A very exothermic reaction.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Delta H is about 824 kilojoules
per mole.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If you have an acidic stomach
and you then ingest something

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that is a little bit more basic,
well, this reaction goes.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It neutralizes that acid,
also an exothermic reaction.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You did not have to do anything
other than drink the more basic

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
solution.
This reaction,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
here, this hydrolysis of ATP to
ADP, adenosine diphosphate,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
--
-- proceeds in every cell of

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
your body, and you don't have to
do anything to make that go.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That is an exothermic reaction.
But what about an endothermic

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
reaction?
How about this reaction?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This is ammonium nitrate
dissolving in water to make

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
ammonium ions and nitrate ions.
The delta H for this reaction

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is positive, plus 25.7
kilojoules per mole.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It is an endothermic reaction.
Is this reaction spontaneous?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Well, yes.
We are going to do an

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
experiment anyway.
And the experiment we are going

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to do is, you are going to be
given one of these cold packs.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And the TAs can start
distributing them.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
What you have to do is find the
little pouch inside the cold

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
pack that contains the water.
You have to press on that,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
allowing the water to disperse
in the material,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and you will see if the
reaction goes.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
If it goes, that cold pack
better get cold because this is

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
an endothermic reaction.
It is going to remove some heat

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
from the environment.
Some of you will get hot packs,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and we will see if that is
spontaneous.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Is an endothermic reaction
spontaneous?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Yes.
Is an exothermic reaction

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
spontaneous?
Yes, right.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Is delta H the key to
spontaneity?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
No.
What is?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Delta G, right.
So, delta G is the key to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
spontaneity.
You already know that when

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
delta G is negative,
you have a spontaneous

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
reaction.
When delta G is positive,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
you have a non-spontaneous
reaction.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And very importantly,
when delta G is zero,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that is when you are at
equilibrium.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
That is what we are going to be
talking about in just a few

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
minutes, when delta G is equal
to zero.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
These are the conditions,
of course, for constant

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
temperature and pressure.
Delta S, in this expression for

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
delta G, is the change in the
entropy.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
It is a measure of disorder.
When delta S is positive,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
we have an increase in the
disorder.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
When delta S is negative,
we have a decrease in the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
disorder.
Where do these conditions come

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
from?
You are going to talk about

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
that in exquisite detail in
5.60, but I want to give you a

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
physical understanding for what
delta G is.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And that is this.
Suppose you have an exothermic

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
reaction.
It turns out that not all of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that exothermicity,
not all of that enthalpy,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
can be released to the outside
world to do useful work.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Some of that enthalpy is
actually caught up in the

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
product molecules,
or can be caught up in the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
product molecules.
Some of that enthalpy gets

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
stuck in the product molecules.
It gets stuck in the vibrations

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and rotations of the product
molecules in the internal

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
degrees of freedom.
It is that energy that is not

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
available to do useful work.
For some exothermic reactions,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
here, the amount of energy that
is available to do useful work

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
is something smaller than delta
H.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It is delta H minus T delta S,
where T delta S,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
then, is a measure of how much
of that enthalpy is stuck in the

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
internal degrees of freedom of
the molecule.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And so, this delta G is called
the free energy because this is

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
the amount of energy that is
free to do useful work.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
That is what delta G is.
For example,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
if you go home and turn on your
gas stove, oxidize some methane,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
burn some natural gas to heat
up the water for your pasta,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that delta H is very negative.
But let's now calculate delta

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
G.
Well, to do that,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
we need to know what delta S
is.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Delta S, I will show you in
just a moment,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is the change in the entropy.
We can calculate that.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But knowing delta S then,
we can plug in the delta H and

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the temperature.
What we find is that delta G

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
here is less negative than delta
H.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Not all of this enthalpy,
not all of that energy is

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
available to the outside world
to do useful work.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Some of it, in this reaction,
gets trapped or caught in the

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
internal degrees of freedom of a
molecule.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And it is not available to do
that useful work.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Delta G, in this case,
is less negative than delta H.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
But let's take the eat,
breathe, exhale,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
pee reaction.
The oxidation of glucose,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
going on in every cell of your
body, this reaction also very

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
exothermic.
Let's calculate delta G for

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
this reaction.
Well, first of all,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
we need delta S.
From that, we can calculate

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
delta G.
And, in this case,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
what do you see?
In this case,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
you see that delta G is more
negative than delta H.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
In this exothermic reaction,
we are getting back all of the

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
enthalpy and then some.
We are getting back even more.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And that extra energy is coming
from the energy that is tied up

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
in the internal degrees of
freedom of the reactants.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
In this reaction,
here, delta S is positive.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
We are increasing the disorder.
If we increase the disorder,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
there are fewer ways to tie up
energy in the internal degrees

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
of freedom of the molecule.
When we increase the disorder,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
that is what happens.
And so, your body has figured

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
out how to get back all of that
delta H, and then some.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
We are getting that energy out
that is locked up in the

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
reactants, in the internal
degrees of freedom of the

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
reactants.
That is a physical feeling,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000
there, for what delta G is.
Entropy for a reaction.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
The entropy is calculated from
the absolute entropies of the

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
products and the reactants.
And so, what you need are the

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
absolute entropies for each one
of the products multiplied by

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the appropriate stoichiometric
number.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
You sum them all up.
And you do the same then for

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
the reactants,
the absolute entropy of each

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
one of the reactants multiplied
by that stoichiometric number.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Sum them up.
Subtract it.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
That is the entropy change for
the reaction.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Now, one thing I do want to
point out is that in the case of

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
entropies, here,
these are absolute entropies.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
That is rather unusual in
thermodynamics.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
In thermodynamics usually we
look at changes in energies,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
but here we are talking about
absolute entropies.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
That is a consequence of the
third law of thermodynamics.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
You will see how that arises
again in 5.60,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
but right now we are going to
use it to calculate the entropy

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
for a reaction.
And some reactions here are

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
completely entropy-driven.
For example,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
if you melt ice,
this is an endothermic

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
reaction, 6.95 kilojoules per
mole.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
In going from solid water to
liquid water,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
you have to put energy into the
system to do that.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
But you know that this reaction
occurs spontaneously.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
If I had a cube of ice here,
it would melt.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
This reaction is
entropy-driven.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Why?
Let's look at it.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Let's calculate delta S for
that reaction.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
You need the absolutely entropy
for water in the liquid phase,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
that is the product,
minus the absolute entropy for

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
water in the solid phase.
The difference between the two

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
is positive.
We have increased the disorder.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
There are less ways to tie up
energy in liquid water than

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
there are in solid water,
in ice.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And that fact is going to make
this reaction then spontaneous,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
6.95 positive for delta H minus
T delta S.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
This term, T delta S,
now is larger in absolute

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
magnitude.
Therefore, delta G is negative.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
This reaction is spontaneous.
It is certainly entropy-driven.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
The other concept I want to
talk about is the free energy of

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000
formation, which is analogous to
what we talked about last time,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000
the enthalpy of formation.
The free energy of formation is

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
the free energy for a reaction
that forms one mole of a

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
compound from the elements in
their most stable form in the

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
standard state.
And our standard state is one

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
bar.
The free energy of formation,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
here, is tabulated like the
heats of formation.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
You can find tables of free
energy and enthalpy of formation

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
for all molecules.
However, unlike the enthalpy of

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
formation, the free energy of
formation can also be calculated

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
easily by you,
which is the following,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
if you know the enthalpy of
formation for some reaction.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Or, for the reaction that
defines the enthalpy of

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
formation.
And if you know what the

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
entropy change is for that
reaction that defines the

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
enthalpy of formation,
then you can calculate the free

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
energy here of formation.
You have two choices in the

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
case of the free energy of
formation.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You can look it up.
Or, if you know what delta H

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
sub f and delta S
are for the reaction,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that defines the free energy of
formation or the enthalpy of

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
formation.
You can calculate the free

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
energy of formation,
here.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Here is a reaction that forms
one mole of CO two.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And the delta G for this
reaction is minus 394 kilojoules

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
per mole.
The delta G for this reaction

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
is defined as the free energy of
formation for CO two.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
It is so because we are forming
one mole of this molecule from

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
the elements in their most
stable form in the standard

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
state.
The most stable form of the

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
element carbon is graphite.
The most stable form of the

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
element oxygen is molecular
oxygen.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
But what is important about the
free energy of formation,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
here, is that it is a measure
of a compound stability relative

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
to decomposition to its
elements.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
For example,
the free energy of formation of

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
carbon dioxide is negative.
What that means is CO two

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
is thermodynamically
stable relative to decomposition

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
into its elements.
Because delta G for this

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
reaction is written as negative.
The reaction is spontaneous in

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
this direction.
It is not spontaneous in the

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
reverse direction.
That is, the decomposition of

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
CO two to its elements
is not a spontaneous process.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Therefore, we say that CO two
is thermodynamically stable

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
relative to decomposition into
its elements.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
If you have a free energy of
formation for a molecule that is

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
negative, it is
thermodynamically stable,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
but if you have a free energy
of formation that is positive,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
then that compound is not
thermodynamically stable

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
relative to decomposition to its
elements.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
For example,
let's look at benzene.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Here is a reaction that forms
one mole of liquid benzene from

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
the elements in their most
stable form in the standard

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
state, graphite and molecular
hydrogen.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
The free energy of formation
for this benzene is positive

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000
kilojoules per mole.
That means that this forward

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
reaction, as written,
is not spontaneous.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000
However, the reverse reaction
is spontaneous because delta G

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
is minus 124 kilojoules per
mole.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And so we say benzene,
here, is thermodynamically

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
unstable relative to its
elements.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
But, even though you might have
a reaction, here,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
that is spontaneous,
that is the reverse reaction.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
You have a delta G formation
that is positive,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
meaning the reverse reaction is
spontaneous.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Even though that reverse
reaction may be spontaneous,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
it also could be very,
very slow.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
When was the last time you saw
a pint of benzene decompose into

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
graphite and hydrogen?
You haven't seen that.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I haven't seen that and I am a
lot older.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
What this means is that even
though you might have a

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
thermodynamic tendency to
compose, it does not mean that

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000
it is going to happen because
there is a question of the rate

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000
of the chemical reaction.
We have two different terms to

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
describe the thermodynamic
tendency and then the kinetic

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
tendency, and these terms are
the following.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
We call the molecules stable or
unstable when we are referring

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
to the thermodynamic tendency.
That is when we are referring

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
to delta G or the free energy of
formation.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
If it is negative,
the molecule is stable.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
If it is positive,
the molecule is unstable

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
relative to decomposition.
However, we also have to

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
consider the rates.
And we have another term to

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
describe the rates.
And that is labile and

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
non-labile.
If a molecule is non-labile,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
what that means is that the
rate, at which the thermodynamic

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
tendency is realized,
is very, very slow.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Benzene, for example,
is thermodynamically unstable

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
relative to decomposition into
its elements,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
carbon and hydrogen,
but it is non-labile.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
The rate at which that reaction
happens is just too slow to be

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
of any practical interest to
you.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
However, if this decomposition
reaction occurred very readily,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
then we would call that
molecule labile.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
That is, the rate of the
decomposition is something that

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
is going to affect your ability
to handle that particular

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000
compound or that molecule.
Like the enthalpy of formation,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:02.000
the free energy of formation
can also be zero.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Last time, we talked about how
the enthalpy of formation for

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
hydrogen, oxygen,
chlorine, xenon,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
all of that,
had zero enthalpy of formation.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Well, all of these molecules
have zero free energy of

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
formation because they are all
in the most stable form already,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
in the standard state.
The free energy of formation of

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
bromine liquid and
mercury liquid is

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
zero.
Because they are in the most

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
stable form at the standard
state.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
The free energy of formation of
carbon in the form of graphite,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
sodium solid,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
iron solid, iodine solid.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Those free energies of
formation are all equal to zero,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
but the free energy of
formation here of bromine in the

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
gas phase is not equal to zero.
Because bromine gas is not the

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
most stable form in our standard
state.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Liquid bromine is,
so it is going to take energy

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
to produce bromine gas.
So Delta G of formation is not

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
going to be zero.
Likewise, the free energy of

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
formation of diamond is not
equal to zero.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Because carbon,
in the form of diamond,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
is not the most stable form of
carbon.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Graphite is.
This is going to take energy to

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
form that configuration of
carbon.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
So free energies of formation
are very important in terms of

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
understanding the thermodynamic
stability of molecules.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Just a review,
here.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
If you want to calculate delta
G for a reaction,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
what can you do?
You can take the free energy of

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
formation for each one of the
products, multiply it by the

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
appropriate stoichiometric
number, since those free

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
energies of formation are given
per mole, add them all up,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
and then do the same thing for
the reactants.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Free energies of formation for
each of the reactants.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Stoichiometric number.
Add them all up.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Subtract the two.
That is the delta G for your

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
chemical reaction.
Like delta H for the chemical

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
reaction, which you calculated
from the differences in the

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
heats of formation,
the products and reactants,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
note that this is products
minus reactants.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
This is different from when you
calculate delta H,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
for example,
from bond enthalpies.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
That was reactants minus
products.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Something to remember.
But again, in the case of delta

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
G, we can calculate it from
knowing the free energies of

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
formation of the reactants and
the products.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
But we can also calculate it
from this expression.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
If, for example,
you know the enthalpy change

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
for a reaction and you know the
entropy change for a reaction,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
you can calculate the free
energy change from these two

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
quantities.
You have two choices to

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
calculate the free energy change
of some chemical reaction,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
depending on what information
is known or is given to you.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Now, I want to talk kind of
briefly about controlling the

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
spontaneity of a chemical
reaction.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
And, to do so,
I am going to talk about this

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
molecule, which is sodium
bicarbonate.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Sodium bicarbonate is better
known as baking soda.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
It is what you put into some
batter of soft baked goods that

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
you want to make.
What happens is that the sodium

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
bicarbonate decomposes and two
of the products are gases,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
CO two and water.
And so, in your batter,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
what you get are these bubbles
of CO two and water.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And what happens is that the
dough starts to harden around

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
these bubbles.
And then, of course,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
eventually, the CO2 and water
leave, are completely driven

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
off, but what that leaves behind
in the batter is a very porous

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
structure, so porous that after
you remove it from the oven you

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
can actually put your teeth into
it.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Have you ever left out the
baking soda in some soft baked

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
goods?
You cannot get your teeth into

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
it, right?
So, this is an important

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
reaction.
But this is a reaction,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
here, that is very endothermic.
It does increase in the

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
entropy, but at room
temperature, this reaction has a

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
positive delta G.
This reaction does not proceed.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
It is non-spontaneous in the
forward direction,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
as written.
And that is good because you do

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
not want this reaction to start
when your batter is still on

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
your kitchen counter.
You want it to start when it is

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
in the oven.
What happens as we raise the

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
temperature, here?
For the purposes of what we are

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
going to do, we have the same
delta H and delta S.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
But now, when we calculate
delta G, the temperature,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
here, is going to be our baking
temperature of 350 degrees

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Fahrenheit.
And now, what you see is delta

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
G is negative,
minus 14 kilojoules per mole.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
All of a sudden,
this reaction became

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
spontaneous.
And we made it spontaneous

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
simply by increasing the
absolute magnitude of T delta S.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
We increased it by increasing
the temperature,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
in this case.
We made it spontaneous by

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
raising the temperature.
For some reactions,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
we can do that.
We can find a temperature at

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
which the reaction will be
spontaneous.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Let's look at the particular
conditions.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Delta G is a linear function of
the temperature,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
so let me draw that for this
particular case,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
for the sodium bicarbonate
decomposition.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
The slope of this line for this
reaction is, of course,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
minus delta S.
The intercept is delta H.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
And now, let me just draw a
zero here.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
What I want you to notice is
that there is some temperature

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
that I am going to call
T star.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
There is some temperature at
which the sign of delta G

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
changes.
You see that below T star,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000
delta G is positive.
Below those temperatures,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
such as room temperature for
the sodium bicarbonate

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
decomposition,
delta G is positive.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
We have a non-spontaneous
reaction.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Above some temperature delta G
has become negative.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
We have a spontaneous reaction.
We can calculate the value of

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
this T star, where the
spontaneity switches,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
by setting delta G nought
equal to zero

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
and then solving for T star.
Let's do that.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
I rearrange this to give me T
star is equal to delta H over

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
delta S.
For this reaction,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I know the values of delta H
and delta S.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
And for this reaction that
value of T star is 406 Kelvin.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
So, your oven has to be higher
in temperature than 406 Kelvin

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
if you want to make some baked
goods that you can put your

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
teeth into.
For some reaction,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
in this particular case here
that is endothermic,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
delta H greater than zero,
in which case we have an

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
increase in entropy,
that reaction is spontaneous

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000
whenever the temperature is
above some temperature T star.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
But we also have reactions
which are exothermic,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
delta H less than zero,
and reactions in which the

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
entropy decreases.
Delta S is less than zero.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And I have plotted that line
here, delta G versus T.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000
For the opposite condition,
we have the opposite slope

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
because delta S has changed
sign.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
In this case,
the reaction will be

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
spontaneous whenever the
temperature is below some

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
temperature T star.
And you can see that by looking

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
at the relative signs in this
expression.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
If delta H is less than zero up
here, then we have a negative

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
quantity right here.
And, since delta S is less than

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
zero, we have minus times a
minus, which is a plus.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
This term here is positive,
this term is negative,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
and so this positive term
better not be in absolute value

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
very much larger than delta H
here.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
If it is, then we are going to
have a positive delta G,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
but if this term is small
compared to the absolute value

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
of delta H, then we will have a
spontaneous reaction at low

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
temperatures.
So, you want to keep this term

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
small.
That is why it is spontaneous

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
when T is less than T star.
But we can also have reactions

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
that are exothermic and
reactions in which the entropy

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
increases.
In this case,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
you have the best of all
worlds.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
In this case,
this reaction is spontaneous at

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
all temperatures.
You cannot adjust the

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
spontaneity of this reaction by
temperature.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
This is always going to be
negative.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Delta H is negative here,
minus T delta S.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
This is going to be minus a
positive number.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
A negative minus a positive
number is always a negative

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
number, always spontaneous.
And then, finally,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
we can have a condition where
we have an endothermic reaction,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
delta H is greater than zero,
and where the entropy

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
decreases, delta S is less than
zero.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
In this case,
the reaction is never

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
spontaneous, no matter what
temperature you do.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
You cannot adjust that
non-spontaneity with

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
temperature.
Delta H, you can see that,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
is going to be positive.
And since delta S is negative,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
we have a minus times a minus,
that is positive,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
delta G is positive at all
temperatures.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
So we have failed to adjust the
spontaneity with temperature for

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
some reactions that are
endothermic and in which the

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
entropy decreases.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:56.000
What we have been talking about
are values of delta G that are

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
standard state.
We have been talking about

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
delta G nought,
one bar pressure.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
That is what we have been
talking about.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
What that means is that the
delta G nought for any reaction

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000
means that we have one
atmosphere each of the products

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
and the reactants.
That is what delta G nought

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
means.
That our famous reaction here,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
argon-boron,
argon plus boron going to

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
carbon plus deuterium.
Let's take this reaction.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
When I give you a delta G
nought for this famous reaction,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
what that means is that that is
the delta G nought when the

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
partial pressure of the reactant
A is one bar,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
and the partial pressure of
reactant B, is one bar and the

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
partial pressure of product C is
one bar, and the partial

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
pressure of product D is one
bar.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
That does not seem real useful,
because say you were going to

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
start a reaction and you just
start it even with one bar of A

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
and one bar of B,
this is not the delta G under

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
those particular conditions.
We have to be able to calculate

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
delta G under any conditions.
Not just our standard state

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
conditions.
And that is what we are going

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
to do with this expression.
We are going to be able to

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
calculate a delta G at any time
during a reaction.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
We can stop a reaction,
and we can measure the partial

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
pressures of the reactants and
the products present,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
and we can get from that,
then, a delta G for a reaction

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000
at that particular point.
That is what we are going to

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
do, here.
What have I got written here?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
I have delta G is equal to this
delta G nought,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
the standard state delta G,
plus RT ln of the partial

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
pressure of product C over some
reference pressure raised to the

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
appropriate stoichiometric
number, times the partial

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
pressure of the other reactant,
divided by some reference

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
pressure raised to the
appropriate stoichiometric

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
number.
And that is all over the

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
product of the partial pressure
of A over that reference

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
pressure, raised to the
appropriate stoichiometric

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
number, times the same for
reactant B.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
What this ratio here of partial
pressures is,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
or what it is called,
is the reaction quotient,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Q.
It is the ratio of the partial

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
pressures present during any
time during the reaction.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Not necessarily at equilibrium
-- at any time during the

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
reaction.
That is what Q is here.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
And so in this way,
with this expression,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
we are going to be able to
calculate what delta G is for

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
the reaction at any time outside
of this special standard state

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
of one bar pressure for each one
of the reactants,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
one bar partial pressure for
each one of the products.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Where this expression comes
from is, again,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
discussed in exquisite detail
in 5.60.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
You will see where it comes
from later, but right now we are

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000
going to use it to calculate
delta G at any time during the

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
reaction.
But now let me point out that

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
our reference pressure right
here is one bar.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
What I am going to do is
substitute a one in here for

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
each one of the reference
pressures, so that my reaction

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
quotient is going to look like
this.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
And I did not put in the bars
because what you are going to do

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
is put in the pressures in bars.
And then, the reaction quotient

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
will be just fine.
You have to use bar pressure

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
here, since that is our standard
state.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
That is our reference pressure.
Now, keep this in mind.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
This is important.
We are going to use this again

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
in just a moment.
Let's start talking about the

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
equilibrium constant.
Here is our famous A plus B

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
going to C plus D reaction.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
We already said if delta G,
for this reaction as written is

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
negative, then that forward
reaction is spontaneous.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
If delta G for that reaction is
positive for the reaction as

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
written, what that means is
then, the reverse reaction is

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
spontaneous.
And now, very importantly,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
if delta G is zero,
then we are at chemical

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
equilibrium.
Notice this is delta G equal to

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
zero.
This is not delta G nought

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
equal to zero.
A big difference here.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
This is delta G equal to zero.
Then, we are at equilibrium.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
What I am going to do is I am
going to bring back my

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
expression that allowed me to
calculate delta G at any

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000
arbitrary pressures of the
reactants and the products.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
And I just said that
equilibrium, here,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
is defined by delta G being
equal to zero,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
so I am going to plug in a zero
right in there.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
If that is the case,
then I am going to rearrange

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
this equation.
I am going to bring delta G

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
over to the other side,
and that is what I do here on

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
the next slide.
I have delta G nought is equal

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
to minus RT ln of this reaction
quotient.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Now, we have a special

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
condition here.
And that is when delta G is

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
equal to zero,
when we are at thermodynamic

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
equilibrium this reaction
quotient has a special name.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
That special name is the
equilibrium constant,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
K.
This reaction quotient is equal

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000
to the thermodynamic equilibrium
constant.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
And it is so only when delta G
is equal to zero.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Not delta G nought equal to
zero.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
We get the equation,
delta G nought is equal to

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
minus RT ln of K.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000
That is where this particular
expression comes from.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
So, the reaction quotient is
equal to K when we are at

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
thermodynamic equilibrium.
Now what we are going to do is

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
set up some equations here that
are going to allow us to quickly

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
tell when our reaction is at
equilibrium.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
We are going to compare Q to K.
Let's do that.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Here is that general expression
I had that allowed me to

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
calculate delta G at any
arbitrary pressures of the

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
reactants and the products.
Here is the expression delta G

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
nought at equilibrium,
delta G nought equal minus RT

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
ln of K.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
What I am going to do is
substitute this delta G nought

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
into here right in there.
Let me do that.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
I am just going to plug it
right in.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
So, I have minus RT ln of K
plus RT ln of Q.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Now I have the difference

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
between two logs.
The difference between two logs

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.000
is the log of the quotient of
those arguments of the logs.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
So, delta G then is RT times ln
of Q over K.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Remember what Q is?

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
It is this ratio of
instantaneous partial pressures.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
If we have a reaction running
and we somehow measure the

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
partial pressures at some time,
and we calculate the reaction

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
quotient from that and then we
find that Q is less than K,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
the equilibrium constant,
what that means is that we have

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
fewer products present than
equilibrium says we should have

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
--
-- because Q is less than K.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
If that is the case,
then what is going to happen is

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
that the reaction is going to
proceed in the forward direction

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
in order to make more products,
so that Q can get to the point

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
of being equal to K.
You can also see that up here.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
When Q is less than K,
we had the log of a number that

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
is going to be less than one.
The log of a number less than

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
one is a negative number.
When Q is equal to K,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
delta G is going to be
negative, meaning,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
the reaction as written is
spontaneous in the forward

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
direction.
That is what our equilibrium

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
says.
It wants to make more products.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
On the other hand,
if we have Q greater than K,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
that says we have too many
products compared to what

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
equilibrium says we should have.
And, of course,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
then the reaction is going to
run in the reverse direction.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
It is going to try to use up
those products and make more

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
reactant.
You can also see that by this

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
expression.
When Q is greater than K,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
we are going to have a log of a
number that is greater than one,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000
that is going to be positive.
If delta G is positive in the

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
forward direction for the
reaction as written,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
then it is the reverse reaction
that is going to be spontaneous.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Another way to look at it is
shown here.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Suppose we are in a situation
where Q is less than K.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
I am plotting here Q as a
function of the time in the

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:44.000
reaction, and I am starting out
here at T equals zero and Q is

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
less than K.
If Q is less than K,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000
it means that we have fewer
products than what equilibrium

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
tells us we should have.
The reaction is going to

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
proceed in the forward
direction, so that Q will

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
increase to the value of K,
so that we can attain

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
equilibrium.
On the other hand,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
if we have a situation where we
start a reaction,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
but Q is greater than K,
in that case,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
we started the reaction by
putting all the products in

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
instead of the reactants.
When Q is greater than K,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
it says we have more products
than equilibrium says we should

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
have.
What is going to happen is that

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
the reverse reaction is going to
proceed.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
It is going to try to use up
those products,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
so that we attain this ratio
given by the equilibrium

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
constant.
That is how we are going to use

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Q, compare it to K to determine
whether or not we are at

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
chemical equilibrium.
Professor Cummins will be here

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
on Wednesday.
I will see you later in the

00:47:12.755 --> 00:47:15.000
week.

WEBVTT

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.707
Oh, actually before
we take the break,

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.609
let's quickly go
around for feedback.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.113
So maybe I should just
try to have a quick round.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.280
AUDIENCE: Good presentation.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.448
It was pretty.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:19.919
It made me think a lot-- great
reference to the readings.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.688
AUDIENCE: I really
like how it basically

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.024
encompassed everything we're
going through the class on.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.693
You guys kind of
edited very personally.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.728
AUDIENCE: I really like
how it was very personal.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.564
I also liked how, when she
said that it covered everything

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.933
in the class, which I
think it's also important,

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.536
given that we're sharing
this class to the world,

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.072
to cover everything you said.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.975
Yeah, it was awesome.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:42.575
Yeah.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.110
I thought we were going
to talk a little bit more

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.312
about technology and
[INAUDIBLE] specifically

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.048
because of the
week, but I mean, I

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.682
think it was more appropriate.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.251
Like, I liked it.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.990
AUDIENCE: I also liked the fact
that you referenced readings

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.592
from weeks far in the past.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
thought it was stellar.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:16.142
You guys really ended us on a
good note, and yeah [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.144
did you say pun?

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:20.013
AUDIENCE: Yeah, stellar
like the website.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.650
AUDIENCE: The sky, no.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.720
Yeah, you guys were
so well-spoken,

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.692
and your questions obviously
spurred great discussions.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.890
AUDIENCE: I have
nothing to contribute

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.601
that hasn't already been said.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.603
Great job, guys.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.438
MICHEL DEGRAFF: At class
night, when I first

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:49.008
saw the first draft,
I was very worried,

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.045
but you two have done lots of
work between then and today,

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:54.280
so I'm very, very pleased.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.048
So congratulations.

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:59.285
And as was said before,
it was a nice to--

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.854
it was the perfect
last presentation,

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:04.557
because you did manage to
bring lots of threads together,

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.159
and you did get
reference the readings.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.627
And like I would say, I wish
there was a little bit more

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:12.599
about the technology parts,
but, you know, 10 minutes--

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.437
I think you went beyond
10 minutes, which

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.573
means that maybe I assigned
too many readings for that one

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:21.774
time.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:25.645
So yes, it was well done,
and also the personal parts

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.081
were well-chosen,
and appropriate,

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.884
and brought extra life
into the discussion.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.186
And great question,
great question--

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.088
In fact, one could keep
thinking about these--

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.550
for a long time ahead.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:43.396
In fact, it's a nice way to go
to the world after this class,

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.531
because I think we're
going to keep coming back

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:46.566
in your interaction.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.268
And I'm going to send
you some references

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:52.505
on this issue of growth
mindset versus fixed mindset.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:56.509
So actually in black matters we
had last week, we had actually

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.079
someone from distant
learning, Luis Aleman, who

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.481
goes with me to Haiti.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.616
She did do two workshops
with the students

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.686
about growth mindset
versus fixed mindset,

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.489
and she had some very
interesting references

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.657
which I will share with you.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:11.824
Because I think we connect--

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.427
very interesting, this
question of identity.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:16.829
Who makes it for
you, and how can you

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.400
go beyond what was imposed on
you for your own self in terms

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.870
of thinking of it as an
asset versus the liability.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.206
So well done.

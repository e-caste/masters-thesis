00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.860
HONG LIU: So last time, we
introduced this threshold

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.210
metric for the black hole.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:36.310
And then this rs gives the
horizon size of the black hole.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.390
And then, there are two very
important geometric quantities

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.260
for the black hole.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.190
One is the so-called
area of the horizon,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.070
which is the area of
this s2 at the horizon.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.980
And that the other
is what is called

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.400
the surface gravity,
which is essentially

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.800
given by 1/2 of the derivative
of this function, f,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.930
evaluated at the horizon.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.430
And if you value it on this,
then this gives you 1 over 2

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.460
rs.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.180
OK.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.730
So those quantities, we
will see them very often.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.960
So now we talk a little bit
more about the causal structure

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.850
of the black hole.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.610
So before I start, do
you have any questions?

00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:02.490
OK.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.389
So to understand the structure,
the space-time structure

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.050
of a black hole, a
little bit better,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.320
let us look at the geometry
view of the horizon.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.130
Because horizon is clearly
one of the most important part

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.324
of the black hole geometry.

00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:25.240
So let's consider the
region near the horizon.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.640
So this is for r greater than
but close to the Schwarzschild

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.140
radius.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:01.360
So, for this purpose, you
can expand this function, f,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:14.450
so near the horizon you can
say rs plus f prime, et cetera.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.080
And this sum is equal
to 0, so we essentially,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.950
when you expanded
this function f,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.154
so that's essentially
what you have.

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:26.118
OK.

00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:29.120
Then here, then they
have all the terms,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.470
but they can be neglected if
we are close to the horizon.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.860
So let's put this
insight into here.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.990
But to write this metric in a
slightly more transparent form,

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.740
it's convenient to consider
the proper distance.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.710
Also consider the
proper distance.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:15.390
Say suppose you are a stationary
observer sitting at some,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.430
say, some value of
r, then you're asking

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.890
what is the proper
distance from the horizon?

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:29.010
And that can be just read from,
by integrating this distance.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.420
So essentially, d rho, so
rho, the proper distance,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.850
should given just by dr
divided by square root of f.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.090
OK?

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.610
You can read it from here.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.110
AUDIENCE: Can you--
can you give us

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.640
a reminder what's
proper distance?

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.880
HONG LIU: The proper
distance is the distance

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.160
of a local observer.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.510
Just from local
observer the [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.375
looks like a flat
space-time, and then that's

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:04.000
the distance measured
by that observer.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.330
Yeah.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.690
Similarly, which is the
local proper time, et cetera.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.960
So then, by using this, then
we find here the horizon,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:34.053
then we can write this as,
say, dr plus higher order

00:05:34.053 --> 00:05:39.940
corrections, so now if
you integrate this rho,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:50.740
and the setting rho equal
to 0 to be the horizon,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.020
then we find rho
equal to-- yeah,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.310
I just integrate that equation,
which can be easily integrated,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.110
under the integration
constant is chosen,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.970
so rather rho is equal
to 0 add to the horizon,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.160
then you find the proper
distance from the horizon

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:16.570
is proportional to the square
root r minus rs of this.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.070
Yeah.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.910
So now we could rewrite to the
f itself, in terms of this rho,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.390
OK?

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.440
So if we rewrite the f
in terms of rho itself,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.540
so f is just f
prime, r minus rs.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.580
And a square root r minus rs
equal to rho times this factor.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.620
So we said this be
algebra, you can see

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.290
plus higher order corrections.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.790
OK?

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.530
And this oh, so
now you recognize

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.545
this is essentially just
the surface gravity.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.950
So near the horizon,
this function

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.610
f can be written as
kappa square, rho square,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.525
then plus higher
order corrections.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.110
So now we can rewrite
to the horizon.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.070
Now we can rewrite this
metric in terms of this rho.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.960
The ds squared.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.750
Now equal to [INAUDIBLE]
Kappa square,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.310
rho square, dt square,
plus the rho square.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.990
So you're thinking
about definition,

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.100
this term just becomes 0 square.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.600
And f I replace by this
kappa square rho square.

00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:57.660
And to the leading order, I just
replace this r square by rs,

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.160
because we are close
to the horizon.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.237
So now I can slightly
rewrite this.

00:08:06.237 --> 00:08:07.320
So I introduce a variable.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:17.350
So let me introduce a variable,
eta, equal to kappa times t.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.390
So essentially just
t divided by 2 rs.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.410
So with that range
of eta, then this

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.710
becomes minus rho
square to eta square,

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:37.274
plus d rho square, then plus
rs square d omega 2 square.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.590
So this is just a s2.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:52.870
This is a two-dimensional
sphere with a radius

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.320
given by the horizon sides.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.615
And then these, some of
you may already recognize.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.960
This is, in fact, just
a Minkowski spacetime.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.430
This is a 1 plus 1 dimensional
Minkowski spacetime.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.560
OK?

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.800
So this is actually
a 1 plus 1 dimension

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.750
Minkowski's time retain
in the special coordinate.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.790
So, in the so-called
Rindler form.

00:09:28.758 --> 00:09:30.960
The so-called Rindler form.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.190
OK?

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:42.310
So we see then either the
horizon, the spacetime geometry

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.660
have the structure of
a 1 plus 1 dimensional

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:51.330
Minkowski spacetime, times
a two-dimensional sphere.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:58.750
So now let me elaborate
this a little bit,

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.676
on why this is
Minkowski's space.

00:10:01.676 --> 00:10:02.175
OK?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.270
So do you have any
questions so far?

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.740
OK.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.535
Let's just start.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.000
Let's consider 1 plus
1 dimensional Minkowski

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.500
spacetime.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.170
OK, now you're going to
see 1 plus 1 to here, done.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.450
I will write it in
the following form.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.620
I call my T-- So to
distinguish with the t

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.980
and there-- so let me call it
capital T, and capital X. OK?

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.000
So this is our familiar 1 plus
1 dimension Minkowski's time.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.130
So now I will introduce
a new variable.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.440
So make a coordinate change.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.650
OK?

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.010
So I just plug this into there.

00:11:07.492 --> 00:11:08.450
So let me call this m2.

00:11:11.795 --> 00:11:13.920
So you just plug in them
there, and you immediately

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.680
see that ds square m2 is
just precisely we see there.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.770
OK?

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:32.210
So this metric, so this
part of the metric,

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.340
you see, in fact, flat.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.260
But this coordinate,
rho eta actually

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.460
does not cover the
full Minkowski space,

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:53.330
because, just by definition,
this coordinate satisfy x

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.284
square minus t square
equal to rho square.

00:11:56.284 --> 00:11:57.450
Because this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.015
So this, by definition,
satisfy x square minus t square

00:12:03.015 --> 00:12:04.390
actually greater
than equal to 0.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:15.610
And also, just by definition,
because we will take rho

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.710
to be positive, and by
definition, the x is positive.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.960
OK, we will take rho positive.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.050
Greater/equal to 0.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.310
So let's take rho
greater/equal to 0.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.090
And which is what
we are having here,

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.080
because this rho is related
to the proper distance

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.660
from the horizon
is, by definition,

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.610
a non-elective quantity.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:52.430
So here we also want to restrict
to rho greater/equal to 0.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:58.960
And so it's easy to draw
what part of Minkowski

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.120
spacetime this is.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:08.900
Let's plot it-- T, X-- so
we have the light cone.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:23.570
So this occupies the region
which x-- so x can be positive,

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:28.220
so have to be on the right side.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.610
But also, we have x,
the absolute value

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.670
of x must greater than
absolute value of t,

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.340
because this thing
is greater than 0.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.080
So that means it must
be cover this region.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.030
And this is, let's say, this
is [INAUDIBLE] x equal to t.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.400
And this is T minus equal to x.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.630
So these are the two light
cone, and so they can only

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.620
occupied that region.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:13.420
You can also show-- let me
erase those things here,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.980
so it's only in this quadrant.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.600
So now let me erase these, so
that I can draw further lines.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.090
Not to make things too messy.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.030
So you can also just
invert this relation.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.380
So if we invert
this relation, then

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.670
you see that the rho
square equal to x

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:43.190
square minus t square
under the tangent times

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.890
eta equal to t divided by x.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:53.600
So that means that the
constant rho should correspond

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.817
into constant x
square minus t square,

00:14:55.817 --> 00:14:56.900
and that's just hyperbola.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.610
So this is a constant rho.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.470
Say this is rho
equal to constant.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.240
OK?

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.040
And from here, the constant
eta will corresponding

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.742
to constant slope
between t and x,

00:15:16.742 --> 00:15:18.860
so the constant eta
will be corresponding

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.270
to the straight line, like this.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.210
OK?

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:33.460
So, essentially, we
see that this metric

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.810
covers this part of
the Minkowski 1 plus 1

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.960
dimensional them
Minkowski's time,

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.470
but 48 the Minkowski's time
using coordinate like this.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.100
OK?

00:15:53.100 --> 00:16:05.340
So now, on this
light cone, so there

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.970
are two special lines here.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.650
One is x equal to t,
which is essentially

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.605
the boundary of this region,
so here is when rho equal to 0.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:30.110
So now you look at is
formula, where rho equal to 0,

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.610
when rho close to 0-- oh, maybe
we should do it in the limit.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.940
So when rho approach 0, in
order for x and t finite--

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.300
so on this [INAUDIBLE], of
course, x and t are finite.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.250
Then the eta has
to go to infinity.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.040
So that means the light cone
[INAUDIBLE] rho equal to 0,

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.080
and the eta goes
to plus infinity.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.720
OK?

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.815
And the [INAUDIBLE] rho
exponential eta finite.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:14.130
And similarity, t equal
to minus x, this line,

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:18.160
then goes 1 into rho
goes to 0, but now

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.605
eta goes to minus infinity.

00:17:21.605 --> 00:17:22.980
And when eta goes
minus infinity,

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:29.470
then the minus sign here will
dominate the t and the rho

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.250
exponential minus eta finite.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:35.630
OK?

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:50.365
And so there's a
special point here

00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:54.370
that goes 1 into x
equal to t equal to 0.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.770
So this goes 1 into
rho equal to zero,

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:07.590
and any finite eta, say, will
correspond into that point.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.090
OK?

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:32.680
So we see that this is precisely
what describes the black hole

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.770
horizon.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.089
OK?

00:18:35.089 --> 00:18:36.880
And if back here you've
got rho equal to 0,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.950
precisely lie on the
black hole horizon,

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:51.360
so from here, we conclude,
so the black hole

00:18:51.360 --> 00:19:18.161
horizon is corresponding
to x equal to plus minus t.

00:19:18.161 --> 00:19:18.660
OK?

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.930
Here you also see, so
this rho and the eta

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.250
is essentially simple
transformation of what

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.896
we have here, r and the t.

00:19:33.896 --> 00:19:54.660
So we also see, just
from this discussion--

00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:00.270
so we see that the
black hole horizon just

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.440
is mapped to the light
cone in the 1 plus 1

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.990
dimensional Minkowski's
time, and that the region

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.780
outside the black
hole just mapped

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:15.470
to that quadrant of the
Minkowski spacetime.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:21.080
So we conclude that the
little black hole geometry,

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.800
near horizon black
hole geometry.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.105
So this is called Rindler space.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.550
So we see that the near
horizon black hole geometry

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:47.070
is just Rindler times s2.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.700
OK?

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:56.690
In particular, it's precisely
have this causal structure.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:01.610
You have a light cone which
comes 1 into the horizon.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.420
So that also shows that the
horizon is a long surface,

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.330
because the horizon comes
1 into the light cone.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:14.910
And so we can just directly
translate that picture from rho

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.550
into t and r.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:18.320
OK?

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.940
So this is just r.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.180
You go to rs.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.630
So eta goes to-- So
here, is that the rho

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:32.406
equal to 0, of the eta
goes to plus infinity.

00:21:32.406 --> 00:21:40.390
So here is the rho goes to 0,
and eta goes to minus infinity.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.620
So that means, for
the black hole,

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.160
this will cause 1
into i equal to i s,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.000
and the t goes to
positive infinity.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.230
And t and eta just differ by
this constant factor, and so

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.240
essentially the same thing.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.522
And here, rs t equal
to minus infinity.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.930
And then similarly,
near the horizon,

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.250
the constant r surface
will be like this,

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:20.477
just like a hyperbola in the--
and then the constant t surface

00:22:20.477 --> 00:22:21.310
will also like this.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.140
OK?

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:34.620
And then, of course, the full
spacetime would be times s2,

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.820
so you should imagine each
point on this plot, which

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.480
only plot r on the t
plane, so each point there

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.320
this s2 with this
radius over i rs.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:47.820
OK?

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.120
Any questions on this?

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.620
Yes?

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.328
AUDIENCE: What's the
meaning of the arrow

00:22:55.328 --> 00:22:58.474
on r equals constant hyperbola?

00:22:58.474 --> 00:22:59.140
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.970
AUDIENCE: What's the meaning
of the arrow on the r equals

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.930
constant hyperbola?

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:04.920
HONG LIU: Ah.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.990
That's just come from here.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.030
So from here, once we
map to these coordinates,

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.040
we see that the rho
constant because 1

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.460
to hyperbola like that.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.550
And the rho is essentially
just related to r

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.240
by a simple transformation.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.080
So constant the rho surface
is also the constant the r

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.550
surface, because
they are related

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.450
to a similar transformation.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.850
So the constant r surface must
also be a hyperbola like that.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.880
AUDIENCE: But why is there
an arrow pointing to that?

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.890
HONG LIU: Oh, the arrow just
to show that the time goes up.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:42.510
Yeah, Here you can
also show arrow,

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.890
which is the direction
which the eta increases.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.640
Yeah, so this is the
direction which time goes up.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.600
And the time goes up, and, yeah.

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:55.600
Other questions?

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.274
OK.

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:03.815
Now let me make some
further remarks.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:18.390
So some of them just repeat
what I just said, just so

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.540
that we have it here.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:39.655
So observer at r equal
to constant, but r

00:24:39.655 --> 00:24:48.760
say slightly outside the horizon
for black hole, black hole

00:24:48.760 --> 00:25:07.020
geometry corresponds
to an observer with rho

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:23.060
equal to constant in
Rindler patch of m2,

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.860
OK, of two-dimensional
Minkowski spacetime.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.785
And then this is
observer which follows

00:25:32.785 --> 00:25:34.590
a hyperbolic trajectory.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:35.220
OK?

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.980
So it goes like that.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.291
So this is not the
standard observer.

00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:41.540
This is a hyperbolic observer.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.620
Yeah?

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.812
So such observer which
has a constant r,

00:25:56.812 --> 00:26:00.980
they're not the standard
initial Minkowski observer.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.740
They travel in hyperbola.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.010
So now you can
check easily, just

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.590
by working with this flat
space, because we know

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.620
everything about flat space.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.310
You can easily work out.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:16.810
So you can easily
check yourself.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.270
It's an elementary calculation.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.353
Take you a couple minutes.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:45.730
Such observer has a constant
proper acceleration,

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.670
which is given by a
equal to 1 over rho.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.360
OK?

00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:00.760
So you can also translate
into black hole language, when

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.240
we converted this rho into rs.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:12.930
So this becomes 1/2 rs.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:21.830
Yeah.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:27.760
Then they make us just
including the whole thing.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.370
So you can see
from this formula,

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.600
so this is a local proper
acceleration of observer,

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.410
as we discussed yesterday.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:48.450
If you want to be-- because
a black hole attracts things,

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.530
so if you wanted
to stay at a fixed

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:55.110
radius outside the black
hole, you need to accelerate.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.830
You need to have
some acceleration.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.310
And this is just
that the acceleration

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.466
close to the black hole.

00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:03.340
And, in particular, you
see this accelerating

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:07.490
goes to infinity when
you approach the horizon.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.760
OK?

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.570
When you approach the horizon.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:17.875
So just a side remark-- let
me put here, side remark.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.310
So this is related once the last
remark, the last thing we said

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:31.550
yesterday, is that
the surface gravity is

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.270
the acceleration of an
observer at the horizon,

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.910
near the horizon
viewed from infinity.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.540
OK?

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.650
So the infinity.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:46.800
So that formula, so
that ar, so that formula

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.750
is the local acceleration.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.250
And you can easily
convince yourself

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.020
the acceleration at
infinity is related

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:59.930
to the local acceleration by
a [INAUDIBLE] factor precisely

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.790
given by this.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.630
And if you just
take that formula,

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.150
and multiply it by this,
then you find precisely

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.950
1/2 f prime rs, which is kappa.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.176
OK?

00:29:14.176 --> 00:29:14.800
Which is kappa.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.720
So this also give
you a derivation

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.300
of this surface gravity,
this formula for the surface

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.013
gravity.

00:29:26.013 --> 00:29:27.180
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:27.971
Why is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:34.360
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's where
I ask you to check yourself.

00:29:37.272 --> 00:29:40.070
Yeah, I said it's a couple
minutes calculation.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.289
It's flat space.

00:29:41.289 --> 00:29:42.580
So you should be able to do it.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.991
Any other question?

00:29:47.991 --> 00:29:48.490
Yes?

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.940
AUDIENCE: What's the definition
of proper acceleration?

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.452
HONG LIU: Yeah, it's
acceleration in the local rest

00:29:54.452 --> 00:29:55.410
frame of that observer.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.160
Yeah, anything you
call the proper

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.324
is something which is defined
in the local rest frame

00:30:08.324 --> 00:30:09.490
of that particular observer.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:12.430
Yeah.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.596
AUDIENCE: What's the
expression for the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:18.215 --> 00:30:18.840
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.700
It's, say the a mu,
say it's a vector,

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:29.770
say it can be defined a mu
equal to u nu plus nu u nu.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:40.147
And so, this u nu is the local
trajectory of that observer.

00:30:40.147 --> 00:30:41.230
So this is the definition.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.480
You can see it in the TR book.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.610
So that's the local--
so that's a velocity

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.460
vector of the observer.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.011
U mu.

00:30:54.011 --> 00:30:54.510
OK.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.790
So this is the first thing.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:08.170
The second thing-- Yeah, so
if you check in this Waltz

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.150
book which I wrote last time.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:14.220
I put the reference in the
Waltz book, and he can find it.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.345
Or he can find it in any
GR book, they explain it.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:42.890
So now, a free-fall observer
near the black hole horizon,

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.520
they just gave
you, just goes one

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:56.180
into inertial observer in
Minkowski spacetime, OK,

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.650
in M cube.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.950
So this is easy because
they map to each other.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.900
So free-fall observer is
observer in the black hole

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.970
spacetime, which
just follow from,

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.990
say some time like geodesics.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.490
And we know that in the time
like geodesics in the Minkowski

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.690
space is just straight line.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:15.880
Just straight line.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:21.707
So for object fall
into to the black hole,

00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:23.040
you just follow a straight line.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.156
So this provide the very simple
description of an [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:29.156 --> 00:32:30.280
observer near a black hole.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.255
So this is the second remark.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:50.860
So the third remark is that
this Rindler coordinates rho

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:55.655
eta, as we see from
here, become singular.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.680
And the rho equal to 0.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.200
Yeah, you see to describe
those rho equal to 0

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.650
to describe the
horizon, you have

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.040
to take a [INAUDIBLE] limit.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.590
There's no longer
one-to-one relation

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:24.820
between the capital X and
T, and the rho and the eta.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:30.971
So, for this just explains that
the Schwarzschild coordinates--

00:33:30.971 --> 00:33:32.970
so the same thing happens
with the Schwarzschild

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.290
coordinate at the horizon.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.740
In the same way
the Schwarzschild

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.670
coordinates become
singular at the horizon.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.860
OK?

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.690
At the same way.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:53.080
But we do understand
in Minkowski spacetime,

00:33:53.080 --> 00:34:00.450
we know that the
reason this-- we do

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.260
know the actual
Minkowski spacetime have

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.940
four patches, rather than just
a single patch, rather than just

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.330
the single quadrant.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:12.719
And so, just by
changing the [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:16.159
to a different coordinate,
this capital X and capital T,

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:20.530
we can actually describe the
full Minkowski spacetime, not

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.969
just the single quadrant.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:23.230
OK?

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:28.440
So let me call this region one.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.770
So now let me call this,
so this Minkowski spacetime

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:38.810
separated by light cone into
four regions-- I, II, III, IV.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.310
OK.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.230
I hope this is clear.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.659
There are too many
things on the blackboard.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:48.590
But by this quadrant is I,
this top quadrant is II,

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.790
this right quadrant is
III, and the bottom is IV.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.290
OK?

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.600
So even though this
Rindler coordinate

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:10.030
become singular rho equal to 0,
by using Minkowski coordinates,

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:16.030
standard Minkowski
coordinates, x and t,

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:27.770
we can actually extend this
region I to the full Minkowski

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:28.441
spacetime.

00:35:28.441 --> 00:35:28.940
OK?

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.560
To the full m2.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.030
To the full Minkowski spacetime.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.950
So now he's becoming mechanical.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:51.530
So now, you must be,
because this is essentially

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:55.704
what describes the black
hole near the horizon.

00:35:55.704 --> 00:35:57.120
Then in the black
hole you must be

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.280
able to find the
set of coordinates

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.740
to actually extend
beyond the horizon.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.350
OK?

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:28.650
So, similarly, by changing
to suitable coordinates,

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:37.140
one can-- so this is normally
called the Kruskal coordinate--

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.360
we will not need to use it,
so I will not write it down

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.530
explicitly.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:48.860
It's just a generalization of
this-- going to this capital

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:54.440
X and T. So in the
black hole geometry,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:59.050
by going to these
Kruskal coordinates,

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.460
the counterpart
of this Minkowski

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:19.010
coordinates, one can also extend
the Schwarzschild geometry

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.240
to four regions.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:22.740
OK?

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.360
Just like this
region in Minkowski

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.550
can be extended to four
regions, and this region

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:37.070
outside the black hole horizon
can be extend to four regions.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:37.940
OK?

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.510
And we can, in fact, immediately
just modeled on here,

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.020
going from here to the
full Minkowski spacetime,

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:51.710
we can just immediately
extend this,

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:56.390
so we can immediately extend
the black hole geometry

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:57.170
into four regions.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:07.030
The only difference--
of course, this picture

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:11.240
is only precise when you
are close to the horizon.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:18.480
So once are you far
away from the horizon,

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.480
so those corrections
will become important.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.190
OK?

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.750
But those don't change
the basic causal structure

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.890
of the black hole, which
are essentially determined

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.670
by the horizon structure.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:35.422
So essentially,
just add to the--

00:38:35.422 --> 00:38:36.990
in terms of the
causal structure,

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:41.300
this picture just extends to
the full black hole spacetime.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.270
OK?

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.100
And in particular, say
if go this way, go to r,

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.970
go to infinity, and
there's a slight subtlety,

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.340
slight difference,
from this picture,

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.080
it's because black
hole eventually becomes

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.495
singular when r equal to 0.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:03.380
So black hole have a
singularity at i equal to 0.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.090
And that happens
inside the horizon,

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.300
so this happens in this region.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.310
So eventually you will
reach i equal to 0.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:13.360
You will reach some
singularity, so we will draw it

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.440
by some wavy lines.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.715
And also there's a
singularity in the past.

00:39:20.395 --> 00:39:22.130
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:26.244
Is the Gordon transformation the
same as from Rindler to flat?

00:39:26.244 --> 00:39:27.410
HONG LIU: It's very similar.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:38.310
Of course, it's not identical,
because that Rindler is only

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.100
valid close to the
horizon, and we're

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:46.130
away from the horizon
things become different.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:51.980
Yeah, but qualitatively,
they're very similar.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.680
The precise mathematical form,
of course, are not the same.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.699
AUDIENCE: And on the
horizon, they are the same.

00:39:57.699 --> 00:39:59.240
HONG LIU: Yeah,
essentially the same.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.104
Any other questions.

00:40:03.104 --> 00:40:04.270
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:05.000
HONG LIU: Yes.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.416
AUDIENCE: Does it
make sense, just

00:40:06.416 --> 00:40:08.288
from a mathematical
point of view,

00:40:08.288 --> 00:40:12.690
to have a piece of Minkowski
spacetime on its own?

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.880
You just, the manifold
is only that quadrant?

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.311
HONG LIU: Yeah, sure.

00:40:17.311 --> 00:40:17.810
Sure.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.660
AUDIENCE: Could a
similar thing happen

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.090
in the case of a black hole,
that the inside is simply

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.850
the manifold does
not extend into it?

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:25.521
HONG LIU: Sure.

00:40:25.521 --> 00:40:26.020
Yeah.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.350
It can happen.

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:28.230
Yeah.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:35.650
But, one thing, so here we
are making a basic assumption,

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:40.270
is that you can fall
into a black hole.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:44.010
And from this picture,
we know that falling

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.570
into a black hole, from
Minkowski point of view,

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.820
means something very trivial.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.980
Just cross that light cone.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:55.420
And so this region must exist.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.660
So let me call this
I, II, III, IV.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.290
So this region must exist.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:02.740
OK?

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.490
Yeah, so let me make
some further remark.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:11.140
In this three, then it
may become clear to you.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:18.210
Say these are the
remarks for this diagram.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:24.890
He said when you fall
into the black hole,

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:25.960
you enter region II.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:35.390
Because time goes up,
you enter region II.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:39.970
And clearly, because
this is a light cone,

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:43.920
so if you draw a light
cone inside the horizon,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.770
no matter what point
you draw the light cone

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.186
inside the horizon,
there's no way

00:41:47.186 --> 00:41:50.310
you can cross outside
across this surface.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:52.530
OK?

00:41:52.530 --> 00:42:08.660
So clearly, no information
or observer in region

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:22.240
II, can reach region I. OK?

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.280
So we call this
a future horizon.

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:37.065
We call this a future horizon,
because once you go beyond it,

00:42:37.065 --> 00:42:39.880
you cannot influence
here anymore.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.560
So we call this
a future horizon.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.060
OK?

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.650
So another comment is
that regions III and IV,

00:42:51.650 --> 00:43:00.560
just like in Minkowski
case, can be obtained.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:13.435
from I and II by time reversal.

00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:21.040
OK?

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.210
Yeah, actually, not precisely.

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:28.290
Only region IV.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.090
Only region II.

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:38.630
Let me see.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:53.716
Region IV can be obtained
from II by time reversal.

00:43:57.668 --> 00:44:00.420
Yeah, by time reversal.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:16.860
So for the real back hole,
for region III and IV

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:31.150
do not exist for real black
holes formed from collapse.

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:38.601
Formed from collapse.

00:44:38.601 --> 00:44:39.100
OK?

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.530
So in some sense,
regions III and IV

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:48.100
are artifact of we are
working with a time reversal

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.410
in [INAUDIBLE] geometry.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:05.010
So also, again, if you draw
the light cone in the region I,

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.160
there's no way you can
send signals to region IV.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.060
OK, again, because of the
light cone, it's going that,

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.160
so there's no way you can cross
into the-- so the light radius

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.100
no way can reach region IV.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:40.990
So observer in region I
cannot influence-- oh,

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.260
this is already finished.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.510
Influence IV.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:45.805
Maybe I should go back to here.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:09.370
Cannot influence region
events in region IV.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.940
So that's why this one is
called the past horizon.

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.120
OK?

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.390
So this is called
the past horizon.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:35.860
So the final remark r the
diagram, is that r equal to 0.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.740
Of course should be.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.650
So if you go into
the r equal to 0

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.720
cause light inside
to the horizon.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.570
And so r equal to 0 is the
black hole singularity.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:47:00.870
So notice that
outside the horizon,

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:05.450
the constant r surface
goes like this, OK.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.440
But when you go inside the
horizon, as we remark before,

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:15.000
the f will change sine,
then the rho between t and r

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.330
will switched.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.670
So r actually become time.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:25.010
So that's why r equal to 0 like
a constant time surface, OK?

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.970
And so is like this.

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:28.040
And then this just a
time reversal of that.

00:47:32.657 --> 00:47:34.490
So this is called the
spacetime singularity.

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:39.145
So this is a
spacetime singularity,

00:47:39.145 --> 00:47:40.820
because r become time.

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:50.480
Yes?

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.840
AUDIENCE: So this is a time
reversal in variant geometry,

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:59.735
but so is it possible for there
to be time reversal, a time

00:47:59.735 --> 00:48:04.910
reversal in processes that
are not time reversal?

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:08.040
That you cannot time reverse
in a time reversal in variant

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.880
geometry?

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:17.410
HONG LIU: Of course, in the time
reversal in variant geometry,

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:22.750
there certainly exists processes
which it does not respect.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:24.720
Time reversal in variants.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.040
That can happen.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.550
But for each such process,
there's a mirror process.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:33.500
AUDIENCE: So in the case
of crossing from I to III,

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.620
I guess you can cross from I
to II, but not from II to I,

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.680
but you can cross from IV to I?

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.310
HONG LIU: Yeah, you
can cross IV to I.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:43.060
AUDIENCE: So that's
like a mirror process?

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.320
HONG LIU: Yeah, That's right.

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:50.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what does it really

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:56.080
mean about the inside the
horizon the space and time

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.565
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:57.565 --> 00:49:00.257
I mean, mathematically
it's [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:06.327 --> 00:49:08.910
HONG LIU: Physically, if you are
a local observer you will not

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.090
feel anything.

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:14.150
From a local observer
point of view,

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:17.570
when you cross the
horizon-- So this

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:22.300
is just related to our
choice of coordinates.

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:28.170
Just imagine from here,
we'll cross from here.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.740
Of course, nothing
really happens.

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.690
Yeah.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:33.450
Yeah.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:39.350
Here, the reason--
yeah, just the t,

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:42.099
we just related to the
rho of t and r switch.

00:49:42.099 --> 00:49:43.390
T and r, they just coordinated.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:49.910
They're not-- Yeah, it's just
how you describe the system.

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:52.110
You can prefer not
to use t and r.

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:56.115
Then cross the horizon,
nothing really happens.

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
euclidean formula,

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.469
you cannot cross the horizon.

00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:06.760
HONG LIU: Yeah, and we will
talk about euclidean later.

00:50:09.247 --> 00:50:10.080
Any other questions?

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.730
Yes?

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:15.500
AUDIENCE: Why do you
specify that it's

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.340
real black holes from collapse?

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.530
HONG LIU: Maybe I should
just equal black holes, not

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:20.740
imaginary black holes.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.770
Yeah, just say black holes.

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:29.583
Yeah, real life black holes.

00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:30.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:35.530
Yeah, then I was getting
neglected [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:37.250
Any other questions?

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.015
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
space lights.

00:50:39.015 --> 00:50:40.431
HONG LIU: Sir, you
have something.

00:50:40.431 --> 00:50:42.808
AUDIENCE: And don't they
take infinite time to form?

00:50:42.808 --> 00:50:45.069
Don't they take
infinite time to form?

00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:46.110
HONG LIU: The black hole?

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:55.960
No, they take-- gravitational
collapse always take finite,

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.860
always take finite proper time.

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.860
Say, from the
observer in infinity,

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.980
and you will have the
phenomenon because

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.690
of the infinite redshift.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:11.580
And then, seems like they will
never pass through the horizon.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.840
But eventually they will.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.191
Eventually you cannot see them,
because the light ray will

00:51:17.191 --> 00:51:18.690
become dimmer and
dimmer, et cetera.

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:20.280
Yeah.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.750
Anyway, so this is
a standard question

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.352
in GR of what happens before
the black hole collapse.

00:51:26.352 --> 00:51:27.310
Yeah, they do collapse.

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:33.170
Does this answer your questions?

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.670
No?

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:34.170
OK.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:36.580
Yeah.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.570
I cannot do the
whole GR course here.

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:40.055
Yeah.

00:51:40.055 --> 00:51:42.530
AUDIENCE: I just
wanted to ask-- so

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:47.480
how long does it take
for the observer's frame?

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.405
The time it takes from
the horizon to hits

00:51:51.405 --> 00:51:53.469
the r equals to 0 singularity.

00:51:53.469 --> 00:51:55.260
HONG LIU: Well, then
you just calculate it.

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.550
AUDIENCE: Is it finite?

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:57.758
HONG LIU: Yeah, it is finite.

00:51:57.758 --> 00:51:59.315
AUDIENCE: Then how does it feel?

00:51:59.315 --> 00:51:59.815
I mean--

00:51:59.815 --> 00:52:00.801
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:00.801 --> 00:52:04.816
[INAUDIBLE] suddenly stop
when you hit the singularity?

00:52:04.816 --> 00:52:05.440
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.815
Before you hit the singularity,
you'll already be killed.

00:52:07.815 --> 00:52:09.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:12.940
So the curvature
will become very big.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.040
The curvature will be very big.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.640
And, yeah.

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] quantum
fluctuation spacetime.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:22.240
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.840
So what we believe is that this
singularity-- so the curvature

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.500
will become infinite here.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.454
So before you reach here,
you're already, say,

00:52:30.454 --> 00:52:32.120
be killed by the tidal
force, et cetera.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:40.530
But we do believe
that the curvature,

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:45.120
this curvature singularity, must
be just a mathematical artifact

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.340
of using the classical GR.

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:50.080
Say, if you are able
to use quantum gravity,

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:54.930
then there should
not be a singularity.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:57.130
But there are even debate
whether they're even

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:59.160
reaching behind the horizon.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.140
Maybe you can never
cross the horizon.

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:03.200
Maybe you already get
killed at the horizon.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:06.260
That's a lot of possibilities.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.660
That's a lot of possibilities.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.160
Yeah.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.220
So we don't really know.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.740
So here, we are
using the assumption

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.760
that the things, so
there's nothing wrong,

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.160
at least from the
classical metric,

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.154
nothing wrong on the horizon,
then you can cross it.

00:53:22.154 --> 00:53:24.570
But there have been debate
whether you can really cross it

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:25.070
or not.

00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:27.040
AUDIENCE: But you'll
get killed anyway.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:27.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:31.132
HONG LIU: But nobody knows.

00:53:31.132 --> 00:53:34.770
Yeah, even if you get killed,
no other people will know.

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:36.626
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:39.525 --> 00:53:42.525
AUDIENCE: Are some people
working on experiments?

00:53:42.525 --> 00:53:45.090
[INAUDIBLE] we have
an academia response.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:49.720
So we add a prohibition to a
system to see how it responses.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:55.310
For a black hole, if [INAUDIBLE]
what kind of experiments?

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:55.960
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.910
I think in the second
half of the class,

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:00.950
we will see such examples.

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:01.450
We will.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.360
Yeah.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:07.000
Some process, some scattering
process reached the black hole.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.730
That can be considered as
some kind of linear response.

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:12.604
Yeah.

00:54:12.604 --> 00:54:13.270
Other questions?

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.320
OK, good.

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:25.410
So I'm running a little
bit short of time.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:28.870
Maybe I should--
So does everybody

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:31.029
know what's a Penrose diagram?

00:54:31.029 --> 00:54:31.570
AUDIENCE: No.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:35.530
HONG LIU: So not?

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:36.480
Half?

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.560
Maybe half?

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.750
Raise your hand, people
who know Penrose diagram?

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:44.190
OK.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.141
Yeah, let me maybe skip it now--

00:54:46.141 --> 00:54:46.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:51.460
Because we will not
immediately use it.

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.900
So let me just skip
it, just because I want

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.270
to reach the next topic today.

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:00.719
It's a little bit
more interesting

00:55:00.719 --> 00:55:01.760
than the Penrose diagram.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.340
OK.

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:09.095
So these are all essentially
the classical physics

00:55:09.095 --> 00:55:12.132
of a black hole.

00:55:12.132 --> 00:55:13.840
So now we can go to
a little bit quantum.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:35.900
So Hawking, in 1974,
made the great discovery

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.230
that actually, you
don't need to treat

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:40.800
the black hole as quantum.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.530
If you just treat the matter
field, treated the matter,

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:46.390
whatever matter outside
the black hole-- so

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:51.130
photon, electron, neutrino--
treated those things as quantum

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:57.200
in the back hole geometry,
then actually, then black hole

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:01.030
does not appear as
completely black.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:03.590
Actually, black hole
radiates like a black body.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:06.550
So actually, black hole have
a well-defined temperature.

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:08.440
OK?

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:14.840
So now, we will try to derive
this black hole temperature.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.190
There are many ways
to derive this.

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:24.110
The most authentic
away is essentially

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:26.440
Hawking's original derivation.

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.380
To really show that if you
have a gravitational collapse,

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:37.660
and then long after the
black hole has formed,

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.360
actually there is a still
[INAUDIBLE] radiation

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.420
coming out of the black
hole, from the perspective

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.430
of the observer at infinity.

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:52.010
And so you can deduce
that actually black hole

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:56.960
is like a black body with
a finite temperature.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.920
And you can show that the
radiation is precisely

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.980
[INAUDIBLE] in the
semi-classical approximation.

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.480
Say treating the
geometry as classical,

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.810
but treat the quantum
field as quantum.

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:11.572
And then you can show
that the spectrum

00:57:11.572 --> 00:57:12.530
is exactly [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:18.440
But we will not go
through such a derivation,

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.630
because it takes a
little bit of time.

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:28.690
And also, we will not lead
that particular technical tour

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:29.570
de force.

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:34.380
Yeah, it's a technical tour de
force, but we will not need it.

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.990
So I will give you a
different derivation.

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:41.040
And this derivation
is very simple,

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.610
but it's a little bit sleek.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.550
It hides a lot of things.

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:49.590
And so I will just try to
give you a derivation first,

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:54.280
and then we will talk about
the funny things which

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.220
are hidden by this derivation.

00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:58.370
OK?

00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:02.060
So first, let me remind you,
that in the quantum field

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:21.820
theory, if we want to describe
a system at finite temperature,

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:28.450
we go to euclidean,
one way to do it is

00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:29.658
to go to euclidean signature.

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:37.270
We take t equal to minus i tau.

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:47.850
And then you periodically
identify tau to have a radius,

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:52.300
to have a period identify tau
to have lens h bar times beta,

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.650
and the beta is 1
over temperature.

00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:56.010
OK?

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:58.895
So there's a key
thing, this h bar here.

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:04.590
And we will always take the
Boltzmann constant to be 1.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.870
So conversely, if you have
a euclidean theory which

00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:20.360
have a periodic time, then
when you analytic continue back

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.570
to the Lorentzian
signature, then that system

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:25.320
should be at a
finite temperature.

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.460
OK?

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:29.810
Should be at a
final temperature.

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:32.460
So now let's try to
analytic continue.

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:34.830
So now the logic
is the following.

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:37.070
So now the logic
is that, let's now

00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:40.040
try to analytic continue
the black hole spacetime

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.520
to euclidean signature.

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:47.840
And then I will show that the
euclidean time of a black hole

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.865
is forced to be periodic.

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:55.770
With some specific periods.

00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.130
And so this tells
you, by consistency,

00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:00.070
the black hole must have
a finite temperature.

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:00.570
OK?

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:03.330
So that's the logic.

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:04.710
So now let's do a [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:16.590
And let me keep this here.

01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:24.110
So, for black hole, so let's
take t equals to minus i tau.

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:24.915
OK?

01:00:24.915 --> 01:00:26.540
Then the euclidean
black hole geometry.

01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:44.450
So now, again, I
go to the horizon.

01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:47.000
I go to the horizon, and
I just take this thing.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.390
So this is a Lorentzian
metric near the horizon.

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:52.440
So now I now go to the horizon.

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:01.780
Let's go to the horizon.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:05.240
Then we find that this
euclidean metric, then just you

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.900
take this t equal
to minus i tau,

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:11.400
then you find rho
square kappa square tau

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:20.450
square plus t rho square plus
r square d omega 2 square.

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:23.050
OK?

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:28.325
So again, in analog with here,
I introduce a euclidean version

01:01:28.325 --> 01:01:32.730
of this eta, so I introduce a
euclidean version of this eta,

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:35.640
which is [INAUDIBLE] theta.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:51.200
So I introduce, let me
define, introduce, theta

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.850
equal to kappa tau.

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.920
OK?

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:05.870
So you do that-- so now I
can erase here-- then you

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:11.030
find this becomes
rho square d theta

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:17.448
square plus d rho square plus
r s square d omega 2 square.

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:32.910
So now, this we recognize
without any explanation.

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:35.230
This is just
euclidean flat space.

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:41.420
Euclidean flat two-dimensional
space in polar coordinates.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.930
OK?

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:50.670
But with one difference, is
that, in the standard euclidean

01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:54.960
coordinate, the theta
is periodic in 2 pi,

01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:02.630
but here, for the black hole
case, this tau, in principal,

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:03.730
is uncompact.

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:06.010
OK?

01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:20.470
But this metric,
as a singularity,

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:33.585
has a conical
singularity at the rho

01:03:33.585 --> 01:03:42.290
equal to 0 for any
theta not equal to 2 pi.

01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:44.030
OK?

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:47.400
For any theta not equal to 2 pi,
there's a conical singularity.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.780
So this is easy to understand.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.738
If you have things which
are now equal to 2 pi,

01:03:50.738 --> 01:03:53.485
you can fold it, then become a
cone, and then tip of the cone

01:03:53.485 --> 01:03:53.985
is singular.

01:04:00.155 --> 01:04:04.100
For any theta whose
periods not equal to 2 pi.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.600
I think you understand
the sentence.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.110
A singular-- yeah, let
me write proper English.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:24.810
It has a conical
singularity unless theta

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:26.970
is periodic in 2 pi.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.125
This is proper English.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:42.050
So, now the little horizon
metric will become like this.

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:43.890
And then we see that
this metric is actually

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:47.720
singular at rho equal to 0.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.440
If theta is not
periodic in 2 pi.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.840
But as we said, in the
Lorentzian signature,

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.490
the horizon is a
completely smooth place.

01:04:57.490 --> 01:05:00.140
Nothing should happen there.

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.050
In particular, from
this Rindler picture,

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:04.690
you can just pass
through the horizon.

01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:05.790
This just flat space.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:07.990
It's nothing really
happening there.

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:25.520
So since to the horizon
non-singular in Lorentzian

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:47.130
picture, in Lorentz
signature, it

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:59.840
should not be
singular in euclidean.

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:05.580
OK?

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:12.720
So we conclude that this
tau that must be periodic,

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.830
so that this
redefine, this theta,

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.480
should have period in 2 pi.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.160
OK?

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:27.940
So that means tau must be
periodic, with a period given

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.820
by 2 pi divided by kappa.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:32.320
OK?

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.090
So that theta has
period in 2 pi.

01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:41.885
Yes?

01:06:41.885 --> 01:06:43.454
AUDIENCE: Isn't
that metric slightly

01:06:43.454 --> 01:06:45.370
different from the
original one, because here,

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:49.240
rho is forced to
be greater than 0?

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.740
HONG LIU: No, rho equal to
0 is the horizon, right?

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.256
AUDIENCE: But negative rhos are
not covered in this subject.

01:06:57.256 --> 01:06:59.285
But negative rhos are excluded.

01:06:59.285 --> 01:06:59.910
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:01.940
In the euclidean
spacetime, negative rho

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.345
is also not allowed.

01:07:04.345 --> 01:07:07.250
In euclidean flat space.

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:08.980
It's the same thing here.

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.735
Rho is a radial coordinate.

01:07:11.735 --> 01:07:14.854
AUDIENCE: In Minkowskian time,
we had the region I and II,

01:07:14.854 --> 01:07:15.770
like inside and out.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:16.436
HONG LIU: Right.

01:07:16.436 --> 01:07:18.470
But once you write
in this coordinate,

01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:21.530
once your write in this
form, euclidean form,

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:25.120
and then this is just
really a flat space.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.830
And rho is really a
radial coordinate.

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:31.355
You cannot extend rho
to negative value.

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:42.710
So recall that this thing
should be identified as h beta.

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:44.000
OK?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.690
So now, if you consider,
say, a quantum field theory

01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:52.160
in this black hole spacetime,
then that quantum field theory

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.890
must have a periodic
imaginary time.

01:07:57.890 --> 01:08:00.760
And then this should be
identified with this h bar

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.610
beta.

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:13.790
So this tells us--
let me just write-- so

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:18.550
let me say recall t
is the proper time.

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:26.319
So this tau is the
euclidean version of this t,

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.124
but each observer
a different r, they

01:08:28.124 --> 01:08:32.850
have a different proper time,
and t is only the proper time

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:34.240
for the observer at infinity.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.870
OK?

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:49.116
[INAUDIBLE] the proper
time for observers

01:08:49.116 --> 01:08:50.074
at r equal to infinity.

01:08:53.180 --> 01:09:13.410
So we deduce from
here that observers

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:27.386
at r equal to infinity must feel
a finite temperature given by.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.060
So, by identify this thing
to be h bar beta and beta

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:39.410
is 1 over t, so that means
t is equal to 1 over beta

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:42.950
is equal to h bar
kappa divided by 2 pi.

01:09:46.109 --> 01:09:46.660
OK?

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.434
So this kappa is 1 over 2 s.

01:09:49.434 --> 01:09:56.893
So this is 2 pi r s, and
this is h bar 8 pi GNm.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:07.290
So we conclude if you want
to put a quantum field

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:10.640
theory in this black
hole spacetime,

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.110
then this quantum field
theory is automatically

01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:17.850
at the finite temperature,
with this temperature.

01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:20.570
OK?

01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:23.110
With this temperature.

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:26.150
So to emphasize,
this is a temperature

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:30.920
to the observer at
r equal to infinity.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:39.732
So you can easily work out the
local temperature for observer

01:10:39.732 --> 01:10:41.780
at some r.

01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:47.860
Then you just work out
the redshift factor,

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:51.750
since the t local, so as
we discussed yesterday,

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:57.420
is one half r d t
of the infinity.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.450
So that tells you, and
the temperature should be

01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:04.370
conjugated with the
time, [INAUDIBLE] time,

01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:09.780
so that means that the
t local r should be,

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:16.600
that the t at infinity
minus one half r. ?

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.180
OK Then t for
infinity is this one.

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:22.000
So, yeah, just call it t.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:31.840
So this is just h bar kappa
divided by 2 pi f minus 1/2 r.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.290
And in particular, this
will goes to infinity,

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:38.750
as r goes to r s.

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:42.240
Because this f goes to 0
when you approach horizon,

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.460
because it lacked in power,
so this goes to infinity.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:50.880
So the local temperature at
the horizon is very, very hot.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.260
So at infinity, you
have this temperature.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:56.080
But when you get closer
to, closer to horizon,

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.494
for any station observer,
you feel hotter and hotter,

01:11:59.494 --> 01:12:01.660
and then become infinite
temperature of the horizon.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:02.160
OK?

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:07.160
So black hole is actually
a very hot place,

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.710
if you want to get close to it.

01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:11.490
Yes?

01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:14.725
AUDIENCE: But didn't-- But this
metric is still the one near

01:12:14.725 --> 01:12:15.710
the horizon.

01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:16.524
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:12:16.524 --> 01:12:18.690
AUDIENCE: So how can we
make sure that that's indeed

01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:19.872
the temperature at infinity?

01:12:19.872 --> 01:12:21.830
I mean, it seems that
there's other corrections

01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:23.700
that we have to do.

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.650
[INAUDIBLE]

01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:26.316
HONG LIU: Yeah, this
is a good question,

01:12:26.316 --> 01:12:30.370
The only thing matters,
the only thing matters,

01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:35.030
is what time you use to
periodically identify.

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:39.074
So the time we identify is the
time which is used at infinity.

01:12:39.074 --> 01:12:39.740
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:44.320
HONG LIU: Yeah, because we
analytic continue this time,

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:47.390
and it's this tau
get identified.

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:50.290
And this tau is the tau used
by the observer at infinity.

01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:50.960
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.585
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:12:51.585 --> 01:12:55.250
So observer in other
positions, they

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:58.840
use different tau obtained
by analytic continuation

01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.940
of this guy.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:03.844
So that's why, then, you will
see a different temperature.

01:13:03.844 --> 01:13:05.810
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:08.830
I'm asking, this
is not the actual--

01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:10.316
we're using a
[INAUDIBLE] metric,

01:13:10.316 --> 01:13:12.664
or [INAUDIBLE] metric, right?

01:13:12.664 --> 01:13:13.580
HONG LIU: We're using?

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:16.350
AUDIENCE: We're not using
the exact metric, are we?

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:18.360
HONG LIU: Oh, we are
using the exact metric.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.400
I mean, this doesn't-- so
I know what you're asking.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:31.120
This tau is the exact
tau for the-- t.

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.386
We have not changed the t.

01:13:32.386 --> 01:13:33.094
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

01:13:33.094 --> 01:13:34.135
I see what you're saying.

01:13:34.135 --> 01:13:34.800
Yes.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.820
HONG LIU: We just
look at the behavioral

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.590
of the metric near the horizon.

01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:41.830
But t is still the t used
in the regional metric,

01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:44.370
and which is the t used by
the observer at infinity.

01:13:47.454 --> 01:13:48.120
Other questions?

01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:55.110
OK.

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:57.410
Good.

01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:00.509
So you may say, r, OK,
fine, the black hole

01:14:00.509 --> 01:14:01.800
will have a finite temperature.

01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:10.600
But now, if we use this relation
with a Rindler spacetime,

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:16.620
then we immediately conclude,
in Minkowski spacetime,

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:19.720
some observer must also
see a finite temperature.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.470
OK?

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:42.200
So let's just-- So let's do,
for the Rindler space-- OK?

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:51.265
So let's write is as so this
is a Rindler space Lorentzian

01:14:51.265 --> 01:14:51.765
metric.

01:14:54.550 --> 01:15:00.320
Now we take, again, go to
the euclidean signature.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.270
Let me call eta equal
to [INAUDIBLE] i theta.

01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:09.437
And then I get the euclidean
metric, which just-- yeah,

01:15:09.437 --> 01:15:11.520
of course it's just exactly
the same thing that we

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:14.580
did for the black hole, because
they are the same thing.

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:16.450
Near the horizon is same thing.

01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:21.900
So that means the theta must
be identified with 2 pi.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:24.780
OK?

01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:38.280
But now, you say, observer
who use this time, eta, must

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.050
feel at the finite temperature.

01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:40.870
OK?

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:44.170
So the time, which time
you use, is crucial.

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:47.710
And this eta is not the
standard Minkowski spacetime.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:52.640
And this is the
time which-- yeah,

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:58.390
I forgot-- which is the time.

01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:07.810
So for the Rindler space, is
the time which goes like this.

01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.210
Yeah, it's the time
which goes like this.

01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:16.270
This is not the
standard Minkowski time.

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:20.520
So for observer who
are using that time,

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.710
then they should feel to
be at a finite temperature.

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:28.160
Of course, the observer
who used that time

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.135
is precisely the observer
who are at the constant rho.

01:16:31.135 --> 01:16:33.980
So if you have a constant
rho, then d rho equal to 0,

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.280
then that's the time you use.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.780
OK?

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:44.040
So, but with a slight
correction-- so for observer.

01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:53.250
So this is normally
called a Rindler observer

01:16:53.250 --> 01:17:00.030
at constant rho, at
rho equal to constant,

01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:08.690
then it's local proper time
as given by this guy, then t,

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:14.680
d t local is equal
to just rho d eta.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.980
OK?

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:20.040
Then that means the
corresponding euclidean

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:29.080
time is related to this theta,
also by this factor of rho,

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.110
is rho d theta.

01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:36.770
And that means that
this tau local will

01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:42.950
be periodic in 2 pi times rho.

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.460
OK?

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.980
And again, you identify
this with h bar beta.

01:17:51.470 --> 01:18:02.030
So that's tell you for Rindler
observer, at location rho,

01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:06.660
you will see a temperature which
is h bar divided by 2 pi rho.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:13.050
And, as we said
before, 1 over rho--

01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:16.310
I just erased it-- is
essentially acceleration.

01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:21.850
So this is just h a divided by
2 pi, and a is the acceleration.

01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:25.000
So we call a equals
to 1 over rho.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.530
So the acceleration is
equal to one over rho.

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:36.620
So this tells you, once
you write it in this form,

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:42.620
once you write in this form, you
can forget about Rindler space,

01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:46.430
because the only physics is
now using the acceleration.

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:47.270
OK?

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:52.090
Now you can say any
Minkowski observer

01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:55.080
with a non-zero
acceleration, will

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.760
feel to be at the
finite temperature.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.050
OK?

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:01.680
Will feel at the
finite temperature.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.610
And the finite temperature
is proportional to

01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:08.140
its acceleration and the h bar.

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:08.845
Yes?

01:19:08.845 --> 01:19:12.225
AUDIENCE: And so an observer
free-falling into a black hole

01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:13.620
will not--

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.370
HONG LIU: Yeah, will
not feel temperature.

01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:15.970
AUDIENCE: So 0 temperature?

01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:17.970
So even like when you're
approaching the horizon

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:19.880
and you're close to the
horizon, usually you

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.910
would have an
infinite temperature,

01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:22.300
but here you're going
to have a 0 temperature?

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:22.600
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.141
That's right.

01:19:23.141 --> 01:19:26.410
Yeah, so here, and besides,
this must be observer

01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:28.680
is some constant value of r.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.160
Yeah, must be a
stationary observer

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.306
outside the black hole.

01:19:35.109 --> 01:19:37.275
Yeah, so let me just write
down this final sentence.

01:19:45.060 --> 01:20:07.600
You said, in Minkowski spacetime
an accelerated observer will

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:25.022
feel the temperature
proportional to acceleration.

01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:36.830
So this was first
discovered by Unruh.

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:40.640
So this is called
Unruh temperature.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.030
So this was discovered by
Unruh, I think also around 1974.

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:47.680
Maybe 1976.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.650
Around the time of Hawking's
discovery of Hawking radiation.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:58.411
So Unruh, actually, was
very close to derive

01:20:58.411 --> 01:20:59.660
the Hawking radiation himself.

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:03.745
Yeah, there were
several people who

01:21:03.745 --> 01:21:06.650
were very close to derive
the Hawking radiation,

01:21:06.650 --> 01:21:10.390
but only Hawking,
in the end, did it.

01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:13.580
But then, Unruh
realized, actually

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:17.060
Hawking radiation is actually
the same as this phenomena

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:18.590
in flat space.

01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:23.790
And so, now this is
called Unruh temperature.

01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:24.290
OK.

01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:27.050
So as I said earlier,
that this derivation

01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:31.770
is very simple and powerful, and
we will use it again and again

01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:34.570
in the future.

01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:39.850
But it's quite sleek.

01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:42.420
It does not tell you
where this radiation,

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.560
where this temperature
comes from.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.190
And if you have a
black body radiation,

01:21:46.190 --> 01:21:48.680
where does the radiation
come from, et cetera.

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:53.960
And so next time, we will
try to explain, physically,

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.520
where does this
temperature come from?

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.020
Yeah.

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:01.520
OK.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.670
Let's stop here.

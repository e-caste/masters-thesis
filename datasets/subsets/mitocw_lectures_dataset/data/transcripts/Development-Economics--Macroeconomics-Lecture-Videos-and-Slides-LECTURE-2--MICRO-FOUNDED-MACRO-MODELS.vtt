00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:31.880
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We want to
talk about theoretical models.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.610
They tell us stories.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.310
The key variables are very
much of interest-- growth,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.130
inequality, poverty, but just
telling a story as elegant,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.070
as it may be, even
with surprises does not

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.060
even necessarily tell us that
it matches up to reality,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.550
and therefore, one might be a
little bit cautious in terms

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.220
of formulation of policy.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.890
Now it is true that having
sort of a good conceptual

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.010
foundation, a good
well-articulated theoretical

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.840
model is a very important step.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.740
I'm not demeaning
that step at all.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.365
What I'm trying to say is
it's a very useful first step,

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:16.740
but in the literature
we're going

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.930
to review today, we've
gone beyond that,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.840
and to try to take the next
step and see how well it fits.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.630
And how are we going
to, quote, fit it?

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.160
We're going to take the assumed
micro-financial underpinnings

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.100
and estimate those
underpinnings,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.580
and get the bulk of the key
parameters of the model pinned

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.700
down in that way
from the micro data.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.320
There'll be a few
remaining parameters

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.670
that we can't get from household
choice or business choice,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.410
and we'll calibrate those.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.320
And then we'll
simulate the models

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.789
and get what the model would
predict for growth inequality--

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.550
income, savings,
labor's share of GDP,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.820
and actually also some
of the key underpinnings

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.770
of each model, and
the first one it's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.830
going to be the fraction of
households running businesses

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.270
and the second
one is going to be

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.390
the fraction of
households participating

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.735
in the financial sector.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.425
So what do we do with these?

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.430
Each one, then,
after we get done

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.370
looking at the
goodness of fit, we

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.400
can do welfare analysis
of policy intervention.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.910
The first model has,
to make it easier,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.210
an exogenously expanding
financial sector

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.240
at exactly the rate
we see it in the data,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.460
and that's going to
create winners or losers.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.120
As the financial
system expands, we'll

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.250
get changes on the
extensive margin

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.200
because some households
will go into business.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.960
We'll get changes as
wealth accumulates

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.410
in the amount to take
and invest in business,

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.890
and also because it's going to
be a general equilibrium model,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.120
we're going to get changes in
equilibrium wages and interest

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.490
rates which have effects even
beyond the direct effects,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.860
often quite big.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.460
In fact, there's a debate,
depending on which political

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.370
position you take,
about trickle-down,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.210
which is sometimes
taken negatively,

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.360
trickle-down meaning only
the rich benefit from various

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.430
things and the poor--

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.910
workers are lucky to get
anything, a better way

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.190
to say it is a rising
tide raises all boats.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.980
The model kind of takes
a stand on these things,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.980
and in particular,
the wage, when

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.700
you have financial
deepening, can go up,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.980
and that is an enormous benefit
to poor people, even unskilled

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.490
poor people who have better
employment and better wage

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.690
opportunities.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.570
The second welfare experiment
is when, in the second model,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.090
the government takes
over the banking system.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.540
I alluded to this at
the end of last time,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.395
and again, when they
liberalized this system

00:04:45.395 --> 00:04:48.750
and turned it back over
to the commercial sector,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.070
that also creates welfare
gains, which can be quite large,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.290
and we can--

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.510
the point is, we can use
each of these models,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.840
if we believe the
model and we believe

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.200
more or less the numbers we
put in for the parameters,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.570
we can quantify these
welfare gains and losses.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.165
There's some corollaries
that come out of this.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.850
First of all, growth
doesn't necessarily

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.810
have to go up as the
financial system expands.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.940
We reviewed some
literature last time

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.880
about finance causes growth that
seemed plausible and reasonable

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.070
and at least at a
reduced form since it

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.280
seemed to fit the data.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.720
But in the second model,
as opportunities expand,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.800
you can create endogenously
more financial infrastructure,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.800
but it comes at a cost.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.020
And just like anything
else, investment not

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.700
may not pay off right away.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.550
So some resources,
quote-unquote,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.420
disappear in this creation
of financial infrastructure,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.140
and so in effect, the
growth rate levels go down

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.110
and growth rates are
slower for a while

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.520
than they would have been
without the liberalization.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.520
Another caveat
coming from the model

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.630
is, both models today
are transition models--

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.050
that is to say, they are
not yet in steady-state,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.500
although if I remember,
I'll try to say something

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.990
about the steady states
of each of these.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.920
And so in some
respects, the models

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.090
are not generating
stationary time series.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.580
Implicitly when you run a
regression, OLS and so on,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.610
you're kind of assuming
you're getting data drawn

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.895
from as stationary time series.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.320
So we run regressions on some
of these model-generated data

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.130
where we know exactly what's
going on, and sure enough,

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.870
you get kind of spurious,
bogus, or erratic coefficients

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.840
on the very same regressions
that the literature has

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.480
been running with actual
cross-country data.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.972
So it's sort of a caution.

00:07:12.972 --> 00:07:20.330
Now toward the end, there's
a tendency to, in any class,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.650
any lecture for any course,
you see models and you'll see,

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.550
oh, there's a model, let's
learn how to manipulate that one

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.640
and maybe do a few
extensions of it,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.090
or a second class
with a second model.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.920
Toward the end, I
will deliberately

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.000
try to engage you in a
comparison of these two models

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.720
to make the point that the
real research that goes on

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.770
is trying to decide not just
how to an extent a given model,

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.560
but sort of what
we learn overall.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.040
It's not typically published,
this stuff, actually.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.640
Mostly these conversations take
place in offices and hallways

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:05.870
or over beer and so on, but
it's actually a big part

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.540
of the research process.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:16.710
So as an introduction overall,
a few words from a paper I

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:28.490
wrote with Hyeok
Jeong, which repeats

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.630
all what I've said already.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.600
Basically we're not grabbing
parameters out of thin air,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.200
we're going to estimate
them with the micro data.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.600
We compare the
predictions of the model

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.739
with the actual dynamics.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:50.390
There is a well-established
tradition in other sciences

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.200
that has to do with
model validation.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.310
So it's quite common
to basically calibrate

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:03.620
the machine or the model
or the process, and then

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.950
sort of simulate and
see how well it works

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.455
without being recalibrated.

00:09:10.455 --> 00:09:12.830
Or put another way, if you
have enough degrees of freedom

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.490
and enough parameters and
you're constantly tinkering,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.230
there's a tendency to
be able to fit stuff.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.150
You've seen this probably in
your first course in statistics

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.830
and ordinary least squares.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.530
If you run out of degrees of--

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:35.580
you can fit-- align two points,
you can perfectly well--

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:42.580
or you can fit a polynomial
even with nonlinear data,

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.090
but then out of sample, you
want to predict some more

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.460
and it's just crazy,
it's just completely off.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.180
So here, we followed the
tradition of kind of not--

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.530
deliberately not
using all of the data.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.040
It is a matter of choice,
though, what data to use

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.570
and what to set aside, and
I could imagine more, quote,

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.880
experiments than
we actually did.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.150
So there isn't a fixed
rule for how to do this,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.090
and it's not even as
commonly used in economics

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.090
as I think it
probably ought to be.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.850
And I guess you
know the main theme

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:32.460
today is this marriage
of theory and data.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.690
Frisch very early on in
the '30s was a big champion

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.860
of the mutual penetration of
quantitative economic theory

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.920
with statistical observations.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:52.000
I think that's actually on
the econometric cover, if not

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.500
their website.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:11:00.210
And in particular, we're
somewhere between theory

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.520
without measurement and
measurement without theory.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.920
A big controversy in
business cycle analysis

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.870
along that line, a big debate
between [INAUDIBLE] and Burns

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.240
and Mitchell.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.260
OK.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.390
So we're going to do
these two papers that

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.630
came from the literature.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.990
It's kind of a plus and a minus.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.330
One is Lloyd-Ellis
and Dan Bernhardt,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.170
and the other is
Greenwood and Jovanovic.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.750
Each tell a plausible
story about what

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.380
lies behind the growth
process and the relationship

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.370
between growth and equality,
financial deepening,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.386
and those other
variables that I listed.

00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:51.720
And we're going to try
to estimate those models.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.370
Well, the negative
part of this thing

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.570
is we learned how to do
statistics and econometrics

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.760
in part through the
lens of these models

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.160
by realizing how problematic
certain parts of those models

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.390
are.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:11.940
And I would not start this
way if I were starting over.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.340
And as I go through
the lecture, I

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.770
will try to point out which
particularly worrisome

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.610
or problematic parts I
have in mind in terms

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.530
of taking these
models to the data.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.330
But anyway, again, back
on the positive side,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.670
that's literally what we did.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:37.040
We adopted wholesale,
without any modification

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.940
or qualification,
exactly the equations

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.766
that these theoretical
authors used in their models.

00:12:44.766 --> 00:12:48.240
Uh oh.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.060
That's not good.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:12.240
So Lloyd-Ellis and
Bernhardt, LEB for short,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.630
there are three occupations--

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:20.840
farmers, workers, and
entrepreneurs, and it's

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.780
costly to set up a firm.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.320
But these costs are like talent,
they vary with the individual.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.670
The more talented you are,
the less costly it is.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:37.190
It's assumed that the cumulative
distribution of talent

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.530
is distributed
according to capital H

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.040
here where x is
the level of cost.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.680
And you have to be
careful with the notation

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.330
where we're talking
about densities

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.870
versus cumulative distributions,
so just kind of bear

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.270
that in mind.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.370
There's also an initial
distribution of wealth

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:07.910
that starts off the model, G of
b where b is sort of bequest.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.870
Just to alert you, this
model has a relatively naive

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.060
dynamic part.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.270
People essentially live for
two periods-- they eat today

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.060
and they leave
money for their kids

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:27.260
or their tomorrow's next period
as if leaving a bequest, hence

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.520
the notation b for a Bequest.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.780
So what earnings two people
have in a given period?

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:41.640
Farmers earn kind of a
subsistence living in farming,

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.270
and they carry their
wealth over and have it

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.940
at the end of the period.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:54.890
Workers earn wages-- excuse me--
and entrepreneurs make profits.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.440
Everybody has this
initial wealth

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.720
which can vary
across individuals

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:06.860
carried over to the end of
the period, essentially.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.700
A little bit of an exception
for the entrepreneurs.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.810
When Dan wrote his
model, he kind of

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.930
had in mind an earlier
development literature

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.240
which makes
agriculture out there

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:26.330
in the rural areas versus
factories and manufacturing

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:26.930
in the cities.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:32.090
So they had in mind a kind
of cost of living adjustment,

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:37.970
so basically workers
earn their wage,

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.730
but they have to pay this
cost of living, which

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.920
gives a little bit advantage
to being in the subsistence

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.090
sector.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:53.480
Actually, you can see
it right away down here,

00:15:53.480 --> 00:16:00.260
if sort of in equilibrium to
have both farmers and workers

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:06.030
coexisting, these two equations
have to be equal to each other.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.740
So as long as the
wage does not exceed--

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.460
the wage less this cost of
living does not exceed gamma,

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.040
then a household
would be indifferent

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.430
about whether to migrate
to the city for a wage

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.830
and pay that cost
versus stay in farming.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:23.330
Yes?

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.525
AUDIENCE: So is this
going to be abstracting

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:25.945
all the way from land markets?

00:16:25.945 --> 00:16:27.070
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes it is.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.170
And-- OK, let's get to the firm.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.940
Well, let me just
follow up on that.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.230
The model as estimated
and calibrated

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.340
will actually deliver the fact
that for fairly long periods

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.000
of time, the wage
stays relatively low

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.600
and you have all three sectors
coexisting, although there will

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.650
come this knife-edge time where
the wage starts to pop up,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.230
and then quite
unrealistically there

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.140
should be no more farmers.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.700
You would think
this model is doomed

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.849
to fail with that
kind of knife edge,

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:15.240
but surprisingly in Thailand,
there are still farmers,

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:23.920
but the wage did stay relatively
flat for quite a long time

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.319
and then grew rather quickly.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.290
What about firms?

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.270
So firms maximize
basically profit.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.960
The price of the output
or the consumption goods

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.130
is normalized to 1.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.950
So firms have output,
which is produced

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.060
using capital and labor.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.380
Labor can be hired.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.310
Those are the workers, you
have to pay them a wage.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:57.470
And capital, basically, is
coming out of initial wealth.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.680
So capital and consumption
are kind of 1 to 1.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:07.700
So you have your sort
of initial wealth,

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.850
and the capital has to
be financed by that.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:15.410
Capital cannot
exceed that amount.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.150
And actually, there's
this fixed cost,

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.300
and that also has to get paid.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.910
There's a lot going
on right here,

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.330
because there's two constraints.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.950
One is you have to
pay x to get started,

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:35.300
and the second is that
you can't borrow at all.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.050
All the investment is
basically self-financed.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.950
Now that said, you could imagine
kind of weakening this a bit

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.500
and allowing the amount
you could be borrowing

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:52.020
to be some multiple of
a b, and next class,

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.410
we'll talk about
many models that

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.200
do something exactly like that.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.850
But for now, no credit at all.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.410
So this just-- these costs
just subtract right off

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:12.060
of output as if at
the end of the period,

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.900
or b minus these
things is what you

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.862
have at the end of the period.

00:19:18.862 --> 00:19:21.195
Then you get you get the
output and you pay the workers.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.570
So the key in this
paper and so many

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:34.580
other papers is an occupation
choice map that really

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:44.890
summarizes the possibilities.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:49.050
So the two key variables from
a household's point of view

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.760
is the initial
wealth that they have

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.960
at the beginning of the period--

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.930
it could be high or low--

00:19:54.930 --> 00:20:00.830
and the setup cost x
to running a business.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:06.120
And naturally, if your wealth
is high and your costs are low,

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.350
you're a talented person,
you're, say, not only

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.000
likely to go into business, but
that finance constraint is not

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.470
going to be binding either.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:22.450
You're going to run the marginal
product of capital down to 1,

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.402
and you still have
more money left over,

00:20:24.402 --> 00:20:26.610
so you kind of carry it off
to the end of the period.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.320
There is a region
of lower wealth,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.420
but yet somewhat
talented people who

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.150
are constrained
entrepreneurs, they

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:44.330
would actually like to employ
higher levels of capital k

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.450
than they are able to finance
out of their own wealth.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:52.110
They would borrow if they could,
but there's no credit yet.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:57.960
And actually, this straight
line is when they can't even

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.460
cover their setup
costs, or on the margin,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.630
they're just able to
cover their setup cost

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.240
x out of their wealth b, and
there's nothing left over,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.150
so they can't even run the
firm on the intensive margin.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.970
And then the rest
of the guys, they're

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:20.360
kind of workers or
agriculturalists.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.590
So the shape of this is
intuitively reasonable, right?

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.280
The higher is
wealth and the lower

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.910
is talent, the more likely you'd
be a firm or an unconstrained

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:32.870
for a more--

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:38.000
the lower is your wealth
and the more likely

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.710
you are to be a worker.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.720
And the thing is, even
when your talent is low,

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.650
if your wealth is quite low,
you can't be in business.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.770
These are potentially
profitable entrepreneurs

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.100
who are constrained on
the extensive margin

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.260
at these parameter values.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.420
Now you say, what
parameter values?

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.390
Well, I drew some lines.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.630
The point of the
micro estimation

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:11.990
is to actually be able
to draw those lines based

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.130
on the micro data.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.800
So-- oh my goodness.

00:22:25.408 --> 00:22:27.200
I don't know how often
this is going to be.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:40.760
So let me just grab
three equations

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.570
and let you focus on this.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.960
Here are the functions,
the structural functions

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.220
of the model.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.160
There is a trade-off between
consumption and bequests

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.380
under this utility function.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.170
It's basically top Douglas
in today's consumption

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.910
and tomorrow's wealth.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.580
This little parameter
here is omega.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:06.290
Omega is basically going to
determine the savings rate.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.810
And we're going to
have to calibrate it.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.800
This production
function is ugly.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.690
It was meant to be
general, which sounds good.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.910
So it has capital,
it has labor, it

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:26.570
has the square of each of them,
and it has an interaction term.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.270
Unfortunate-- so
it's like translog.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.930
Approximately-- it can
approximate almost any function

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.350
reasonably well,
but the problem is,

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.450
it carries with it
five parameters.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:48.883
Alpha, beta, xi, rho, and an
unreadable script, I'm sorry.

00:23:48.883 --> 00:23:51.175
I thought it was sigma, but
it doesn't look like sigma.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:00.940
And this is one of
the regrets that I

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.940
have about pushing so
hard in these models,

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.540
because it turns
out in hindsight,

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:14.590
we generated data from
that production function

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.230
knowing the model,
and it's still

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.910
hard to recover
these parameters.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.440
That's something you should
get into the habit of doing.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.550
It's hard enough with
real data, and you already

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:30.168
know, the actual world
is not like your model,

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:31.710
it's an abstraction,
but at least you

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.200
ought to make sure that--

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.910
and that you can't
really do too,

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:38.640
too much about, because
you have to make decisions

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.995
about your model.

00:24:39.995 --> 00:24:41.370
But at least you
should make sure

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.910
your estimation routine
works well if the model--

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.190
if the world were
exactly like the model

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:51.550
and generated the data
that you're about to use.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.020
Anyway, we did the
best we could on that.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:25:00.030
And this is this
distribution of setup costs,

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.220
the cumulative distribution.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.340
The easiest way to
disentangle this is to say,

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.660
suppose m is equal to
0, then this disappears,

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:15.300
and the cumulative distribution
is just rising linearly in x.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.510
In other words, the
density is flat.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.680
So this is just a standard
uniform distribution.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:29.860
That's also kind of
nice on the diagram,

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.880
because although I don't want
to enlarge this, basically

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.120
you want to know how many
people of a certain x

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.010
there are given a certain b
how many people of a certain x

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:46.260
there are before you go
from firms to workers.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.940
And that's just the
length of that line,

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:59.100
and so a uniform density is
convenient for the sort of--

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.800
the geometry of that figure.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.590
However, if m is you
know more than 0,

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.360
then you get that squared term.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.880
It just means the distribution
of talent is skewed to the--

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.620
really, the distribution of
cost is skewed to the right,

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.870
so there are some very
untalented people,

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:23.440
and conversely
when m is below 0.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.180
Now all this big to-do
about micro underpinnings,

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.760
what do we see in the data?

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.290
Well let's imagine
we see the wage,

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.320
and we also see sort
of the net worth

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:44.790
or wealth of the household,
and we know their occupation.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.160
So what does the model predict?

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:55.030
The model predicts that the
occupation is, say, firm--

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:59.170
or yi equals 1 in
a binary sense--

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.730
when that distribution
of cost is--

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.600
this is-- you should
read this as an x--

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:11.520
is on or below that partition
between workers and firms.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.970
So you add up, as I was just
doing, all those households

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.200
with talent less than that.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.790
Likewise, if you're not
going to be yi equal to 1,

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.820
you're going to be yi equal
to 0 and a wage earner,

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.190
and that's the rest
of the residual mass

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.110
or 1 minus this probability.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.900
So what is the likelihood?

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:40.780
So just quick review,
imagine you have a coin,

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.980
and usually coins
are fair coins, so--

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.310
I'm not sure about
the Super Bowl--

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.520
equal probability of
being heads or tails,

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:57.490
and you see a bunch of
data, 4 heads and 6 tails,

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.600
and you say, well what
were the odds of that?

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.540
Actually, it's a
bit more interesting

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.370
if the coin is not
fair, because then it's

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.210
not probability 1/2 for
everything that turns up.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.150
But you just basically
take the data,

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.240
which is heads, tails, tails,
heads, and so on, or a worker,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.470
firm, firm, worker, and start
adding up the probabilities.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:22.595
They're independent events.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.360
So this says log here,
but if you undid the log,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.790
you would have the
probability of being a firm,

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.960
and then this yi would
just be the 0 or 1,

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.520
and when it's equal
to 1, you're just

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.760
getting the number of, say,
heads or the number of firms

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.675
in the sample, and likewise
for the number of workers.

00:28:48.675 --> 00:28:50.300
It's very convenient
to take the logs--

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.403
and it takes this form because
logs bring the exponent down

00:28:57.403 --> 00:28:58.445
in front of the variable.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.090
It's a cute trick,
too, because you want

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.460
to maximize the likelihood.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.828
Logs and levels or
monotone in each other,

00:29:11.828 --> 00:29:13.370
you find the max of
one, you're going

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.790
to find the max of the other.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:19.380
So econometricians
usually maximize logs

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.320
for reasons like this.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.030
And it turns out with
all that algebra,

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:30.450
those particular
functional forms,

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.630
for any set of parameters
in the production function--

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.750
alpha, beta, rho, sigma,
xi, et cetera, right?

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.620
You can draw all those
lines, and therefore,

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.570
determine all these
probabilities.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.930
So for a given guess
about the parameters,

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.330
you'll have a certain value
for the log likelihood,

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.580
and then you just maximize
that log likelihood

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.910
by choosing those parameters.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.170
Essentially the data come
first there on the diagram,

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.210
you have sort of wealth--

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.060
thousands of data points,
but you have wealth.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:10.090
And you don't see talent,
that's an unobservable,

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.100
but you do see their occupation.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.600
So you're moving
those curves around

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.520
to try to fit as many
data points as possible.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.190
Here are the
estimated parameters.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.300
Alpha, beta, xi, rho,
sigma, et cetera, and it's

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.702
also estimated
naturally, because that's

00:30:25.702 --> 00:30:27.160
kind of telling
you whether there's

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.356
a large mass of high or low
cost people in the population.

00:30:32.356 --> 00:30:34.921
AUDIENCE: So the line of
matter is just the boundary

00:30:34.921 --> 00:30:36.870
between [INAUDIBLE] right?

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.660
Divide [INAUDIBLE]
doesn't matter for--

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.660
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Not in
this case, no we didn't.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.360
Now if I had from the data
households answering-- or firms

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.190
answering the question,
are we constrained?

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.560
And you could even get
more sophisticated.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.150
Running businesses,
would we like

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:58.110
to invest more given
this shadow price?

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.040
I've asked questions like that.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.210
Alp in the macro
lecture half an hour

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:09.460
ago was describing something
like that in the US for firms

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.070
right before the--

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.470
during the financial crisis.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.440
And you could even do something
on the extensive margin

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.360
in principle.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.930
You're worried that those are
lousy questions, like are you

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:22.710
constrained?

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.060
But anyway.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.180
It seems to actually
work better in practice

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.720
than you think it
might in reality--

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.110
in the classroom.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:40.170
Calibration, not everything can
be gotten from those occupation

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.490
choice diagrams.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.950
So-- and actually, we changed
the model just slightly.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.980
We're going to allow
a very slight growth

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.110
rate in subsistence
income as if there

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:55.500
were some technological
progress in agriculture.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:07.260
That savings rate is not
estimable from the micro data

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.870
the way we were doing it, and
neither is the subsistence

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.550
income in farming.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.470
The level of
subsistence income we

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:18.870
get from a socioeconomic survey
done in Thailand in 1976,

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:24.740
basically matching to
the reservation wage,

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.150
there is a slight growth--

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:30.480
very small trend over
time in that wage rate,

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:35.450
so we let it grow exogenously
at 5.5% per year--

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:36.020
less than 1%.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.280
And the Cobb-Douglas says
the savings rate-- and again,

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.420
we're going to get--

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:51.690
we're going to set it high,
basically, at basically 1/4,

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:55.390
but that matches evidence--
and you'll see this in China

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.390
and many of the countries
you're about to study,

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:01.130
the savings rates are very
high in these countries.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.630
So that's actually realistic.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:11.610
Learning by doing.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:24.730
So from the original Bernhardt
and Lloyd-Ellis paper,

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.800
you begin to see a little
bit of the dynamics

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.710
and also their take on
the development literature

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.050
at the time they
wrote the paper.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:41.320
First of all, why that
myopic savings rate?

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.830
Why just care about
today and then tomorrow?

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:48.430
Well, it just helps enormously
in computing the solutions

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:49.970
to these models.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.510
It's like every
day is a new day.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.520
Here's your wealth.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.810
How much am I going to save?

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.570
That's a number, that's the
fraction of wealth you're

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.450
going to save, and the
rest of it you know you've

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.730
got available for consumption.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:07.480
So after you make your
occupation decision.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.940
So every period,
you kind of have

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.360
like a static model where you're
deciding on the occupation.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.580
How well you do, et
cetera, depending

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.469
on your occupation
choice and your talent,

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.889
determines your end-of-period
wealth, and that you carry over

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:22.469
to tomorrow.

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:25.630
And tomorrow's a new day, the
whole thing starts over again.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.230
No, I don't believe these
guys only live two periods.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.420
Although you will
see, this tension

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.469
in the literature between
realism and tractability,

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:39.429
people still use quite heavily
overlapping generations models,

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:41.199
and some--

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.850
and I mean like
with three periods.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.239
So it's kind of hard to match
year-to-year data that way,

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:52.090
but you can tell
interesting stories

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.760
about the distribution of
wealth and the impact of credit

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.610
constraints.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.010
So this is an extreme
version of that.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.860
This is like Rostow's
take-off, you remember?

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.170
He worked for Kennedy and--

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.940
so this-- he says at first
nothing much is happening,

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.670
and then you get
in this transition,

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:16.750
wages begin to rise, but
income and wealth are still

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.190
growing first
order, and then you

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.820
get the advanced economic
development and wages take off,

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:27.310
and incomes and wealth
basically really, really become

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.080
quite high.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.540
And I'll forget to
say it, but if you

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.420
let this model run
long enough, it

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.540
will converge to a steady
state in which there's

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.060
no more any growth in wealth.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.320
It's no longer a growth economy.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.170
And that steady state, because
of this weird assumption

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:51.460
about two periods
and these costs,

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:55.380
you will see people
making transitions.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.180
They will have a certain
wealth and they're

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.150
going to be talented or not
talented in certain things,

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.280
and they will decide
to, say, forget

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.440
what they were doing last period
and do something new today.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.000
So you'll see a lot of churning
in the occupation distribution,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.010
but you will not see
any trends in anything

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.010
in their steady state.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.760
This is going to be a
recurrent theme when

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.760
we go through these papers as
to which ones are essentially

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:23.490
in steady state, and maybe we're
looking across a cross-section

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:28.110
of economies that vary in some
way, each of which country

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.450
is in a steady state
versus transitions.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.060
Today is about
transitions, and I'm not

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.730
going to spend a
lot of attention

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.040
to this steady state of this
model, which is probably

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.040
relatively uninteresting.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:47.640
OK so now we get to the
financial deepening part.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:56.380
So what we do is create an
exogenous financial sector

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.300
under which everybody's
intermediated.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.880
It's like one of
these dual economies,

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.120
except for us, it's like you
have free banks and access

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.030
or you have zero access.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.210
It's very extreme.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.160
In the banking
sector, so to speak,

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.560
it's not just about
credit, it's about lending.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.220
So there's an equilibrium
interest rate that's

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.730
going to clear the market.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:28.330
More savings is
equal to borrowing.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:32.590
And now you look at
the return to farmers,

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.918
farmers have their
subsistence income,

00:37:34.918 --> 00:37:36.460
but they put their
money in the bank,

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.800
so they get 1 plus little r or
big R rate of return on that.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.610
Everybody-- when
you have complete--

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:49.560
there's no uncertainty
here, essentially.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.850
So you have a
neoclassical separation

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:57.760
between households and firms,
which essentially means

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.990
the financing decisions
of firms have nothing

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.350
to do with households.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.880
Another way to put this is, just
put all your money in the bank

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.350
and then borrow what you need
if you need to borrow it all.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.300
So all these guys are
putting their money

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.690
in the bank,
including the firms,

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:18.060
and then they borrow
back what they need.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.790
Now it is true that the
borrowing and lending

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.710
rate are the same
here, and that's how

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:26.670
on getting away with this trick.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:31.140
Two lectures from now we'll have
a paper focusing quite a bit

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.080
on the spread between
borrowing and lending

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.650
as a measure of the
cost of intermediation.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.900
This paper doesn't have
that, this paper just

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.800
assumes perfectly
costless intermediation,

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.420
and these rates are the same.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:47.920
OK.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:58.550
So then alpha
fraction of households

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:01.850
are in this intermediate
sector at this date.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:05.540
So how much is in
the savings accounts?

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:09.080
So you take the
total population,

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.990
alpha fraction of the
population intermediated,

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:13.700
everybody's putting--

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.530
in that sector
putting b in the bank.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.740
So alpha times b is the saving.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:25.070
And what's basically
the borrowing level?

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.890
Well firms, if you
are firm, you're

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:29.990
going to borrow to
finance both your setup

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:34.370
costs and your capital.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:40.790
So basically we add
up or integrate up

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.220
over the two characteristics--

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:48.320
that is to say the setup costs
themselves as well as wealth.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:55.400
You will only
integrate up over firms

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.280
when x is below some threshold.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.760
Now this threshold no long--

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.550
I should actually have drawn
it on the other diagram.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:07.460
It's a completely flat line.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.530
Whether or not you're
a firm or a worker--

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:12.260
I said this-- has nothing
to do with your wealth,

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.940
it just has to do
with your cost.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:19.070
So if your costs are high,
above this threshold,

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:20.870
you're not going to be a firm.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:22.693
And if it's below, you are.

00:40:22.693 --> 00:40:24.110
If you don't have
a lot of wealth,

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.652
you're going to have
to borrow a lot.

00:40:25.652 --> 00:40:28.610
So this is sort of
the demand for funds.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:34.810
And then basically you're going
to set the demand for funds

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.380
equal to the supply for funds
and find an interest rate that

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.190
does that.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.020
There is an inequality
here only because, again,

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.200
the 1 plus little r
could go to 1, basically,

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.090
so the cost of
funds is basically

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.510
like storing grain in the
backyard, in which case

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.150
there's some indeterminacy you
might as well just carry it

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:59.320
over rather than
put it in a bank.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.050
But interest rates can
be higher than that.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:07.660
And likewise,
employment, we've got--

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.180
we just integrate up
the demand for work.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.000
Employment is tricky.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.640
People have jobs.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.080
You're either going
to be a farmer

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.960
or a worker or an entrepreneur.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.460
There's only so many
people in the population.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:34.170
So if the size of the
population is normalized to 1,

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.570
you've got basically the
number of entrepreneurs

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:41.200
and the number of work workers.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.120
The number of
workers, it just comes

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.880
from the employment
of the existing firms

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:52.290
where l is the labor
hired of a firm, facing R

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.390
is the interest rate,
and w is the wage.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.380
There's two sectors
here, intermediated and

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.090
non-intermediated.

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:03.040
They're different
from each other,

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.350
but the labor market is perfect.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:11.610
Again, not so credible,
but makes it much easier.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:14.370
So you can work for
any firm, there's

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.680
not even any real
migration cost-- maybe

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.780
that cost of living
costs, and that's it.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:24.360
So you'll be indifferent at
a given wage where you work.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.350
So you would just add
up all the employment,

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:30.230
add up the number
of firms, and again,

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.412
lots of the time, this
thing will be equal to 1,

00:42:32.412 --> 00:42:35.120
you used up all the
people, and you'll

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.900
have to find a wage that equates
the demand and the supply

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.420
for workers.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.860
So on Friday, Yan will kind of
talk you through a bit more.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.070
Easy to say, maybe
not so easy to do.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.040
Even though it's a
static model, you

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.610
have to find these equilibrium
interest rates and wages that

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:56.510
clear the market.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.420
You need an algorithm
for doing that.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.540
You need to have a good
guess about how to search

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.630
and how to iterate.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:06.570
AUDIENCE: Question?

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:07.507
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes?

00:43:07.507 --> 00:43:09.090
AUDIENCE: This may
be in all of these.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:11.340
So I want to think about
investments in human capital.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.530
Should we think of that as--

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:13.988
that goes into x
or should we think

00:43:13.988 --> 00:43:16.302
of that as a different
kind of investment which--

00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:17.760
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
There really isn't

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.180
any realistic human
capital in this model.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.000
These guys are choosing
whether to be--

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.200
set up a firm or have--

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.200
or what occupation.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.730
You could imagine a
model where the choice is

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:36.280
whether or not to go to
school, but it's just not here.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.240
And it's not even
realistic in the sense

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.030
that those x's, you might
say, well I went to school,

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.540
I'm pretty talented, and I
know how to run a business,

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.010
might want to do that.

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.930
But that talent can change
from one period to the next,

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.085
so it's not great
for human capital.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.210
OK.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:01.650
So here are income,
savings, labor share,

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:04.410
the fraction of entrepreneurs,
and a measure of inequality--

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.910
the Gini--

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.430
as both predicted by
the model and what

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:12.330
is actually in the data.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.610
The data are up here, actually.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.130
So this didn't work too well.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.930
Income growth in the
model is always less

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:25.320
than it is in the actual data.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.510
Remember my little
bit for science?

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.890
Where I said let's see
how well a model does?

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.110
Yeah, we can match
these things much better

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.090
if we also choose the
parameters to try to match them,

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.200
but we didn't do that,
we're completely under--

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.060
it's amazing, it's
doing in some sense,

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.400
as well as it does at all--

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.230
like look at
inequality, for example.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.370
You can't probably
tell from the back row

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:52.530
the difference between
the model and the data.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.570
There's some intervals here.

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.360
Basically, when you
estimate things,

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.910
you have standard errors
on the parameter estimate.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:02.310
So there's a whole
confidence interval

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.460
around all those curves I'm
drawing on the occupation

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.510
choice.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:10.500
So we generated lots of
different paths drawing

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:16.480
parameters within standard
confidence intervals.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.350
But the actual mean
path is right here

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.700
and the actual Thai
data is right here.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:31.680
So this inequality kind of is
basically very well-tracked,

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.990
and eventually goes down.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:36.720
When does this start going down?

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.570
That's when there
are no more farms.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.550
Well that's kind of the
model version of it.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:45.090
There's a sharp
increase in the wage

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:49.970
at around 1992 in Thailand.

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:54.090
I think-- I don't know when
the turning point was in China.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.370
But this is pretty typical.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.720
Fraction of entrepreneurs
we're underpredicting,

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.310
although eventually it rises.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:10.430
Labor share would do
quite well, and so on.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.400
So now with the model with
its pluses and minuses,

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:30.890
we can do some
welfare experiments.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:35.340
And what I want
to do essentially

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.430
is a couple of experiments.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.930
RCTs.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:46.530
One partial equilibrium and
one general equilibrium.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.480
So here's my randomized control
trial for partial equilibrium.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.360
I'm going to take a
household and move it

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.760
from the non-intermediated
it sector

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.160
and put it in the
intermediated sector

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.960
and then look at
the welfare gains.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:18.870
Now actually, before 1992, the
wage in Thailand is the same,

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.500
it's still at the
subsistence level

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.530
regardless of this
expanding financial sector.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.448
So it's both a partial and
a general equilibrium model,

00:47:28.448 --> 00:47:30.740
but I don't have to worry
about the general equilibrium

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.700
effects of the wage.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:38.450
It's not like I'm giving the
economy intermediation or not.

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:41.720
Or it's equivalent
with having a guy moved

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.800
from autarky to
financial intermediation,

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.030
because a wage is the same.

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:52.090
So what the hell is this?

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:56.620
This huge spike
here are basically

00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:05.310
the gains equivalent--

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.580
consumption gains
or wealth gains

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:13.920
for households of low
wealth but high talent.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.670
So I pinpointed them earlier in
the occupation choice diagram.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:22.410
So they are no
longer constrained.

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.150
So there are some
very talented people

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:29.640
who will now set up businesses
and even hire workers and make

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.880
a lot of money.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:36.450
After all, the flip side
of the wage being low

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:40.290
is that when you're a firm, you
don't have to pay high costs.

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:41.460
You make a ton of money.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:50.790
So these gains are so big that
they make the other things

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.320
small in comparison.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.270
Actually, these sort
of orangey people

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:02.490
are switching from workers
to firms, and these blue--

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.785
light-blue people, those were--

00:49:05.785 --> 00:49:07.410
I don't know if this
will surprise you,

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:11.610
those are inefficient firms
going out of business.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:17.190
I mean, they're an autarky, not
much to do with their money,

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:20.310
throw it back into the business,
drive the marginal return down

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:25.890
to the carrying costs
of grain, and that's

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:34.800
the best thing other than
being a farmer that you can do.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.970
But when the interest
rate goes up early on--

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:39.920
and early on the interest
rate in this economy

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.560
will be high, because there
isn't that much wealth,

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.880
and there's relatively high
marginal product in production.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:52.430
So these lazy, untalented,
richer people--

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.110
sorry, lazy was excessive.

00:49:56.923 --> 00:49:58.340
They don't have a
choice about it,

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.730
they're just not
good at anything.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:06.192
They take their money and
they put it in the bank

00:50:06.192 --> 00:50:07.400
and they get a higher return.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.210
We'll come back to this later
in the class when we actually

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:18.820
come back to RCTs and
IV and all of that,

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.780
but there is already
a caution here--

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.170
some things are not monotonic.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:26.900
The treatment effect is not
monotonic in this model.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.360
Intermediation it's a
good thing in the sense

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:33.350
that everyone can earn higher
income at least when there are

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:36.600
no general equilibrium effects.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.670
But the way in which
you earn higher income

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:41.040
may involve occupation shifts--

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.380
some people going into
business and some people

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.700
going out of business.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.850
So in a very simple
way, you can see

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:55.280
how you would lose
monotonicity of the treatment.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.080
We'll come back to
that in a later day.

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:03.530
So this is a prediction--

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:06.070
oh, now let's jump countries.

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:07.200
I'll go to Mexico.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.160
Actually, I think
the next slide is--

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.260
oh, how annoying.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.140
OK, I'm learning.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.260
We won't have this--

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.240
I'll try to avoid this
problem in the future.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:29.300
In Mexico, the
fractions of basically

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:34.640
wage earners, the fraction of
agriculturalists or subsistence

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.970
people, and the fraction
of entrepreneurs.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:41.900
And the earlier one I didn't
show you on that scale

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.030
actually shows these can
be slightly different,

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.450
but on this scale with
all the occupations,

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.670
it works quite well.

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.010
So yes?

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:54.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
imagine the fractions

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.720
in each occupation.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.500
You mentioned some of that--

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.060
there's a lot of movement
in cross-occupation type.

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.373
That probably is a
[INAUDIBLE] from the data.

00:52:04.373 --> 00:52:05.790
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, we're not--

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:06.872
AUDIENCE: Times the time.

00:52:06.872 --> 00:52:07.830
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Right.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:13.800
We're not actually looking at
the panel of a given household

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.520
at their career choice
or occupation choice

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.930
over many time periods.

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.900
We're just only using
the cross-section

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.190
to do the estimation.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:31.030
So even though-- I think your
point is-- even though this

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:34.000
seems to fit well,
beneath this picture,

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.430
there may be households
flipping from one to the other

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:41.110
and the model doesn't
say they should.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.690
Actually, when we get to
Buera and Shin and so on,

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:50.570
that will be at center stage.

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:53.150
They're going to be more
realistic about the talent

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:56.900
distribution, and they're going
to even have forward-looking

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:00.050
dynamics so you'll-- they'll
anticipate the way in which

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:06.410
their talent may evolve in the
future and it will remedy this

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.130
shortcoming.

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:11.400
Now it looks like I'm
claiming a big success here

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.220
in the sense of jumping
New Mexico and all

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:17.040
of a sudden showing you
the outcome after all

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.220
the same steps, but let me
show you something else.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:39.540
So this line is the
model predicted number

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.420
of entrepreneurs in the
sector without credit,

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.970
and this is the one with credit.

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:46.840
It's bad news.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.540
It's kind of the opposite
of what you think.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:57.660
Financial autarky turns out
to be better in this sense.

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:02.220
Now normal people don't
show you this stuff.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.760
But I'm showing it
to you for a reason.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.340
And it's in that book
that I mentioned, the one

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.680
we're writing on Mexico.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.840
So what went wrong?

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.150
Well I went back and I've
been worried about this

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:19.110
for quite a long time.

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:22.480
I went back and looked
at the chapters again.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.800
Am I going to put this
book in the trash can?

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.490
And what I realized was
that occupation choice

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:34.400
where you do these probits of--

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.280
the variables like credit
weren't even showing up there

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:42.980
as being significant,
whereas they do in Thailand.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:46.820
So the data-- the micro data
were essentially speaking to me

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.770
and I wasn't hearing
it for a while.

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:52.380
It makes the point
of the lecture,

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:57.300
which is you've got to take the
micro underpinning seriously.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.500
And I followed an algorithm as
if I'd figured something out

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.840
in Thailand and I
could do it in Mexico.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.410
But now I know why it wasn't
working so well in Mexico.

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:10.230
It doesn't tell you what the
next step is, by the way,

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:14.526
but clearly LEB isn't going
to work there very well.

00:55:14.526 --> 00:55:19.810
AUDIENCE: But isn't the firm
bigger In the credit sector?

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:21.060
ROBERT TOWNSEND: In the model?

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:21.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:22.358
The firm is--

00:55:22.358 --> 00:55:24.275
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
the model doesn't work.

00:55:24.275 --> 00:55:26.250
AUDIENCE: No, but--
so if there is a lower

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:28.260
percentage [INAUDIBLE]
but the firm's bigger,

00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.210
that's fine, right?

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:30.680
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Oh.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.170
All right, I don't
have firm size.

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.720
I'll go back and
look if we actually--

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.440
oh, I should say also
something related.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.140
We have-- like I
have for Thailand,

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.840
and it's available
to you on Dataverse,

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.690
we have a massive
archive of Mexican data.

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:56.510
It should be on Dataverse,
and I meant to include--

00:55:56.510 --> 00:56:00.530
I hope there is included
already Jorge Moreno's summary

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:03.930
of the Mexican data.

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:06.030
And this book will
kind of give you

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:09.270
a sense of the great variety
of data we have and--

00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:12.360
I can go back and look and
see whether we actually

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.710
plotted firm size.

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:23.390
OK, another model.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:28.210
So this is the one with
endogenous financial deepening,

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:33.430
and I'm leading off with a
picture that should remind you

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:36.530
of the lecture of last time,
which is this trade-off

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:37.030
between--

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:45.280
potentially between
growth and levels and also

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.560
the variability of growth.

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:59.070
In this case, at low
levels of income,

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:01.950
you have higher
variability, which

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:07.060
is kind of a fact that seems
to be true in the data.

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:09.900
However, this is a
model-generated path

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:15.540
in which over time, per-capita
income is going to be changing,

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:17.670
and from those
points on, is going

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:20.460
to change the
statistics of the model

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:24.930
in terms of expected future
growth and the variance

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:27.040
of the growth.

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.830
So how does this model work?

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:34.240
Well it is-- this one
is forward-looking.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.440
So households don't just care
about today and tomorrow,

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:43.150
they care about the
discounted expected future,

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:46.860
and they care about, in this
case, the log of consumption

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.120
at every date.

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.550
In a minute we're going
to talk about some-- only

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:53.730
slightly more general
power functions.

00:57:53.730 --> 00:58:01.150
Beta is the discount
rate, and we're

00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:05.230
going to simplify sectors
and occupation choices,

00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:12.790
almost like telling the usual
riskless and risky asset.

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:15.490
Rather than thinking
of them as occupations,

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:17.150
there's a riskless asset.

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:21.250
So when you invest at t
minus 1 a certain amount,

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:26.850
you get delta times that amount
back in the following period.

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:32.470
A constant rate of return,
and the risky technology

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:37.261
when you invest at the
amount i at t minus 1,

00:58:37.261 --> 00:58:43.290
you get it back plus
or minus 2 components.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:46.780
There's an aggregate
shock, theta t, no i on it.

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:50.200
It's common across
every household.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.360
It's like aggregate risk.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.790
And there's an epsilon,
which does have--

00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:00.980
this is household
j, sorry, not i.

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.310
i as investment, j is household.

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:06.160
This epsilon j is the
idiosyncratic shock

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.640
that's hitting household
j, and definitely

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.980
different across
different households.

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:21.810
So if you're lucky
enough or you've

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:30.240
paid the money to be in the club
of the financial intermediary,

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.130
there's an advantage--

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:36.120
two advantages, actually.

00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:42.790
Information and pooling
of idiosyncratic risk.

00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:49.860
So the return you get at t
minus 1 for carrying stuff over

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:55.230
is the maximum, largely,
of either the safe return

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:56.880
or the risky return.

00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.120
But the risky return
isn't risky anymore.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.240
This model goes too far, you
see it perfectly in advance,

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.410
so you can kind of
pick off what to do.

01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:10.610
It's an extreme version
of intermediaries

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:13.610
have an information advantage
and they can advise clients

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.430
because they have
that advantage.

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:22.040
Well not quite, there's
kind of an intermediation

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.900
cost and that's gamma.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:28.260
So this is a wedge, this
is in inefficiency--

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:33.210
it's not modeled in a deep
way, but it uses up resources.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:36.010
And we'll come back
to that momentarily.

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:40.390
And the other thing
is, it's costly to get

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:46.600
into the investment club,
and it cost basically alpha.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.090
Not the alpha of the previous
slide, just some new number.

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:53.950
There's perfect competition
among financial intermediaries,

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.100
they might be tempted
to try to make profits,

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.840
but they're going
to be driven down

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.440
to basically making
people pay the fixed cost

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.350
to enter the financial
system at the true cost

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:11.520
and to give them a return
that exactly covers the wedge

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.440
and is otherwise equal to
the real rate of return

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.080
on the investment.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.860
So where did the epsilon go?

01:01:21.247 --> 01:01:22.330
I said they got the risk--

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.740
I didn't quite say it right.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.830
You get the risky
thing for sure,

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:34.910
not only because theta,
but because these epsilons

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:36.320
disappear.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.900
And the epsilons
are pooling across

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.440
many, many, many households.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.330
It's IID, essentially,
so it goes to 0

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:46.020
as you have more
and more households.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.620
So it's like a mutual fund.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.820
It's not just a bank
with fixed borrowing,

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.960
it's more like equity.

01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:59.370
You put your money
in the bank, it

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:03.120
gets kind of the average
return on the bank's portfolio,

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.910
you might want to borrow
some to finance investment,

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:07.597
but that's kind of separate.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.810
So this looks like a
discrete choice problem.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:25.190
And if you bear with me, It's
not as bad as it may seem.

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:27.980
Suppose at day t, you've
already made the decision

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:31.620
to keep yourself out of
the financial system.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.520
So then you have
a value function

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.670
that depends on your
wealth, which is not

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:42.720
b here, but k at day
t, and you're going

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.220
to decide what to do with that.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:49.140
You can save some of it, and the
difference between what you had

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.160
and what you save, you eat.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:58.945
And the amount that you
save, you get to put into--

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.200
some fraction into the risky
thing and some fraction

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.670
into the safe thing.

01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:11.400
Now you're not in the
bank by the decision

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.890
here, so you're definitely
going to be experiencing

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:17.056
this idiosyncratic risk.

01:03:17.056 --> 01:03:24.730
It may make the save return
more attractive, but we'll see.

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:32.060
OK, so then the next
period rolls around,

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.050
and then at the
very, very beginning,

01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:36.030
you kind of get to
decide whether to join

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:39.410
the financial system
or not at that date.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:43.510
You're forward-looking.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:49.470
So the value to, say, not
joining the financial system

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:52.800
is this W that was over here.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.300
W means withdrawn or
not participating.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.300
But if you do decide
to join, you're

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:04.560
going to get the other branch,
the value of participating,

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.340
and that's basically going to
be something called V. However,

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:14.040
not quite V, because that
instant that you join,

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.700
you're going to have to subtract
off those fixed costs q.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.190
And in this model, it's once
and never more, actually.

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:27.520
Once you pay to be in,
you stay in forever.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.200
So this could have been a
simpler slide in the sense

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.170
that once you join and
you join the V branch,

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:38.700
you'll never again have
to choose to withdraw,

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.860
you'll just stay in the
financial system-- you reap

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.908
all the advantages of
information and risk pooling

01:04:44.908 --> 01:04:46.200
and there's no reason to leave.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.650
You'd have to change this
model to get disintermediation.

01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:55.970
But the focus here was on
increasing intermediation.

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:07.220
So this is probably
something you've seen--

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.990
I'm not quite so
sure what you've

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:10.640
had in your other courses.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.890
This is a dynamic
discrete choice model.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:26.240
And basically, you have
this value function W

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.560
for low wealth.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.078
It's the highest
curve, and then you

01:05:30.078 --> 01:05:31.370
say, no, well this is above it.

01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:35.030
No, not really, because
at the instant you join,

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:37.320
you have to subtract q.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.740
So you take this V
and subtract q off

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.780
of the capital level that
brings the whole curve down.

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.490
So where these-- to this.

01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:49.520
So where this thing
crosses, that's

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.820
kind of the key entry point.

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:56.090
At k at 15, given the way
I've drawn these curves,

01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:58.790
to the left of 15, you
won't be participating,

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:00.590
and to the right
a 15, you will be.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:06.040
Now remember, there's not a
whole lot of heterogeneity

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.370
either, sort of wealth
is the key unique state

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:11.390
variable at the
beginning of the period,

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:15.970
so wealth alone is going
to predict if the model is

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:21.340
accurate, whether or not
you're in the financial system,

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.520
and I'll come back to that.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:29.860
Here, here are these savings
functions and portfolio

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.540
choices, and 15--

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:36.725
or I guess I said this
is kind of the key mark.

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:42.940
One thing that makes sense is
the dynamics, which is you're

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:48.070
saving up more and more in
advance for this eventual entry

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.530
into the financial system.

01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:52.600
Exactly when you
will go in depends

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.640
on the sequence of shocks
that you experience,

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.120
and you may experience setbacks
that push your wealth down

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.790
even though ex ante your
investment decision made sense.

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:02.950
But kind of slowly
over time, there's

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:07.530
this pressure moving
off to the right.

01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:11.272
So it makes-- but there's
discounting, right?

01:07:11.272 --> 01:07:13.230
So you don't want to save
up too much early on,

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.000
you kind of want to
be close, and then you

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.830
don't want to take all
that fixed cost out

01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:21.870
of your wealth at that date,
you save up to finance it.

01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:26.580
This is unexpected ex ante.

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:31.500
So the closer you get,
the riskier you go.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.260
So you would think
people who can't

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:36.810
diversify outside the
financial system would

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:38.820
be doing the safe thing.

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:43.050
But actually, this fixed cost
is creating a non-convexity.

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:44.670
If you remember
way back when you

01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:49.060
see Friedman and Savage,
sort of that utility function

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:53.160
which is not concave everywhere,
well you've got two branches.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:56.310
You've got this value
function for participating

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:59.010
and the value function
for not participating.

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:03.010
And in principle, they kind of
cross like a butterfly, right?

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:08.010
So then you're getting this
non-concave part in the middle,

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:12.480
and that's creating this kind of
risk behavior where they start

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.480
doing riskier or risky
things that kind of span--

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.090
take a chance of
grabbing the brass ring

01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:22.620
and bootstrapping up
to a higher level.

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.120
We didn't see that coming.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.590
Actually, those diagrams
look like they paced smoothly

01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:31.950
into one another in
those value functions.

01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:37.130
That's after this
randomization is going on.

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:38.899
Otherwise-- and so
the butterfly kind of

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:43.760
disappears, but only
after this randomization.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:09:00.810
So let me just say a few more in
terms of the actual functional

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:02.310
forms.

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:07.250
Constant relative risk aversion
of essentially degree sigma.

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:10.319
Beta, I said, was
the discount rate.

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:15.090
Sorry, this is now
xi rather than theta.

01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:18.569
But in any event,
we have to specify--

01:09:18.569 --> 01:09:21.300
and they're uniformly
distributed-- again,

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.840
not my favorite choice anymore.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.640
If something is
uniformly distributed,

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.380
you have to have an
upper and lower bound.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:33.600
So we have picked up two more
parameters for the epsilon

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:43.890
distribution, and even something
for the risky distribution.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.700
So discrete choice-- d for,
I guess, discrete choice,

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.380
basically you're
going to enter or not

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:06.470
enter depending on whether
your value of participating

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:10.160
is higher than not
participating and vice versa.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.100
The model that
those parameters is

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:17.270
going to give you the k star,
which, again in the example,

01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:19.010
was 15.

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:22.880
In general, k star is
going to depend on this--

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.440
all these list of parameters,
and this list of parameters--

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:33.080
the fixed cost, the discount
rate, aversion and utility,

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.840
the wedge in
intermediation, the upper

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.770
and lower bounds on
those distributions,

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:41.390
all of those things--

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:45.760
theta for GI-- basically
determine k star.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:54.830
And k star is going to determine
whether you at a given wealth

01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:56.600
choose to enter or not enter.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.110
So I'll skip this,
but basically there's

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:03.500
a complicated way in
which the parameters

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.620
of the model through
the lens of the model

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:12.030
are generating this
sort of threshold value.

01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:17.610
And likewise, therefore, you can
imagine, if at a given wealth,

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:20.190
you kind of see the fractions
participating and not

01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:23.040
participating in
the cross-section,

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.380
that you would be able
to sort of invert things

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.180
and estimate these parameters.

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.650
It's a bit tricky because
that theta, the level

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:37.120
of the aggregate
shock kind of matters,

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.690
so we have to integrate
up over that, too.

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:44.660
But when we do the estimation
using a socioeconomic survey,

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:48.150
the papers online, we
ended up estimating--

01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:52.080
and actually, comfortingly,
a lot of the parameters

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.040
make sense.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.640
The discount rate's close
to 1, but not exactly.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.890
A degree of risk aversion
is like almost the log case

01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:06.600
and the depreciation rate was
4% and so on and so forth,

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.730
quite remarkable.

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:08.230
Yes?

01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:10.640
AUDIENCE: And so is that--
am I reading this correctly?

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.140
Is that gamma was
estimated to be 1?

01:12:15.132 --> 01:12:16.590
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
In this case, yes.

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:17.132
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:19.720
So with that imply efficient--
like there's no wedge?

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.250
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, no wedge.

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:25.871
Yeah, that-- I'll come
back to that momentarily.

01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:36.100
So again, we can
simulate the model--

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:42.910
and under various estimated
or robustness checks,

01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:44.560
parameter values--

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.050
to get the growth rate,
the participation rate,

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:52.000
and the tile index
of inequality.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.220
Now one caution on
the growth rate,

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.580
and I always have to
check to make sure--

01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:00.850
this model has aggregate shocks.

01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:04.040
So if you integrate out
over the expected shocks,

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.790
you're going to get a
smoother growth rate

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:08.340
path than in the actual data.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.855
And what is it that
I have to check?

01:13:09.855 --> 01:13:11.730
I always have to go back
and see whether this

01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:15.030
was one where we use
simulated values of theta

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:16.755
or we took the average
over those thetas.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:23.000
We missed this upturn
here and the growth rate,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.180
and that's related to the fact
that financial participation

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.530
goes flat right here.

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:31.180
This model's great
at the trends.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:36.240
It gives you this very smooth,
ever-increasing participation

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.120
in the financial
system, and actually, it

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.060
gives you for a
while a good shot

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:46.140
at the increasing inequality
as those firms made

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:50.300
a lot more money, but
it misses the downturn.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.070
In fact, there are
no real prices,

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:54.230
there's nothing like a
wage or an interest rate,

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:56.060
that's a defect.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:01.640
And so it's almost like a
linear world, in some sense,

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.470
and we can't get inequality
to go down in this model,

01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:07.850
but we can get the
trends right for a while.

01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:10.150
This participation
thing is going

01:14:10.150 --> 01:14:12.620
to bring me back to the wedge.

01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:22.780
So what do we do?

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:28.650
We're going to do a policy
experiment, basically.

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:40.060
We look at the government's
control of the banking system

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.610
in terms of the ratio of credit.

01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:45.950
It's moving around a bit,
but essentially it's flat,

01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:48.380
it goes up, and then
it comes down again.

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.830
This is the liberalization
and this is the retrenchment

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:53.960
that happened before it.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:00.100
So what we do is, we vary
that parameter gamma.

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.297
It's not going to be
costless intermediation.

01:15:03.297 --> 01:15:04.880
In fact, we're going
to subtract off--

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:11.410
I think it was
something like 3% or 4%

01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:14.470
when the intermediation is
being done by government banks.

01:15:17.150 --> 01:15:20.970
And we don't change
the model otherwise.

01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:27.270
And amazingly, we get this
almost perfectly right.

01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:32.250
So we can actually get the
slowdown in the economy

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:37.740
as a function of this, quote,
bad policy experiment where

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.380
the government, for
one reason or another,

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.840
essentially took over
the banking system.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:48.930
By the way, we don't do very
well with growth differences

01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:53.930
even after liberalization,
and we can--

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:57.670
and the reason is partly
because, at least through

01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:00.580
the lens of OLS
regressions, it's--

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.830
I've alluded to this before--

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:04.540
it's just basically junk.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.600
I mean, it's not a
stationary model.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.070
The decision rules
are stationary,

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:12.420
but aggregates like
growth rates are not.

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:15.970
And you can use
this value functions

01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:19.330
to back out the welfare gains.

01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:21.020
There are a number
of ways to do that.

01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:23.110
One thing we could do
is just surprise people.

01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:26.470
They think the banking system
is going to stay restricted,

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:28.900
and they've made
their dynamic plans,

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:33.757
and then we surprise
them and liberalize.

01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:36.340
And they're better off, and we
can calculate through the value

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.500
functions.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.150
It's a bit complicated
and I'm not

01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:41.775
going to take you
through these slides,

01:16:41.775 --> 01:16:45.170
but the welfare gains
can be quite large.

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:47.530
Now we can imagine
surprising them,

01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:50.980
like varying that wedge or
varying the fixed cost and it

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:55.810
actually matters a bit, and we
can take this model to Mexico

01:16:55.810 --> 01:17:02.640
and it does pretty well with
the trend of the growth rate,

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:10.480
but around 1992, Mexico
had yet another crisis.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.280
And not surprising, this model
is just very ill-equipped

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.550
to handle that kind of stuff.

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.190
Actually, things
started going better

01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:23.130
with Vicente Fox around 2002.

01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:27.810
We could restart the model
over here and it will do well.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:30.930
But it's not going to explain--

01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:33.810
this is why Mexico
is still poor.

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:35.880
I mean, they go upstairs,
they go upstairs,

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.410
and then they fall down again.

01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:40.925
And they've been doing this
since the early '80s, you know?

01:17:40.925 --> 01:17:43.050
Now hopefully they're not
going to fall down again.

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:44.850
But the model--

01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:46.920
I promised you
shortcomings, right?

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:52.620
This model is not designed to
get at sudden stops or things

01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:53.750
along that line.

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:08.020
So the last thing I
want to show you quickly

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:13.450
is another kind of experiment.

01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:15.640
Instead of going to a
new country like Mexico,

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.210
we started to look interior
to the country of Thailand.

01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:24.510
This is a picture
of basically wealth

01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:27.550
using a principal component.

01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:29.380
You can see in
and around Bangkok

01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:31.840
and going north to Chiang Mai--

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.380
the wealth corridor, if
you want, of the country,

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:40.180
these green things are the
provinces of my survey.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:44.560
And looking at them
again, you can actually

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.125
see where the villages are,
you can see the road network,

01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:52.340
at least on major highways, you
can see the district centers.

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:55.850
And I promised I
would ask you this.

01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:57.560
I mentioned it before.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.310
If you have an interest in
going through some of the GIS

01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:05.360
capabilities, I'm more
than happy to schedule

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.490
an extra session.

01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:09.400
I have to check my GIS person.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.110
I see some of you
shaking your heads.

01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:14.320
You don't all have to go,
so that's enough for me.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.770
So let me check with her
and maybe we can possibly

01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:21.970
do that Friday of
next week, but it

01:19:21.970 --> 01:19:24.790
would be over and above the
regular recitation section.

01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:30.760
And so here is a
picture of where

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.190
the businesses are in Thailand.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.000
And through this GIS,
something called the Moran,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.500
you can see whether areas, which
have high levels of enterprise,

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:49.840
are surrounded by other areas
with high levels of enterprise

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:53.230
or low levels surrounded by low.

01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:59.695
And so you see this quite
salient geographic picture.

01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:13.660
And here, we took levels
of enterprise in 1986

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:17.410
and looked at the growth
rate of enterprise

01:20:17.410 --> 01:20:22.570
between 1986 and 1996.

01:20:22.570 --> 01:20:26.550
This area in here, the
colors are a bit pale--

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:28.430
it doesn't come out too well--

01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:30.700
are areas of
convergence in the sense

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:32.830
that they started at
high levels but then they

01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:33.925
shrink to lower levels.

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.910
This area around it,
though, these reds, those

01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:42.500
are areas of agglomeration.

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:45.550
They have high levels
and high growth rates.

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:51.140
There's an ever-increasing
concentration of enterprise.

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:56.660
These pink areas are catch-up
areas along the corridor which

01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:00.980
had low levels, and now they're
gaining a lot of enterprise.

01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:04.910
And these blue areas out here
are kind of like the boonies.

01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:09.070
They have low levels
and low growth rates.

01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:11.130
So it's not a uniform picture.

01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:15.030
In fact, you can take
this down to the provinces

01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:19.980
and look in the data at
the areas of agglomeration

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:26.040
and relative low
levels, and then that

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.960
looks like almost
the same picture.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.900
That's a
model-generated picture.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:35.610
So we actually projected--
took Lloyd-Ellis and Bernhardt

01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:39.090
and projected it down
at the village level,

01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:41.760
and here you can
see agglomeration.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:45.040
It's not exactly identical.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.790
There are certain
predictions in the model

01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:51.990
that don't happen in
the data, but largely

01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:54.620
these sort of favorable areas--

01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:58.200
a subset of the candidate
of favorable areas

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:01.140
are the ones that actually start
growing like crazy in Thailand.

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.810
And here at that same level
is Greenwood in Jovanovic.

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:14.490
And here, these
red areas are areas

01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:17.700
where the model
overpredicts the data,

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.980
and the green areas
are places where

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.480
the model is underpredicting.

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.150
In other words, these
red areas, which turn out

01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:28.630
to be the same urban areas,
Greenwood and Jovanovic

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:32.460
is predicting they should have
more banks than they actually

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.680
do.

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.020
So in some sense, even
though they're higher wealth,

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:40.930
they're underserved relative to
what the model would predict.

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:44.280
And these green
areas, those are areas

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:48.660
where there's more access
to credit than Greenwood

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.360
and Jovanovic would predict.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.340
Now it turns out
this story has to do

01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:56.250
with the interplay
between commercial banks

01:22:56.250 --> 01:23:00.210
that operate in urban areas and
the bank for agriculture which

01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:02.220
is operating in rural
areas, and we'll

01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:06.340
come back to that in the
last lecture of the class.

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:10.200
So I'm done, essentially.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.380
I'll just point you to
the rest of the slides.

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:18.660
Basically we did kind
of a rigorous comparison

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:23.940
of the successes
and the failures.

01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:26.100
So you can actually go
through each of the models

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:29.700
and see on which data
which model's doing well

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:34.950
and which data models
are doing poorly,

01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:39.240
which feeds into the
issue of model selection

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.810
and next steps in the research.

01:23:40.810 --> 01:23:45.680
So OK, with that, I'm
slightly two minutes beyond.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Where were we,
last time?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Last time, we said we were
setting aside the problem of the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
structure of the atom.
We were setting it aside

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because we were stuck,
and what we had to do was to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
look at another area of
discussion.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And that is this wave-particle
duality of light and matter,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
because it is that discussion
that is going to give us the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
clues about how to proceed.
We are putting aside the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
discussion of the structure of
the atom all the way until next

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Wednesday, because next Monday,
I was reminded,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is a student holiday.
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And so we started.
We talked about the wave-like

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
properties of light.
We said that the property of

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
superposition,
the fact that you can put waves

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
at the same point in space and
their amplitudes add.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Since waves have both positive
and negative amplitude,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that means that you have
constructive and destructive

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
interference.
And it is those interference

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
phenomena, then,
that are evidence for wave-like

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
property.
And we did the two-slit

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
experiment to try to give you an
example of interference

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
phenomena.
We were trying to understand

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
those interference phenomena,
and did so in terms of this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
diagram here.
The interference phenomena that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we saw was an array,
actually a row of bright spots,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
dark spots, bright spots,
dark spots.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And we drew these semicircles
here around each one of the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
slits.
They represent a little bit of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the wave that emanated through
those slits.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Because those slits are small,
then, those waves emanated

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
equally in all directions.
That is why these semicircles

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
represent the wave maxima.
And what we discovered is that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
if we looked along this line
here, this line which led to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this bright spot,
that all of the waves along

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
this line were constructively
interfering.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
That is, we had the maximum of
the two waves at the same point

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in space, or the minimum of the
two waves at the same point in

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
space.
And we noticed that everywhere

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
along this line,
where we had that constructive

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
interference,
the difference in the distance

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
of the waves traveled was one
lambda.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We noticed, here,
that everywhere along this line

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that led to a very bright spot,
we had constructive

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
interference.
And the difference in distance

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
traveled by those two waves was
two lambda.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And, likewise,
up here, along this line,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
the difference in the distance
traveled was zero lambda.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And from just that,
in a sense, qualitative

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
observation, we drew a
conclusion.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And that conclusion was in
order to get maximum

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
constructive interference,
a condition that had obtain,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
is that the difference in the
distance traveled by the two

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
waves has to be an integral
multiple of the wavelength.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
N could be 0,
1, 2, 3, etc.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And so, the very bright spot
here that always bisects the two

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
slits, since N is 0,
we call that the zero-order

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
interference feature,
or the zero-order fraction

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
feature.
The bright spot that is either

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to the left or to the right or
up or down of that center bright

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
spot is the first-order
diffraction feature or the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
first-order interference
feature.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And then the second bright spot
up or down from the center is a

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
second-order diffraction
feature.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And so on and so on.
And in recitation section,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
what you also should have done,
is you should have reasoned

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
through what the condition was
for destructive interference.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
That is in between these bright
spots, you have dark spots as a

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
result of destructive
interference.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And that results because,
say, right here you get a dark

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
spot --
Right here at that point you

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
would see the maximum of one
wave at the same point in space

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
as the minimum of the other,
and so they exactly cancel.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And so by just analyzing what
waves were destructively

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
interfering, you should have
come up with a general

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
expression for destructive
interference,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
of N plus one-half,
that quanity,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
times lambda.
That is your general condition

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
for destructive interference,
the difference in the distance

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
traveled by the two waves.
This kind of diagram here we

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
are also going to see on Friday,
because this interference

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
phenomenon is the property
associated with waves.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And what we are going to do is
see this diagram again when we

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
scatter electrons for particles.
We are going to see that

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
particles, also,
will destructively and

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
constructively interfere.
They also have wave-like

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
properties.
That is what we will do on

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Friday.
We have established,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
now, the wave-like properties
of radiation,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
so I would like to move on and
talk about the evidence for the

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
particle-like nature of
radiation.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The evidence for the
particle-like nature of

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
radiation comes from an effect
called the photoelectric effect.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Shortly after Thompson
discovered the electron,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
scientists were noticing that
if you took a metal and shined

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
radiation on that metal,
that indeed electrons were

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
emitted.
Electrons came off.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
These were called
photoelectrons.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
However, the radiation that you
shined on the metal had to have

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
a frequency nu that was greater
than or equal to some threshold

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
frequency, nu nought.
That is, if you took radiation

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
of some frequency here,
nu, that was less than this

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
threshold frequency,
well, you did not get any

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
electrons off.
Well, another way to kind of

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
understand that data or that
effect is to just plot the

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
number of the electrons that
come off as a function of the

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
frequency of the radiation.
And so at low frequency,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
there are no electrons,
but all of a sudden you get to

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
nu nought, and then electrons
start coming off.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And no matter how high you
increase the frequency here,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
the number of electrons that
come off remains the same,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
remains constant.
And it turned out that for the

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
metals that were looked at,
at that time,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
the threshold frequency,
here, was in the UV range of

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
the electromagnetic spectrum.
Well, in addition to just

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
measuring the number of
electrons and generally

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
observing this effect,
scientists did not understand

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
what was going on.
So they just started measuring

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
everything they could think
about measuring.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And one quantity that they
measured was the kinetic energy

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
of these electrons that were
being emitted.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And so you take kinetic energy
here, KE, as a function of the

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
frequency.
They found that at low

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
frequency, again,
there is no kinetic energy,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
because there are no electrons.
And then at some frequency,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
all of a sudden electrons
started coming off.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And the kinetic energy of those
electrons seemed to increase

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
with the frequency once past
that threshold frequency,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
nu nought.
Well, this was really another

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
one of these conundrums,
here, at that time,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
because classical physics,
classical electromagnetism,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
classical physics had no way of
explaining these data.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And, in fact,
what classical physics

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
predicted is that the kinetic
energy of these electrons,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that that kinetic energy should
have nothing to do with the

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
frequency of the light.
That is, the kinetic energy was

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
constant.
As you increased the frequency

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
of the light,
classical physics would tell

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
you that the kinetic energy
should not be affected by the

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
frequency of the light.
There was nothing in the

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
classical way of thinking,
classical electromagnetism that

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
connected the frequency of the
light to the kind of energy,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
to the kinetic energy.
There was no way for blue light

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
to make the electrons have a
larger kinetic energy,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and for blue light to have an
effect on the kinetic energy,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and red light to not have an
effect on the kinetic energy.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
In addition,
what classical physics

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
predicted is that the kinetic
energy of the electrons should

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
be dependent on the intensity of
the light.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
That is, the more and more
intense the radiation on the

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
metal, the more and more kinetic
energy those electrons should

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
have.
Because, after all,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
if you increase the intensity
of the light going into the

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
metal, you are putting more and
more energy into it.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
That should be reflected in
just how energetic those

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
electrons were picked out.
The more energy in,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the electrons ought to come out
with larger and larger kinetic

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
energy.
Of course, the observation was

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
that the kinetic energy of the
electrons had nothing to do with

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
the intensity of light.
The kinetic energy of the

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
electrons did not increase as
you made the light brighter and

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
brighter.
As you put more and more energy

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
in, the kinetic energy remained
the same.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It didn't have an effect.
This was a real conundrum here.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The known classical physics was
making predictions really just

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
contrary to what was being
observed.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
These data, here,
of the kinetic energy versus

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
the frequency,
were around for a few years

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
before Einstein took a look at
them in 1905,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
a hundred years ago.
And he looked at these data for

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
many different metals.
Here is some data for metal A,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
for example,
and here is some data for metal

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
B.
And, in both cases,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
it certainly looked like the
kinetic energy was linearly

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
dependent on the frequency of
the radiation.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
But what was different for the
two different metals was the

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
threshold frequency here,
nu nought.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
What Einstein did was,
he went and fitted a straight

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
line to these data,
y equals mx plus b.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And when he did that,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and he went to calculate the
slope here, m,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.000
of these lines,
he thought "very interesting."

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Because the slope of those
lines was 6.626x10^-34 joule

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
seconds.
The slope of those lines was

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
something called Planck's
constant, h.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You say so what?
Well, the reason he was so

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
interested in this is because
just a few years earlier,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
there was a scientist by the
name of Max Planck who was

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
interested in understanding what
was called the black-body

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
radiation data.
What is a black-body?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Well, let's just,
for simplicity purposes,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
think of the black-body as the
burner on an electric stove.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
What you know is that if you
turn up the voltage on that

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
burner, the burner gets hot.
It increased in temperature.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And you increase the
temperature, and sooner or

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
later, that burner is glowing
bright red.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And you increase the
temperature some more,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and the burner is glowing a
brighter red.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And you increase it some more,
and it is glowing orange.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And you increase it some more,
which you shouldn't do,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and it's glowing yellow.
And then if you could increase

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
it some more,
it's glowing white.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
What is happening,
as you increase the

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
temperature, is that the
radiation from that black-body,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
this is the black-body
radiation, is increasing in

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
intensity.
But, more importantly,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
the frequency is getting larger
and larger.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Dark red, bright red,
orange, yellow,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
white, those are all
frequencies.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000
The frequency is shifting to
higher and higher values.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And what was actually done at
that time is that the intensity

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
of that black-body radiation,
oh, and this material is not in

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
your notes, because you are not
responsible for it.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I am just trying to make this
surprise that Einstein noticed

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
about the slope.
I am just trying to put it in

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
some context,
why he was so surprised and

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
amazed at it.
This black-body intensity here,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
people had dispersed that
radiation and looked at the

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
frequencies that were coming
off.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
This is intensity versus
frequency.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Here is a general shape of that
intensity versus frequency.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
That was observed for some
temperature T one.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
That was a low temperature.
And then, when the temperature

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
was increased and the intensity
versus frequency was observed,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
well, the frequencies generally
got higher.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
This is higher temperature.
Intensity goes up.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And you increase the
temperature some more,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and you get even higher
frequency.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
T three is the highest
temperature.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And that is what the data were.
What Planck was trying to do

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000
was to understand the origin of
that black-body radiation.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
What he said was that in these
black-bodies,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
in these materials,
what there must be are

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
oscillators that are giving off
this radiation.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
But he had another little kick
to these oscillators.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
These oscillators were giving
off radiation or energy in

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
chunks, in quanta,
in particles.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And using that idea,
plus some statistical

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
mechanics, he was able to
calculate the shapes of these

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
curves.
That is, he indeed got,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
for the lowest temperature
here, a curve that looked like

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
this.
And for T two,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
he got a curve that looked like
this.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And for T three,
he got a curve that looked like

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
this.
He got the shape right,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
but he wanted to get the
intensity right,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
too.
What he realized he had to do

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
was he essentially needed to
have a scaling factor,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000
actually, in front of his
frequencies of his oscillators.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
He wanted a constant.
And so he said,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
what constant do I have to have
in order to make all of these

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
data fit the observation?
That constant is Planck's

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
constant, his own 6.626x10^-34
joule seconds.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
There it is.
That is Planck's constant.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
That is it.
There is nothing deeper here.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
It is a natural constant.
It comes from our observations

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
of the world,
of nature.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
That is it.
It is a fitting constant.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And so that is why Einstein was
so amazed, here,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
when he realized this number is
the same as what comes out of

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
here.
There must be something very

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
fundamental about this h,
this Planck's constant.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
That is the story.
Isn't that amazing?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.000
What Einstein then proceeded to
do, of course,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.000
is to write down the equation
of the straight line that he

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:33.000
just put through these data.
And so that equation is the

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
kinetic energy equal to nu,
which is our x,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
h, which is the slope.
And then what he found was that

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
the intercept here,
of course, is minus h times nu

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
nought.
This is plus minus h times nu

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
nought.
And that is the equation of a

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
straight line.
Of course, he realized,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
if this is energy on this side,
boy, there better be energy on

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
this side.
And so this h times nu

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
better be an energy.
And since this nu was the

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
frequency of the incident
radiation, therefore,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
h times nu better be the energy
of the incident radiation,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
E sub i.
That is where this expression,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
energy equals h times nu
comes from.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Nothing more.
That is where it comes from,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
the photoelectric effect.
This was the first time that

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
there was any relationship
between the frequency of the

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
radiation and the energy of the
radiation.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
In classical electromagnetism,
there is no relationship

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
between the frequency and the
energy.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
This was the first time in
which that relationship was

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
observed.
And what this is saying is the

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
following.
This is saying that you can

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.000
have any frequency of radiation
you want, but the corresponding

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000
energy comes in these chunks of
h times nu.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
h is a quantization constant.
Radiation, nu,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
is continuous,
but the energy that corresponds

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000
to any given frequency of
radiation is h times nu.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000
This E equals h times nu,
here, is thought of as a

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
quantum of energy.
A particle of energy.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
A chunk of energy.
Later on, it became the photon,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.000
the energy of a photon.
If this h times nu here

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
was an energy,
well, this h times nu nought

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
also better be an  energy.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000
It is the threshold energy.
Let's draw an energy level

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
diagram to try to understand
that.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I am going to plot an energy
here.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Let's draw an energy level for
an electron.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
This is an electron,
here, bound to the metal.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And we know that it takes some
energy to rip this electron off

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
of the metal.
Up here, at higher energy,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
is going to be our free
electron.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
I will just call it
electron-free,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
not bound to the metal anymore.
And the energy that is required

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
to pull the electron off,
from the bound state to its

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
free state, is this threshold
energy, h times nu nought.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
This threshold energy is like

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
an ionization potential.
You know what the ionization

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
potential is.
Just the energy required to

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
pull an electron off an atom or
a molecule.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
However, when we are pulling an
electron off a chunk of a metal,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
we actually have another name
for it.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
It is called the work function.
That is just historical,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
but it is the same thing as an
ionization potential.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And we often give it the symbol
phi.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
That threshold energy,
ionization energy for a metal,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
is the work function,
here, h times nu,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
phi.
The important point here is

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
this.
In order to get an electron off

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
of the metal,
what you have to have is

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
energy, E sub i.
That energy E sub i has to be

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000
equal to at least the threshold
energy, h times nu nought.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
If you come in with energy of

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
this radiation,
of this wavelength and that

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
frequency, you pulled the
electron off,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
and then the electron is off
the metal and it just kind of

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
stays there.
It doesn't move away.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
But you can also come in with
energy here, E sub i,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
that is greater than this work
function, than the threshold

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
energy.
And you can pull the electron

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
off.
But then, the electron is

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
actually going to move away from
the metal, and the energy with

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
which it moves away from the
metal, its kinetic energy,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
is just the incident energy
minus this threshold energy.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
It is the excess energy here.
And I am going to write it as

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
the kinetic energy.
From that energy level diagram,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
this energy,
the incident energy,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
has to be equal to the work
function, h nu nought,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
plus the kinetic energy.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Or, if I turned this around,
the kinetic energy is equal to

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.000
the incident energy minus h nu
nought.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
The actual expression for the
energy that Einstein found,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
I just turned that equation
around.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
This is an equation that you
have to know.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
I will not give this to you on
an exam.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Now, you don't have to memorize
it.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
You just have to reason it.
Draw yourself an energy

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
diagram.
You know conservation of

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
energy.
The sum of these two energies

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
has to equal the incident
energy.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Then you will be all set.
Now, what is very important

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:44.000
here is the following.
If I come in with radiation

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
that is, say,
a half of the threshold energy.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Suppose I come in with two
photons, where each photon is

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
one half h nu --

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
The bottom line is that you are
not going to get an electron

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
off.
Even though you are coming in

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
with two photons,
which together are going to

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
give you the threshold energy,
you won't get a photon off.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
You have to come in with at
least the energy of the work

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
function.
A photon has to have at least

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
this energy to get an electron
off.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
That is the particle-like
nature of radiation.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Energy comes in chunks,
in particles of energy,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
in quanta of energy.
Likewise, if I came in here

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000
with a photon that had twice the
energy of the work function or

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
the threshold energy,
I would still only get one

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
electron off.
I would not get two electrons

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
off, even though energetically
you would be able,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
in principle,
to get two electrons off.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
But you won't.
You will only get one electron

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
off.
Whenever you send a photon in,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
if it has enough energy,
that is if its energy is equal

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
to or greater than the work
function, you will get an

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
electron off.
There is one electron for every

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
photon.
You never get two electrons for

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
every photon,
or you can never get one

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
electron for two photons that
are lower energy.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
That is the particle quantum
nature of radiation.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
That is important.
Yes?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:18.000
What is the form of the photon?
What do you mean by form?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Oh, you want a picture of the
photon.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
You're looking at them.
You cannot draw a picture of a

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
photon because you want to
relate it to something that is

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
within your classical
experience.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And you cannot do that.
It isn't a classical particle.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
That is what you're working
with right here.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
You are trying to use your
experiences, that are everyday

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
experiences, to explain
something that isn't within your

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000
everyday experiences.
You don't have a frame or a

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
format to do that.
Yeah?

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Yes.
If you have a constant flux of

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
photons onto the surface,
you will have a constant flux

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
of electrons.
Now, there is a probability.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
It is not necessarily the case
that every photon gets in,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
will eject electrons,
because there are other kinds

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
of competing processes.
Whatever the rate with which

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
the photons come in.
It depends on the flux of the

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
photons.
And we will have some problems

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
like that, where we are going to
assume that the probability of

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
the electron coming off is going
to be one, so one electron for

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
every photon.
But, in reality,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
there are competing processes.
Are all electrons being

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
ejected?
Actually, some electrons.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Again, this goes to the
probability.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Some are actually kind of going
in, too, into deeper the metal.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Not the probability,
right.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
The rate at which the electrons
come out with is dependent on

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
the intensity.
The more photons you send in,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
the larger the number of
photons per second coming in,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
the larger the number of
electrons per second coming out.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
This is a plot,
here, of the energy of the

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
electrons.
That's all right.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Other questions?
Yeah?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Eventually.
Yes.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Absolutely.
There are other problems that

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
will come in.
Usually, your light source

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
isn't so energetic that you
could possibly do that.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Now, also usually what happens
is that you've got your metal

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
grounded, so that as you lose
electrons, new electrons come in

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
and fill it up to the fermi
level.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
And so you don't charge up your
sample.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
In an experiment,
if you had your metal just not

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
grounded and you did shine some
radiation, what would happen is

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
the metal would start to charge
up.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Then, that would make it
difficult to get electrons off.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Yes?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Yes.
How strongly those electrons

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
are bound to the metal depends
on the electronic structure of

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
the metal.
And we are going to talk a

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
little bit about what determines
the strength of the interaction

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
for electrons on atoms and
molecules, but it is similar to

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
what it is for metals.
That is coming in a few days.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Yes?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Yes, there is.
Right.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
You don't actually have to have
a metal.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
You could do it.
There are usually higher

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
frequencies on insulators and
semiconductors,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
right.
It is harder to see the effect,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
but it can be done and has been
done.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Well, what I want to do right
now is to show you an experiment

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
we are going to do.
We are going to do a

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
photoelectron experiment.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And the experiment is this.
We have a device up here.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000
What we have is an aluminum
plate.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
And that aluminum plate is
mounted on this blue metal rod.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
And in the middle of this rod
is a needle on a pivot.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
And this is a fairly
frictionless pivot.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
This black ring,
here, is just a support

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
structure, an insulating support
structure.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
What we are going to do is put
some excess charge on this

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
aluminum plate.
And that excess charge is going

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
to run down this metal rod and
then onto this needle.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
And because that excess charge,
the electrons on the needle and

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
the electrons on the metal rod
are repulsive,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
since this is rather
frictionless,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
that needle is going to move
because of the repulsive

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
interactions between these
electrons.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
What we're then going to do is
try to do the photoelectron

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
experiment.
We are going to take some UV

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.000
radiation and shine it on this
metal and drive the electrons

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
off.
And we should see,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
then, the needle swing back to
its original position.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
I need a couple of volunteers
in order to do this experiment

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
here.
Come on up.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
All right.
Fantastic.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I think that is all right.
Good.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Okay.
One of you needs to be the

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
charger, and the other needs to
be the discharger.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Which one?
You want to discharge?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Discharge, okay.
You come over here.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
And what you are going to do is
discharge the aluminum plate

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
after we get some excess charge
on it.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
You are going to do it just by
holding it up to here.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
You have to get it kind of
close because it is not a very

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
intense UV source.
Could you get the video cam on

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000
the side or on the center to get
where we are putting it?

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
I guess we are putting it on
the side, right?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Okay.
There we go.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
There is the device.
You are the charger.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
What we are going to do,
to get the excess charge,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
we are taking a piece of
natural fur.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
We are going to rub it on this
Lucite rod.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
You have to keep your fingers
on the yellow tape here.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
And we are going to transfer
some of the natural oils here

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
onto this rod.
And there are plenty of

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
negative ions around here and
free electrons.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
That oil likes those negative
charges, and so there are going

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
to be excess negative charges on
this Lucite rod.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
And then you are going to come
over here and just touch the

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
edge of this and let the
electrons flow onto there.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Are you right-handed?
You have to rub that really,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
really hard.
[LAUGHTER] Great.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Go over there.
Touch the end.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Cool.
Why don't you give it another

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:30.000
jolt here and we will really
move that needle over.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Okay.
Discharger.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
We have to give it another
jolt.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
That is okay.
You may have touched it with

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
something else and discharged it
a little bit.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
No, that's okay.
You have to get the hang of

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
this, here.
You are doing fantastic.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Take it off.
That's what it is.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
You are holding it on too long.
Okay, that is pretty good.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Put it in front there.
Get it a little bit closer.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Here comes the UV radiation.
We did it.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Try it again really hard.
Just touch it.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Take it off.
Do it again.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
You need to do it again.
You've got to get it right

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
here.
Not too much,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
not too little.
Okay.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
It is doing it.
Discharge in front.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Electrons off.
Now we have to do a control

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000
experiment.
That is, you have got to charge

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
it up again, but now,
when you put the light there,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
what I am going to do is hold
up a Pyrex plate in between the

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
light and the metal.
It is going to block the

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
radiation, and it should not
discharge.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
You need to get on there.
Fantastic.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
There it goes.
Here is the plate.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Get it to a little bit lower.
Do a good discharge.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
[APPLAUSE] Fantastic.
Thank you very much.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Thank you for being a good
sport.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
That is the photoelectron
experiment.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Hey, it works.
Well, what I want to do now is

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.000
just spend a few minutes working
on a few problems.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
I think these are pretty
straightforward,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
but I just want to make sure
that everybody is on the same

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
page here in terms of being able
to do the homework.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Here is the first problem.
The first problem says,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
how many photons?
And remember what we said a

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
photon was?
E equals h nu.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
This is the number of joules.
Implied is the number of joules

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
per photon, although we don't
usually write this,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
but that is what that is,
joules per photon.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
You may want to write it as you
do these problems.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:28.000
How many photons associated
with radiation of a wavelength

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.000
lambda equals one picometer,
which is 1.0x10^-12 meters,

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000
how many of these do you need
in order to create,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000
say, a laser pulse of energy
that is one joule?

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Lasers are pulsed,
so I am talking about a pulse

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
of energy, one joule.
You want to draw yourself a

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
picture, here.
We are drawing a picture of one

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
pulse of energy,
one joule.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Now, we have not been given the
frequency, here,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
of this radiation,
but we know the wavelength,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
and we know the relationship
between frequency and

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
wavelength.
It is just c over lambda.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
I know what lambda is.
I can calculate nu.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
And, when I do that,
I find that the energy of the

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
photon, hc over lambda,
that energy of the

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
photon is 1.99x10^-13 joules per
photon.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
And I am using one more figure
than is significant since this

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
an intermediate step in the
calculation.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.000
If I want a pulse of one joule
of energy and I am asked how

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000
many photons do I need to get
that, and each photon is

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
1.99x10^-13 joules,
well, that means that I am

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:24.000
going to need 5.0x10^12 photons.
There was a question here?

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
All right.
Let's work another one.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Here, we want to define what we
mean by power.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000
This says the power of
radiation from the continuous

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
laser is three milliwatts.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
We have some laser,
and the power of that radiation

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
coming out is three milliwatts.
Well, what is power?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Power is energy per unit time.
It is the energy delivered or

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
the energy expended per unit
time.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
The unit of power that we are
going to use is a watt.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
A watt is a joule per second.
We are told that we have

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
radiation of three milliwatts.
That is 3.0x10^-3 joules per

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
second.
And the question asks,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
how long will it take for a
total energy of one joule to be

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
supplied?
Well, one joule.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And we have the rate of energy
supply as 3x10^-3 joules per

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:54.000
second.
That gives us 330 seconds.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:04.000
That is straightforward.
Finally, we have one more.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.000
It says, how many photons per
second of, again,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000
the same radiation,
of the wavelength of one

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
picometer.
That means, again,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.000
we are dealing with photons
that have an energy of

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:39.000
1.99x10^-13 joules per photon.
How many photons per second,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.000
the rate of photons at the
wavelength do you have to have,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
or do you have,
if the power of the radiation

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
is three milliwatts?
Well, the power of the

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000
radiation is 3.0x10^-3 joules
per second, --

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
-- and we have 1.99x10^-13
joules per photon.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:18.000
In order to have this kind of
power, what we have to have

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.000
being emitted is 1.5x10^10
photons per second.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
All right.
The photoelectric effect is one

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
of the experiments that
demonstrated the particle-like

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
nature of light,
of radiation.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Particle-like nature because
you have to have these chunks of

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
energy to make some process
occur.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Next time, we are going to look
at and will just talk briefly

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.000
about the other experiments that
demonstrated the particle-like

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
nature of radiation.
And that other experiment is

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
the demonstration that a photon
has momentum,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
even though it doesn't have any
mass.

00:48:22.562 --> 00:48:25.000
See you Wednesday.
See you Friday.

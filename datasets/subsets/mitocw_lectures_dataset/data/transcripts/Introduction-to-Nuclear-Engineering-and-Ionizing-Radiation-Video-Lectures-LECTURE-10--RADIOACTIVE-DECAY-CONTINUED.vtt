00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:24.130
MICHAEL SHORT: I got
an interesting question

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.960
in the anonymous
comment box, and I

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.090
want to see how many
other people agree

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.130
with it the comment
when something like,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.710
is everything in this field
of nuclear science engineering

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.067
computational in nature?

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.650
Because so far, we've
pretty much just

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.277
thrown theory and
simulations at you,

00:00:38.277 --> 00:00:39.610
we haven't done any experiments.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.465
So who shares this
concern or wonder?

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:45.375
So 1, 2, 3, 4--

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:46.670
OK, 5, yeah.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.950
So getting towards
roughly half of you.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.280
So I can confidently
answer, no, this is not

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.320
a purely computational field.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.680
We just had to get you just
enough science and physics

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.050
so that you'd be able to
understand some of the lab

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.910
activities that we've got in
store for you, one of whom,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.130
Mike Ames here from
the Nuclear Reactor Lab

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.490
is going to be helping
you with-- actually, two

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.760
of them he'll be helping with.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.320
MICHAEL AMES: Two?

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.650
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.000
Well--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.610
MICHAEL AMES: --your bananas.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.290
MICHAEL SHORT: The
bananas and the thing

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.540
that we dreamed up today, so--

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.665
MICHAEL AMES: This morning?

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:15.270
OK.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.580
So you want an intro those--

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.030
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.680
MICHAEL AMES: --and
I'll, I don't know--

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.820
MICHAEL SHORT: Fill
in what I get wrong.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.362
Also, Mike's going
to talk about what

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:23.780
we're going to do together,
which is called NAA,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.940
or Nuclear Activation Analysis.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.370
There are many, many
ways of measuring

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.500
what sort of impurities
may exist in materials,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.450
and this is among
the most sensitive.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.903
We happen to have
a nuclear reactor.

00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:36.320
So what we will
be doing, what I'm

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.892
going to ask each of you guys
to do for a special assignment

00:01:38.892 --> 00:01:41.350
that not graded, except you'll
need it for the problem set,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.180
so it kind of is, is
I want each of you

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.810
to bring something into me
that weighs about 50 milligrams

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.110
in one piece, fits in
here, is not fissionable--

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.185
so if you have uranium at home,
I shouldn't know about it.

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:56.060
And we also ask that
you don't bring anything

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.750
in that is too salty, because
sodium activates like crazy.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.360
And each of you, using your
knowledge of radioactive decay

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.060
that we learned Tuesday
and today, and the Bateman

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.120
equations in serious
radioactive decay next Tuesday

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.610
and Thursday are going to
calculate what impurities

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.540
exist in your sample.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.730
What is your sample?

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.560
It's--

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.085
MICHAEL AMES: You're
not going to be

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:16.080
able to do the calculations.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.630
MICHAEL SHORT: We're going
to make some estimates of--

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.140
MICHAEL AMES: Oh, OK.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.265
MICHAEL SHORT: The isotopes
that you'll let us see.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.340
The shorts, yeah.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.507
I know we're not going to
get every impurity, right?

00:02:24.507 --> 00:02:26.298
MICHAEL AMES: Well,
we're not going to able

00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:27.478
to run it next week.

00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:30.020
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, but I will
want your materials next week.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.190
OK.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.810
So by Tuesday, I'd
like each of you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.240
to come bring something
in for what you'd

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.750
like to know the elemental
composition consisting

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.880
of the following elements.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.470
Let's see.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.310
Problem sets, I think
I've got it right up here.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.210
Let me just clone the screen.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.710
So you can see what
we can look for.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.823
So this is provided
to me by Mike.

00:02:52.823 --> 00:02:55.240
We're going to do what's called
a short nuclear activation

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.640
analysis run looking for any of
the elements up on this list.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.040
Shorts 1 with extremely short
half-lives, and shorts 2

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.560
with elements in the
half-lives of hours.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.810
And Mike, I had a question
for you now that we're live.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.570
Can we count arsenic
in that list?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.045
Because it's
24-point-something hours.

00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:14.980
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah,
we could do arsenic.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.730
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.608
MICHAEL AMES: It's not
a great shorts element.

00:03:19.608 --> 00:03:21.150
You'd probably have
to have something

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.710
with a bunch of arsenic in it.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.210
MICHAEL SHORT: So
if any of you guys

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.010
have some food that
you bought online

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.020
and you don't know what sort
of contaminants there are,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.812
or if you've got a
piece of your fingernail

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:32.850
and want to see if you
are what you eat, or--

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.980
MICHAEL AMES: After
telling you why fingernails

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.670
would be a great
sample, we might

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.720
run afoul of the human
subjects in research issue

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.435
with fingernails.

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:45.185
MICHAEL SHORT: What
about dog fingernails?

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:46.295
MICHAEL AMES:
--believe it or don't.

00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:47.837
Ah, yes, your dogs
are probably not--

00:03:47.837 --> 00:03:48.630
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.370
So clip your pets'
claws if you want

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.260
to see if they
are what they eat,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.720
or don't tell me what nail the
thing came from, or get a--

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.450
slice up a piece of a peanut or
whatever your favorite food is.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.980
Or if you want to see if
there are any metal dyes used

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.285
in your clothing, cut out a
little 50 milligram square,

00:04:05.285 --> 00:04:07.410
it'll be like a fashion
statement and an experiment

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.390
at the same time, right?

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.110
So we ask that it's
about 50 milligrams,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.490
it's gotta fit in here, it's
gotta be not that salty and not

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.899
fissionable, and we're going to
pack a couple of these in one

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.940
of these rabbits, these
polyethylene rabbits.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.340
We call it those, one,
because everything in nuclear

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.137
is named after animals and farm
implements for some reason.

00:04:26.137 --> 00:04:28.470
Did I go over that with you
guys the first day of class?

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.690
Barns, shakes, pigs, rabbits?

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.190
OK.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.720
So a rabbit is a little capsule.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.830
Do you pop open or
you screw it open?

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.075
Oh yeah, there's like a
square nut at the top.

00:04:40.075 --> 00:04:42.450
Just a little capsule that
goes through a pneumatic tube,

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.580
kind of like the
old bank machines,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.520
and it'll go firing into the
reactor, sit there for a while,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.590
and get pneumatically
sucked back out so that we

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.680
can calculate the activation and
decay of the isotopes within.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.070
And a pig is just a
big heavy thing of lead

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.240
where you keep pieces
of things that you

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.880
irradiated for shielding.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.430
So if you notice the sort
of methodology theme here,

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.700
farms, pigs, rabbits,
barns, shakes.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.370
Anyone else you know any
other farmy nuclear units?

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.012
Yeah?

00:05:09.012 --> 00:05:09.953
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:11.370
MICHAEL SHORT: Or
farmy anythings?

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.590
AUDIENCE: They follow
the [INAUDIBLE] detectors

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.857
toads and bullfrogs.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.690
MICHAEL SHORT: So the
detectors in [? nif ?]

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.070
are called toads and bullfrogs.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.933
Why is that?

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:22.475
AUDIENCE: Because
the people who made

00:05:22.475 --> 00:05:23.933
the acronym
[? like making their ?]

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:26.315
acronyms, and [INAUDIBLE]
bullfrog was not [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:26.315 --> 00:05:28.690
MICHAEL SHORT: So actually
bullfrog stands for something.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.340
MICHAEL SHORT:
That's pretty cool.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.840
OK.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
acronyms are [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.885
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:39.062
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
acronym for acronym.

00:05:39.062 --> 00:05:41.020
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh yes,
the acronym for acronym.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.228
As well as what I study,
which is CRUD or Chock River

00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:44.380
Unidentified Deposits.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.758
It's the gunk that
builds up on fuel rods.

00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:48.550
Well, I talked to a
fellow from Chock River

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.140
who took extreme offense
to this detriment

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.900
to nuclear power
plants being attributed

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.668
to his fine laboratory.

00:05:54.668 --> 00:05:56.710
MICHAEL AMES: Oh, I thought
it was chromium-rich.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.377
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh,
see, that would work,

00:05:58.377 --> 00:06:00.310
but they're not
actually chromium-rich.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.950
Yeah.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.450
Cool.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.710
So Mike, do you want
to say anything else?

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.502
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah.

00:06:03.502 --> 00:06:07.240
I think I want to say-- so yeah.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.930
So--

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.080
MICHAEL SHORT: You want to
introduce yourself, too?

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.247
MICHAEL AMES: Oh yes, sorry.

00:06:10.247 --> 00:06:10.980
I'm Mike Ames.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.330
I work over at the
Nuclear Reactor Lab mostly

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.320
doing nuclear experiments, but
I also run the NAA lab there.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.200
And I've been doing
it for a while.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.620
So the idea-- the reason
we've got these guys,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.060
it'll irradiate the
samples in this.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.270
The easiest thing for
me to do without losing

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.460
any of your samples is
[INAUDIBLE] [? there, ?]

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.730
something gets radiated in
this, I slip the top off,

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.620
and you probably can't see that,
but it's for a little poly bag.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.790
I'll dump your sample
into the poly bag.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.320
So it's something that's like
one piece that works the best.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.070
What I usually tell
people, it's something

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.920
that you could
pick up reasonably

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.913
easily with a pair of tweezers.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.580
That way if they drop
it, I can actually

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.990
pick it up with tweeers.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.970
But that kind of
gives you a good size.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.510
No-- nothing to powdery,
because the powder

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.090
is going to spread around
and then get contaminations.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.358
Yeah, and that list there, I
guess you said you posted it.

00:07:10.358 --> 00:07:11.150
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.280
The list has posted
on the Stellar site.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.322
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:14.322 --> 00:07:16.940
So yeah, we'll see mostly
these light elements,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.000
the guys with the astericies.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.270
I don't see that well.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.410
Yeah, gallium I'm probably
not going to see that.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:24.910
So--

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.140
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting,
we found gallium

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.550
in your dog claws or something.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.370
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, magnesium,
aluminum, titanium, vanadium,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.752
those are easy.

00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:33.460
Sodium, chloride, and
potassium are easy.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.580
The manganese will
come out nicely.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.370
Some of the elements of--

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.840
generally more interest
down-- further down--

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.600
MICHAEL SHORT: Even further--

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.390
MICHAEL AMES: --chromium,
those have longer half-lives,

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.880
so I'm going to see those.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.990
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.340
MICHAEL AMES: Probably do like
a five or 10-minute irradiation,

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.910
let it decay for a little
while, and then we'll

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.540
do a couple of counts.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.318
Have you ever get
over to the reactor?

00:07:58.318 --> 00:08:00.110
MICHAEL SHORT: We will
be there a fair bit.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.040
MICHAEL AMES: OK, you guys are
going to be there next week.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.873
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:08:01.873 --> 00:08:04.573
So what do you
usually use NAA for?

00:08:04.573 --> 00:08:05.990
MICHAEL AMES: NAA,
well, the thing

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.560
we've been using it for lately
a lot is anything that's

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.660
going to go in the
core of the reactor,

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.880
we want to analyze to see if
there's any surprise elements--

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.732
to see how much cobalt
is in a piece of steel

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:21.440
that we're going to
put in because people

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.820
don't usually
measure the cobalt,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.400
but it activates really well.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.870
And so that causes
problems later

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.640
on when we have to
take some compartments

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.910
for cobalt-60 or half
the M that shows up

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.047
and things that you
don't expect it.

00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:35.450
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.360
MICHAEL AMES: My past
in doing NAA was all

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.039
environmental samples.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.559
So we did a lot
of trace element,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.930
heavy metal chemistry on
atmospheric particulates,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:55.340
rain water, ice cores, lake
sediments, crude oil, coal,

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.670
fly ash.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.940
And so we would measure
that whole stack

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.617
of elements and those guys
for environmental studies.

00:09:01.617 --> 00:09:02.450
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.550
MICHAEL AMES: That
was my time doing NAA.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.050
I don't know, I
think that's enough.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.400
You want me back here
next Tuesday or Thursday--

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.540
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, to
explain a little bit more

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.820
of the specifics of the process.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.737
MICHAEL AMES: --give you
the five, 10 minutes.

00:09:12.737 --> 00:09:14.420
And if you guys could--

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.770
I mean, are you guys can
be able to come to the lab

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.788
when we do the shorts?

00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:19.580
MICHAEL SHORT: Depends
on when you do them.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.640
If it's early
November, then yes.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.850
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, OK.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.483
So when I do shorts, I put two
samples in one of these guys,

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:28.150
they'll shlink into
the reactor and out.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.220
MICHAEL SHORT: Which
you guys should see.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.270
It's pretty cool.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.080
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, you
can watch that part.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.550
And then I run it
down the hallway

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.250
and throw each
sample on a detector.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.580
And while those samples are
counting, I run another rabbit.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.490
So it's kind of an all-day thing
running up and down the hall

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.470
every half hour.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.570
So you could almost come
anytime during the day

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.799
while I'm running these and get
one full round in half an hour.

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:52.632
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

00:09:52.632 --> 00:09:54.090
MICHAEL AMES: I think
that's the whole story.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.050
You can hang on to
that if you want.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.940
Thanks, Mike.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.960
So you heard the charge.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.710
Bring me your dog claws, your
eyebrows, your skin flakes,

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.610
your scabs, your--

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.990
MICHAEL AMES: Oh yeah, can we--

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.710
MICHAEL SHORT: --food pieces--

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:03.860
MICHAEL AMES: --from hair?

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.420
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh
Yeah, so no hair.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.730
MICHAEL AMES: We used to do
a bunch of hair analysis.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.810
Hair is a pain in
the neck because it--

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:11.810
MICHAEL SHORT: Staticky?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.310
MICHAEL AMES:
--clings to everything

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.890
and it gets stuck to parts.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.520
Yeah, we did some hair
analysis for the superfund site

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.750
in Woburn, and it
was a big success,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.730
but it was not pleasant
to do the work.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.680
MICHAEL SHORT: So don't
bring us your hair,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.230
but bring us your skin flakes,
your scabs, your dog claws,

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.310
your food scraps, your--

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.270
MICHAEL AMES: No skin flakes.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.590
MICHAEL SHORT: Just
don't tell him.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.007
MICHAEL AMES: Stuff
that you can--

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:34.365
like I said, something
that's like one good piece

00:10:34.365 --> 00:10:35.600
that you can pick it up--

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.185
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, get creative.

00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:37.227
MICHAEL AMES: --be great.

00:10:37.227 --> 00:10:39.920
MICHAEL SHORT: It doesn't have
to be something that I said.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.628
As long as it's not
fissionable or salty.

00:10:41.628 --> 00:10:43.430
MICHAEL AMES: And we
might veto samples--

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.240
I do need to know what they
are roughly before we throw it

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.427
in the reactor, and we might
end up vetoing some samples.

00:10:50.427 --> 00:10:51.260
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.760
So let's figure
it out by Tuesday.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.135
That way if we have to veto,
we have a while for you guys

00:10:55.135 --> 00:10:56.290
to find another sample.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.290
MICHAEL AMES: Or-- yeah.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.708
I don't know if I'll be able
to run a sample from everybody.

00:11:00.708 --> 00:11:01.750
MICHAEL SHORT: We'll see.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.470
MICHAEL AMES: We'll see.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.130
MICHAEL SHORT: We'll
see what we can do.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.040
MICHAEL AMES: Anyway, I'll
see you all next week.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.687
MICHAEL SHORT: Thanks, Mike.

00:11:05.687 --> 00:11:07.270
So yeah, so Mike's
going to be helping

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.150
us do some nuclear activation
analysis, and in addition,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.650
next week we're
going to be counting

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.230
our big bag of burnt bananas,
because now that you're

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.480
learning about radioactivity,
and this-- when

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.340
we go over activity
and series decay,

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.900
you'll have enough
of the science

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.670
to understand to
calculate how to what

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.350
is the radioactivity
of one banana.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.630
And to do so, we
need like 500 bananas

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.670
to get enough statistics.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.420
So we'll be going to
the reactor for that.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.360
We've also set it up so
that next week and the week

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.490
afterwards you guys are going
to be manipulating the power

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.550
levels of the reactor.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.730
So you'll actually get to
sit in the control seat,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.590
raise and lower
the control rods,

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.390
and watch the power
of the reactor change

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.490
in ways you probably
won't expect unless you're

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.240
getting operator training.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.750
And all of that stuff is
going to be used in the lab

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.640
components of the problem sets.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.140
So you guys might
have noticed there

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.960
was some spinthariscope
scope thing on problem set 3.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.430
Radiation protection
did not want

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.370
me taking smoke detectors apart
and giving them all to you

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.070
because that's distributing
open radiation sources

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.025
and I probably
shouldn't do that,

00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:03.400
but we've got
plenty of lab stuff

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.770
for you to do to
see what is actually

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.570
hands-on in this field.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.760
And if you do want to know
what else is hands-on,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.677
I have an experimental
group and you're always

00:12:11.677 --> 00:12:13.870
welcome to come see
what we do at the lab.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.690
There usually isn't an
explosion happening,

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.660
but there's usually
something that 1,000 to 1500

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.750
Celsius temperature,
blue uranium fluoride

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.550
salts, nanonewton forces,
extreme pressures, or what

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.700
have you, we do a lot of it.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.520
So I wanted to give a quick
review of where we were

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.460
in radioactive decay last time.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.100
I think we left off somewhere
around "Particle Physics

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.620
Telescope Explodes" was my
favorite BBC headline ever

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.370
when we were talking
about-- we've already

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:50.260
gone over alpha decay,
we've gone over beta decay,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.960
we started talking
about positron decay

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.100
and the neutrinos
that come out of that,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.840
and this Kamiokande
detector that

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.480
is set up with lots of
expensive phototubes

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.130
to detect the
cones of light left

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.240
as neutrinos pass faster than
the speed of light in water

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.320
through water.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.340
And then there is my
favorite headline.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:17.030
I believe we made it up to the
end of positron annihilation

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.430
spectroscopy or ways
that you can actually

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.160
use positron emission
to look at the number

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.230
and types of atomic defects
in crystalline materials.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.770
And yep, that's where we
left off, interested in PAS?

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.730
Lots of papers to check out.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.760
In the meantime,
let's look at one

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.090
of the competing mechanisms
for positron emission, which

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.880
is electron capture.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.980
In this case-- so
I will warn you,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.840
it's sometimes a little
easy to get mixed up

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.570
between electron capture,
internal conversion,

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.480
isometric transition, so I've
left these slides on here,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.030
and I also took pictures
of the board from last time

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.577
and posted them on
the Stellar site.

00:13:53.577 --> 00:13:55.660
So all the blackboards
where we filled the boards,

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.020
there's pictures of those.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.100
And I'm going to
keep doing that.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.767
So if you've learned better just
by looking and listening rather

00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:02.680
than writing
everything, feel free.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.660
If you want to write stuff
down, also feel free.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.480
So an electron capture,
another way of,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.140
well, destroying positive
charge would be for the nucleus

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.520
to capture an electron.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.620
So either it can
emit a positron,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.600
giving away some
positive charge,

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.243
or it can capture an
electron, destroying

00:14:20.243 --> 00:14:21.410
one of the positive charges.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.160
And in each case here, we've got
a proton that becomes a neutron

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.090
and something.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.210
I'm won't be specific as to
which one because positron

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.600
and electron capture, well,
two different but similar kind

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.100
of decaying mechanisms.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.740
And then what you
get is this hole

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.910
where the electron used to be.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.670
And that's not a very
stable configuration

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.390
for an atom to have, let's say,
one fewer electron then protons

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.730
and especially to have a
hole in the inner shell.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.490
So you get this cascade from
straight-up from high school

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.330
chemistry of electrons falling
from one shell to the next

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.730
and giving off
characteristic X-rays--

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.650
that's me that cross
that out there--

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.240
because you will
find misinformation

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.430
all over the place
online, and someone

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.980
might make a great
figure and mislabel

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.040
an electron-emitted photon
as a gamma ray, and remember,

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.320
we said gammas come
from the nucleus,

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.098
otherwise they're
indistinguishable photons.

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:13.640
And so in electron
capture, you don't

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.347
need much of an
energy difference

00:15:16.347 --> 00:15:17.930
between the parents
and the daughters,

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:23.090
unlike positron decay where
for positron decay to happen,

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.550
you have to have
Q at least equal

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:31.660
to 1.022 MeV, which is the
same as 2 times the rest

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.220
mass of the electron.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.850
For electron capture, you don't.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.220
This can happen at
just about any energy.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.350
As long as you can overcome
just the binding energy

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.450
of the electron,
which is negligible

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.090
compared to these sort
of nuclear energy levels.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.110
And so this is the Q equation.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.820
Keep in mind, these deltas
here are excess masses.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.310
So I'll put this up
again, the excess mass

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.270
is the real mass minus
the terrible approximation

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.220
of a nucleide's mass.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.610
And this way, excess mass and
real mass are directly related,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.340
so you could plug
in masses here,

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.900
you could plug in
binding energies

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.040
by making everything with
a minus sign, and so on.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.950
I think I've repeated myself
enough for the Q equation

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.860
stuff, would you guys agree?

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.590
Yeah, OK.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.980
And so these are actually
two competing mechanisms.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.710
So shown here is the
decay of sodium-22

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.340
which we don't want to happen in
our nuclear activation analysis

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.320
because it gets pretty toasty.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.300
It can either proceed--

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.430
there's a kind of hidden
part of the diagram

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.710
that I drew in to make
a little more sense.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.150
You start off with the nucleus
at 2.8 MeV above the neon

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.980
nucleus' energy level.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:48.020
You need 1.022 MeV to create
the positron-electron pair,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.340
at which point you can emit the
positron with a certain energy.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.630
You're left in an excited
state, and the next thing

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:58.130
we'll go over is gamma decay
or Isometric Transitions or IT.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.380
That's the next method of
decay we'll talk about.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.560
Or the nucleus can just
capture an electron,

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.900
getting to that
same energy level

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.579
and emitting the same gamma ray.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:12.210
So these are two competing
mechanisms of decay.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.839
And then you might
ask, well, when

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.750
is one going to happen
and not the other?

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.520
Well chances are,
the lower energy

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.240
that transition is, the
more likely electron

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.510
capture is going to happen.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.990
So when you look at
these energy diagrams,

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.690
you can see that as the
transitions get bigger,

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.300
the probability of positron
decay goes up and up and up.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.250
So you need 1.022 MeV to make
the positron an electron,

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.030
but the probability of positron
decay very close to this

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.310
is fairly low.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.620
Possible, but unlikely.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.620
Is everyone clear on these
two competing mechanisms?

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.720
So one way of reducing
the number of protons

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.578
is emit a positron, another
is gobble up an electron.

00:17:55.578 --> 00:17:57.620
In the end, they make the
same daughter products,

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.690
but they go by
different mechanisms.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.490
And they give off
different bits of radiation

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.075
which we can actually
sense and measure.

00:18:06.075 --> 00:18:07.970
Cool.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.690
So on to gamma decay or
isometric transition.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.850
These range from
the dead simple,

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:16.120
like technetium-99
metastable giving off

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.630
a characteristic 140 keV
gamma ray for technetium,

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.130
that's the medical
imaging procedure

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.345
we've talked a lot about.

00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:26.710
To the ridiculously
complex, like americium-241,

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.980
which has a lot, a lot, a lot
of different nuclear energy

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.030
states, all of which
release anywhere between 1

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.500
and a lot of gamma rays.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.920
And this is what's referred
to as isometric transition.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.700
So we'll say gamma or
isometric transition

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.810
is like the same thing, they're
just different words for it.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:47.950
These are called isomers.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.300
They've got the same number
of protons and neutrons,

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.770
so it's the same nuclide,
but at an excited state.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.660
And we call it gamma
decay because we

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.170
emit gamma rays or photons.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.810
I think this one is the
easiest one to understand,

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.990
because the reaction
goes something like--

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.490
let's say we have
a parent nucleus

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.310
with Z protons and A neutrons.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.950
Nothing happens.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.640
It's about the easiest
nuclear reaction there is.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.820
Except you do give
off a gamma ray.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.280
And we'll usually put
a star or something

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.680
to denote an excited state.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.640
So when you see a star
in the reading over there

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.920
on a nuclide where
the charge would be,

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.990
that's an excited energy
state that will likely

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:41.220
decay by IT or gamma decay.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.490
There is also a
competing mechanism

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.640
for isometric transition
or gamma decay,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.700
and that's what's called
internal conversion.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.293
In this case you
can kind of think

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:54.460
of it-- this isn't the
correct physical explanation,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.150
but it's a perfectly
good mental model,

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.980
that the gamma ray
would either just

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.130
be emitted from the nucleus, at
which point you would see it,

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.680
and the energy of the gamma
is the same as that Q,

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.010
or it kind of hits an
electron on its way out,

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.990
ejecting that electron.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.180
So instead of
finding a gamma ray,

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.900
you may just get an electron
emitted at an energy very, very

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.880
close to that gamma ray.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.850
The difference between the gamma
ray energy and the electron

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.970
energy is its binding energy.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.530
Because if a gamma hits an
electron on the way out,

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.010
it has to overcome the binding
energy of that electron,

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.600
at which point the
rest of the energy

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.460
is just its kinetic energy.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.970
So again, I don't think that's
the precise physical mechanism,

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.880
but it's a perfectly good mental
model to remember what this is.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.370
A gamma can either
just get out on its own

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.650
or it can hit an
electron on its way out.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.690
If you hit the electron
on your way out,

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.030
just like in electron
capture, then

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:56.020
you get a larger shell electron
falling down to the inner shell

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.530
emitting an X-ray
just like before.

00:21:00.033 --> 00:21:01.450
And then there's
one other process

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.860
I want you guys to be aware of.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.380
Has anyone here ever heard
of Auger electron emission?

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.680
Er, yeah.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.710
So in this case, instead
of sending out an X-ray,

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.400
you can think of it like
the X-ray kind of hits

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.010
the-- another electron
on its way out.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.810
That's not the actual
process that happens,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.640
but let's just think
of it like that.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.800
And then that electron
is ejected usually

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.580
from a much outer shell.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.770
And we can actually use
these Auger electrons

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.770
because they have specific
but very low binding

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.140
energies to do
imaging and elemental

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.410
analysis of materials.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.243
So this is another one
of those things where

00:21:38.243 --> 00:21:41.290
the stuff you're learning today
is used in an Auger electron

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.650
microscope up and Building
13 to do combined imaging

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.970
and elemental
analysis of materials.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.570
I want to skip back a
sec, because let's say

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.540
we have this decay diagram
right here, a pretty simple one.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.480
Cesium-137, that
isotope that everyone

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.050
was worried about from the
release from Fukushima.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.010
Can either proceed
by just beta decay,

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.460
or beta decay followed by
an isometric transition.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.310
And shown here is a spectrum
of all the different electron

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.200
energies that you'll get out.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.960
If you remember from last
time when we talked about,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.270
let's see, the energy of a beta
particle emitted versus let's

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.150
say the number of those
particles emitted,

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.080
if this is the Q value
for that reaction,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.110
you don't always get
a beta particle out

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.870
at the Q value-- in
fact, you never do.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:40.270
It looks something
like this, where

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.290
they'll be some,
let's say, average

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:49.510
or some most likely beta energy,
which is about one-third Q.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.000
Depends on the reaction, but
that's a good rule of thumb.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.910
So if you've got a
1.174 MeV beta particle,

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.970
you're going to see a spectrum
of electron energies ranging

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.450
from 0 to 1.174.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.700
And you've got this
other beta transition

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.950
possible at about
half an MeV, so you're

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.927
going to see that same
spectrum right there.

00:23:11.927 --> 00:23:14.260
And then there's these two,
what's called the conversion

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.460
electrons.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.117
That's evidence of the competing
process with gamma decay.

00:23:19.117 --> 00:23:21.700
Which is to say that this gamma
decay can either just get out,

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.460
at which point you see a
gamma ray of that energy,

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.310
or that gamma hits an
electron on its way

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.402
out, knocking those
electrons out.

00:23:30.402 --> 00:23:33.180
Does anyone know here what it
means by K-shell or L-shell?

00:23:36.462 --> 00:23:37.670
If you do, just shout it out.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.120
So that there depends on the--

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.220
oh, that's correct.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.390
It's the energy level.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.450
So let's say we'll draw kind
of a bore model of a nucleus,

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:55.710
we'll call it N. And let's
give it three electron energy

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.750
levels.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.750
And let's say there's a couple
electrons in the first shell

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.690
and some electrons
in the outer shells.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:11.020
And let's say this electron
was struck on its way

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.330
out by a gamma ray.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.770
So it's gone.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.320
At this point, you might
have an electron fall

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.480
from let's call this
level 2 to level 1.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:28.980
And so this 2-to-1 transition
is called the K-transition.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.530
Don't ask me why the letters
are the way they are.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.690
I probably have read it
and have forgotten it

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.310
because it wasn't
that intuitive,

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.922
but this is referred
to as a K-transition.

00:24:37.922 --> 00:24:39.630
So you may have what's
called the K-alpha

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.310
or a K-beta line,
that depends on

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.830
if you have an even
higher energy shell,

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.670
but whatever this letter is, it
tells you what an energy level

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.070
the electron is going to.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.880
So the K lines would be here.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.530
The L-line-- yeah, I'm sorry.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.990
Let me back up and
say that again.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:01.340
So the idea here is
that if this the--

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.760
but let's see.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.510
Which one is this?

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.130
0.662.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.040
So if the gamma ray
is at 0.662 MeV, which

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.970
would be about there, notice
that these K-shell and L-shell

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.378
lines aren't quite 0.662.

00:25:15.378 --> 00:25:17.670
That's because they have to
overcome the binding energy

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.530
of the electron to get out.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.700
So to jump back to this
diagram right here,

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.550
the gamma ray loses a
little bit of energy

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.890
in freeing the electron,
the rest of which

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.050
can become kinetic
energy, which is

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.940
why you can see that
the electron, let's say,

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.570
was ejected from
the K-shell here.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.645
And-- yeah?

00:25:36.645 --> 00:25:38.895
AUDIENCE: So internal
conversion is the actual process

00:25:38.895 --> 00:25:40.978
of-- when we figure out
the process of a gamma ray

00:25:40.978 --> 00:25:42.815
hitting the electron?

00:25:42.815 --> 00:25:44.940
MICHAEL SHORT: I will say
that internal conversion,

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.100
you can imagine a mental
model of the gamma ray

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.530
hits an electron on its way out.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.570
AUDIENCE: But it's not
the actual-- that's

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.850
not physically happening?

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.330
MICHAEL SHORT: Physically
it's more complicated.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:52.930
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:53.290
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:54.570
AUDIENCE: Looks
like a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.036
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:55.536
Yep.

00:25:55.536 --> 00:25:57.320
So if you want remember
like what's what,

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.510
I would say, just remember
this diagram right here.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.140
Yeah, Kristen?

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.932
AUDIENCE: You get a gamma
ray and an electron or just

00:26:02.932 --> 00:26:03.380
the one--

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Just
the-- you get just

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.080
the electron, good question.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.390
Is the gamma ray is
effectively absorbed

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.180
in freeing the electron
from its bound shell

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.300
and then imparting
kinetic energy.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:13.900
Yep?

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.420
AUDIENCE: Is the
Auger emission is

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.975
when another electron
hops down an energy level

00:26:18.975 --> 00:26:20.263
and that [INAUDIBLE] electron?

00:26:20.263 --> 00:26:21.430
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.800
So that's correct.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.540
So I'll spend the
next couple of slides

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.300
going over what Auger
electron emission is,

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.120
but not till we finish the
easier stuff, because Auger

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.530
is a little complicated.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:36.040
Did I see another
question out here?

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:36.540
Cool.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.510
So again, all the competing
methods for gamma decay,

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.510
one, the gamma can just
get out; two, the gamma

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.240
can knock out an
electron from, let's say,

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.410
the K-shell or the L-shell or
the M-shell and so on and so on

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.878
depending on what
elements you have.

00:26:51.878 --> 00:26:52.920
So I'll just label these.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.016
Like this would be
like the K-shell,

00:26:55.016 --> 00:26:57.810
this would be the L-shell,
this would be the M-shell.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.390
Now I want you to
notice something, too.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.820
The K-shell electron ejected
from the innermost electron

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.560
is slightly lower than
the L-shell electron.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.850
Why do you guys think that is?

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.010
Let's look at the energetics
for this process, right?

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.920
The electron energy level is
whatever the gamma ray level

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.560
is minus the binding energy.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.140
Which of these two electrons,
the K-shell or the L-shell,

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.090
do you think is going to
be more tightly-bound?

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:34.720
The K-shell.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.370
The innermost electron
is more bound,

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.730
so it takes away more
energy from that gamma ray.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.380
Let's say this is the gamma.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.800
It takes more energy to eject
an electron from the K-shell

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.230
than the L-shell.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.190
Or in other words, the
gamma loses less energy

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.103
ejecting a less-bound electron.

00:27:51.103 --> 00:27:52.270
So that's why you see these.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.730
If there were an
M-shell, there--

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.370
I don't know what element
this was drawn for,

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.110
but let's say-- oh, for cesium.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.060
So there probably is an M-shell.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.700
It's just that as you get
down in energy levels,

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.770
the probability of
finding an electron

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.750
from these outer and
outer energy levels

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:10.090
gets way and way less likely.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.882
So you'll usually just see
a K or an L-shell electron.

00:28:12.882 --> 00:28:15.090
And if I asked you to draw
one of these on a problems

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.680
set or an exam, just drawing
the K and the L-shells

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.487
is perfectly sufficient.

00:28:19.487 --> 00:28:21.570
Because that way at least
you'll know that there's

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.640
a couple of possibilities.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.140
Yeah?

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.310
AUDIENCE: What are the two
curves on the right graph

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.810
there?

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:26.330
MICHAEL SHORT: On this one?

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:26.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.397
MICHAEL SHORT: So
these two curves

00:28:28.397 --> 00:28:31.360
represent the probability of
finding an electron emitted

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.660
at that energy.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.870
So this curve right
here where you

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:40.780
get a maximum beta energy of 512
keV comes from that beta decay.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:46.660
And the maximum for the 1.174
comes from this beta decay.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.030
So the total curve
would be the sum

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.610
of each of these four things.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:53.560
If I just said draw
the total probability

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.810
of detecting an electron
at that temperature,

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.660
you just add those up.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.910
I saw two other questions
or were they the same thing?

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:00.690
Yeah?

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.428
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was going to ask

00:29:01.428 --> 00:29:02.604
what the [? lower ?]
[INAUDIBLE],,

00:29:02.604 --> 00:29:03.930
but his question made me think.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.680
So is it kind of like the
area under both those curves

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.054
sums to 1?

00:29:08.054 --> 00:29:13.280
Because the probability given
that like 0.512 max is 95% of--

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.280
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.510
So the question was is the area
under each of these curves 1?

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.028
Not with this scale.

00:29:20.028 --> 00:29:22.320
Here we're just showing a
relative number of electrons.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.440
So if you want to find
what's the total probability

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.950
that cesium will emit an
electron of each energy,

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.680
if you integrate under
all of these curves,

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.510
that will sum to 1.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.580
If you're looking at
just one of these decays

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.880
and you're saying, if
cesium undergoes this decay,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.640
what's the probability of
each of these energy levels?

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.820
Then you only integrate
under the relevant curve.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.040
What's more practical
is usually what's

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.960
the probability of
finding any electron

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.730
at any energy from cesium?

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.730
Then you take into account
all the possible decays,

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.640
draw all the curves
independently, add them up,

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.080
and you get the
total probability

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.960
function whose area will be 1?

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.460
Yes?

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.362
AUDIENCE: So maybe you could
say that all L-shell electrons

00:30:05.362 --> 00:30:08.110
would be ejected if [INAUDIBLE]
in the K-shell due to the fact

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.620
that it's less tightly-bound?

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.200
MICHAEL SHORT: Wait, can
you say the last part again?

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.710
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't we say
the L-shell electron will

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.335
be ejected if [INAUDIBLE] energy
in the K-shell due to the fact

00:30:15.335 --> 00:30:16.680
that it's not as tightly-bound?

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.930
MICHAEL SHORT: That's correct.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.030
So the L-shell electron
in the second shell

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.030
is less tightly-bound than
the first one, which is why

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.830
it's ejected with more energy.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:29.290
It doesn't take as much of the
gamma's energy to get it out.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:33.110
If you were to get, let's say,
the outermost electron ejected,

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:36.610
which happens and Auger,
which we'll go over next,

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.057
it can take up anywhere
from 1 to 7 eV.

00:30:40.057 --> 00:30:41.140
Really, really low energy.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.680
That's what we call the work
function or the energy required

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.190
to make the outermost
electron out.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.040
So any other questions on this
before I go Auger and show you

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.640
that process?

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.640
Cool.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.860
So then let's get into what
is Auger electron emission?

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.650
It's exactly-- Luke,
is that what you said?

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:02.825
Were you asking about it?

00:31:02.825 --> 00:31:03.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.060
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah So it's
exactly like what Luke said.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.110
Normally if you have a hole
in a lower-level energy shell,

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.350
an electron from a higher shell
will fall down to fill it,

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.730
emitting an X-ray.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.900
A competing process for
this is another electron

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.460
from a very similar energy
shell will get ejected instead.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.393
The mental model for
this, which again, is not

00:31:25.393 --> 00:31:27.810
the true physical picture but
it's perfectly fine to think

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.050
of it like this, the X-ray hits
another electron on its way

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.130
out.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.750
And you can look at the
energetics accordingly.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:39.540
Where for Auger emission,
let's say the kinetic energy

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.550
the Auger electron
is the difference

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:45.480
in the final and initial
electron energy states

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.670
minus the binding energy
of the Auger electron,

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.210
which will usually be very
low, because the Auger

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.310
electron that's
emitted is usually one

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.900
of the outer shell electrons.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.990
So to help make this a
little more concrete,

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.740
I wanted to show--

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.470
I will do a little calculation
example-- it's just addition,

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.760
so it's not that hard.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.200
So let's say we were measuring--

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.910
I don't even know what this is.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:10.270
And we started to see some
characteristic Auger electrons

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.310
for copper, platinum,
carbon, and oxygen.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.510
And the question is, why
do we see oxygen coming out

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.087
right there at about 501 eV?

00:32:20.087 --> 00:32:21.670
Very, very low energy
compared to what

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.720
we've been talking about.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.390
We can actually look at the
binding energies of some

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.690
of the different electrons
in oxygen. Luckily

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.567
there aren't that many
electrons in oxygen. The first--

00:32:33.567 --> 00:32:35.150
the only-- well, the
only K electrons,

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.180
let's say, have a
binding energy of 532 eV,

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.820
the L1 is 24, and then
the L3's something else,

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.300
and one of the other
p orbitals is 7 eV.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.550
And so the formula
is pretty simple.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.510
It's just 532 minus 24--

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.660
that's the difference between
the final and initial energy

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.650
levels--

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.340
minus the seven to free
that outer electron--

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.940
comes to 501 eV, which
is exactly where you

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.620
see the Auger line for oxygen.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.220
So when I ask you what are all
the possible things that you

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.610
could see during the decay
of something, something,

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:15.100
something, if I were
to show you this curve

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.120
and ask what's missing,
what would you do?

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.510
Where would you draw the
Auger electrons on this curve?

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:28.510
Yep?

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.468
AUDIENCE: Like almost
on the vertical axis

00:33:31.468 --> 00:33:32.510
because it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.302
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:33:33.302 --> 00:33:36.250
500 eV would be like, I
don't know, one pixel away

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.455
on this graph.

00:33:37.455 --> 00:33:39.580
But if you want a complete
answer to this question,

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.390
you've got to take into account
all the possible beta energies

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.240
for all the possible
beta decay mechanisms;

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.470
all of the possible conversion
electrons for whatever gamma

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.050
come out-- in this case,
there's only one gamma;

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:59.600
and Auger electrons which could
compete with X-ray emission.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.187
So everyone clear on that?

00:34:02.187 --> 00:34:02.687
Yeah?

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.960
So the question is if
you eject an electron

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.420
from one of the inner
shells, does that eventually

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.489
create an Auger electron, right?

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:24.449
It can.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.889
These are competing processes.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:31.170
So to the X-ray can just
escape during that transition,

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.659
or we'll assume that it hits
another electron on its way

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:35.760
out and emits an Auger electron.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.340
So these are also
competing processes.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.560
So you'll see one or
the other-- in reality,

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.462
you'll see a lot of both
with different probabilities.

00:34:43.462 --> 00:34:45.420
Because you're usually
not looking at one atom,

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.760
it's usually looking at a lot.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.260
Cool.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:54.570
Any other questions on IT
as an isomeric transition

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.760
or internal conversion or
Auger, what this is all about?

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.980
Cool.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.960
Wanted to give
you one note, too.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.950
That these Auger
electrons are really,

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:09.790
really low energy, which means
the only ones that get out

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:13.720
of the material are in
the top, like, tens or so

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.520
nanometers of the material.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.070
So it's a very
surface-sensitive technique.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.020
So if you want to do a
really detailed surface

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:24.040
analysis or profiling, you
can scan an electron beam

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.220
across the sample and then
collect the Auger electrons

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.660
that come out--

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.310
skipping ahead to
our calculation--

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.400
and get an elemental
profile that'll

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.002
tell you how much
of each element

00:35:35.002 --> 00:35:37.210
is where depending on how
many of its Auger electrons

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:38.560
you can count.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.580
And it's pretty-- it's
a pretty cool technique.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.300
There are just machines
that do this now.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.797
Any interest in seeing
one of these at the Center

00:35:45.797 --> 00:35:47.380
for Materials Science
and Engineering,

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.530
because we could try
to arrange that, too?

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:51.990
Cool, OK.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.110
I'll see what I can do.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.640
That'll be fun.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.180
And the last decay that
we haven't talked about

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.700
and did not show up in
our generalized decay

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.963
diagram from last time.

00:36:03.963 --> 00:36:05.630
We did talk about
neutron decay, there's

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:09.080
one other one that probably
wouldn't fit on this diagram.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.220
Does anyone know what it is?

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.140
Spontaneous fission.

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:15.700
So this can happen--
that's right.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.610
This happens with
very heavy elements.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.620
Then usually the heavier
it is, the less stable

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.060
it is, the higher
probability this

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.510
is at which the nucleus can once
in a while, it-- nuclei just

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.430
explode sometimes.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:30.550
Giving off two fission products,
any number of neutrons--

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.040
usually between
1 and 3, a couple

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.900
of gamma rays, some
anti-neutrinos,

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.645
and a whole bunch
of other crazies.

00:36:36.645 --> 00:36:38.770
And so that, of course,
doesn't fit on the diagram,

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.140
but it is another type
of decay that I'll

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.195
ask you guys to analyze
on the homework.

00:36:43.195 --> 00:36:45.320
And here's a hint-- you
already analyzed part of it

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.660
in problems set 1.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.242
I'll ask you to go a little
deeper in problem set 3.

00:36:50.242 --> 00:36:54.180
So anyone have a
question for myself?

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.680
Cool.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.930
OK.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.580
Bear with me because
I skipped back

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.860
to like slide really far away.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.410
Oh cool.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.680
That thing actually works.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.590
Right to the summary.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.780
So in summary, the radioactive
decay processes are more--

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.730
I think the energetics
are pretty easy.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.400
The formulas aren't that hard
to remember because most of them

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.973
are just parents minus
daughters minus something.

00:37:16.973 --> 00:37:18.390
But what I do want
you to remember

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.930
is which mechanisms compete
with which other ones and why.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:26.040
And if I were to tell you,
draw me a spectrum of photons

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.550
that you may see from
the decay of caesium-137,

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.790
or draw me a spectrum
of electrons,

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.960
you'd be able to
draw what that is

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.540
so that when you
go do lab number 4

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.950
and we count our big
bag of burnt bananas

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.950
and you know that there's
potassium-40 in there,

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.380
you know what peaks
to start looking for.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.990
Because you're not
just going to see--

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.410
let's do a little
flash-forward to detectors now.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.660
And some other stuff that
nuclear engineers actually

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.860
do on a daily basis.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.970
Let's say you're counting
the energy of photons

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.370
as a function of, let's
say, the number of photons

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:02.750
that you count.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.910
You're never-- you're
almost never just

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:11.473
going to see a lone
potassium-40 peak like that.

00:38:11.473 --> 00:38:13.140
It's very, very rare
that you would just

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.582
capture the gamma ray as is.

00:38:14.582 --> 00:38:16.290
There's going to be
a lot of other things

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.738
that will go into it, which
I'm not going to give away yet

00:38:18.738 --> 00:38:20.280
because we're going
to go over photon

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.640
interactions in
like a week or two,

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.390
but you do have to
think about, well, what

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.160
other X-rays might you see?

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.310
What if the gamma-- what if
this gamma ray hits an electron

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.780
on the way out, and then
you end up with some X-rays?

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.120
Let's say you might
have some K-level X-rays

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.820
and some L-level X-rays
and maybe some Ms?

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.255
These could all be
possible as well.

00:38:42.255 --> 00:38:43.630
I'll just label
those real quick.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.390
Does anyone know how
to find these energies?

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.962
What those X-ray levels are?

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.520
Anyone ever heard
of the Lyman series?

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:03.240
The emission lines from ionized
hydrogen or anything like that?

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.790
That's kind of the
simpler case of it.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:09.920
The idea here is if
you want to figure out

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.958
what's the wavelength of light
that's going to be emitted,

00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:16.250
it'll be that's this thing
called the Rydberg constant,

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:21.020
a more complex formula for which
I have in the notes, times 1

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.800
over your final
shell squared minus 1

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.980
over your initial shell squared.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.680
So the idea here is that
you can look up these--

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.630
this Rydberg constant
for any element

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:35.800
that you have, and
there's actually--

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.370
there's what's called
an R infinity constant

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.340
and I think you
just multiply by Z--

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.690
I forget what power it is, but
I will get it for you next time.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:45.440
And then it's just a
matter of the squares

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.110
between the final and
the initial shell levels

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:55.730
where n can vary from 1
to theoretically infinity.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:59.300
Realistically I've never heard
of anything beyond a g orbital,

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.832
so let's just say it's that.

00:40:00.832 --> 00:40:01.790
Or something like that.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.640
I'll leave the infinity there.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.380
That's technically correct.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.450
OK.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.380
And so all you need to
do is either look up

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.990
or calculate this
constant for your element,

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.180
and then plug-in the
numbers of the shells,

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.150
and you know what sort of photon
energy you're going to get out.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.850
And to make that easier
for you, I think now

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.450
is a good time to introduce
the NIST X-ray tables.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:27.502
So I want to make sure
you can see my screen.

00:40:27.502 --> 00:40:28.960
And I'm going to
show you something

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.970
that's on the Stellar
site which will

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.890
help you figure this stuff out.

00:40:36.466 --> 00:40:38.960
20.2.0.0.1.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.040
Good, you can see.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.065
Probably will make log in.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.150
And all the way at the bottom
of the material section,

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:59.580
there's the NIST X-ray
Transition Energy Database.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.250
So for example,
you can look at--

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.560
I don't know, we were
looking at caesium, right?

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.400
Let's find caesium.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.400
And you can start to
look at all transitions--

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.090
let's look at the simplest one.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.130
KL1.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:17.400
An electron going from shell
number 2 to shell number 1.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:23.900
Get transitions, and you end up
with a table of these energies

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.550
in electron volts.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.460
So if I were to
ask you, let's say,

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.000
what sort of gamma rays might
you see coming off of caesium,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.090
that would be the most likely
one where you're more likely

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.760
to eject an
inner-shell electron,

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.690
and it's most likely that a
number 2 shell electron will

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:45.110
fall down to a number 1 or from
the L-shell to the K-shell,

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.750
whatever you want
to call it, or the--

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.520
some level orbital
to some other--

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.960
there seems to me like
eight different letters

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.265
that describe the same thing.

00:41:52.265 --> 00:41:54.630
I hope you guys get the idea.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.840
If you want to look at all
the possible transitions,

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.905
I have to zoom back out again.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.900
Yeah.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.610
Let's just scroll through it.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:11.410
But what I want you to notice is
that all of the KL transitions

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:14.210
are within like a couple
hundred eV from each other.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:17.500
So this is like the first
or second or third L-shell

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.200
electron falling to the K-level.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.560
So they call it
the KL1, KL2, KL3.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.682
They're all from L-shell.

00:42:24.682 --> 00:42:26.890
They all just might be one
of the different electrons

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:30.080
occupying that shell, which is
why they're not that different.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.720
So if I asked you, draw
all of all of the X-rays

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.310
and gammas coming
out, I don't want

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.620
to see a line for
every single level.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.890
I'm very happy for you just
to say, this line represents

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.230
the KL series, this
line represents

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:48.420
the KM series, all the things
from shell 3 to shell 1.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.970
Notice also that
because it's final

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:55.310
minus initial squared,
which I covered up,

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.340
falling from an even
further outer shell

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.980
to the same inner shell should
give you a higher energy,

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.430
which it does, by like 5 keV.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:09.860
And then the KN levels,
another 500 eV up.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.610
They don't have KO's.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:12.110
Interesting.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.803
But they have the K-edge.

00:43:13.803 --> 00:43:15.095
Anyone know what the K-edge is?

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:19.980
Exactly.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.520
It's level infinity, which
would mean an electron

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.290
from somewhere else, right?

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.870
So this in effect
is like the energy

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.780
it takes to ionize a
K-electron or the X-ray

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.150
that you would get from
an electron falling

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.040
all the way into the K-shell.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.230
So this is your kind
of level infinity.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.450
Notice, it's not that
different from level 5.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:44.710
That's why I wrote 6, I erased
it for theoretical correctness,

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.660
but in all practicality,
you won't see much else.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.200
Does anyone have a question?

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.310
Thought I saw a hand.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:52.810
OK.

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:54.550
Let's look at the
L-series-- oh yes?

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.019
AUDIENCE: Sometimes you
see L-alpha, L-beta.

00:43:57.019 --> 00:43:57.811
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:43:57.811 --> 00:44:01.033
AUDIENCE: Is that the same as
the subscript 1, 2, 3, and 4?

00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:02.575
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
that's another--

00:44:02.575 --> 00:44:04.660
AUDIENCE: --corresponding--
it's just a notation.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.750
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.630
Yeah, there's the
L-alphas, the L-betas,

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.290
or you may see L-alpha 1
and 2 in L-beta 1 and 2.

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:14.530
So L designates that it's
going to shell level 2.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:18.250
Alpha or beta is like LM or LN.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:22.300
Again, I think I've ranted
about notations before.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.363
Physics is notorious,
because whoever--

00:44:24.363 --> 00:44:25.780
to describe
something, and it gets

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.990
enough people to infect
with the notation

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.060
that you decide it sticks.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.270
But the main patterns
to look at, then,

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:36.040
let's say the L1 M whatever.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.380
This is from level 3 to
level 2, and notice how

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.650
much lower an energy these are.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.490
And the L-edge.

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:46.513
5 keV compared to like 36 keV.

00:44:46.513 --> 00:44:48.430
And all of these sort
of different transitions

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:49.930
you can calculate
with this formula.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:52.932
And this has just kind of
tabulated this formula for you.

00:44:52.932 --> 00:44:54.640
So whatever you're
more comfortable doing

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.560
is putting this in Excel, look
it up on NIST, your choice.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.060
Yeah?

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.643
AUDIENCE: If we were to
calculate that by hand--

00:45:01.643 --> 00:45:02.560
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.560
AUDIENCE: --what would
you use for like NF?

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.443
Say, like, 5?

00:45:08.443 --> 00:45:10.610
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, what is
the largest NF, you mean?

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:11.235
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:11.235 --> 00:45:14.400
What numbers actually
go in NF [INAUDIBLE]??

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:19.190
MICHAEL SHORT: For that I'll put
my practical thing back there.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:20.840
You'll never see it
much higher than 6

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.460
unless you're talking
about actinides

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.570
and super heavy elements with
even crazier shell levels.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:29.840
But you'll put the
integer shell number,

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.240
regardless of whether they
call it L or S or whatever.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.200
Just put the number
here, and that

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.690
will give you the-- a
pretty good approximation

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:42.178
of the energy transition.

00:45:42.178 --> 00:45:43.970
Does anyone remember
this from high school?

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.442
I hope they're
teaching this now.

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:47.130
AUDIENCE: We learned
this in [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:49.260
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh,
they did in 5-111?

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.260
Oh, that's good to hear.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.520
What about 3-091?

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.800
Anyone take that?

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.550
No one took 3-091?

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:57.660
Wow, OK.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.900
Usually it's like
half and half or so.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:00.770
Cool.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.190
And let's see, how
far does it go?

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.000
All the way to the L3
N's in the L3 edge.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.290
So that's the biggest
element they have talking

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:12.690
about ridiculous transitions.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:16.990
Yeah.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:20.860
So notice also,
as you go up in--

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.987
that's number 100.

00:46:22.987 --> 00:46:24.570
So this is the
heaviest one they have,

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:27.600
so most likely to have the
largest number of levels.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.710
So here, the KL1
is like 114 keV,

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.480
sometimes
indistinguishable from some

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.930
of these smaller nuclear
energy level transitions.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.720
So remember I said before,
chemistry and nuclear differ

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.520
by about a factor of a million.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.430
Well, not so if you're
talking about weak gammas

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:47.990
versus heavy elements K-shell
transitions or their K-edges.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.060
Let's see, the largest
X-ray you'd expect

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:55.110
would be the K-edge at 142 keV.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:47:00.060
And the technetium-99 gamma
ray comes out of 140 keV.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.160
How do you know if it's
a gamma or an X-ray?

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.778
You don't.

00:47:03.778 --> 00:47:06.320
Unless you have really, really
good energy resolution and you

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.460
can tell them apart.

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:07.960
Yeah?

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.460
AUDIENCE: This
formula in this chart

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.922
is only for caluclating
energy of X-rays, right?

00:47:11.922 --> 00:47:12.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Correct.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:13.380
This--

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.873
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
for gammas.

00:47:15.873 --> 00:47:17.290
MICHAEL SHORT:
Things get quantum.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.870
So the question was, this
formula and this chart,

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:22.930
yes, this is only for
X-rays and electron shells.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:25.750
There are probably
equivalent calculations

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:27.700
for nuclear energy levels.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.930
I will say that's a 22.02
and far beyond topic.

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:34.420
For the nuclear
energy levels, just

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:38.006
use the decay diagrams
to find those.

00:47:38.006 --> 00:47:39.370
Yeah.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:43.800
The table of nuclides and
all their different diagrams.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.300
Cool.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.500
How far do we go here?

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.580
LN-- yep, there's no O's.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.910
So they never talk about
anything beyond shell level 4,

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:52.810
even for fermium.

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:54.658
So ha, I stand corrected.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.314
OK.

00:47:59.314 --> 00:48:01.340
Cool.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.840
So what I wanted
to show you quickly

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.090
is is that series of
hydrogen emission lines.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.070
So how familiar does
this look to folks?

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:10.950
Where you can have a
transition from level 3

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:14.460
to level 2, level 4 to level
2, and you can actually--

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.180
this is a kind of
neat thing to verify.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.460
I don't it as a
problem set question

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.110
because it's not
very nuclear, but you

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:22.110
can try this on your own and
verify that you can actually

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:26.250
calculate the expected
wavelength of these photons

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.290
coming off of excited hydrogen.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:30.330
Also notice here,
it goes all the way

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:33.030
out to 9 and out to
infinity, because this

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:35.070
is electronic excitation.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.080
You won't usually get
the ejection of anything

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.550
beyond an M or an N electron
even in the largest elements

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:45.080
from, let's say,
from IC-- what is it?

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.735
From internal conversion.

00:48:46.735 --> 00:48:48.110
But you can
electronically excite

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:50.930
them to whatever energy level
to the point of even ionizing

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:51.830
them.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.990
That's where the
infinity comes in.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.490
Cool.

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:57.910
So it's like two of five of.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.340
So I want to open this up to any
questions about decay before we

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.760
move upstairs to talk about
activity, half-life, and series

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:08.210
radioactive decay, which is what
nuclear activation analysis is

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:09.722
all about.

00:49:09.722 --> 00:49:10.430
So anything here?

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:14.506
Yep?

00:49:14.506 --> 00:49:16.381
AUDIENCE: Just making
sure I understand this.

00:49:16.381 --> 00:49:18.841
So the H-alpha lines transition
from N equals to 3 to N

00:49:18.841 --> 00:49:19.400
equals 2.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:19.755
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

00:49:19.755 --> 00:49:21.210
AUDIENCE: Would you call that--

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:25.072
in our previous notation, would
you call that LM transition?

00:49:25.072 --> 00:49:26.030
MICHAEL SHORT: Correct.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:29.010
In our pre-- in
our other notation,

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:31.970
this would be known
as an LM electron.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:34.700
And probably L1M1
because there is only one

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.665
electron in hydrogen. Yep.

00:49:37.665 --> 00:49:39.290
So don't let the
notations trip you up.

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.957
As long as you--

00:49:39.957 --> 00:49:42.500
I'm sure someone's
got a chart of L

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.650
equals 2 equals whatever
other Greek letter

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.262
someone has designated it for.

00:49:47.262 --> 00:49:49.470
There's just different ways
of saying the same thing.

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:51.190
So as long as you
know the physics,

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:55.410
looking up the notation is
just kind of a little pain.

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:58.260
Any other questions on
radioactive decay or competing

00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:58.950
mechanisms?

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:04.760
Cool.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.560
Let's take a 10 minute break.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.890
So I'll see you guys upstairs
in Room 307 in 10 minutes.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:13.890
There's no projector there, so
we'll do it all on the board.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:14.390
All right.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.690
So I want to start off the
second half of today's class

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:19.595
by posing and
answering a question.

00:50:19.595 --> 00:50:24.330
Who's still mentally having
trouble grasping this idea?

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:25.560
What did I tell you?

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.108
Yeah.

00:50:26.108 --> 00:50:28.400
So whoever I said it to, I
said at least half the class

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.210
is right there with
you, it's true.

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:31.860
So in a sentence, it's this--

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.330
Q is the conversion
of mass to energy.

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.287
That's all.

00:50:37.287 --> 00:50:39.370
And the whole point of
doing this nuclear reaction

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.460
energetics to find out if
things are or aren't allowed,

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.140
if they're exo or
endothermic is to see

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.660
how much mass is
converted to energy

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:51.360
or how much energy has
to be converted to mass.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.860
And if you have
trouble remembering,

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.420
just go back to
the equation that I

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.230
see on everybody's T-shirts.

00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:59.135
And like I said on the
first day of class,

00:50:59.135 --> 00:51:00.510
everyone's got it
on their shirts

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:03.630
and no one quite understands it,
not even the nuclear engineers.

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:06.870
Because it's very difficult
mentally to grasp the idea

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.270
that energy and matter are
two sides of the same coin

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:11.680
or two different forms
of the same thing.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.600
So for a nuclear reaction
where Q is greater than 0

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:21.330
or exothermic, all that means
is that energy is spontaneously

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:24.620
created from the
destruction of mass.

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:25.940
That's all.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:32.870
And for a Q less than 0
reaction or endothermic,

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.570
when you inject energy into
the system, it is absorbed

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:40.970
and mass is created
straight from this equation.

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.680
So does this make more
sense to the folks

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.070
that raised their hands,
which is almost everybody?

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.013
Q is nothing but
a quantification

00:51:48.013 --> 00:51:49.430
of the amount of
matter and energy

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.610
that turn from one to the other.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:53.110
And all the balance
stuff we've been

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:56.405
doing for almost the last month
has been to serve, to quantify,

00:51:56.405 --> 00:51:58.890
and to predict it.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.860
So I hope that helps.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.070
I know that MIT students
have this gift for being

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:05.930
able to hide behind
the math, and I

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:08.660
know that's true because
I used to be one myself.

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:10.070
And you could get
through the day

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:13.970
or get through the class getting
the math right without really

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:16.340
understanding the
physics or the mechanism

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.508
behind what's going on.

00:52:17.508 --> 00:52:19.550
So everything we've done
for the last three weeks

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.212
can be summed up
in one sentence--

00:52:21.212 --> 00:52:22.670
mass and energy
are the same thing.

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:28.050
We've just had a lot of math
to get there and be able to--

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:29.633
yeah, it still kind
of makes your head

00:52:29.633 --> 00:52:30.930
want to explode, right?

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:32.640
If you think about
it, if you make an--

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.150
we want to make an
endothermic reaction happen,

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:38.750
you have to put kinetic energy
into one of the particles.

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:43.850
And that system in the
just barely-allowed state,

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.170
the nuclei won't really be
moving, or at least the--

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:46.670
yeah.

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:48.545
The nuclei won't really
be moving afterwards,

00:52:48.545 --> 00:52:51.100
because you'll have
turned energy into matter.

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:55.310
That kinetic energy is
turned into mass energy.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:58.070
Just like you can turn potential
into kinetic or thermal

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:03.570
into mechanical or vice versa,
it's other forms of energy.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.890
Kind of mind-blowing.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:09.670
Well anyway, so now that we
finished radioactive decay,

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:12.568
I want to get into the
concept of activity half-life,

00:53:12.568 --> 00:53:14.110
and then we're going
to start but not

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:18.760
finish serial radioactive
creation and destruction.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.150
In your readings, you'll see an
equation that looks something

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:25.660
like this where we're going to
be at the end of the day today.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:30.610
If you want to show off
how much of some isotope N1

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:32.560
exists as a function
of time, you

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.435
may have seen something
that looks like this.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.860
We're going to be
able to understand

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.580
how these equations are created,
and because this is MIT,

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:49.650
we're going to take
it further and add

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:54.060
specifically driven
mechanisms, like can you

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:57.060
create an isotope
not just by decay

00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:00.150
from one isotope to another,
but by intentionally making it?

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:04.140
Which is exactly how NAA Nuclear
Activation Analysis works.

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.450
You fire neutrons
into a material.

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:10.117
They turn into something else
and start decaying in series.

00:54:10.117 --> 00:54:12.450
This is what we're going to
be working out the math for,

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.850
but I want to make
sure at every step

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:17.100
that we get the physics right.

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.220
So first, a very quick
primer on where--

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.150
what is activity and where
does half-life come from?

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:31.020
So we define the A, the
activity of a substance

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:34.650
as pretty simple.

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:38.300
It depends on the amount of
the substance that's there,

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.190
and it depends on what's
called this decay constant.

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:45.680
So this amount-- let's
just say like atoms.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.780
And this decay constant is
in units of 1 over second.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.570
An activity is in,
let's say, atoms

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:58.950
destroyed or decays per second.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:02.720
That thing right there is called
the decay constant, lambda.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.520
And if we want to see, let's
say, how much of a substance

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.670
is decaying at a certain
time or what's its activity

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:16.460
and get a measure of how quickly
does it take to decay away,

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.400
we can start by saying,
well this in effect

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.790
is a destruction
rate of isotope N.

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:25.150
So we can make the simplest
of differential equations

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:30.100
and say, the amount of substance
N as a function of time

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:36.470
is just minus its activity,
which equals minus lambda n.

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:39.260
I hope I don't have to explain
how to solve this differential

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:42.230
equation, so I'm going to go
through it pretty quickly.

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:45.100
What's the method
you use for this

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.870
to get n as a function of t?

00:55:49.582 --> 00:55:50.718
AUDIENCE: 3?

00:55:50.718 --> 00:55:51.510
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:54.093
You're all in 18-03 or
have finished 18-03, right?

00:55:54.093 --> 00:55:55.260
This should have been day 1.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.200
So we'll just separate
variables, divide each side

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.100
by N, multiply side by dt.

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:06.142
So we get dN over N
equals negative lambda dt.

00:56:06.142 --> 00:56:12.810
You can integrate both sides,
and we get the natural log of N

00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:17.678
equals minus lambda t plus
some integration constant.

00:56:17.678 --> 00:56:19.470
We're going to do a
little bit of trickery,

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:24.220
and to make things in a nice
form that we can deal with,

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:28.190
let's just call this log of N0.

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:29.450
They're just numbers, right?

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:33.180
We haven't defined what this
constant of integration is.

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.930
Everyone cool with
us doing that?

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:40.220
So then we can subtract
log of N0 from each side.

00:56:42.992 --> 00:56:52.910
And we get log N minus log
of N0 equals minus lambda t.

00:56:52.910 --> 00:57:01.370
So this is like saying log of N
over N0 equals minus lambda t.

00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:03.260
We'll take either the
power of both sides

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:09.580
and we get N over and not
equals e to the minus lambda t.

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:13.560
And right there you've got your
exponential decay equation.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.600
This is the easy part.

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.720
And what this tells you is it
is a larger decay constant.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.370
Well let me ask you
a question, then.

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:24.160
Would a larger decay
constant mean a faster

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.358
or a slower decaying isotope?

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.250
A larger decay
constant-- correct--

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:36.220
means that you've got more
of these decays happening

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.780
per second.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:43.050
So a larger lambda
means faster decay.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.330
And we also can
define a quantity

00:57:49.330 --> 00:58:02.420
called the half-life, which
means N at t 1/2 equals 1/2 N0.

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:07.670
So for that, all you have to
do is plug in t 1/2 for t,

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:12.980
and 1/2 N0 for N0, and you
actually get this relation

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:20.180
where the half-life is just log
of 2 over lambda, better known

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.700
as 0.693.

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.690
But we'll just leave it
as log of 2 for exactness.

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:28.610
And that's all there really
is for decay in half-life.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.500
So I'll pose another
question to you.

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:35.420
Something with a
larger decay constant,

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:38.680
will it have a larger
or a smaller half-life?

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.540
AUDIENCE: Smaller?

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.210
MICHAEL SHORT: Smaller, because
they're inversely related.

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.440
So I'd say from this
quick derivation,

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.990
these are the two
things to note.

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:54.870
Is that something with a larger
decay constant decays faster

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:57.210
and therefore has a
shorter half-life.

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.000
So when we were separating
out our isotopes in nuclear

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.700
activation analysis into
what Mike called the shorts

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.840
and the longs, he was separating
them by half-life to say that--

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.670
let's say the same
amount of activation

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:11.100
or the same amount
of creation, the ones

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:15.420
with shorter half-lives will
be hotter, more radioactive,

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.052
but for less time.

00:59:17.052 --> 00:59:18.510
And so what we're
going to be doing

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:21.150
is what's called short
nuclear activation analysis

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:23.610
because we don't want to
count for like days or weeks

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:24.120
or months.

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:24.760
Yep?

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.010
AUDIENCE: So is half-life--
is the decay constant just

00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:29.915
a property of the given
substance, given element?

00:59:29.915 --> 00:59:31.290
MICHAEL SHORT:
The decay constant

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:33.090
is a property of
the given isotope

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:35.650
specific to that type of decay.

00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:40.740
So if we were to draw that
generalized radioactivity

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.310
diagram--

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:46.530
let's say we have potassium-40,
which can either go by beta

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:48.990
decay to--

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:51.060
what comes in beta--
what comes after--

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.490
I think it's calcium-40.

00:59:53.490 --> 01:00:02.560
Or it can go by positron or
electron capture to argon-40.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.433
Each of these processes
has a different half-life.

01:00:05.433 --> 01:00:06.850
And then in that
chain-- remember,

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:10.210
let's do the
americium-241, and I'm

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:12.190
going to channel
my one-year-old son

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:14.995
in drawing this decay diagram.

01:00:14.995 --> 01:00:21.720
It looks something like that
with all sorts of transitions.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.010
I didn't scream like he
usually does, but whatever.

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:25.562
We're on camera.

01:00:25.562 --> 01:00:27.520
Each of these decay--
each of these transitions

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.140
may also have its own half-life.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.210
So between isometric
transitions,

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:34.175
they're usually very, very
fast, but once in a while

01:00:34.175 --> 01:00:34.675
they're not.

01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:42.950
Like technetium-99
metastable to technetium-99

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:46.340
has a half-life of
around six days,

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:50.730
which is why it's so useful
as a medical isotope.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.210
So when you see something
marked M for metastable,

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:57.560
all that means is there
is some sort of a gamma,

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.560
also known as an IT
transition, with a particularly

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.832
long half-life.

01:01:04.487 --> 01:01:06.070
Everyone clear on
what all that means?

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:10.773
Cool.

01:01:10.773 --> 01:01:12.190
Well, there'll be
some time for it

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:17.560
to sink in because with
these definitions in hand,

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.690
I want to pose a
problem to you guys.

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:31.200
Let's say I start off with
some amount of an isotope N1.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.780
And it decays by
some mechanism--

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.350
we don't care what--

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:40.350
to isotope N2, and it
decays to some isotope N3

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:45.480
with decay constants
lambda 1 and lambda 2.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:49.140
This is what we call
serial radioactive decay.

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:58.010
How do we construct
a system of equations

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:03.080
to tell us what is N1 as
a function of time, what

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.710
is N2 as a function
of time, and what

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:11.210
is N3 as a function of time?

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:13.568
Where do we begin
in a general sense?

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.980
OK, so let's start with N1.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.990
We kind of have an
expression for N1 already,

01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:24.840
but let's start out with
a differential equation.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.760
So the form of all
of these equations

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.090
for everything serial
radioactive decay and burning

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:33.300
isotopes in a reactor and
creating isotopes in a reactor

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.060
is going to take
the following form.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.370
The general equation is simple.

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:46.265
The change equals creation
minus destruction.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.070
Or the simple thing is
let's say the change is

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:57.280
a source minus a sink.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.920
And we'll have to come up for
every one of these isotopes

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.830
for a mathematical way to
describe what's the source

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:04.330
and what's the sink.

01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:08.170
So if we want to
measure the change in N1

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:12.410
as a function of time, what
are the sources of isotope N1?

01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:13.825
Yeah?

01:03:13.825 --> 01:03:15.200
AUDIENCE: Isn't
there no sources?

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.690
MICHAEL SHORT: No sources.

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:21.140
We're starting off with
some fixed quantity of N1.

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.260
Let's just call it N1,0.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.320
But you're right, there's
no continuous source

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.480
of isotope N1.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.296
What about its destruction?

01:03:33.296 --> 01:03:35.197
AUDIENCE: Decay to N2?

01:03:35.197 --> 01:03:36.030
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:36.840
Decay to N2.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.540
So we've got the equation
for that right there.

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:44.410
it depends on the decay
constant of number 1

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:46.347
and the amount of number 1.

01:03:46.347 --> 01:03:47.430
So what we're doing here--

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:50.470
I love how this course is
timed with 18-03 because you're

01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:53.280
learning ordinary differential
equations in 18-03,

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.780
and we're going to be solving
everyday ordinary differential

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.722
equations for a fair
bit of this course.

01:03:57.722 --> 01:03:59.180
So it's one of
those rare times you

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.780
get to like learn math and
put it to use at the same time

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.930
instead of six years later,
it's just kind of nice.

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:06.590
So that's easy.

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:08.430
Let's go to the more
challenging one.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:13.280
What is the source
of isotope N2?

01:04:16.082 --> 01:04:17.272
AUDIENCE: Decay from N1?

01:04:17.272 --> 01:04:18.480
MICHAEL SHORT: Decay from N1.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.744
So how would I
mathematically write that?

01:04:21.744 --> 01:04:23.910
AUDIENCE: Just lambda 1 N1.

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:27.780
MICHAEL SHORT: Just lambda 1 N1.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:33.780
And what is the
destruction of isotope N2?

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.679
Anyone else?

01:04:35.679 --> 01:04:36.932
AUDIENCE: Lambda 2 N2?

01:04:36.932 --> 01:04:38.390
MICHAEL SHORT:
Takes the same form.

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:40.640
It depends on the decay
concept of isotope 2

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.280
and the amount of
isotope 2 that's there.

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:48.920
How about isotope 3?

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.848
Where does that come from?

01:04:55.186 --> 01:04:56.308
AUDIENCE: Lambda 2 N2?

01:04:56.308 --> 01:04:57.350
MICHAEL SHORT: That's it.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:01.310
The source is lambda 2 N2.

01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:03.276
What are the sinks
or the destruction?

01:05:03.276 --> 01:05:04.150
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.860
MICHAEL SHORT: Nothing.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:10.210
So we have a very simple set
of posed differential equations

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:13.540
to describe the production and
the destruction of these three

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.830
isotopes.

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:18.670
So let's imagine now
that N1 was, let's say,

01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:22.490
radium, which exists all
throughout the soil and rocks;

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:27.040
N2 is radon, the gas that's
produced from radium decay;

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.640
and then N3 could be let's
say one of the stable daughter

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.877
products of radon.

01:05:31.877 --> 01:05:33.460
So these are the
sorts of calculations

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.688
that are done all the
time in real life to see--

01:05:35.688 --> 01:05:37.480
if you know how much
radium is in the rock,

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.850
how much radon do you
expect to breathe in?

01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:42.850
Because at the same time
you're producing radon

01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:44.740
from radium decay.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.410
And the radon is
decaying itself.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:49.750
So you can't just say, oh,
the activity of the radium

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.700
equals the amount of
radon because it's

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.490
being created and destroyed
all at the same time,

01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:56.940
and it depends on how
much there is around.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.650
Same thing with nuclear
activation analysis.

01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:05.470
You'll, let's say, you'd
start off with sodium-21,

01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:08.440
you can create sodium-22.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.060
Sodium-22 will decay
by positron emission.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.460
What comes before sodium?

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:21.200
Probably neon, I think, 22.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.880
That's my guess.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.510
Yeah.

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:26.750
So if you want to say how
much sodium-22 is there,

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:29.690
well you're both creating it
from sodium-21 from neutron

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:33.290
absorption, and you're
decaying it naturally

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:36.178
by positron emission
among other processes.

01:06:36.178 --> 01:06:38.720
We're going to get back into
how do we deal with the neutrons

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.230
thing probably on
Tuesday, But for now,

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:45.660
let's work on solving
this system of equations.

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.020
So I think N1 is pretty
easy because we already

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.713
have the solution for it.

01:06:49.713 --> 01:06:50.630
So I'll just write it.

01:06:54.058 --> 01:06:54.558
1t.

01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:01.060
The harder one is N2.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.940
So what can we start by doing?

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:10.330
We've got an ordinary
differential equation with--

01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:13.480
it's just this first order,
but there's two variables.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.230
So how do we deal?

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.760
AUDIENCE: Pick another equation?

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.302
MICHAEL SHORT: We do it-- well,
we have other equations, so--

01:07:24.302 --> 01:07:25.510
actually, we've got this one.

01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:26.050
Yes.

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:30.460
Substitute N1 in here so we
get everything in terms of N2

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:33.280
and constants and type.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:41.650
So we'll rewrite this equation
as dN2/dt, which I'm also just

01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:43.603
going to write as N2 prime.

01:07:43.603 --> 01:07:45.520
And when you use this a
little bit of notation

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.260
that I'll leave up
there on the board

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.870
because it's going to be
a lot faster in writing.

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:54.760
Which equals lambda 1 and
10e to the minus lambda

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:58.260
1t minus lambda 2 N2.

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.440
Can we separate variables here?

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.080
I don't see an easy way.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:15.690
So, 18-03 experts, how do we
solve this type of first order

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:18.540
differential equation?

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.486
And I'll give you--

01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:21.069
l won't give you a
hint, I'll give you

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:22.990
a little bit of consolation.

01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:26.260
No one from last year
knew how to approach this.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.890
So if you don't know, I
won't be disappointed.

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:30.350
Yeah?

01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:33.432
AUDIENCE: You've got
N2 dot plus lambda 2

01:08:33.432 --> 01:08:37.280
N2 equals lambda 1 N1 dot--

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.689
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:41.020
AUDIENCE: So you could put--

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.200
add lambda 2 N2 to both sides.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.720
MICHAEL SHORT: Add lambda
2 N2 to the both sides.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.670
I think you're on to
what I'm thinking about.

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:59.270
Also, if you can't
read something I write,

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:01.830
please stop me and let me know
and I'll be happy to erase it.

01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:03.380
I don't think I've
said that yet,

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.090
but it takes a lot
of control for me

01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:07.279
to get my handwriting legible
on the board let alone

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.112
on a piece of paper.

01:09:08.112 --> 01:09:11.189
So if you can't read,
please let me know.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.779
OK.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:15.800
So now we've got the N2's
separate from the N1's, what

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:16.460
do we do next?

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.750
AUDIENCE: --N2 has
the form A times

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:21.500
e to the negative lambda 1t?

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.770
MICHAEL SHORT: OK,
let's try this.

01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:28.127
Assume N2 has the
form e to the what?

01:09:28.127 --> 01:09:30.877
AUDIENCE: Negative lambda 1t?

01:09:30.877 --> 01:09:32.544
MICHAEL SHORT:
Negative-- has the form e

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:34.090
to the lambda negative 1t.

01:09:34.090 --> 01:09:35.560
AUDIENCE: With that A in front--

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.960
MICHAEL SHORT: With an A,
some constant in front.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.090
What makes you say that?

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:43.340
AUDIENCE: Like if you take
the derivative with respect

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.597
to time, then the next
term will still have a e

01:09:45.597 --> 01:09:47.065
to the negative lambda 1t?

01:09:47.065 --> 01:09:47.982
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

01:09:47.982 --> 01:09:50.477
AUDIENCE: Cancel all
those out and solve for A.

01:09:50.477 --> 01:09:51.310
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:53.450
So that is one way to do it.

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:55.490
It's going to get a
little messy, though.

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.130
There's another
method specifically

01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:59.510
for equations of the form.

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.990
Let's call it y prime plus--

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:04.340
I'm going to use notation
they may have used in 18-03.

01:10:07.651 --> 01:10:09.105
I hear a couple of aha.

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.380
Anything look familiar
about this type of equation?

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.690
OK, what is it?

01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:18.690
AUDIENCE: Not following.

01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:21.160
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.230
MICHAEL SHORT:
It's not that hard.

01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:25.570
Anyone remember the
word integrating factor?

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:34.960
And it was probably done
horribly and on like six math

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.860
boards or whatever.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:39.940
So I'm going to show you
the simpler way to do this.

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.180
The idea here is we want
to multiply everything

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:49.030
by something-- by
some function mu.

01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:52.260
Put a mu there, put a mu
there, put a mu there.

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.010
I think that's the
notation that's usually

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:56.950
used in differential
equations, such

01:10:56.950 --> 01:11:01.910
that this thing right here is
shrinkable through the product

01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:02.410
rule.

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:06.960
Or the product rule--

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.360
I'm not assuming
everyone remembers--

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:16.315
says that let's say you
have some function a of t,

01:11:16.315 --> 01:11:27.220
b of t prime is like a prime
times b plus a times b prime.

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.110
So we're kind of getting
around to the method

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:30.693
that Luke was talking
about, but we're

01:11:30.693 --> 01:11:33.100
going to do it by a little
bit of a cleaner way.

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.880
We multiply every term
by some function mu

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.510
such that this part is one
of these perfect product

01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:43.090
rules at which point we
can shrink and integrate

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:44.530
the expression.

01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:46.840
Without going through
the derivation of how

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.850
integrating factors
are done, I'll

01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:52.390
just let you know that
this function mu ends up

01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:56.300
being e to the integral of p.

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:01.595
Hat is our integrating factor.

01:12:01.595 --> 01:12:03.470
So that's the end result
of what was probably

01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:05.360
six boards of 18-03.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.310
Am I right or am I mistaken?

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:09.230
Well, things haven't
changed in 15 years.

01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:10.130
Cool.

01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:16.140
OK, so what is mu
for this equation?

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:21.220
Luckily, p of t
is pretty simple.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.870
Which part of this
equation right here

01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:26.624
is our p of t-like term?

01:12:26.624 --> 01:12:28.810
AUDIENCE: Lambda 2 N2.

01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:31.810
MICHAEL SHORT:
Actually, just lambda 2.

01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:34.180
Because we've got our
variable right here

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.960
that right there is our p of t.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.780
So we'll just say that mu
equals e to the integral of--

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:51.700
uh, yep-- of lambda 2 dt, which
is just e to the lambda 2t.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.160
That's our integrating
factor right there.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.560
So we'll multiply every
term right here by that.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:07.090
So we'll say e to the lambda 2t
times and N2 prime plus lambda

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:09.610
2 e to the lambda 2t.

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:13.030
Anyone see what
is going on here?

01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:15.190
There's the product
rule thing going on--

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:24.100
times N2 plus e to the
lambda 2t times lambda 1 N10

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.210
e to the minus
lambda 1t equals 0.

01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:32.350
And we have successfully
created something here

01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:34.130
that can be shrunk up
with a product rule.

01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.310
Yeah?

01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:35.774
AUDIENCE: Should
that be a minus e

01:13:35.774 --> 01:13:39.190
to the lambda 2t lambda 1 N1--

01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:41.142
when you moved it over?

01:13:41.142 --> 01:13:42.322
It's positive--

01:13:42.322 --> 01:13:43.280
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh yeah.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.640
There's an equal sign
there, isn't there?

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.920
That's what tripped me up.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.030
Thank you.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:50.300
So there is indeed
a minus sign there

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.030
because I skipped the
step putting everything

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:54.670
on one side of the equation.

01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:55.170
Yep?

01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:58.905
AUDIENCE: Could we do this with
variational parameters instead?

01:13:58.905 --> 01:14:01.530
MICHAEL SHORT: Where you replace
one variable with-- or replace

01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:03.256
a couple of variables
with another one?

01:14:03.256 --> 01:14:06.588
AUDIENCE: Well yeah, just
like the homogeneous solution,

01:14:06.588 --> 01:14:09.450
and then you'll
find like a factor--

01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:10.590
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:12.850
There are lots of ways
of solving a first order

01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:13.990
ODE like this.

01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.490
Sure.

01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:16.580
So this would work with
various parameters.

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:18.502
It would work with what
Luke's talking about.

01:14:18.502 --> 01:14:19.460
It works with this one.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:21.810
This just happened to be
a particularly simple one

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:24.990
because the integrating
factor's so simple.

01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:27.720
So let's cram this
up right here.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.340
So this is like
saying N2 times e

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:38.310
to the lambda 2t prime minus--

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:41.580
and we've got two
e to the somethings

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.990
that we can combine right here.

01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:50.580
So I'll just say lambda
1 and 10e to the lambda

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:57.450
2 minus lambda 1t equals 0.

01:14:57.450 --> 01:15:00.480
So now I will put this
term back on the other side

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.820
by doing that.

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.380
And now we just
integrate both sides.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:16.970
And we get N2 e to the
lambda 2t equals, let's see.

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:21.260
Becomes lambda 1
N10 over lambda 2

01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:26.330
minus lambda 1 e to
the lambda 2 minus

01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:33.280
lambda 1t plus some
integration constant C.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.920
And in this case, our
initial condition, well,

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.130
how much of isotope
N2 did we start with?

01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:41.928
Have we specified that yet?

01:15:41.928 --> 01:15:43.740
No?

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.990
Let's make it simple.

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:51.450
Let's assume that the initial
amount of isotope N2 equals 0.

01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:53.340
We put some isotope
in the reactor

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.342
or start it off with some
amount of isotope like radium.

01:15:56.342 --> 01:15:57.300
Didn't start off with--

01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:00.600
it didn't start off with any
radon, and just kept going.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.680
So then all we have to do is
divide each side by either

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:12.680
the lambda 2t, and
that cancels those,

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:20.320
that cancels that and that, and
we end up with N2 as a function

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:28.180
of time equals lambda 1 N1,0
over lambda 2 minus lambda 1

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:34.010
times e to the minus lambda 1t.

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:34.510
OK.

01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:40.850
And we've got an
expression for N2.

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:41.810
How about N3?

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:44.435
Do we even have
to solve this one?

01:16:44.435 --> 01:16:48.342
I see a couple of people shaking
their heads no, why is that?

01:16:48.342 --> 01:16:50.318
AUDIENCE: Basically you
already solved for N1,

01:16:50.318 --> 01:16:52.058
they're just not minus signs.

01:16:52.058 --> 01:16:53.350
MICHAEL SHORT: Well, not quite.

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:56.230
Because we-- well yeah, I guess
we've kind of solved it for N1,

01:16:56.230 --> 01:17:00.760
but now we take this expression
for N2, stick it in here,

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.640
and then solve that,
it's going to get messy.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.880
So I'm going to show you
something mathematically

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.920
now that I'll show
you graphically later.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.481
There's a conservation equation
that we're missing here.

01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:24.270
If we sum up isotopes
N1, N2, N3, equals what?

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:25.800
Conserving total
number of atoms.

01:17:28.572 --> 01:17:29.960
AUDIENCE: N1,0?

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.250
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:32.517
N1,0.

01:17:32.517 --> 01:17:34.100
In this situation
where we started off

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:37.280
with some known quantity
of isotope 1 only,

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.160
you can't change the
number of atoms here,

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.290
you can only change
the type of atoms.

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.630
So we don't have
to solve for E3--

01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:52.240
oh sorry, for N3, because N3
is just N1,0 minus N1 minus N2.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.680
And that takes like an extra 10
minutes out of today's lecture.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:00.100
So later on when we have
a projector on Tuesday,

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.960
I will show you these
equations graphed out where

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.710
I've-- actually, I'll
share this with you.

01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:08.630
Did I tell you guys about the
Desmos graphical calculator?

01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:10.108
Or have I shown this to you yet?

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:17.500
Go here for all of
your graphing needs.

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.980
It's free, and the
best part that I like

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.930
is that anytime you
define some parameter,

01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:25.970
it automatically
makes a slider bar

01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:28.160
so you can play
with the equations.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.300
And you can just--

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:31.610
say, like, well
what if L1 and L--

01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:32.900
lambda 1 and L2 are equal?

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.233
What if they were way different?

01:18:34.233 --> 01:18:36.798
And it just graphs
the solutions for you.

01:18:36.798 --> 01:18:37.590
It's pretty useful.

01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:40.040
So I'll show you some
of that on Tuesday

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.040
when we actually have a screen.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.060
Let me see what time it is.

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.295
Oh sweet, we've
got plenty of time.

01:18:46.295 --> 01:18:48.170
So now I want to pose
the following questions

01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:49.505
to you guys.

01:18:49.505 --> 01:18:51.630
I'm going to erase stuff
from here because we still

01:18:51.630 --> 01:18:52.297
have some space.

01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:01.810
How do we model nuclear
activation analysis

01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:05.290
using this kind of equation?

01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:09.370
We'll start off with
the same equation.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:16.590
So let's say we'll have a minus
lambda 1 N1, we'll have N2,

01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:21.570
minus lambda 2 N2
minus something.

01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:27.180
N3 equals something-- let's
see, there's a lambda 1 N1,

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:31.080
there's a lambda 2
N2 minus something.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.880
I've left some
trailing minus signs

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.940
to indicate that we don't have
complete equations for this

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.930
yet.

01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:41.640
So for the case of nuclear
activation analysis where

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.440
we have some imposed flux--

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.215
flux-- of neutrons.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:56.430
So anyone remember from some
of our previous flash-forwards

01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:59.370
how do we turn these into
creation and destruction rates

01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:00.945
of these different isotopes?

01:20:05.797 --> 01:20:07.130
AUDIENCE: Could you repeat that?

01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.922
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

01:20:07.922 --> 01:20:12.200
So let's say we've now
stuck N1 in the reactor.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.140
And we're now using the reactor
to create different isotopes

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:19.220
like N2 and N3, but at the same
time they're in the reactor,

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.290
they're getting
cooked as well by some

01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:24.500
imposed flux of neutrons.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.955
How do we set up and not
solve the system of equations

01:20:27.955 --> 01:20:31.750
to describe this?

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:38.012
AUDIENCE: Are they-- are N2
and N3 both getting like--

01:20:38.012 --> 01:20:40.220
MICHAEL SHORT: They're
getting destroyed and whatnot?

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:42.348
AUDIENCE: Are they
just like decaying

01:20:42.348 --> 01:20:45.425
or are they also getting like
added stuff from neutrons--

01:20:45.425 --> 01:20:46.300
MICHAEL SHORT: Well--

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.000
AUDIENCE: Because that
depends on the isotope.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.230
MICHAEL SHORT: That
depends on the isotope.

01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:50.740
So let's define
what the system--

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.290
this system is.

01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:56.890
Let's say we stuck in
some other isotope N0,

01:20:56.890 --> 01:21:01.680
and we put it in, and we're
going to have to say it's--

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:08.250
if we have N0 prime, some
minus some creation term.

01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:13.620
And in this case, N0 can
absorb a neutron to become N1.

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:21.900
N1 is decaying to N2,
N2 is decaying to N3.

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.840
But also, N1 can be
burned by neutrons

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:31.750
N2 can be burned by neutrons and
N3 can be burned by neutrons.

01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:34.500
So here I've given you kind
of a simplistic situation that

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.940
doesn't usually exist.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.070
Here I've given you
a situation that you

01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:40.200
could replicate in the reactor.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:44.310
How do we model this nuclear
activation analysis process?

01:21:49.957 --> 01:21:51.540
Well first of all,
what's the creation

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:57.647
rate of N0, the stuff
we put in the reactor?

01:21:57.647 --> 01:21:58.480
Are we creating any?

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.140
No?

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:05.640
Luke?

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:09.528
AUDIENCE: It's all going
to be created if N2 absorbs

01:22:09.528 --> 01:22:11.515
the neutron and [INAUDIBLE]?

01:22:11.515 --> 01:22:12.640
MICHAEL SHORT: It could be.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.700
So if we had this for the
following nuclear reaction,

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.560
now it's getting crazy.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.060
We can model that, too.

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:21.670
Let's do it.

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.462
OK, I was going to say
no, but let's do it.

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:29.210
We can-- so what I'm
trying to do here is

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.190
give you the mathematical
tools to model

01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:33.290
any real physical situation.

01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:35.540
Usually in this class
like when I took it,

01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.010
the discussion
stopped here and we

01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:39.950
got to start looking at
different graphs of secular

01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:42.920
versus transient equilibrium
like in the reading.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.990
But I want you guys to
have the intuition to say,

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:47.960
all right, let's take any
crazy decay diagram, right?

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:52.340
And N3 becomes N1,
let's just go nuts.

01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:54.140
How do we set up the
differential equations

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:58.860
for this assuming that
computers can solve them?

01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:02.490
In every case-- where's
my long pointer?

01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:04.440
Go back to this here.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.440
The change is the creation
minus the destruction.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.240
So what are all the
creation sources

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.778
in our new scenario for N0?

01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:20.010
Well I pose you a
simpler question.

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:23.340
If there is no isotope
N2, can you create any N0?

01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:26.940
No.

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:30.540
Because the only way to
make N0 is to start with N2.

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:36.720
So we know its creation term
is going to have an N2 in it.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.312
What else does it depend on?

01:23:39.312 --> 01:23:40.858
AUDIENCE: Cross-section.

01:23:40.858 --> 01:23:43.150
MICHAEL SHORT: I heard both
of the pieces of the answer

01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:44.840
correct at the same time.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:47.650
It depends on the
flux of neutrons,

01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:50.680
and it depends on
the cross-section.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.860
This macroscopic
cross-section right here.

01:23:55.716 --> 01:23:57.144
OK?

01:23:57.144 --> 01:23:58.088
Or I'm sorry, no, no.

01:23:58.088 --> 01:23:59.880
It depends on the
microscopic cross-section

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.890
because we have an amount of N2.

01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:07.190
But it does depend on how
many neutrons you throw at it

01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:10.770
and what is the probability
of each of those neutrons

01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:12.910
make some N0.

01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:16.390
So what we've got right
here is a reaction rate.

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:23.050
So who remembers from the
like second or third lecture,

01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:25.270
we said a reaction
rate can be expressed

01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:29.350
like macroscopic
cross-section times of flux,

01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:32.080
which is the same as a
microscopic cross-section times

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.960
number density times flux?

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.782
But this is better known as
a macroscopic cross-section.

01:24:41.497 --> 01:24:43.830
Remember, I kind of showed
this to you very briefly when

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.205
we talk about
cross-sections, now

01:24:45.205 --> 01:24:47.108
is where we actually use them.

01:24:47.108 --> 01:24:48.900
So the cross-section's
like the probability

01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:54.090
that a neutron coming in to atom
N is going to react with it.

01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:58.500
The macroscopic cross-section
in units of, let's say,

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:02.342
1 over centimeters
is the total--

01:25:02.342 --> 01:25:04.800
let's say the total probability
accounting for how many are

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.560
there, and the flux is in
neutrons per centimeter

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.630
squared per second.

01:25:12.630 --> 01:25:16.650
Combine these together,
and you get a reaction rate

01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:22.890
in atoms per centimeter
cubed per second,

01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:25.545
a volumetric reaction rate.

01:25:25.545 --> 01:25:26.210
There we go.

01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:31.960
So N1 can be created.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:36.430
Let's give this cross-section
a designation from N2 to N0.

01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:41.240
So let's call it
cross-section 2,0.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.680
How can N not be destroyed?

01:25:48.452 --> 01:25:52.390
I'll give you a hint, it looks
very similar to this term.

01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:53.952
Anyone want to take a guess?

01:25:58.762 --> 01:25:59.724
Yeah?

01:25:59.724 --> 01:26:01.952
AUDIENCE: Could it
undergo fission?

01:26:01.952 --> 01:26:03.660
MICHAEL SHORT: We
haven't specified that.

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:06.560
I'm going to cut the
craziness at there, I think.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.310
But just look at the
reactions right here.

01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:11.280
N0 can absorb a
neutron and become N1.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.144
So how do we
mathematically write that?

01:26:16.126 --> 01:26:18.818
AUDIENCE: Minus the
cross-section N--

01:26:18.818 --> 01:26:19.610
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:20.870
Minus the cross-section of?

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:21.950
AUDIENCE: N1.

01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:23.960
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
say 0 going to 1.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.340
Let's just call it that.

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.550
Times the neutron flux.

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:28.520
Times what?

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.290
AUDIENCE: Times N0?

01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:33.170
MICHAEL SHORT: Times the
amount that's there, N0.

01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:34.610
So this is your
destruction term.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.440
Using this pattern, we can
fill in all the remaining terms

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.570
for all the remaining isotopes.

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:48.166
So what are the creation
mechanisms for isotope N1?

01:26:53.402 --> 01:26:54.610
Well, just follow the arrows.

01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:55.568
AUDIENCE: --same term--

01:26:55.568 --> 01:26:56.485
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

01:26:56.485 --> 01:26:58.320
AUDIENCE: --on the
first equation for N--

01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.200
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.130
There's this one right here.

01:27:00.130 --> 01:27:00.590
We can have--

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:01.270
AUDIENCE: --the sign.

01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:03.640
MICHAEL SHORT: But flip the
sign because it's creation.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:08.500
So sigma 0,1 flux N0.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.080
And what else can create
N1 because we're just

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.520
going crazy today?

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:16.460
N3 can create N1
because we said so.

01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.360
But-- yeah, because we said so.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:23.260
So now we'll say also we'll
have this cross-section for 3

01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:28.050
turning into 1
times flux times N3.

01:27:28.050 --> 01:27:33.150
Minus the decay of N1 using
our activity expression, minus

01:27:33.150 --> 01:27:34.116
what else?

01:27:37.005 --> 01:27:38.463
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
cross-section

01:27:38.463 --> 01:27:40.463
of the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:27:40.463 --> 01:27:41.880
MICHAEL SHORT: I
heard some-- yep,

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.948
that will be the
cross-section of N1.

01:27:44.948 --> 01:27:46.990
Let's call it going to
some isotope we don't care

01:27:46.990 --> 01:27:52.360
about times the flux times N1.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.770
So as long as you can
draw a like arrow decay

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:58.380
and destruction
production diagram,

01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:00.382
we can put this to math.

01:28:00.382 --> 01:28:01.340
That's the crazy thing.

01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:02.132
Let's finish it up.

01:28:02.132 --> 01:28:03.500
How about N2?

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.080
We know that N1 can decay to N2.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.960
What are the other
production mechanisms for N2?

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.826
Follow the arrows.

01:28:12.826 --> 01:28:14.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.920
MICHAEL SHORT: That's it.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.170
Because we're not changing
anything at this point.

01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:22.904
What are all the destruction
mechanisms for N2?

01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:24.880
AUDIENCE: Decay or [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:25.740
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.830
It can decay, it can be
absorbed by a neutron

01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:31.326
to become something
we don't care about.

01:28:31.326 --> 01:28:33.460
Let's see, let's
call it cross-section

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:41.380
2 null times flux times
N2 minus the cross-section

01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:44.130
from 2 to 0, just this
term with a minus sign.

01:28:48.567 --> 01:28:50.300
How about N3?

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.396
What are all the
ways we can make N3?

01:28:55.702 --> 01:28:57.077
Could you say it
a little louder?

01:28:57.077 --> 01:28:58.178
AUDIENCE: Only from decay.

01:28:58.178 --> 01:28:59.470
MICHAEL SHORT: Only from decay.

01:28:59.470 --> 01:29:02.020
Again, just see which
arrows are pointing at it.

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:06.225
And what about the
destruction mechanism for N3?

01:29:06.225 --> 01:29:08.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:09.030
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:11.890
So there's some probability
it decays, let's say,

01:29:11.890 --> 01:29:19.800
cross-section 3 null times
flux times N3 minus this arrow

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.960
going back to N1.

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.210
Running out of space,
too many units.

01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:31.450
From 3 to 1 flux N3.

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:35.530
So the point of accepting the
escalation of this problem

01:29:35.530 --> 01:29:37.240
into something crazy
is that it doesn't

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.010
matter how crazy it gets.

01:29:39.010 --> 01:29:42.190
As long as you have like an
arrow-based diagram or a flow

01:29:42.190 --> 01:29:45.820
chart to say which isotopes
become which other isotopes

01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:49.720
by which other means, you
can pose and correctly write

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:52.390
the set of equations
that defines them.

01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:55.450
This is when I would bring
in MATLAB or Mathematica.

01:29:55.450 --> 01:29:57.080
I could make you do
this analytically,

01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:00.090
but this isn't a
course 18 class and--

01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:01.844
yeah, we don't want to go there.

01:30:01.844 --> 01:30:04.060
Cool.

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.240
So I think--

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.660
I guess it's probably
getting towards 10 of 10 of.

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:11.220
Close enough.

01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:14.790
It's like three of 10 of.

01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:18.910
So I'd like to open it up to any
questions because we let this--

01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:22.240
I let this escalate freely to
prove the point that as long

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.680
as you know what
decays into what

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.600
or what creates
or destroys what,

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.980
you can set up the
equations correctly.

01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:31.800
What we'll be doing on
Tuesday is graphing this.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.920
Where we can pose an arbitrarily
complex set of equations

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:38.010
and you can start looking
at, well, the change in one

01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:40.130
depends on the
amount of the other,

01:30:40.130 --> 01:30:42.900
and you can almost graphically
solve this on paper.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.878
Forget Mathematica in MATLAB.

01:30:45.878 --> 01:30:47.670
If you look at last
year's exam, I actually

01:30:47.670 --> 01:30:49.080
posed a more
complex set of these

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.030
and said draw the solution.

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:54.710
And I'm going to-- we're going
to show you how to do that.

01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:59.175
But any question on
how we formed these?

01:30:59.175 --> 01:31:00.165
Yep?

01:31:00.165 --> 01:31:02.145
AUDIENCE: What is sigma again?

01:31:02.145 --> 01:31:03.640
I'm sorry.

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:06.400
MICHAEL SHORT: So we just
said let's say N3 decays

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.862
to some isotope we
don't care about.

01:31:08.862 --> 01:31:10.570
That's how I initially
had it, and then I

01:31:10.570 --> 01:31:12.600
think Luke said, well
can N2 become N0?

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.260
And I said, yeah, sure.

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:17.090
So there can be a cross-section
for every type of reaction.

01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:20.350
So in reality, you might have
any reaction under the sun,

01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:21.220
right?

01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:23.290
One isotope could absorb
a neutron and decay

01:31:23.290 --> 01:31:25.600
by like any three or
four different mechanisms

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:27.297
into something else.

01:31:27.297 --> 01:31:28.797
You may have different
probabilities

01:31:28.797 --> 01:31:30.288
for each of these.

01:31:34.261 --> 01:31:34.761
Yeah?

01:31:34.761 --> 01:31:40.665
AUDIENCE: Do those decay
constants [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:40.665 --> 01:31:42.290
MICHAEL SHORT: The
only time I'd expect

01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:44.630
you to find these decay
constants is if I told you

01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:46.400
what these isotopes were.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.190
Those are also listed on
the table of nuclides.

01:31:49.190 --> 01:31:52.610
As in they give
you the half-life,

01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:54.800
and you know from this
half-life relation

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:57.350
what the decay constant is.

01:31:57.350 --> 01:32:00.243
If I didn't tell you
what these isotopes were,

01:32:00.243 --> 01:32:01.910
I would just have you
keep these symbols

01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:03.710
as lambda 1 and lambda 2.

01:32:03.710 --> 01:32:06.830
And I might pose a question
which will solve graphically

01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:09.110
on Tuesday, like
let's say, solve

01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:12.320
this set of equations
for lambda 2

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.203
is much greater than lambda 1.

01:32:14.203 --> 01:32:15.620
I don't care what
the numbers are,

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:18.700
let's just look at
that general relation.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.430
And all the graphs for
that sort of situation

01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:26.140
will follow the same pattern.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.640
Cool.

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.860
Any other questions on how
we constructed this set

01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:32.190
of differential equations?

01:32:32.190 --> 01:32:34.820
And know that I'll never
ask you to solve them

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:38.020
numerically or analytically.

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:38.520
Yeah.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:43.060
That's why we have computers
and this is the future.

01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:45.492
These I might expect you
to know how to derive,

01:32:45.492 --> 01:32:47.117
but this is the
simplest possible case.

01:32:52.254 --> 01:32:54.445
All right, if
there's no questions,

01:32:54.445 --> 01:32:56.070
then let's take
another 10-minute break

01:32:56.070 --> 01:33:00.100
and I'll be here for recitation
to go over whatever problems

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:02.250
you guys would like to do.

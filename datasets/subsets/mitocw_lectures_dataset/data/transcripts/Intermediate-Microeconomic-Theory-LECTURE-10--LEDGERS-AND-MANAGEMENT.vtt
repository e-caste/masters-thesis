[SQUEAKING][RUSTLING][CLICKING]

00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:11.147 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.147 --> 00:00:11.980 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So let me update where we
are in terms of the calendar.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I guess a notable
thing is that we

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.130 align:middle line:84%
have reached lecture 10
today, Thursday, in terms

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:90%
of the reading list.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.334 align:middle line:84%
We are-- having done
all the risk-sharing.

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we're at lecture 10.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's a couple of
things that are starred here,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and they obviously both come
up in the lecture today.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
One is the early
version of this paper

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.020 align:middle line:84%
with Alvarez and
Pawasutipaisit sit

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.570 align:middle line:90%
cash, which has a star on it.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit rough because
it's kind of, even then,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.340 align:middle line:90%
in the process of revision.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And I have added new material
in the slides that haven't even

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.980 align:middle line:84%
made their way into
the working paper yet.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
Samphantharak and Townsend,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
which is describing
the tools we're

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:90%
going to be using a lot today--

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:84%
how to organize data, and think
about flows and stocks in terms

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:90%
of financial accounts and so on.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So, again, the two
starred readings.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Other things you might
enjoy, time permitting,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
there's something
on Kenya, M-Pesa.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And I have one slide
describing-- actually

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:84%
two slides describing
that today;

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:90%
something on lifecycle planning.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
But none of those things
have stars on them.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:90%
So that's the reading list.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
The last thing, turning to
the study guide or the lecture

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
from last time, which
was "Risk and Return

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:90%
in Village Thailand."

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So explain intuitively in words
why multiple technologies can

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:84%
be chosen to be
operated simultaneously,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and why the rate
of return on some

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
might be higher than
the rate of return

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:84%
for the others that
are also operating.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And for that matter, why some
projects are not chosen at all.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
If you can, try to use the
language of risk premium,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:90%
but don't use it as jargon.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Try to imagine you're telling
someone in your household

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
or a friend kind of what
we're studying in class.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:90%
So I've been calling on people.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Let me just ask for
volunteers today.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I can call on people.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Any volunteers?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Carrie, you want to
take a crack at this?

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is it because
some technologies

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:84%
have a lower rate of return
because they're riskier?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And the probability of
a high rate of return

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:90%
is lower for them?

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.997 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.997 --> 00:02:50.205 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's true.

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:84%
At first blush,
the rate of return

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
is simply all the possible
returns multiplied

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:90%
by the respective probability.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of inherent
in the technology itself.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:84%
But if that were the only
thing going on, then why would

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.542 align:middle line:84%
they not choose the one with
the highest expected return?

00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can I
take a crack at it?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yep.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Well, I think
they've got-- yeah,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm a bit behind
in the readings.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But what it looks
like here is that you

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
have some technologies that
have a higher expected rate

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
of return but more risk,
and some technologies that

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
have the low rate of
return and lower risk.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And basically--
and some of them--

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:90%
so some of them are--

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
some people-- it's like some
households might be more like--

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
it's like, you can have like--
and if these aren't perfectly

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
correlated, then you might
be able to get a better--

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
sort of a less risky
rate for the same-- less

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
risk for the same rate of
return by diversification.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
you would have lower--

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:84%
you would have-- you would
have lower rate of return

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:90%
technologies in the same--

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:84%
used at the same time as higher
rate of return technologies,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
as the lower rate of
return points, have a--

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.518 align:middle line:84%
the lower rate of return
points have a lower risk,

00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and the higher rate
of return points,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:84%
you have to basically
pay a risk--

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
there's risk
premium there, which

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.567 align:middle line:84%
is why it's less desirable
or something like that.

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yep.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.792 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty good.

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
What you're
describing is correct.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:84%
There's like a mean
variability trade-off

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
here, a downward-sloping
frontier,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:84%
if you want to think
about it that way.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:84%
As you move across
different projects

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
they may have higher
and higher means,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
but they come with higher
and higher variance.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.305 align:middle line:90%
So there's a trade-off.

00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And since households
are risk-averse,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:90%
they don't like the variance.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.225 align:middle line:90%
So they pay attention to that.

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:90%
And you said this also.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:84%
You could have two technologies
with the same mean return--

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:84%
one with a higher variance
than the other one,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and they would never do
the higher variability one

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
because then there's
no trade-off.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Since they get the same
mean but higher risk,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't choose that.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:84%
There is a
diversification aspect

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that we featured quite a
bit in terms of land plots

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and how they want to
diversify, or in village India

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:84%
over crops and income
sources and so on.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
captured here in a new way,

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:90%
but it is in here.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Namely, a guess of
what technologies

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to operate overall, you can
compute the variability.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you look on the
margin about whether to add

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:90%
or subtract one more.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And you look at its variability
relative to this village

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%
average.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So if it's going to
add to diversification,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:84%
it's going to have a return
stream which is low when--

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
well, say high when the
rest of the village is low.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of the
way the diversification

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
aspect is coming out in this
mean variance framework.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:90%
But great.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:90%
That's very helpful.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.120 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:90%
So here's another one.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Explain how it can be
that while the magnitude

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
of idiosyncratic risk is
higher than the magnitude

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.760 align:middle line:84%
of aggregate risk, nevertheless
the idiosyncratic risk premium

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
is smaller than the
aggregate risk premium.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.630 align:middle line:90%
So, again, I'll take volunteers.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So is it-- so I think
it's because when

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
it comes with
idiosyncratic risk,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.260 align:middle line:84%
it's possible for the village
to distribute the returns

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:90%
amongst each other.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:90%
It's like ex-post.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, for aggregate
risk, it's like

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.240 align:middle line:84%
is risk affecting
the whole village.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And so there's not-- and so
redistribution can't really

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:84%
benefit anyone when it
comes to things that

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:90%
affect the village as a whole.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yep.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the last part,
which I didn't read out,

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
explain in words what gifts
and loans have to do with it,

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:90%
but you kind of did already.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the way they pool
away most, if not all,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:90%
of the idiosyncratic risk.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, in the
aggregate, it's common.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:90%
It's hitting everyone.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you
can't pool it away.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And this next part
is related to that.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Is there full insurance in these
Thai village economies or not?

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:90%
And to give it away a bit, not.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And, in particular,
what is it in the data

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
that is inconsistent
with full risk-sharing?

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Volunteers?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: We find
that in the data

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:90%
household consumption is still--

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
is positively correlated with
the idiosyncratic shocks.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So that shows that it's
not full risk-sharing.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
some risk-sharing

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.170 align:middle line:84%
because the coefficient
is really, really small

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.302 align:middle line:90%
compared to other coefficients.

00:08:28.302 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Right.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
Compared to the coefficients
on gifts and lending,

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
which absorbs the
bulk of the risk.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's a perfect answer.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I am so happy with this class.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy teaching
you tremendously.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:90%
It's very gratifying.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:84%
There's one more-- see
if we can get it in.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Describe one example from
Thai villages of propagation

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:84%
through networks that
would be inconsistent

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:84%
with full risk-sharing
and investment efficiency.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'm abbreviating.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So this happened at the end of
the lecture, just as a hint.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.607 align:middle line:84%
Can someone described what we
did at the end of the lecture?

00:09:12.607 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's kind of given away
here in this bullet point,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:90%
but I'll read it out anyway.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:84%
How can an individual
specific illness shock

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:84%
turn into an aggregate
village-level downturn?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Volunteers?

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I think at
the end of the class,

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.407 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about how
some of the networks--

00:09:37.407 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
how different kinds of networks
are different from each other.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure which specific
networks were being compared,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.387 align:middle line:90%
but yeah.

00:09:45.387 --> 00:09:46.595 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's true.

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So what happens,
do you recall, when

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:84%
a household gets hit with
an illness shock that

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:90%
increases its expenditure?

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Did nothing happen?

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Something?

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
You remember, or
anyone else remember?

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I remember
that the households who

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
are directly connected to
the household who got illness

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.720 align:middle line:84%
shocks would [INAUDIBLE] down
their working opportunity

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
much more than households
who are unconnected

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:90%
to those illness households.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So through the network,
households who are connected,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:84%
who are related to each
other much more maybe shock--

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
there was an actual
shock between them.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So sudden illness shocks
to these households

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
may transfer to the
aggregate village

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:90%
through the [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty good.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a bit
tricky, this question.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Because there are different
networks in the village.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of the
risk-sharing insurance network.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:90%
There's the labor network.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
There's the supply chain
production network.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:90%
And they don't coincide.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you got hit
with an illness shock,

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless, you're in this
risk-sharing insurance network,

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
then part of the-- or
almost all of the shock

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:84%
gets covered, in come the gifts,
just like we were describing

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:90%
with the production shock.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
However, when that illness
shock is not covered by gifts,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
then the household has to
respond on its own in some way.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And it does this by cutting
the number of laborers

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
that it hires,
and by shrinking--

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:84%
saving costs by shrinking
its production operations.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is what spills
over to other households

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:90%
along the production network.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So networks could
be good or bad.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Networks are good
for sharing risk,

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:84%
but they also can be bad because
they propagate contagion.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:90%
So that was--

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.260 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So if there was a
full risk-sharing, then the--

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
then there were no effect on
the employment for the household

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:90%
who did not get any shock?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Network-- I mean, network--

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:90%
that was a factor.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Those houses who did
not get any shock

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:84%
because they are more related
to the households with illness.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But if there was
full risk-sharing,

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:84%
those households will
not have any effect?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's right.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So the emphasis here is on
a very specific household

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.450 align:middle line:90%
idiosyncratic shock.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And this-- I drew an
analogy with COVID-19,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:90%
but it's a bit unfair.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Because COVID, as we know,
has a contagion effect

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:90%
literally in the health sense.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And if one person gets it,
people around that person

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:90%
get it.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So here, though, it's a
different kind of illness.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But it-- and it could be
just an elderly person

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.650 align:middle line:90%
in the household.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But still, there
are big expenses--

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:90%
double the normal expenses.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
the budget to manage,

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and they have to start either
getting a gift from someone

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:middle line:90%
or cutting.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So when they start
cutting expenses,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
that's when it spills over to
other people that they hire

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:90%
or people.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is very
reminiscent, as I

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
said in class, of what's
going on in the supply chain

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
networks in the US, for example,
and many other countries.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:02.275 align:middle line:84%
Although, that's more of a
different kind of health shock.

00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Any questions about-- any other
questions about the lecture?

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:11.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So then we come to the
lecture for today--

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:90%
ledgers and management.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a lot
in the lecture today.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I would say I'm
going to give you

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:84%
a tool to think about,
namely, financial accounts--

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
income and balance sheet
accounts, in particular.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go to
the Thai monthly data

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that we were just talking
about, and use the tool

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
to think about planning--
about wealth planning.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll take a step back
and add another account.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll motivate that account
by thinking about Bitcoin,

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:54.330 align:middle line:84%
as I promised in lecture one,
and link the ledgers of Bitcoin

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:90%
to the statement of cash flow.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And hence, back to
the Thai villages.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
In particular, I'll talk about
distributed ledgers, which

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:90%
is a big part of Bitcoin--

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin, blockchain,
and distributed ledgers.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And then having
introduced that concept,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I'll focus on the use
almost exclusively

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:84%
of paper currency
in Thailand, the use

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.900 align:middle line:84%
of almost exclusively
electronic transfers in Sweden,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and something in
between in Kenya,

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
which has two different kinds
of monies, essentially--

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:84%
privately issued e-money
from a cell phone

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
provider, and a public Fiat
money, Kenyan shillings.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll end-- and so
these three things for Thailand,

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Sweden, and Kenya
are about cash--

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
various concepts of cash
and cash management.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll come
back to the ledgers

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
again and talk about trusted
third parties, some problems

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and management
that may or may not

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
show up at the individual
level, but definitely

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:84%
show up at the wholesale
level at the level

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.650 align:middle line:90%
of financial infrastructure.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:90%
So here's a statement of income.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And forgive me if this is
a review for some of you.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
These things aren't hard,
but they're a bit tedious.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about sources of
income and uses of income.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And the sources of income,
as in the Thai data,

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
come from cultivation,
livestock, fish and shrimp.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a wage-earning
household primarily,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of livestock.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So the line entry here
is almost entirely

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.900 align:middle line:90%
from wage, labor, income.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Those are the sources.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the uses, so
to speak, or you could

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.750 align:middle line:90%
say revenues versus costs--

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:84%
you have expenses from each
of the activities-- livestock.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
If they're in debt, they
have interest expenses.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
There's that depreciation that
we talked about last time.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And then this is
charges against revenue.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to having
expenses for production,

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:90%
they might pay taxes--

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:90%
these guys don't.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:84%
But they can either
consume the rest or save.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Advantage of the
financial accounts

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:90%
is that everything balances.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
revenue is totally

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
balanced by charges
against revenue.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you're-- as we
did-- taking the Thai data

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and thinking of all the
line items then creating

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
the accounts, and if these
left- and right-hand sides

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
don't balance, we know
we something wrong.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And we have to go back and
iterate and figure out--

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
excluded a variable, or put
it in the inappropriate spot.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great
discipline device.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.660 align:middle line:84%
The balance sheet is stocks
of stuff at a point in time,

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:90%
namely, liabilities and assets.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So the obvious
liability would be

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:90%
debt, which this household has.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:84%
This is really
somebody's numbers.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a real person,
I want to remind you.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:90%
More on that momentarily.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And the debt's
about 37,000 baht.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And the assets that
the household has

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.915 align:middle line:90%
could be real or financial.

00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
The financial assets are a big
chunk of it in paper currency

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.860 align:middle line:90%
and some deposits at the bank.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And real assets, in this
case, household fixed assets.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So we went through
some examples last time

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:84%
when we talked about rates
of return, because we

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
had in the numerator
profits, which

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:84%
is on the previous account
revenue minus expenses.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.950 align:middle line:90%
And here, profits over capital.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the real
and also financial capital.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, these
things balance.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:84%
But here, there's a big
item that I deliberately

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
didn't mention at first to
get your attention, which

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
is if you take assets
minus liabilities,

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:90%
hopefully net worth is positive.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
If liabilities were
greater than assets,

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
this guy's bankrupt, at least
in the accounting sense.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So for almost all
these households,

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:84%
assets are greater
than liabilities.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And the difference is something
we call equity or net worth.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And that enters oddly
on the right-hand side

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
with liabilities, precisely
so that the two sides

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:84%
of the financial account, or
the balance sheet account,

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:90%
are equal to each other.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So now with those concepts, the
statement and balance sheet,

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:90%
would take it to an application.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is a wealth
planner, which

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:84%
we implemented to that household
and all of the other ones.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:84%
What is the household
we imagine to be doing?

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Namely, maximize discounted
expected utility.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So you've kind of seen
versions of this before.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
You saw it first with
respect to storage of seed

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:84%
and so on in the
medieval village economy.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got a finite
horizon here that happens,

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.660 align:middle line:90%
but more on that momentarily.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's discounted utility.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.260 align:middle line:84%
This is constant relative risk
aversion, with a risk averse

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:90%
coefficient of kappa.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:90%
Delta is the discount rate.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And the end of life,
which is T, they

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle line:84%
may bequest assets
to their kids.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a
similar function,

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
but there's an extra
term here, which

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:90%
is beta, almost for bequest.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And again, the notation changes
from one lecture to the next.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so that's
another parameter.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:90%
We have delta, kappa, and beta.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to figure
out what they are because they

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.940 align:middle line:90%
will impact the solution.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Subject to the big
constraint-- now,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:84%
again, you've seen a version
of this in the medieval village

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.240 align:middle line:84%
economy because we had
resources available today, which

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
they could eat or store in
two different ways, which

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:84%
would determine resources
available next period.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Here, they have
wealth today, and they

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
have resources
available today, which

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of period
stocks, their wealth,

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:90%
plus income--

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:90%
more on that momentarily.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And they can either eat
it-- and the difference

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
between what they have and
what they eat, they invest.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So some fraction, Z,
goes into risky assets,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and the residual 1 minus Z
fraction goes into safe assets.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is a lifecycle
portfolio allocation problem.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:84%
A little bit more detail
about these numbers--

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
so the income term is the
second and third term.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:84%
If gamma is equal to 1, then the
mu, which is the mean income,

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:90%
cancels out.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And this household is
entirely on its own

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:84%
with income fluctuations
around the mean.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
When gamma is equal to 0,
this whole term is gone,

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and the household
has its mean income.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So gamma here, between 0 and 1,
is capturing the risk-sharing

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that we know is prevalent
in the Thai villages.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way all that
risk-sharing stuff entered

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:90%
into the individual program.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:84%
It looks like self
insurance, but it isn't.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Because the income stream can
be attenuated due to the gifts.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But it can also vary
over households.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:84%
We have to elicit
from the households

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:90%
how big or small gamma is.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.130 align:middle line:90%
This is a premium if the--

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:59.150 align:middle line:84%
sorry-- an indemnity if
the household head dies,

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
all these village villagers
get together and contribute

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.780 align:middle line:84%
something to help the bereaved
household with expenses

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and so on. c is consumption.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Big C is committed consumption.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So these are things the
household tells us they're

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:90%
going to do no matter what.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we enter as a
particular expense.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So here is a bit of what
we show the household.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:90%
We explain to them--

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:90%
we go and interview them.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And that we have been getting
data from them all along,

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:90%
but this is extra.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So we tell them we want
to know how much they're

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
planning to give to
their kids, if anything.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Try to elicit their
current income profile

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:90%
and future movements and income.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.775 align:middle line:84%
Get their goals, and get
their current wealth.

00:22:45.775 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
going to tell them

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:84%
how much they should be
saving, and how to save it

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:90%
in risky versus safe things.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.788 align:middle line:84%
And particular, whether they
might want to be borrowing.

00:22:55.788 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't like these
little cartoon characters.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
It's an attempt to
communicate clearly.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So we don't say,
tell us everything.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
We say, let us demonstrate
to you how this works.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
We'll show you the results
of another villager.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
We asked that household
whether or not

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:84%
they want to leave
money to their kids.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:90%
And this household said, no.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:84%
My kids are going to be
much richer than I am.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
work in Bangkok.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I need to
leave anything to my children

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:90%
after my death.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So this household
said zero baht.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I made the mistake
once of having

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:84%
this interview with the
mother and the daughter

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.770 align:middle line:84%
present in the room
at the same time.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.072 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, that was awkward.

00:23:39.072 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] OK.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Collect inputs-- so we need to
calibrate this income process.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.973 align:middle line:90%
And we give, for example, Chen.

00:23:48.973 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going
to see some Thai.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, wage earners earn a
regular income of 10,000 baht.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Expects to work to age
65, and then income

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
drops to something very
small, which is a pension.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's this picture.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:84%
10,000 baht, age
65, the household's

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:90%
currently young, actually.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Drops to zero.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Or this guy--
different example--

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
has a little shop
as a business--

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:90%
very volatile income.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Expects to keep its business
running until age 60--

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:90%
currently age 25.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And then receive some small
income, again, from the kids.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Kids give money to
the parents, you guys.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.330 align:middle line:90%
You hear that?

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Depends on where you're from
whether you can relate to this.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Another example-- this household
has regular increasing income

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.050 align:middle line:90%
for 30 years.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But, again, income
starts to drop.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.050 align:middle line:84%
However, they're going to
go into a second occupation,

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:90%
and income only slowly.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So I stay-- we used to stay in
the village with the headman.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
Thailand has motels.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And you'll often see an elderly
couple running the motel.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:84%
That's now their new
business, relative to what

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.880 align:middle line:90%
they used to do, et cetera.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
three examples.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:90%
So what about goals?

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So do you expect to send
your kids to college?

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Is that a planned expense?

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Or in the future open a
business or buy a new TV?

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But what we want
are expenses they're

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:90%
going to be no matter what.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.420 align:middle line:90%
So yes or no, depending.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.940 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
example household,

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:90%
we give them car purchase.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Was that obligatory?

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:90%
Send the kids to college?

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:90%
How many years away?

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:90%
15 years-- kids are young.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to cost
$10,000 for three years--

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:90%
30,000 baht.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
That's about-- it's a lot
less than US expenses.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not an MIT tuition.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:90%
So now we have wealth, so w.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.010 align:middle line:90%
This is tricky.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Money available to save
or spend or invest.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a car
that's worth 10,000 baht.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:84%
You think-- it's used, but
you could sell it easily.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Then we would count that as
a household asset or business

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.710 align:middle line:90%
asset-- could be sold.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:84%
If they own land
worth 100,000 baht,

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:84%
they may never plan to
sell it, and may not even

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:90%
be productive land.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So we don't count it
unless they said it was.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
If it's productive, we want
to avoid double counting.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:90%
So here's the thing.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:84%
You would count
the asset, or you

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:90%
would count the return stream.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.775 align:middle line:90%
You cannot count both.

00:26:36.775 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:84%
The value of land should be the
discounted capitalized value

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:90%
of net profits from farming.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.380 align:middle line:84%
That's how much
the land is worth.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to count
both the land as an asset,

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and also ask the households
about the income stream.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So generally, we
don't count assets

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.050 align:middle line:84%
that we are using in calculating
the income stream unless they

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:84%
say, I'm going to stop
farming at a certain date.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And how much would the
land be worth then?

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
If we count income up to that
point, then we count the land.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:90%
So let's run the planner.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you examples.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
We created an Excel
spreadsheet with the answers

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to all the
household's questions,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and then enter it into
the computer and run it.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not showing you all of them.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:84%
The second household--
we told this household

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:84%
to cut its expenses on
consumption quite a bit.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:84%
They weren't saving enough,
and to put almost all of it

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.090 align:middle line:90%
in safe assets.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.370 align:middle line:84%
More interesting is
the life cycle picture.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So here's what the
planner recommends

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that the household should do.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Namely, let's start down here.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.050 align:middle line:90%
We've got income in red.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the elicited
profile over time

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:90%
that I just told you about.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:84%
The consumption is endogenous
variable, obviously.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:90%
It's in black.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So here, we told the household
to cut its consumption

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:02.450 align:middle line:84%
expenditure a lot and much
lower than its current income

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:90%
in order to build up the assets.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So here's the total
level of assets.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And then when income drops
to little or nothing,

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:90%
they eat off the assets.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
saving for retirement.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Most of it's in safe assets,
not so much in risky,

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:90%
and there's no borrowing.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Another household basically
had committed consumption

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:84%
that is going to get
it in big trouble,

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:84%
even though they said they were
going to do it no matter what.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:84%
When we ran the
planner at the time

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that they have
this high expense--

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it was for starting a
business-- they really didn't

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:90%
have the resources to cover it.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, they try to
increase their savings

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:47.930 align:middle line:90%
with income over consumption.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
But in this median simulation
scenario, it's just not enough.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So when that big expense
comes, on average, they

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:90%
use up all of their assets.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Consumption isn't
dropping to zero.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.070 align:middle line:84%
You remember, it's constant
relative risk aversion.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So marginal utility
of consumption at zero

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:90%
is infinite.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Although, you can't see
this, but we gave them

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.000 align:middle line:90%
some subsistence bundle.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So they don't
really go bankrupt.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:90%
They survive.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, they don't die
when they go bankrupt.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.080 align:middle line:84%
They continue to survive because
of that subsistence bundle.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:90%
What else is going on here?

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.710 align:middle line:90%
They kind of know in advance--

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.550 align:middle line:84%
the planner knows-- state
by state, year by year

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:90%
that they're in trouble.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So actually, they
start borrowing.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, given our
subsistence consumption rule,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.050 align:middle line:84%
if the median scenario
occurs, they're

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.550 align:middle line:90%
not going to pay back the loan.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.190 align:middle line:84%
They get to default on the
loan, and they know that.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Call this gambling
for redemption.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
do risky things too,

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and borrowing, leveraging
up, with the idea

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.860 align:middle line:84%
that there's a good chance
they're not going to make it.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Here, the planner
is not the bank.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Whether the bank would make
this loan is another issue.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they
survive this episode

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and continue to live another day
with their fluctuating income.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So the rest of this looks
like the other diagram

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:90%
to some extent.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:14.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So we show the households
these pictures,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and try to explain to
them what's going on.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds
of households in the data.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, in fact,
are very conservative,

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and they have fluctuations
in income and consumption.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Consumption is never more than
the lowest possible income

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:84%
draw, and mostly, a lot
lower than their income draw.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're saving like
crazy, and their net worth

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.910 align:middle line:90%
is growing at 20% per year.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Sounds good to me, by the way.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But they're probably
over-saving.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.080 align:middle line:84%
But we're very conservative
about what we tell them.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't tell them
that that's bad.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:84%
That's fine if they
want to do that.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the ones who
are eating too much

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and not saving that
we're more worried about.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:57.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So this looks like
Thai villages,

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:02.690 align:middle line:84%
but the life cycle
model is universal.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And just to shift gears, this
is Larry Kotlikoff's website.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:84%
He's both a professor
and an entrepreneur.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So he is selling this
product, this ESB planner.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But he has a lot of great
economic research on life cycle

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:90%
planning.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And no one wants to
splurge today and starve

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.340 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow, nor the opposite.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Lifecycle consumption-smoothing
balances our goals.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would think,
could everyone do that?

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.430 align:middle line:84%
There's only two companies I
know of in the US that do this.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's not Vanguard.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not Fidelity.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.650 align:middle line:84%
They're adopting kind
of a rule of thumb.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:84%
They ask you what's
your current expenses?

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And then say 70% of that
is target for retirement.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And then how much do you have
to save to make that goal?

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And so consumption could be low
because you're saving a lot.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And that can end up in a
very imbalanced profile

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:08.540 align:middle line:84%
in which you're starving today
in order to splurge tomorrow.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, we're using this
strictly concave utility,

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and so is Larry, to say we
want to smooth over time.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Just like we want to
smooth over bad shocks,

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
we want to smooth over time,
as in the medieval village seed

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So let me make a transition
then to the other account, which

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:32.660 align:middle line:90%
is cash flow.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do this
by explaining a little bit

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:84%
about Bitcoin, and many of
you probably know about this

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:38.910 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So every transection in Bitcoin
is an encoded message sent out

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.020 align:middle line:84%
with a-- generated with a
private/public key scheme,

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:84%
which has the advantage
that it's known

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:90%
which node sent the message.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's full
commitment to the message.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.160 align:middle line:84%
You can't go back and
deny that you sent it.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:90%
And it prevents fraud.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can transact on
your ID because nobody else

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.440 align:middle line:84%
has the private key,
unless you get careless.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So a transection in
Bitcoin is the moving

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:84%
of the coin from one
person to another.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The message sent
might be, I want

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.580 align:middle line:84%
to give the coin to
person X. Arguably,

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:84%
because person X is a merchant
and you're buying something

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
The various transactions are
accumulated into a block,

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and the block is subject to a
validation routine, which is

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.600 align:middle line:90%
mining and it's quite costly.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll come back to that later.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:84%
The point here is
that Bitcoin is

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:90%
combining two different things.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.100 align:middle line:84%
One is the statement
of cash flow

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:48.320 align:middle line:84%
as the coin moves from out or
in to the person in question.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And the other is
the balance sheet,

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:55.250 align:middle line:84%
which is at a moment in time
how many coins do you own?

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So the accounting of the
cash flow works for Bitcoin.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It also works for paper
currency in Thailand.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.745 align:middle line:84%
So let me show you a
statement of cash flow

00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:90%
as an accounting statement.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Remember, before, I showed
you income and balance sheet.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I haven't shown you the cash
flow statement until now.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.520 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty small print.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Let me just give you
the big picture here.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.940 align:middle line:84%
We have cash flow
from production,

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.360 align:middle line:84%
which you can
imagine, if you sold

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.600 align:middle line:84%
something in got paper
currency as a consequence,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.040 align:middle line:90%
you'd have a plus.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:84%
If you're buying fertilizer
to grow the rice,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.639 align:middle line:90%
you have a minus sign.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have inflows and outflows
associated with production.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.090 align:middle line:84%
You can spend money
on consumption.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.409 align:middle line:90%
That's typically an outflow.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
You can spend money
on investment, also

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.800 align:middle line:90%
typically an outflow.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So we have cash flow from
consumption and investment,

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:84%
and then we have cash
flow from financing,

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:49.580 align:middle line:84%
which is, you can put cash
in the bank as a deposit,

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.050 align:middle line:90%
or you could borrow cash.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, you get
it as an inflow,

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.420 align:middle line:90%
through gifts and so on.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So cash flow from production,
consumption, and financing

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:90%
are the three categories.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And this stuff up
here is complicated.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:84%
When I said I'd shown you
the income statement, but not

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:84%
the cash flow statement, you
may have been thinking, well,

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.550 align:middle line:90%
aren't they the same?

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, well, they
could be, but not necessarily.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a business, and
you sell something and the guy

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.530 align:middle line:84%
doesn't pay you, then
he's going to pay later,

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that's an account receivable,
but there's no cash.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So the sale would
count as revenue

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.690 align:middle line:84%
in the income statement
using the accrued

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.520 align:middle line:84%
notion of accounting,
but it would not

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.090 align:middle line:90%
count as a cash inflow.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So oddly enough,
this top stuff here

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.490 align:middle line:84%
is just starting with
the income statement

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and making adjustments
to it according

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.140 align:middle line:84%
to whether the
movement of cash you

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:84%
have to adjust one
way or the other.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, if you have
an account receivable,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't get
the cash, then you

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.260 align:middle line:84%
have to subtract off
from accrued income

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.630 align:middle line:84%
to get the cash
flow because you're

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.700 align:middle line:84%
counting something that
is not yet associated

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.510 align:middle line:90%
with the cash inflow.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.010 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Mainly, I'm just trying to
give you the big picture here.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the statement
of cash flow.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And it is true, and this is
automatically true in Bitcoin,

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
that you can check whether the
change in cash holdings that

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.060 align:middle line:84%
come at the bottom line of
the statement of cash flow

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.720 align:middle line:84%
are exactly equal or not
to the change in cash

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have on
the balance sheet.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have cash in
a moment in time,

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and then you have these
inflows and outflows.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.210 align:middle line:84%
You have cash in
a future period.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.610 align:middle line:84%
In each of those periods
now and in the future,

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:29.850 align:middle line:90%
you have two balance sheets.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Take the difference in
the balance sheet, that's

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.350 align:middle line:84%
the change in the cash
flow on the balance sheet,

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and it should be
exactly equal to what's

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.170 align:middle line:84%
showing up here in the cash
flow from the statement of cash

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:90%
flow.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So we run a check
on the Thai data.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And, again, if we're making a
mistake these are not equal,

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:90%
and that's a big guide to us.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I should save this
for later, but I

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:53.570 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that no
top US survey does this.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Not the Survey of Consumer
Finances, not the PSID.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.130 align:middle line:84%
They did not gather
variables and check

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:84%
what they gathered against
these comprehensive statements

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:90%
of integrated accounts.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:90%
And Bitcoin is automatic.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you either have it in
your account and you spend it,

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.210 align:middle line:84%
or you don't spend it and
it's still in the account.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of the
unspoken advantage of Bitcoin.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:23.600 align:middle line:84%
There is something that people
talk about a lot on Bitcoin

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and that is consensus.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So I keep giving this
example in Bitcoin

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that Bob wants to
transfer a coin to Alice.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:84%
We have both Alice's
accounts and Bob's account.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And what Bob gives up
is what Alice gets.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So the accounts have to be
consistent with each other

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.610 align:middle line:90%
across the households.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.620 align:middle line:90%
And that is true in Bitcoin.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.080 align:middle line:84%
But it is not--
well, and again, this

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.480 align:middle line:84%
is a bit technical for
now, but the whole thing

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:84%
about the mining and the
validation of the transactions

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
in Bitcoin is to precisely
be assured that Bob is not

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.740 align:middle line:90%
double-spending the coin.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.983 align:middle line:90%
You can't spend it twice.

00:38:06.983 --> 00:38:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of
figured out a way

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:84%
to do that-- a very
ingenious way to do that.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the concept of
reconciliation and validation

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.290 align:middle line:84%
could be taken to accounting
in the Thai villages,

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.260 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that we
really did try to measure

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:23.590 align:middle line:90%
all the transactions.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And when a household says that
it bought something with cash,

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.160 align:middle line:84%
if the person they bought
it from is in the village,

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
then that person
should get the cash,

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:84%
while the person in
question is giving it up.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So it should appear twice, both
in the accounts of the person

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.720 align:middle line:84%
buying and the accounts
of the person selling.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So with one of your
former classmates,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:84%
who was a student in this class
about two years ago, Chad,

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:90%
we set out--

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.760 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to help
on these projects.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.320 align:middle line:90%
He was an RA.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.293 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not pushing that
hard, but if any of you

00:38:55.293 --> 00:38:56.460 align:middle line:90%
are interested, let me know.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
interesting stuff to do.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So Chad was very interested,
so here's what he did.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:84%
He looked literally to
see whether what shows up

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.200 align:middle line:84%
in one person's account
is also showing up

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.240 align:middle line:90%
in the other one or not.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And these are some
of the details

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:84%
of going through and doing
that as an algorithm.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:15.480 align:middle line:90%
He created these accounts.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.700 align:middle line:84%
He checks to see
if it's reported.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.980 align:middle line:90%
If not, et cetera, et cetera.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, right in the
middle of this slide

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.900 align:middle line:84%
it jumps from
Thailand and the thing

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.860 align:middle line:84%
that Chad was doing to a very
different application, which is

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.150 align:middle line:90%
the stock market in Australia.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So the stock market
in Australia is

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:84%
about to run on distributed
ledgers the way Bitcoin does.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Not using Bitcoin,
but using the ledgers.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is when
someone owns the stock,

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
buyer and a seller,

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.730 align:middle line:84%
the traditional legacy system
is that they enter into a deal.

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And then only after a
day, or maybe three,

00:39:54.900 --> 00:40:00.420 align:middle line:84%
the process of reconciliation
kicks in and then they settle.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So the trade of the stocks is
separate from the settlement

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.500 align:middle line:90%
of the stocks.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, there's
often huge discrepancies.

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.570 align:middle line:84%
For one thing,
prices have moved.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So a household could
claim, I didn't buy it.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And in the New York
financial markets,

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:20.300 align:middle line:84%
there was an attempt to provide
this in the repo market.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Because every day in
the US repo market

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.460 align:middle line:84%
with treasuries and so
on, they spend two hours

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.820 align:middle line:84%
at the end of each day
after the end of trading

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.470 align:middle line:90%
trying to reconcile accounts.

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:35.690 align:middle line:84%
State Street Bank here in Boston
is a big third-party broker

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.420 align:middle line:84%
for people that hold
accounts, and it does

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.950 align:middle line:90%
this kind of reconciliation.

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:43.670 align:middle line:84%
It's quite costly and
quite time-consuming.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you're entering these
trades onto the ledgers,

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.660 align:middle line:84%
there's instantaneous
reconciliation.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they could settle
right away if they wanted to.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.630 align:middle line:84%
The decision to not pay for
it is a credit decision.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.300 align:middle line:84%
They're not forced to
settle immediately.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But in principle,
trade and settlement

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.850 align:middle line:84%
can happen at exactly
the same time all

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.400 align:middle line:90%
through the distributed ledgers.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And the one in Australia
is able to process

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.730 align:middle line:90%
115 million daily trades.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:18.650 align:middle line:84%
It's 6,300 trades per second
continuously over five hours.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:22.370 align:middle line:84%
That well exceeds the
volume in Bitcoin.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin is not capable of doing
this because of the mining.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.950 align:middle line:84%
But these other
ledger technologies

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.750 align:middle line:84%
are a lot faster
and a lot cheaper.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's come back
to the village

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and think about how an
individual household is

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.150 align:middle line:90%
managing its currency.

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Let me back up for a second.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.710 align:middle line:84%
That seemed like an
abrupt transition.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I featured in lecture one that
we will say a lot about Bitcoin

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and cryptocurrencies,
and it's spread out

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.590 align:middle line:90%
throughout the lectures.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So Bitcoin, blockchain,
and distributed ledgers--

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.020 align:middle line:84%
it's the first time
it really came up.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.640 align:middle line:90%
And I started with a ledger.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about financial accounts,

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.990 align:middle line:84%
that's why I started
to bring in Bitcoin.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And we will revisit
Bitcoin in other lectures

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.890 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about monetary
economics and so on.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:10.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So now, back to paper
currency management.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I say paper currency just
to constantly remind myself

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.490 align:middle line:90%
that cash is kind of ambiguous.

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.550 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about cash in the
US you mean, currency, yeah.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.520 align:middle line:84%
But also, demand deposits
and other variables,

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.500 align:middle line:90%
like maybe even debit cards.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But in Thailand,
it's paper currency.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:30.560 align:middle line:90%
They love it.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.030 align:middle line:90%
That's what they use.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:33.900 align:middle line:90%
We're on that momentarily.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to, in notation,
describe a Miller/Orr model--

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.360 align:middle line:84%
the management of
cash for firms,

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.490 align:middle line:84%
for business firms,
which do not have

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:45.500 align:middle line:90%
regular nor predictable flows.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And the result solving the
model is rather intuitive.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:51.950 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be bounds.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So cash holdings
can drift around.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But when they go
above an upper bound,

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:84%
it's time to make an adjustment
and deposit the paper

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.600 align:middle line:90%
in the bank, or lend it out.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.515 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, when it
goes below a lower bound,

00:43:05.515 --> 00:43:06.890 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
have to withdraw

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:08.900 align:middle line:90%
money or call in a loan.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes that lower
bound is zero, obviously.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.360 align:middle line:84%
You can't run out of
stock of something.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It can't go negative.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be what
the solution looks like.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So let me introduce a little
bit of notation, e being

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:28.850 align:middle line:84%
expenditure outflows of paper
currency, which looks like c.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically
more than consumption.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.860 align:middle line:84%
It's all expenses out, and
then y being stuff coming in.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So expenditure is outflows
minus inflows, which

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.930 align:middle line:90%
could be positive or negative.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So we postulate a
stochastic process

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:50.990 align:middle line:84%
for the cash flows,
expenditure flows, and estimate

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:52.370 align:middle line:90%
in the Thai data.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:84%
We postulate that
mostly things are

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.990 align:middle line:90%
pretty smooth and predictable.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Delta refers to the length
of the time interval.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's easier conceptually to
think of delta as equal to 1.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So with roughly
probability 1/2, they're

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.880 align:middle line:84%
going to have an
expenditure of c,

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.660 align:middle line:84%
but it could be a higher
order of magnitude, sigma.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Or with residual
probability roughly 1/2,

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.700 align:middle line:90%
it's c minus sigma.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So these are the ups and
downs of expenditures--

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.970 align:middle line:90%
probabilistic basis.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.850 align:middle line:84%
How big or small depends
on how big sigma is.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And I keep saying
roughly probability 1/2,

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:35.930 align:middle line:84%
because there are these
zapper things that are very

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:38.630 align:middle line:90%
large inflows and outflows.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:90%
So expenditure is an outflow.

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So positive zapper, Zp, is a
very large expenditure that

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.810 align:middle line:90%
happens with probability kappa.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Again, say delta equal 1.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.390 align:middle line:84%
So this could be like
2% or 3% of the time,

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.310 align:middle line:84%
there is an outflow
which is more

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.590 align:middle line:84%
than two standard
deviations away

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.560 align:middle line:90%
from the mean positive outflow.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be an inflow.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So these are rare
revenues coming

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.210 align:middle line:84%
in with different kappas
and different Zs, which

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.950 align:middle line:90%
will be estimated in the data.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And these shocks-- you
take the probability

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.280 align:middle line:84%
of the positive
outflow, the probability

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.870 align:middle line:84%
of the negative outflow add
them together, delta, say,

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.460 align:middle line:90%
is still equal to 1.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So with probability
1, something happens.

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:33.990 align:middle line:84%
With probability 1 minus
the sum of those kappas,

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.880 align:middle line:90%
you're in this middle branch.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the 1/2
adjusted up or down.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.270 align:middle line:84%
As always, I'm assuming
you will interrupt me

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.930 align:middle line:90%
if things are not clear.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:44.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's think about
how much cash they

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.790 align:middle line:90%
have in house that's paper.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So they have a certain amount
of cash in a moment in time.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.660 align:middle line:84%
They have an expenditure
outflow, which

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.060 align:middle line:90%
could be positive or negative.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're at t,
and we're going

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.540 align:middle line:84%
to try to do the accounting
for how much money they would

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.940 align:middle line:84%
have at t plus delta,
where again, delta

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.920 align:middle line:90%
could be equal to 1.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Money at t less outflows,
and then they could adjust.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.100 align:middle line:84%
They could either withdraw
money or deposit it.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So these two things the
w and d is endogenous.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And the model is going to
have to solve for w and d,

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:30.360 align:middle line:84%
when to do it, as I was
saying, and how much to do.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And that will result in
this endogenously determined

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.210 align:middle line:90%
statement of cash flow.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.550 align:middle line:84%
You can think about this
like life cycle planning,

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:41.730 align:middle line:84%
except now it's
not over 50 years.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:45.990 align:middle line:84%
It may be a matter of a
couple of weeks or 30 days.

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:48.240 align:middle line:84%
In the data, it's 30
days because that's

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.200 align:middle line:90%
when we get the data.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.730 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
minimize costs.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's two costs.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.140 align:middle line:84%
One is kind of obvious,
really, for economists,

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:00.670 align:middle line:84%
which is if you're holding cash
and it doesn't earn interest,

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.980 align:middle line:84%
you've lost the interest
you could have earned if you

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.810 align:middle line:90%
had deposited it in the bank.

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's a real cost
to the household.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:09.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the opportunity
cost to the household.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to let the
interest rate in the bank

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.320 align:middle line:84%
be capital R. If you
hold too much cash,

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.140 align:middle line:84%
you're giving up a lot
of foregone interest.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:18.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a cost.

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.560 align:middle line:84%
There's also a physical
adjustment cost

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:25.040 align:middle line:84%
to get to the bank, which you
can think of as the hassle,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.350 align:middle line:84%
or in these villages you've
got to get in your truck

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and drive to the village,
to the town, et cetera.

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So that should have
had the notation here,

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:90%
but it's a little b.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:37.140 align:middle line:84%
You'll see a little
b momentarily.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.170 align:middle line:90%
So the next slide-- don't panic.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to walk you
through the value function.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It looks pretty
intense at first.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:50.420 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting here with a
certain amount of money, m,

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and then deciding
whether they want

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:58.640 align:middle line:84%
to stay put and carry m into
the second period or adjust.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, if m is already
negative, they're in trouble.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Can't go negative, so
they have to adjust.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And you get this cost,
b, which is gone.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.450 align:middle line:84%
This cost function
is not utility.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not net profits.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:17.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a cost, and they're
trying to minimize the cost.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is enters positively
because it's a cost.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.180 align:middle line:84%
They've gone to all the
costs, to getting to the bank,

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:24.890 align:middle line:84%
they get to make an
adjustment, which

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.780 align:middle line:84%
means they can choose a
new m prime going out.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll try to minimize
the value from that point

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.020 align:middle line:90%
on by that choice of m prime--

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.960 align:middle line:84%
minimize the cost
from that point on.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Here, m is positive,
but they still

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:43.770 align:middle line:84%
get to choose whether
to adjust or not.

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't
adjust, they keep it.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.710 align:middle line:84%
They suffer the
opportunity cost,

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:50.360 align:middle line:90%
the lost interest in the bank.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll have their
value function tomorrow,

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.730 align:middle line:90%
which is discounted by little r.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:57.920 align:middle line:90%
That's like a discount rate.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And things next
period are stochastic.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So you take expectations
over the future e values

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.990 align:middle line:84%
following that
stochastic process.

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is v of m minus
e is all expectation,

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.880 align:middle line:84%
is all written down here in
terms of these branches, which

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:19.400 align:middle line:84%
is positive zappers, negative
zappers, ups and downs, roughly

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.260 align:middle line:90%
probability 1/2, et cetera.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the expected
cost in the future

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.280 align:middle line:84%
if you don't make a
monetary adjustment today.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
second or third time

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.440 align:middle line:84%
you've seen these
value functions.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I introduced them at the
end of the medieval village

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.730 align:middle line:90%
dynamic programming problem.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.930 align:middle line:84%
We then used that last class
to talk about implications

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:45.015 align:middle line:84%
of risk sharing for production,
with the planner's value

00:49:45.015 --> 00:49:45.515 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:46.920 align:middle line:90%
This is the third time.

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the value function for a
household minimizing its costs.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.970 align:middle line:84%
More fun-- let me show
you some pictures.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:57.050 align:middle line:90%
So these are real live people.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the cash flow
of this house-- the cash

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.760 align:middle line:90%
holdings of this household.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Up and up and up
and up she goes.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.460 align:middle line:84%
This one also had a
trend, and then boom,

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:12.050 align:middle line:84%
down, and then to zero,
and then back up again.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.760 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it very well.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:16.220 align:middle line:90%
The pictures are too small.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But what's plotted over here are
net cash inflows or outflows,

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:26.600 align:middle line:84%
along with, say, a deposit
when you have a net inflow,

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.330 align:middle line:84%
or a withdrawal when
you have a net outflow.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's three lines
here, and sometimes

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.870 align:middle line:84%
things correspond the
way I was just implying.

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:39.440 align:middle line:84%
You're short, so you
withdraw, et cetera.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But when-- you
can't see much here,

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:43.550 align:middle line:84%
but when you integrate
it out and look

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.680 align:middle line:84%
at the consequence
for the levels

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.120 align:middle line:84%
using this flow equation,
then you can see what

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.942 align:middle line:90%
their stocks are.

00:50:51.942 --> 00:50:53.150 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a lot of money.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.150 align:middle line:90%
It is going to be unbelievable--

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.010 align:middle line:84%
unbelievable in
the sense of three

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:01.650 align:middle line:84%
years research running to try
to understand this pattern.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So how much money does
a typical household

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:07.370 align:middle line:84%
have-- currency, paper,
squirreled away in the house?

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:11.180 align:middle line:84%
In the rural villages
that we were looking at,

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:15.050 align:middle line:84%
roughly 32 months
worth of consumption.

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:16.670 align:middle line:90%
What's in your wallet?

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:18.800 align:middle line:90%
You're going to say credit card.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.540 align:middle line:84%
These guys-- it's
not in a wallet.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.810 align:middle line:84%
It's in the house or
hidden in the backyard.

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Almost three years worth
of expenditures in cash--

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.360 align:middle line:90%
cash equivalent consumption.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.450 align:middle line:84%
We measure the consumption
for each household,

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and we see how much
cash they have,

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.960 align:middle line:90%
which we measured in the data.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.630 align:middle line:90%
32 months-- it's unbelievable.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And we also get
deposits and withdrawals

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:42.770 align:middle line:90%
measured in the data.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:44.450 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of
detail to absorb.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you what's
going on in the model.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.660 align:middle line:90%
We estimate the cash flow.

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:54.530 align:middle line:84%
We recover all the
parameters that we need,

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.920 align:middle line:84%
take a stand on the
interest rate in the bank,

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and then look at how small
or big the cost would be.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:05.060 align:middle line:90%
b is varying down here.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And the consequences for
currency, especially but also

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.360 align:middle line:90%
withdrawals and deposits.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So taking the reality to be
the calibrated expenditure

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.840 align:middle line:84%
flows we see in the data, along
with the few other reasonable

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.660 align:middle line:84%
assumptions, I assure
you we can look

00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.150 align:middle line:84%
at how much cash they
should be holding relative

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:26.140 align:middle line:90%
to consumption.

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.910 align:middle line:90%
That's this blue line.

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And we can barely
get it up to three.

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:35.150 align:middle line:90%
The number in the data is 32.

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could imagine
increasing those costs

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.690 align:middle line:90%
and decreasing the interest.

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is like asymptoting
out to something flat.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.590 align:middle line:84%
So you end up with
something ridiculous.

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:50.150 align:middle line:90%
The model isn't working.

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:53.275 align:middle line:84%
You don't go to the bank
and forego two years

00:52:53.275 --> 00:52:54.650 align:middle line:84%
worth of consumption
while you're

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:57.110 align:middle line:90%
doing your banking transection.

00:52:57.110 --> 00:52:59.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just not a
reasonable value.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.510 align:middle line:90%
The sign makes sense.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:06.140 align:middle line:84%
The higher the cost,
b, of going to the bank

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.750 align:middle line:84%
to either withdraw or deposit,
the less you're going to do it.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So when you do it, the
transactions are bigger.

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:15.515 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, you're
holding more cash.

00:53:15.515 --> 00:53:19.700 align:middle line:84%
If b goes to infinity,
then it's all in cash.

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.008 align:middle line:90%
Forget the bank.

00:53:21.008 --> 00:53:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
rarely, then you have

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.510 align:middle line:90%
to make up a big difference.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
frequency, which again,

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:29.540 align:middle line:84%
as b goes up, the frequency
of going to the bank

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.010 align:middle line:90%
is going down.

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Question-- so because we
did that life cycle planner,

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:40.760 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to evaluate as a
randomized controlled trial

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.730 align:middle line:84%
how well or poorly it was
working, and in the process,

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:48.170 align:middle line:84%
we gathered monthly data
for the urban household.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're not in
villages anymore.

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:53.780 align:middle line:84%
We're in towns or even
city neighborhoods.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.110 align:middle line:84%
In each of the four
provinces, we basically

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:59.910 align:middle line:84%
replicated all the
existing surveys.

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So the same questions
are being asked.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of
buried here, but if you

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:08.420 align:middle line:84%
look at the normalized cash
in terms of consumption

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:12.800 align:middle line:84%
for the urban sample,
and look over here,

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.280 align:middle line:90%
we got a number of 3.87--

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.420 align:middle line:90%
much closer to 3.

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Nothing like the 37.

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, I should
be over here at the median.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:23.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's 1.94.

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But when we do some
adjustments in the data,

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy to tell
you about them.

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.660 align:middle line:84%
That's within
reach of the model.

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:37.360 align:middle line:84%
We calibrate the model again
using the cash statistics--

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.240 align:middle line:84%
the zapping, big
shock, small shock,

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.640 align:middle line:84%
how often they happen,
et cetera et cetera,

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.350 align:middle line:90%
and get a model prediction.

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And the implied
value, m, depending

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:50.740 align:middle line:84%
on whether you use the
mean or the median,

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:55.330 align:middle line:84%
is something like 2,
which is close to what

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:56.990 align:middle line:90%
we're getting in the data.

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So now we're in
kind of business,

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:02.170 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that a reasonable
economic model is actually

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:05.230 align:middle line:84%
predicting pretty well how
much cash they're holding.

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, in the rural
data it was a disaster.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.950 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get close.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So now we switch into how
can we understand the error

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:18.580 align:middle line:84%
that the households are making
with their cash management?

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And the guess is--

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.190 align:middle line:90%
several guesses.

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Some turned out to be
correct and some not.

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So why would cash
holdings be so much lower

00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:29.800 align:middle line:84%
in the urban area relative
to the rural area?

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Is it because households
in the urban survey deposit

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.990 align:middle line:90%
more often in larger amounts?

00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Or is it because they withdraw
in the urban areas less

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:40.790 align:middle line:90%
and withdraw smaller amounts?

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So for deposits, it turns out
households in the rural area

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:49.020 align:middle line:84%
deposit more and not less, and
they deposit larger amounts.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is exactly
the opposite of what

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.280 align:middle line:84%
we would have predicted because
the cash is going into the bank

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.360 align:middle line:90%
or into the local money market.

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.480 align:middle line:84%
However, for
withdrawals, it works

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.610 align:middle line:84%
the way we would
have conjectured,

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that when urban households
put money in the bank

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.720 align:middle line:84%
they don't withdraw
it very often,

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.760 align:middle line:90%
and they withdraw a lot less.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.940 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like
they're putting their proxy

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:11.710 align:middle line:90%
for their salary into the bank.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And any other money which they
have, from business and so on,

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.200 align:middle line:84%
goes into the bank
and stays there.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.960 align:middle line:84%
They just withdraw what
they need for consumption,

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.990 align:middle line:84%
taking a, quote unquote,
salary equivalent out

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:24.440 align:middle line:90%
and leaving the rest in.

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is why their
money value's a lot lower.

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:32.290 align:middle line:84%
There's still something to fix,
which just like in life cycle

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:36.790 align:middle line:84%
planner, we could create from
the research cash flow app

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and put it on the phone and tell
households how to manage it.

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the
question is, why are they

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:44.410 align:middle line:90%
having cash at all?

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they just put
it on their cell phone?

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:49.130 align:middle line:90%
And that brings us to--

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.630 align:middle line:90%
oh.

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And the costs of
mismanagement of currency

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.530 align:middle line:84%
are very high--
something like 9 and 1/2%

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:58.510 align:middle line:90%
of monthly consumption.

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.760 align:middle line:90%
That's huge in economics.

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Say, exaggerate a bit--

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:04.630 align:middle line:90%
10, or call it 5 if you want.

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:08.170 align:middle line:84%
5% of monthly consumption
could be saved or used

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:11.600 align:middle line:84%
for consumption if they just
managed their currency better.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.300 align:middle line:90%
So one way to put this--

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.800 align:middle line:84%
enormous cost of
mismanagement of petty cash.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Businesses get cash
advisory services.

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:22.340 align:middle line:90%
They pay for it.

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Why should these poor
households not have access

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.950 align:middle line:90%
to better management tools?

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:27.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:29.680 align:middle line:90%
That's my view.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Go to Sweden.

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:34.750 align:middle line:84%
How much paper currency
are they using?

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Close to nothing.

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.360 align:middle line:90%
They're gone-- it's gone.

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:43.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the amount of currency
relative to GDP ever-declining.

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:46.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the absolute
level of cash,

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:50.180 align:middle line:84%
going down in an absolute
not only relative basis.

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So I got this and this
slide from the governor

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.230 align:middle line:90%
of the Riksbank in Sweden.

00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know whether you
will appreciate the humor here.

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But this is a
picture of a stone.

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So economists and others
have written books

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:07.720 align:middle line:84%
about the first coins,
the first use of cash,

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and there were claims on
stones that were buried

00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:11.440 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the lake.

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So now in Sweden, they're
transferring the stone around

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:15.550 align:middle line:90%
on their cell phone.

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, not really.

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It's Swish, basically.

00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:22.630 align:middle line:84%
They have a bank account,
and for no money at all

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:26.810 align:middle line:84%
households can transfer cash
to each other, buy things,

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:27.800 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's replaced
the paper currency.

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a bit of a
concern for them, which

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:34.900 align:middle line:84%
is why they're thinking
if there's no paper

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.300 align:middle line:84%
currency other than
reserves, there's

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.090 align:middle line:90%
no role for the central bank.

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So they feel they should
be providing a payment

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.280 align:middle line:90%
service as a backup.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to create,
almost surely, a central bank

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:49.910 align:middle line:90%
digital currency.

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So households will
have digital accounts

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.810 align:middle line:84%
in the central bank, which is
what South Africa is doing.

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.810 align:middle line:84%
China has a different
version of it and so on.

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:01.060 align:middle line:90%
This happened in the Bahamas.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.580 align:middle line:84%
They created something
called the Sand Dollar.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The virus is
accelerating this problem

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:08.050 align:middle line:84%
because people need
government aid,

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:09.730 align:middle line:90%
and they can't get the aid--

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:11.740 align:middle line:84%
truck the paper
currency over there.

00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:15.280 align:middle line:84%
When this disastrous Hurricane
Dorian destroyed an island

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.590 align:middle line:84%
in the Bahamas, they couldn't
get emergency assistance.

00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So these are things that are
happening all over the world

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:22.120 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.610 align:middle line:90%
This last slide is Kenya.

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned they have
two kinds of currency.

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:30.750 align:middle line:84%
One is Kenyan shillings--
used to be a British colony.

00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And the other is
e-credits at Safaricom,

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:36.330 align:middle line:90%
which is a cell phone provider.

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you
take your shillings,

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.640 align:middle line:90%
you go to this Safaricom agent.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:45.030 align:middle line:84%
You give him your
Fiat money, and you

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:48.690 align:middle line:84%
get credited cell
accounts called M-Pesa.

00:59:48.690 --> 00:59:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you can use
that to give to your mom

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:54.540 align:middle line:84%
back in the village, who
goes to the agent there

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and transfers it back
out into shillings,

00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.960 align:middle line:90%
or you can buy stuff.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So here you see the use
of the paper currency,

01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:06.840 align:middle line:84%
but also this e-currency,
which is created by Safaricom.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And it has reached
almost everybody.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Some economies try to do this.

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:12.330 align:middle line:90%
We kind of tried in Thailand.

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:14.340 align:middle line:90%
I have not yet succeeded.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.760 align:middle line:84%
In Kenya, even the
lowest income quartile--

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.890 align:middle line:90%
we need to update this graph.

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Tavneet Suri did this.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Roughly, 85% of the
low-income population,

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and a similar, higher number
for those with no bank accounts,

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:31.860 align:middle line:90%
are using Safaricom.

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.610 align:middle line:84%
With no bank accounts--
in other words,

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
you don't need the traditional
legacy infrastructure.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, the allure,
the so-called disintermediation

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
that the fintechs are
bringing to the world.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the commercial
bankers don't like it much.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.900 align:middle line:90%
We talked about risk-sharing.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And Tavneet and her
co-author, Billy Jack,

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
looked at how much consumption
is being smooth in Kenya,

01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:00.840 align:middle line:84%
comparing households
who have not yet

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
gotten early on the M-Pesa
expansion versus those

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.430 align:middle line:90%
that did.

01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot more
smoother consumption,

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.070 align:middle line:84%
which you see these
common themes.

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:12.330 align:middle line:90%
We did risk-sharing.

01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
We did gift giving
in Thai villages.

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Now people are giving gifts
and transfers through M-Pesa.

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:22.726 align:middle line:90%
And so it has an impact.

01:01:22.726 --> 01:01:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's the big deal?

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a big deal for Kenya.

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Sweden already has
this infrastructure.

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
But it makes a big deal
for low-income countries.

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
There are some
qualifications, though.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's not
on a distributed ledger.

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So you have to trust Safaricom
to keep the accounts properly,

01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:45.030 align:middle line:90%
and they have the cash.

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So they're supposed to put
it in a commercial bank.

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:50.010 align:middle line:90%
You trust them to do that.

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So you have to rely on a
third-party vendor in Kenya.

01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, the
money's in the bank,

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.050 align:middle line:90%
and Kenya is subject to runs.

01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:58.998 align:middle line:90%
So how safe is that?

01:01:58.998 --> 01:02:01.040 align:middle line:84%
You may think you're going
to get the money back,

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.780 align:middle line:90%
but will you really?

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And in other economies, they
don't have that kind of trust,

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:08.370 align:middle line:90%
so it doesn't take off.

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:13.070 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is those
agents, these guys,

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:14.950 align:middle line:90%
they run out of stuff.

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So you go and take
your shillings

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:18.580 align:middle line:90%
and say I want M-Pesa.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And they can't create it.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.780 align:middle line:90%
There's no net creation.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a
one-to-one transfer.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
They have to have it in
their accounts already.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And if don't have
it in the account,

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.610 align:middle line:84%
they've got to say, well,
wait, or come back tomorrow.

01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, and perhaps
more obviously

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:36.880 align:middle line:84%
for the currency withdrawal,
say here's my cell account.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.990 align:middle line:90%
I want to cash it out.

01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:40.165 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I don't have that
cash in my drawer.

01:02:40.165 --> 01:02:43.900 align:middle line:84%
What Tavneet discovered is
these agents are kind of linked

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:46.420 align:middle line:84%
to each other in an
informal money market,

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.280 align:middle line:84%
giving gifts to each
other, actually,

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and borrowing and
lending in order

01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to smooth the fluctuation,
from smoothing at the household

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
level, to smoothing at
the wholesale level,

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:58.540 align:middle line:90%
and similar models would apply.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So this brings us to
the theme of building

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.930 align:middle line:90%
financial infrastructure.

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
How can we not just
get currency on ledgers

01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and transfer it
around in a cheap way?

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.700 align:middle line:90%
How can we build in the trust?

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And how can we deal
with this shortage

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
problem among over-the-counter
vendors and agents and so on?

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And next lecture,
starting next time,

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:21.050 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do mechanism
design and private information,

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell you
how to design--

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
at some point-- how
to design this system.

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:26.220 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Went over by an
extra minute today.

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:32.710 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So otherwise, I'll see you
next Thursday or in my office

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.310 align:middle line:90%
momentarily.

01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:51.386 align:middle line:90%

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.090
PROFESSOR: So we've
been wondering

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.180
how a gas, such as
the one in this room,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.220
with particles following
Newtonian equations of motion,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.710
comes to equilibrium.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.270
We decided to explain that
by relying on the Boltzmann

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.120
equation.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.190
Essentially, we said, let's look
at the density, or probability,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.180
that we will find particles
with momentum p at location q

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.190
at time t, and we found that
within some approximations,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.540
we could represent
the evolution of this

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.379
through a linear operator
on the left-hand side

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.340
equal to some
collision second order

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.090
operator on the right-hand side.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.255
The linear operator is
a bunch of derivatives.

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:22.190
There is the time derivative,
then the coordinate moves

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.580
according to the velocity,
which is P over m.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.540
And summation over the index
alpha running from 1 to 3,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.600
or x, y, z, is assumed.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.940
And at this stage,
there is symmetry

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.800
within the
representation in terms

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.880
of coordinates and momenta.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.420
There is also a force that
causes changes of momentum.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.860
Actually, for most
of today, we are

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.110
going to be interested
in something

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.910
like the gas in this room
far away from the walls,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.290
where essentially there
is no external potential.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.870
And for the interest of thinking
about modes such as sound,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.729
et cetera, we can remove that.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.940
The second order operator-- the
collision operator-- however,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.350
explicitly because we were
thinking about collisions

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.390
among particles that
are taking place

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.810
when they are in close
contact, breaks the symmetry

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.960
between coordinate and momenta
that were present here.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.320
So this collision
operator was an integral

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.640
over the momentum of
another particle that

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.590
would come at some
impact parameter

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.050
with relative
velocity, and then you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.680
had a subtraction due to
collisions, and then addition

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.940
due to reverse collisions.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.500
Now, what we said is
because of the way

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.100
that this symmetry is
broken, we can distinguish

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.550
between averages in
position and in momentum.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.530
For example, typically we
are interested in variations

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.050
of various quantities in space.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.860
And so what we can do is
we can define the density,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.280
let's say at some
particular point,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.330
by integrating over momentum.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.400
So again, I said I don't
really need too much

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.630
about the dependence
on momentum,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.770
but I really am
interested in how

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.940
things vary from
position to position.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.700
Once we have defined density, we
could define various averages,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.880
where we would multiply this
integral by some function of P

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.630
and q, and the average was
defined in this fashion.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.900
What we found was
that really what

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.510
happens through this collision
operator-- that typically

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.420
is much more important, as
far as the inverse time scales

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.010
are concerned, than the
operators on the left,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.170
it has a much bigger
magnitude-- is

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:31.890
that momenta are very rapidly
exchanged and randomized.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.560
And the things that are
randomized most slowly

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.853
are quantities that are
conserved in collision.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.870
And so we focused on quantities
that were collision conserved,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.540
and we found that for each
one of these quantities,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.000
we could write down some kind
of a hydrodynamic equation.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.770
In particular, if we looked
at number conservation--

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.750
two particles come
in, two particles

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.480
go out-- we found that the
equation that described that

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:18.230
was that the time derivative of
the density plus moving along

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.480
the streamline had
a special form.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.250
And here, I defined the quantity
u alpha, which is simply

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:38.077
the average of P alpha
over m, defined in the way

00:05:38.077 --> 00:05:41.660
that averages defined over here.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.520
And that this is the
number of particles,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.820
how it changes if I move
along the streamline

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.300
And variations of this,
if you are incompressible,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.140
comes from the divergence
of your flow velocity.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.340
And actually, this operator we
call the total, or streamline,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.840
derivative.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.780
Now, the next thing
that we said is

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.930
that OK, number is conserved,
but momentum is also conserved.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.460
So we can see what equation
I get if I look at momentum.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.180
But in fact, we put
the quantity that

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.770
was momentum divided by mass
to make it like a velocity,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.190
and how much you
deviate from the average

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.630
that we just calculated.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.040
And this quantity
we also call c.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.020
And when we looked at the
equation that corresponded

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.290
to the conservation of this
quantity in collisions,

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:51.060
we found that we had
something like mass times

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.310
acceleration along
the streamline.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.160
So basically this
operator multiplied

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.770
by mass acting on this
was external force.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.500
Well, currently we've
said this external force

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.290
to be zero-- so when
we are inside the box.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.140
Here there was an
additional force

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.940
that came from variations
of pressure in the gas.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.410
And so we had a term here that
was 1 over n d alpha of P alpha

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:29.330
beta, and we needed to define
a pressure tensor P alpha

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:36.997
beta, which was nm
expectation line of c alpha c.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.020
Finally, in collisions
there is another quantity

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.720
that is conserved, which
is the kinetic energy.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.470
So here the third quantity
could be the kinetic energy--

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.970
or actually, we chose
the combination mc

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:02.210
squared over 2, which is the
additional kinetic energy

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.260
on top of this.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.000
And it's very easy to check that
if kinetic energy is conserved,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.630
this quantity is also conserved.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.045
We call the average of
this quantity in the way

00:08:13.045 --> 00:08:18.850
that we have defined
above as epsilon.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.630
And then the
hydrodynamic equation

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.536
is that as you move
along the streams--

00:08:26.536 --> 00:08:29.800
so you have this derivative
acting on this quantity

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.049
epsilon-- what we are going to
get is something like minus 1

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:41.059
over n d alpha of a
new vector, h alpha.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:50.430
h alpha, basically, tells me how
this quantity is transported.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.900
So all I need to do is to
have something like mc squared

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:01.690
over 2 transported
along direction alpha.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.330
And then there was
another term, which

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.040
was P alpha beta-- the
P alpha beta that we

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.060
defined above--
times u alpha beta.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:20.100
U alpha beta was simply the
derivative of this quantity,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.600
symmetrized.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.050
So the statement
is that something

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:38.270
like a gas-- or any
other fluid, in fact-- we

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.020
can describe through
these quantities that

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.265
are varying from one
location to another location.

00:09:45.265 --> 00:09:47.650
There is something
like a density,

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.030
how dense it is
at this location.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.160
How fast particles are
streaming from one location

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.700
to another location.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.830
And the energy content
that is ultimately related

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.400
to something like
the temperature,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.681
how hot it is locally.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.770
So you have these equations.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:11.340
Solving these equations,
presumably, is equivalent,

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.990
in some sense, to solving
the Boltzmann equation.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.690
The Boltzmann equation, we
know, ultimately reaches

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.870
an equilibrium, so we
should be able to figure out

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.700
how the system, such as
the gas in this room,

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.260
is if disturbed, comes to
equilibrium, if we follow

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.930
the density, velocity,
and temperature.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.940
Now, the problem with the
equations as I have written

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.240
is that they are not closed
in terms of these three

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:43.080
quantities, because I need
to evaluate the pressure,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.540
I need to evaluate the
heat transfer vector.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.040
And to calculate
these quantities,

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.420
I need to be able to
evaluate these averages.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.920
In order to evaluate these
averages, I need to know f.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.380
So how did we proceed?

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.690
We said well, let's try to find
approximate solutions for f.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.240
So the next task
is to find maybe

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.740
some f, which is a function
of p, q, and t, and we

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.650
can substitute over there.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.340
Now, the first
thing that we said

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:33.300
was, OK, maybe what I can do
is I can look at the equation

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.050
itself.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.740
Notice that this
part of the equation

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.780
is order of 1 over the
time it takes for particles

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.430
to move in the gas and
find another particle

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.430
to collide with, whereas the
left-hand side is presumably

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.510
something that is
related to how far I

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:57.640
go before I see some variation
due to the external box.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.970
And we are really thinking about
cases where the gas particles

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.520
are not that
dilute, in the sense

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.380
that along the way to go
from one side of the room

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.920
to another side of the
room, you encounter

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.930
many, many collisions.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:18.290
So the term on the right-hand
side is much larger.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.720
If that is the case,
we said that maybe it's

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.030
justifiable to just solve this
equation on the right-hand side

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.970
as a zeroth order.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:32.180
And to solve that, I really
have to set, for example,

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.490
the right-hand side that
I'm integrating here, to 0.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.400
And I know how to do that.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:46.070
If log f involves collision
conserved quantities,

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.310
then ff before is
the same as ff after.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.200
And the solution
that I get by doing

00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.350
that has the form of exponential
involving conserved quantities,

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.480
which are the quantities
that I have indicated

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.350
over here-- let's
say, such as c.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.590
And so log of that
would be something

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.440
that involves--
I can write as mc

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.210
squared over 2 with
some coefficient

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.534
that, in principle, varies from
location to another location.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.980
I want to integrate this and
come up with the density,

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.460
so I put the density out here,
and I normalize the Gaussian.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.870
And so this is a
reasonable solution.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.400
Indeed, this is the
zeroth order solution

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.940
for f-- I'll call that f0.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.810
So once you have the
zeroth order solution,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.850
from that you can calculate
these two quantities.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:01.220
For example, because the zeroth
order solution is even in c,

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.620
the heat vector will
be 0, because it

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.540
is symmetric in the
different components.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.710
The pressure tensor will be
proportional to delta alpha

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.040
beta.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.480
OK?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.170
We started with that.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.740
Put those over
here, and we found

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.640
that we could get some
results that were interesting.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.320
For example, we could see that
the gas can have sound modes.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.570
We could calculate
the speed of sound.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.030
But these sound modes
were not damped.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.130
And there were other modes,
such as sheer modes, that

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.760
existed forever,
confounding our expectation

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.630
that these equations
should eventually

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.400
come to an equilibrium.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.810
So we said, OK, this
was a good attempt.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.660
But what was not good enough to
give us complete equilibrium,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.820
so let's try to find
a better solution.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.960
So how did we find
the better solution?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.320
We said that the
better solution-- let's

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.330
assume that the
solution is like this,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:14.770
but is slightly changed
by a correction.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.570
And the correction comes
because of the effect

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.690
of the left-hand side,
which we had ignored so far.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.620
And since the left-hand
side is smaller

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.970
than the right-hand side by
a factor involving tau x,

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.490
presumably the correction
will involve this tau x.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:32.990
OK.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.690
Good?

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.960
We said that in
order to see that

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.990
as a correction,
what I need to do

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.760
is to essentially
linearize this expression.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:52.976
So what we did was we replaced
this f's with f0's 1 plus g,

00:15:52.976 --> 00:15:56.850
1 plus g, and so forth.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.920
The zeroth term, by
construction, is 0.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.680
And so if we ignore terms
that are order of g squared,

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.553
we get something
that is linear in g.

00:16:08.553 --> 00:16:09.940
OK?

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.190
Now, it's still an
integral operator,

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.920
but we said let's
approximate that integration

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:31.710
and let's do a linearized one
collision time approximation.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.050
What that approximation
amounted to was

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:41.010
that, independent of what this
deviation is, if we are relaxed

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.510
to the zeroth order
solution over time scale

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:48.280
that is the same, and that
times scale we'll call tau x.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:54.150
So essentially we wrote this
as minus f0, essentially

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:59.830
g, which is the difference
between f and f0,

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.670
divided by tau x.

00:17:05.876 --> 00:17:07.140
f0, this was g.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:13.450
No.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.109
I guess we don't have this.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:18.810
We wrote it in this fashion.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.300
It's just writing the
way that I wrote before.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.329
We wrote this as g
over tau x, where

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:30.590
g is the correction that
I have to write here.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.120
And you can see that the
correction is obtained

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:41.200
by multiplying minus tau x with
l acting on f0 divided by f0,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.210
which is l acting on log of f0.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:50.600
So I would have
here 1 minus tau x--

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.420
let's make this curly
bracket-- and then

00:17:53.420 --> 00:18:03.740
in the bracket over here, I
have to put the action of l

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.770
on the log of f0.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.200
So I have to-- this is my f0.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.320
I take its log.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.600
So the log will have
minus mc squared

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.900
over 2 kt and the log
of this combination,

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:26.370
and I do d by dt plus P alpha
over m acting on this log,

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.630
and then a bunch of
algebra will leave you

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.450
to the following answer.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.900
Not surprisingly, you're
going to get factors of mkT.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.280
So you will get m over kT.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.380
You get c alpha c beta
minus delta alpha beta

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:50.750
c squared over 3 acting on
this rate of strength tensor

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.160
that we have defined over here.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.760
And then there are
derivatives that

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.170
will act on temperature--
because temperature is allowed

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.155
to vary from position to
position-- so there will be

00:19:01.155 --> 00:19:06.990
a term that will involve the
derivative of temperature.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:12.740
In fact, it will come in the
form over T c alpha multiplying

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:21.530
another combination which is
mc squared over 2kT minus 5/2.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.625
Let me see if I got all of
the factors of 1/2 correct.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.930
Yeah.

00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:35.560
OK.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.280
So this is the first order term.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.660
Presumably, there will be
high order corrections,

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:48.650
but this is the improved
solution to the Boltzmann

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:53.450
equation beyond the zeroth
order approximation.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:58.800
It's a solution that involves
both sides of the equation now.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.380
We relied heavily on
the right-hand side

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.920
to calculate f0, and we
used the left-hand side--

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.530
through this log l
acting on log of f0--

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.300
to get the correction
that is order of tau x

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.730
that is coming to this equation.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:23.310
So now, with this
improved solution,

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.390
we can go back and re-check
some of the conclusions

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.830
that we had before.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:35.100
So let's, for example, start
by calculating this pressure

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.550
tensor P alpha beta, and see
how it was made different.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:46.050
So what I need to do is
to calculate this average.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.720
How do I calculate that average?

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.130
I essentially multiply this f,
as I have indicated over there,

00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:01.700
by c alpha c beta, and then
I integrate over all momenta.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.110
Essentially, I have
to do integrations

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.700
with this Gaussian weight.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.690
So when I do the
average of c alpha

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.230
c beta with this Gaussian
weight, not surprisingly,

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.640
I will get the delta
alpha beta, and I

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.220
will get from here kT over m.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.340
Multiplying by nm
will give me mkT.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:33.520
So this is the diagonal form,
where the diagonal elements

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.995
are our familiar pressures.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.510
So that was the
zeroth order term.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.320
Essentially, that's
the 1 over here,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.340
multiplying c alpha c
beta before I integrate.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.130
So that's the 1 in this bracket.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.340
But there will be order
of tau x corrections,

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.970
because I will have to
multiply two more factors of c

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:00.770
with the c's that
I have over here.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.200
Now, none of these
terms are important,

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.710
because these are,
again, odd terms.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:15.270
So when I multiply two
c's with three or one c

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.030
the average will be zero.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.651
So all of the averages are
really coming from these terms.

00:22:21.651 --> 00:22:26.170
Now, these terms involve
four factors of c's.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:26.670
Right?

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.240
There's the two c's
that I put out here--

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.560
and actually, I
really have to think

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:37.086
of these as different indices,
let's say nu nu, nu nu.

00:22:37.086 --> 00:22:42.410
Summation convention
again assumed.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:47.380
And then when I multiply by
c alpha c beta, I will have,

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.930
essentially, four indices
to play with-- c alpha

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.070
c beta, c nu c nu.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.970
But it's all done with the
Gaussian weight out here.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.520
And we showed and
discussed how there

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.550
was this nice fixed theorem
that enabled you to rapidly

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:11.340
calculate these Gaussian
weights with four factors of c,

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.340
or more factors of c--
doesn't really matter.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.130
And so in principle you
know how to do that,

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:22.250
and I'll skip the corresponding
algebra and write the answer.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.860
It is proportional
to minus tau x.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.960
And what it gives you, once
you do these calculations,

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:37.730
is a factor of u alpha beta
minus delta alpha beta over 3

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.040
nu gamma gamma.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.270
And again, let me make sure
I did not miss out anything.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.110
And apparently I missed
out the factor of 2.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.370
So really, the only
thing that's happened,

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:11.060
once we went and included this
correction, we added this term.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.540
But the nice thing
about this term

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.500
is that potentially, it
has off-diagonal terms.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.280
This matrix initially
was completely diagonal.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.760
The corrections that
we have calculated

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.150
are potentially
off-diagonal coming

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:33.600
from this term that corrected
the original Gaussian weight.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.610
So where is that useful?

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.490
Well, one of the problems
that we discussed

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:43.210
was that I can imagine a
configuration of velocities,

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.600
let's say close to a
wall-- but it does not

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.980
have to be a wall,
but something where

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.730
I have a profile
of velocities which

00:24:53.730 --> 00:25:00.060
exist with components only
along the x direction,

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.860
but vary along the y direction.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.780
So this ux is
different from this ux,

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.780
because they correspond
to different y's.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.680
So essentially, this is a
pattern of sheering a gas,

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.910
if you like.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:19.660
And the question is,
well, hopefully, this

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.850
will come to relax and
eventually give us, let's say,

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.160
uniform velocity, or zero
velocity, even better--

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.630
if there's a wall, and
the wall velocity is zero.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.570
So how does that happen?

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.485
Well, the equation
that I have to satisfy

00:25:38.485 --> 00:25:42.290
is this one that involves u.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.380
So I have m.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.705
Well, what do I have to have?

00:25:46.705 --> 00:25:55.140
I have du by dt plus
something that acts on ux.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.710
ux only has variations
along the y direction.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.210
So this term, if
it was there, had

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:12.370
to involve a derivative along
the y direction multiplying uy,

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.295
but it's not present,
because there's no uy.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.270
On the right-hand side of the
equation, I have to put minus 1

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:24.040
over n.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.560
Again, the only variations
that I'm allowed to have

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.110
are along the y direction.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.300
So I have, when I do the
summation over alpha,

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.920
the only alpha that
contributes is y.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.910
And so I need the
pressure y, but I'm

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.010
looking for velocities
along the x direction,

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:47.042
so the other index better be x.

00:26:47.042 --> 00:26:49.020
OK?

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.490
So the time course of
the velocity profile

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:57.290
that I set up over
here is determined

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.960
by the y derivative of the
yx component of the pressures

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.960
tensor.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.400
Now, previously our
problem was that we stopped

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.270
at the zeroth order,
and at the zeroth order,

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.250
the pressure tensor
was diagonal.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.970
It didn't have a yx component.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:17.300
So this profile
would stay forever.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.880
But now we do have a
yx component, and so

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.250
what do I get?

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:30.690
I will get here
minus 1 over n dy dy.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:35.130
The yx component will
come from minus 2 tau

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:41.900
x multiplying nkT and
then multiplying-- well,

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.320
this term, again, is diagonal.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.210
I can forget about that term.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.360
So it comes from the uxy.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.815
What is uxy?

00:27:51.815 --> 00:27:57.480
It is 1/2 of the x derivative
of uy that doesn't exist,

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.968
and the y derivative
of ux that does exist.

00:28:03.952 --> 00:28:05.950
OK?

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:10.420
So what we have,
once we divide by m,

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.580
is that the time
derivative of ux

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.880
is given by a bunch
of coefficients.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.720
The n I can cancel
if it does not vary.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:29.370
What I have is the 2's cancel.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.420
The n's cancel.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:39.140
I will have tau x kT over m.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:44.260
tau x kT over m, that's fine.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:49.790
And then the second derivative
along the y direction of ux.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.170
So suddenly, I have
a different equation.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:06.870
Rather than having the time
derivative does not change,

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.650
I find that the time
derivative of ux

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.310
is proportional to Laplacian.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.430
It's a diffusion equation.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.970
And we know the solution
to the diffusion equation,

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:20.110
how it looks qualitative if I
have a profile such as this.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.340
Because of the
fusion, eventually it

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.900
will become more and
more uniform in time.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.410
And the characteristic
time over which

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.570
it does so, if I assume that,
let's say, in the y direction,

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:39.080
I have a pattern that has some
characteristic size lambda,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.950
then the characteristic
relaxation time for diffusion

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.160
will be proportional
to lambda squared.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.460
There's a proportionality here.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.560
The constant of
proportionality is simply

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.350
this diffusion coefficient.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.920
So it is inversely.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.731
So it is m kT tau x.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.840
Actually, we want to
think about it further.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.790
kT over m is roughly the square
of the terminal velocities

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.610
of the particles.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:20.890
So lambda squared
divided by v squared

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.490
is roughly the time that
you would have ballistically

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.760
traveled over this line
scale of the variation.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.930
The square of that
time has to be provided

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.740
by the characteristic
collision time,

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.060
and that tells
you the time scale

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:42.090
over which this kind
of relaxation occurs.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.071
Yes?

00:30:43.071 --> 00:30:46.999
AUDIENCE: So if x
depends linearly, why?

00:30:46.999 --> 00:30:49.340
Would still get 0
on the-- why can't--

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.780
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:57.000
So what you are setting
up is a variation

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.450
where there is some kind
of a sheer velocity that

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.930
exists forever.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.730
So indeed, this
kind of pattern will

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.530
persist, unless you say
that there's actually

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.740
another wall at the other end.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:14.500
So then you will have
some kind of a pattern

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.660
that you would relax.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.140
So unless you're willing to send
this all the way to infinity,

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.900
is will eventually relax.

00:31:26.365 --> 00:31:26.864
Yes?

00:31:26.864 --> 00:31:29.648
AUDIENCE: Can you just
say again the last term

00:31:29.648 --> 00:31:32.281
on the second
line, the 1/2 term.

00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:33.322
Where did that come from?

00:31:33.322 --> 00:31:35.140
Can you just explain that?

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.576
PROFESSOR: This term?

00:31:36.576 --> 00:31:37.201
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:37.201 --> 00:31:38.420
The last half of it.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.711
PROFESSOR: The last half of it.

00:31:39.711 --> 00:31:41.210
So what did we have here?

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:52.690
So what I have is
that over here,

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.210
in calculating
the pressure, when

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.760
I'm looking at the xy
component, I better

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.530
find some element here
that is off diagonal.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:05.620
What's the off
diagonal element here?

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:10.220
It is u xy What is u xy?

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:14.160
u xy is this, calculated for.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:19.700
So it is 1/2 of dx uy,
which is what I don't have,

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.150
because my uy is 0.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.090
And the other half or
it, of symmetrization,

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.595
is 1/2 the value of x.

00:32:26.595 --> 00:32:28.050
Yes?

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
derivative [INAUDIBLE] for ux.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.240
You're starting out
the second term uy uy.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.360
Also, shouldn't there
be a term ux dx?

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.240
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:42.740
Yeah.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:43.960
So this is a-- yes.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.810
There is a term that
is ux dx, but there

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:49.760
is no variation along
the x direction.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.440
I said that I set up
a configuration where

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.900
the only non-zero derivatives
are along the y direction.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.900
But in general, yes.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:58.483
You are right.

00:32:58.483 --> 00:33:00.195
This is like a divergence.

00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:03.460
It has three terms, but
the way that I set it up,

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.140
only one term is non-zero.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.120
AUDIENCE: Also, if you have
[INAUDIBLE] one layer moving

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.280
fast at some point, the other
layer moving slower than that.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.921
And you potentially can
create some kind of curl?

00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:19.470
But as far as I understand, this
would be an even higher order

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.970
effect?

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.369
Like turbulence.

00:33:22.369 --> 00:33:23.660
PROFESSOR: You said two things.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.560
One of them was you
started saying viscosity.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.240
And indeed, what
we've calculated here,

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.150
this thing is the
coefficient of viscosity.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.450
So this is really the
viscosity of the material.

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:41.980
So actually, once I
include this term,

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.960
I have the full the
Navier-Stokes equations

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.640
with viscosity.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.890
So all of the
vortices, et cetera,

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.000
should also be present
and discussed, however

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.880
way you want to do it with
Navier-Stokes equation

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.850
into this equations.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:02.890
AUDIENCE: So components
of speed which

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.730
are not just x components,
but other components which

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.757
are initially zero, will
change because of this, right?

00:34:09.757 --> 00:34:10.965
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's right.

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:11.464
That's right.

00:34:11.464 --> 00:34:12.462
AUDIENCE: You just
haven't introduced them

00:34:12.462 --> 00:34:13.460
in the equation?

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.085
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:17.449
So this is I'm looking at the
initial profile in principle.

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:19.300
I think here I have
set up something

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.020
that because of symmetry will
always maintain this equation.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.850
But if you put a
little bit bump,

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.489
if you make some
perturbation, you

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:28.966
will certainly generate
other components of velocity.

00:34:34.433 --> 00:34:35.929
OK?

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:40.730
And so this resolved one of the
modes that was not relaxing.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:45.710
There was another mode that we
were looking at where I set up

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:50.350
a situation where temperature
and density were changing

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.980
across the system,
but their products--

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.500
that is, the
pressure-- was uniform.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.780
So you had a system
that was always there

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.970
in the zeroth order, despite
having different temperatures

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.886
at two different points.

00:35:03.886 --> 00:35:08.000
Well, that was partly
because the heat transport

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.912
vector was zero.

00:35:09.912 --> 00:35:17.290
Now, if I want to calculate
this with this more complicated

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:21.090
equation, well, what I
need-- the problem before

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:24.110
with the zeroth order was
that I had three factors of c,

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.870
and that was odd.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:30.240
But now, I have a term in the
equation this is also odd.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.700
So from here, I will get
a term, and I will in fact

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.790
find eventually that
the flow of heat

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:48.020
is proportional to
gradient of temperature.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.630
And one can compute
this coefficient, again,

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.940
in terms of mass,
density, et cetera,

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.820
just like we calculated
this coefficient over here.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.460
This will give you relaxation.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.310
We can also look at the
sound modes including this,

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:07.130
and you find that the
wave equation that I

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.920
had before for the
sound modes will also

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.770
get a second derivative
term, and that

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.130
will lead to damping
of the modes of sound.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.650
So everything at
this level, now we

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:23.180
have some way of seeing
how the gas will eventually

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.820
come to equilibrium.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.460
And given some knowledge of
rough parameters of the gas,

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.360
like-- and most
importantly-- what's

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.570
the time between
collisions, we can

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:38.510
compute the typical relaxation
time, and the relaxation manner

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.250
of the gas.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.820
So we are now going to
change directions, and forget

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.360
about time dependents.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.330
So if you have questions
about this section,

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:04.573
now may be a good time.

00:37:04.573 --> 00:37:05.072
Yes?

00:37:05.072 --> 00:37:07.087
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what is lambda?

00:37:07.087 --> 00:37:07.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:11.420
So I assume that
what I have to do

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.940
is to solve the equation
for some initial condition.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.860
Let's imagine that that
initial condition, let's say,

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.380
is a periodic pattern of
some wavelength lambda.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.460
Or it could be any
other shape that

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.880
has some characteristic
dimension.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.750
The important thing is
that the diffusion constant

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:35.580
has units of length
squared over time.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.440
So eventually, you'll
find that all times are

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.740
proportional to
some lengths where

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.590
times the inverse of
the diffusion constant.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.380
And so you have to look
at your initial system

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.830
that you want to relax, identify
the longest length scale that

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.590
is involved, and then
your relaxation time

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.473
would be roughly of that order.

00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:06.110
OK.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:11.340
So now we get to
the fourth section

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.620
of our course,
that eventually has

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.280
to do with
statistical mechanics.

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:26.080
And at the very,
very first lecture,

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:32.150
I wrote the definition for
you that I will write again,

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:42.620
that statistical mechanics
is a probabilistic approach

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:58.270
to equilibrium-- also
microscopic-- properties

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:05.750
of large numbers of
degrees of freedom.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:21.650
So what we did to
thermodynamics was

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:28.390
to identify what equilibrium
microscopic properties are.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:33.520
They are things such as
identifying the energy, volume,

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.480
number of particles of the gas.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.240
There could be other things,
such as temperature, pressure,

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.460
number, or other
collections of variables

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.830
that are independently
sufficient to describe

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.570
a macrostate.

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:58.480
And what we're going to do is
to indicate that macroscopic set

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.160
of parameters that
thermodynamically characterize

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:07.030
the equilibrium
system by big M. OK?

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.150
Clearly, for a
probabilistic approach,

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:18.000
you want to know something
about the probability.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.700
And we saw that probabilities
involving large numbers--

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.930
and actually various things
involving large numbers--

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:34.095
had some simplified character
that we are going to exploit.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.850
And lastly, in the
last section, we

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:45.040
have been thinking about
microscopic description.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.620
So these large number
of degrees of freedom

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.560
we said identify
some point, let's

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.540
say, for particles in a six-n
dimensional phase space.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:02.450
So this would for gas particles
be this collection p and q.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:07.260
And that these
quantities we know

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.860
are in fact subject
to dynamics that

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.810
is governed by some Hamiltonian.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:19.810
And we saw that
if we sort of look

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.900
at the entirety of the
probability in this six

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.640
n dimensional phase
space, that it

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.590
is subject to
Liouville's question that

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:35.953
said that dp by dt is a
Poisson bracket of H and p.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:47.180
And if the only thing that
we take from equilibrium

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:52.220
is that things should not
change as a function of time,

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.280
then requiring this
probability in phase space

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.910
to be independent
of time would then

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:05.240
require us to have a p which
is a function of H, which

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.046
is defined in p and
q and potentially

00:42:09.046 --> 00:42:10.170
other conserved quantities.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:21.270
So what we are going to do
in statistical mechanics

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:26.830
is to forget about how things
eventually reach equilibrium.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:30.230
We spent a lot of time
and energy thinking

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:33.060
about how a gas
reaches equilibrium.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.320
Having established
what it requires

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.690
to devise that solution
in one particular case,

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:44.450
and one of few cases where
you can actually get far,

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:45.640
you're going to ignore that.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.250
We say that somehow my system
reached this state that

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.270
is time independent
and is equilibrium,

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.390
and therefore the
probability should somehow

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.280
have this character.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.460
And it depends,
however, on what choice

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.380
I make for the macrostate.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:09.160
So what I need here-- this was
a probability of a microstate.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.820
So what I want to do
is to have a statement

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.740
about the probability
of a microstate given

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.820
some specification
of the macrostate

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.570
that I'm interested in.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:22.690
So that's the task.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:33.750
And you're going to do that
first in the ensemble--

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:37.062
and I'll tell you again
what ensemble means shortly.

00:43:37.062 --> 00:43:38.270
That's called microcanonical.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:54.830
And if you recall, when we
were constructing our approach

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:59.580
to thermodynamics, one of the
first things that we did was we

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.580
said, there's a whole bunch
of things that we don't know,

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:07.440
so let's imagine that our
box is as simple as possible.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.170
So the system that
we are looking

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.070
is completely isolated from
the rest of the universe.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:14.910
It's a box.

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:17.010
There's lots of
things in the box.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.940
But the box has no contact
with the rest of the universe.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.630
So that was the case
where essentially there

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:28.080
was no heat, no work that
was going into the system

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.810
and was being exchanged,
and so clearly

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.670
this system has a
constant energy.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:43.520
And so you can certainly
prescribe a particular energy

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.110
content to whatever
is in the box.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:53.450
And that's the chief identity
of the microcanonical ensemble.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.650
It's basically a
collection of boxes

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:59.290
that represent the
same equilibrium.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:04.420
So if there is
essentially a gas,

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.110
the volume is
fixed, so that there

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:08.940
would be no work
that will be done.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.630
The number of
particles is fixed,

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:13.550
so that there is no chemical
work that is being done.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:18.140
So essentially, in general,
all of the quantities

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:22.070
that we identified
with displacements

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:28.100
are held fixed, as well as
the energy in this ensemble.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.540
So the microcanonical
ensemble would

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:38.310
be essentially E, x, and N
would be the quantities that

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:40.660
parametrize the
equilibrium state.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.700
Of course, there's
a whole collection

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.210
of different microstates
that would correspond

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:49.310
to the same macrostate here.

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:59.590
So presumably, this bunch of
particles that are inside this

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:04.560
explore a huge
multidimensional microstate.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.320
And what I want to do is to
assign a probability that,

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.540
given that I have
fixed E, x, and n,

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.210
that a particular
microstate occurs.

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:18.150
OK?

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.210
How do I do that?

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:27.940
Well, I say that OK, if the
energy of that microstate

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:33.350
that I can calculate is not
equal to the energy that I know

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:36.320
I have in the box,
then that's not

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.890
one of the microstates that
should be allowed in the box.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:47.030
But presumably there's a
whole bunch of micro states

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:50.530
whose energy is
compatible with the energy

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:52.980
that I put in the box.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.715
And then I say, OK, if there is
no other conserved quantity--

00:46:57.715 --> 00:47:02.850
and let's assume that there
isn't-- I have no way a priori

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.200
of distinguishing between them.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.000
So they are just like
the faces of the dice,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.770
and I say they're
all equally likely.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:14.220
For the dice, I
would give 1/6 here.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.470
There's presumably some
kind of a normalization that

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:23.420
depends on E, x, and n,
that I have to put in.

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.420
And again, note
that this is kind

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:31.050
of like a delta
function that I have.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.870
It's like a delta of H
minus E, and it's therefore

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:37.310
consistent with this
Liouville equation.

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:41.410
It's one of these
functions that is related

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:45.250
through H to the probability
on the microstate.

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.550
Now, this is an assumption.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:56.840
It is a way of
assigning probabilities.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:06.200
It's called assumption of
equal a priori probabilities.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.140
It's like the subjective
assignment of probabilities

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.420
and like the faces
of the dice, it's

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.750
essentially the
best that you can

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:18.140
do without any
other information.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:24.710
Now, the statement is that once
I have made this assumption,

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:28.090
I can derive the three
laws of thermodynamics.

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:28.590
No, sorry.

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:33.220
I can derive two of the
three laws of thermodynamics.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.970
Actually, three of the four
laws of thermodynamics, since we

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:37.990
had the zeroth law.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.550
So let's proceed.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:41.530
OK?

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:46.585
So we want to have a
proof of thermodynamics.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.350
So the zeroth law
had something to do

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.610
with putting two
systems in contact,

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.560
and when they were
in equilibrium,

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.520
there was some empirical
temperature from one

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:20.270
that was the same as what
you had for the other one.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:25.350
So basically, let's
pick our two systems

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:32.375
and put a wall between them that
allows the exchange of energy.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:40.140
And so this is my
system one, and they

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.950
have an spontaneous energy bond.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:47.160
This is the part that is
two, it has energy E2.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:50:01.360
So I start with an initial state
where when I look at E2 and E2,

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:07.350
I have some initial value of
E1, 0, let's say, and E2, 0.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:15.660
So my initial state
is here, in these two.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:20.760
Now, as I proceed in time,
because the two systems can

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:25.320
exchange energy, E1
and E2 can change.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:31.080
But certainly, what I have is
that E1 plus E2 is something E

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:36.590
total that is E1,0 plus E2,0.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:41.700
Which means that I'm
always exploring the line

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.380
that corresponds to E1 plus
E2 is a constant, which

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.961
it runs by 45-degree
along this space.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:59.750
So once I remove the
constraint that E1 is fixed

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:02.050
and E2 is fixed,
they can exchange.

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:05.830
They explore a whole
bunch of other states

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:08.030
that is available to them.

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:12.480
And I would probably
say that the probability

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:18.610
of the microstates is the same
up to some normalization that

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:28.360
comes from E1.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.640
So the normalization-- not
the entirety 1 plus 2--

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.210
is a microcanonical ensemble
but with energy E total.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:41.320
So there is a
corresponding omega

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.740
that is associated with
the combined system.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:48.170
And to obtain that,
all I need to do

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:52.540
is to sum or integrate
over the energy, let's

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.220
say, that I have
in the first one.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.230
The number of states
that I would have,

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.020
or the volume of
phase space that I

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:06.980
would have if I
was at E1, and then

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:12.850
simultaneously multiplying by
how many states the second part

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:15.390
can have at the energy
that corresponds

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:17.492
to E total minus E1.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:27.770
So what I need to do is
to essentially multiply

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:31.560
the number of states that I
would encounter going along

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.790
this axis, and the
number of states

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:37.690
that I would multiply
going along the other axis.

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:40.980
So let's try to sort of
indicate those things

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:45.250
with some kind of
a color density.

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:50.100
So let's say that the
density is kind of low here,

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.500
it comes kind of high here,
and then goes low here.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:59.360
If I move along this axis,
let's say that along this axis,

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.740
I maybe become high here,
and stay high, and then

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.070
become low later.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:07.610
Some kind of thing.

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:11.370
So all I need to do is to
multiply these two colors

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.640
and generate the
color along this--

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.980
there is this direction, which
I will plot going, hopefully,

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:19.190
coming out of the board.

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:21.630
And maybe that product
looks something like this.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:33.013
Stating that somewhere there
is a most probable state,

00:53:33.013 --> 00:53:40.250
and I can indicate the most
probable state by E1 star

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.955
and E2 star, let's say.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.170
So you may say, OK,
it actually could

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:52.010
be something, who says it
should have one maximum.

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:54.520
It could have multiple
maxima, or things like that.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.510
You could certainly allow
all kinds of things.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:03.440
Now, my claim is that
when I go and rely

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:10.770
on this particular
limit, I can state

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:15.710
that if I explore
all of these states,

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:20.300
I will find my system in the
vicinity of these energies

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.070
with probability that in
the n goes to infinity,

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:26.590
limit becomes 1.

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:30.230
And that kind of
relies on the fact

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:33.340
that each one of
these quantities

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:37.480
is really an exponentially
large quantity.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.620
Before I do that, I
forgot to do something

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.250
that I wanted to do over here.

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:47.130
I have promised that as
we go through the course,

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:50.870
at each stage we will
define for each section

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:53.620
its own definition of entropy.

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.050
Well, almost, but
not quite that.

00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:00.700
Once I have a probability,
I had told you

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:05.080
how to define an entropy
associated with a probability.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:09.950
So here, I can say that
when I have a probability p,

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:15.920
I can identify the average of
log p, the factor of minus p

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:21.870
log p, to be the entropy
of that probability.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:27.180
Kind of linked to what we
had for mixing entropy,

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.260
except that in
thermodynamics, entropy

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:33.690
had some particular units.

00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:37.260
It was related to
heat or temperature.

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:41.210
So we multiplied
by a quantity kb

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:44.440
that has the right
units of energy

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.360
divided by degrees Kelvin.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.340
Now, for the choice of the
probability that we have,

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:55.510
it is kind of like a
step function in energy.

00:55:55.510 --> 00:56:01.260
The probability is
either 0 or 1 over omega.

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:04.870
So when you're at 0, this
p log p will give you a 0.

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:08.730
When you're over here, p log
p will give you log of omega.

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:14.630
So this is going to give
you kb log of omega.

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:20.980
So we can identify in the
macrocanonical ensemble,

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:25.610
once we've stated
what E, x, and n are,

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:27.930
what the analog
of the six that we

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:32.430
have for the throwing
of the dices, what's

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:37.340
the number of microstates that
are compatible with the energy.

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.580
We will have to do a little bit
of massaging that to understand

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.880
what that means in
the continuum limit.

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.200
We'll fix that.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.380
But once we know that
number, essentially the log

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.110
of that number up
to a factor would

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:53.670
give something that would be
the entropy of that probability

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:56.520
that eventually we're
going to identify

00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.130
with the thermodynamic
entropy that

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:02.470
corresponds to this system.

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.620
But having done
that definition, I

00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:12.860
can rewrite this quantity
as E1 e to the 1 over kb S1

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:17.520
plus 1 over kb S2.

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.280
This one is evaluated at E1.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:26.029
This one is evaluated at E2,
which is E total minus E1.

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:37.450
Now, the statement that we are
going to gradually build upon

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:43.600
is that these omegas are
these types of quantities

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.650
that I mentioned that
depend exponentially

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:49.900
on the number of particles.

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.620
So let's say, if you just think
about volume, one particle

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.520
then, can be anywhere in this.

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.550
So that's a factor of v.
Two particles, v squared.

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:00.050
Three particles, v cubed.

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:02.640
n particles, v to the n.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.640
So these omegas
have buried in them

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.130
an exponential dependence on n.

00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:12.150
When you take the log, these are
quantities that are extensing.

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:14.500
They're proportionate
to this number

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:17.450
n that becomes very large.

00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:20.380
So this is one of
those examples where

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.760
to calculate this
omega in total,

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:29.080
I have to evaluate an integral
where the quantities are

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.590
exponentially large.

00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:34.440
And we saw that
when that happens,

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:38.220
I could replace this
integral essentially,

00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:39.690
with its largest value.

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:50.000
So I would have 1 over kb S1
of E1 star plus S2 of E2 star.

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:03.540
Now, how do I identify where
E1 star and E2 star are?

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:09.220
Well, given that I scale along
this axis or along that axis,

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:12.400
essentially I want
to find locations

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.540
where the exponent
is the largest.

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:17.520
So how do I find
those locations?

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.490
I essentially set
the derivative to 0.

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:23.840
So if I take the derivative
of this with respect to E1,

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.470
what do I get?

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:28.722
I get dS1 by dE1.

00:59:28.722 --> 00:59:32.790
And from here, I
get dS2 with respect

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:37.670
to an argument that is
in fact has a minus E1,

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:43.500
so I would have minus dS2 with
respect to its own energy.

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.600
With respect to its
own energy argument,

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.070
but evaluated with
an energy argument

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:51.030
that goes opposite way with E1.

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:54.410
And all of these are
calculated at conditions

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.980
where the corresponding
x's and n's are fixed.

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:05.360
And this has to
be 0, which means

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:10.420
that at the maxima, essentially,
I would have this condition.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:21.020
So again, because of the
exponential character,

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:25.100
there could be multiple
of these maxima.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.940
But if one of them
is slightly larger

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:33.050
than the other in
absolute terms,

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:35.800
in terms of the
intensive quantities,

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.850
once I multiply by
these n's, it will

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:40.905
be exponentially
larger than the others.

01:00:40.905 --> 01:00:44.090
We sort of discussed that when
we were doing the saddle point

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:48.690
approximation, how essentially
the best maximum is

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.610
exponentially larger
than all the others.

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:55.400
And so in that sense, it is
exponentially much more likely

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.320
that you would be here
as opposed to here

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.500
and anywhere else.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.970
So the statement, again, is that
just a matter of probabilities.

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:08.530
I don't say what's the dynamics
by which the energies can

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:11.230
explore these two axes.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:13.990
But I imagine like
shuffling cards,

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:19.350
the red and the black cards
have been mixed sufficiently,

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:21.180
and then you ask
a question about

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.200
the typical configuration.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.160
And in typical
configurations, you

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.960
don't expect a run of ten
black cards, or whatever,

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.370
because they're
exponentially unlikely.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:34.000
So this is the same
statement, that once you

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.150
allow this system to equilibrate
its energy, after a while

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:40.990
you look at it, and
with probability 1

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:44.960
you will find it
at a location where

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.980
these derivatives are the same.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.800
Now, each one of
these derivatives

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.340
is completely something that
pertains to its own system,

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.930
so one of them could be a gas.

01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:57.220
The other could be a spring.

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.170
It could be anything.

01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:02.260
And these derivatives could
be very different quantities.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.520
But this equality would hold.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.600
And that is what we
have for the zeroth law.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.710
That when systems come
into equilibrium, there

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:14.990
is a function of
parameters of one

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:18.300
that has to be the same as
the function of the parameters

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.850
of the other, which we call
the empirical temperature.

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:35.070
So in principal, we could define
any function of temperature,

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:39.090
and in practice, for
consistently, that function

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:40.415
is one over the temperature.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.670
So the zeroth law
established that exists

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:58.490
this empirical function.

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:01.340
This choice of 1
over T is so that we

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.000
are aligned with
everything else that we

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.310
have done so far, as
we will see shortly.

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.390
OK?

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:14.670
The next thing is
the first law, which

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:18.690
had something to
do with the change

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:20.280
in the energy of the system.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.460
When we go from one
state to another state

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:28.240
had to be made up by a
combination of heat and work.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.900
So for this, let's
expand our system

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:35.060
to allow some kind of work.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.280
So let's imagine that
I have something--

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:45.740
let's say if it is a gas-- and
the quantity that would change

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:49.020
if there's work done on
the gas is the volume.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:53.340
So let's imagine that there
is a piston that can slide.

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:57.510
And this piston exerts
for the gas a pressure,

01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:00.540
or in general, whatever
the conjugate variable

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.610
is to the displacement that's
we now allow to change.

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:09.270
So there's potentially a
change in the displacement.

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:12.730
So what we are doing
is there's work

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:18.050
that is done that
corresponds to j delta x.

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:27.440
So what happens if this
j delta x amount of work

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.610
is done on the system?

01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:33.480
Then the system goes from
one configuration that

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.270
is characterized by x to
another configuration that

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:39.920
is characterized
by x plus delta x.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:48.040
And let's see what the change
in entropy is when that happens.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.090
Change in entropy, or the
log of the number of states

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:52.780
that we have defined.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:05:05.860
And so this is essentially the
change starting from E and x

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:14.430
to going to the case where
x changed by an amount dx.

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:17.730
But through this
process I did work,

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:22.500
and so the amount of energy that
is inside the system increases

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.980
by an amount that is j delta x.

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:33.610
So if all of these
quantities are infinitesimal,

01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:38.540
I have two arguments of S now
have changed infinitesimally,

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:42.230
and I can make the corresponding
expansion in derivatives.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:48.190
There is a dS with respect
to dE at constant x.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:55.170
The corresponding change
in E is j delta x.

01:05:55.170 --> 01:06:02.660
But then there's also a
dS by dx at constant E

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.370
with the same delta
x, so I factored out

01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:07.214
the delta x between
the two of them.

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:15.840
Now, dS by dE at
constant x is related

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.540
to the empirical
temperature, which we now

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:24.980
set to be 1 over
T. Now, the claim

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:30.110
is that if you have a situation
such as this, where you have

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:32.170
a state that is sitting
in equilibrium--

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:37.980
let's say a gas with a
piston-- then by definition

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:41.900
of equilibrium, the system
does not spontaneously

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.360
change its volume.

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:49.850
But it will change its volume
because the number of states

01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:56.120
that is availability to it
increases, or S increases.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.920
So in order to
make sure that you

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.210
don't go to a state that is
more probable, because there are

01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:04.940
more possibilities, there
are more microstates,

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:09.160
I better make sure that
this first derivative is 0.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.620
Otherwise, depending on
whether this is plus or minus,

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.590
I could make a
corresponding change

01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:18.380
in delta x that would
increase delta S.

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:21.250
So what happens
here if I require

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:25.460
this to be 0 is that
I can identify now

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:32.690
that the derivative of this
quantity dS by dx at constant E

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:43.170
has to be minus j
over T. Currently,

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:46.500
I have only these two
variables, and quite

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:54.040
generically, I can say that dS
is dS by dE at constant x dE

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:59.410
plus dS by dx at constant E dx.

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:02.550
And now I have identified
these two derivatives.

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:10.420
dS by dE is 1 over T, so I have
dE over T. dS by dx is minus

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:16.960
j over T, so I have
minus j dx over T.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:28.295
And I can rearrange this, and I
see that dE is T dS plus j dx.

01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:37.210
Now, the j dx I
recognize as before, it's

01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:40.040
the mechanical work.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.720
So I have identified
that generically,

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.340
when you make a transformation,
in addition to mechanical work,

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:52.040
there's a component that
changes the energy that

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.370
is the one that we can
identify with the heat.

01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:56.229
Yes?

01:08:56.229 --> 01:09:00.540
AUDIENCE: Could you explain
why you set that S to 0?

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:03.710
PROFESSOR: Why did
I set delta S to 0?

01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:09.979
So I have a box, and this
box has a certain volume,

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.700
and there's a bunch
of particles here,

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.420
but the piston that
is holding this

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:19.270
is allowed to slide
to go up and down.

01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:20.770
OK?

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:26.620
Now, I can ask what happens if
the volume goes up and down.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:32.370
If the volume goes up and down,
how many states are available?

01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:35.189
So basically, the
statement has been

01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:38.729
that for each
configuration, there

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:42.460
is a number of states
that is available.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.649
And if I were to change
that configuration,

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:47.630
the number of
states will change.

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.979
And hence the log of it, which
is the entropy, will change.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:53.290
So how much does it change?

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:55.300
Well, let's see what
arguments changed.

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.530
So certainly, the
volume changed.

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:01.970
So x went to x plus dx.

01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:05.390
And because I did
some amount of work,

01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:11.100
pdv, the amount of energy that
was in the box also changed.

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:11.910
OK?

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:15.040
So after this transformation
with this thing going

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.600
up or down, what is
the new logarithm

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.140
of the number of states?

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.730
How much has it changed?

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:26.230
And how much of the
change is given by this?

01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:28.570
Now, suppose that
I make this change,

01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:31.700
and I find that suddenly I
have a thousand more states

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:32.850
available to me.

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:34.910
It's a thousand
times more likely

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:37.540
that I will accept this change.

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:43.440
So in order for me to be
penalized-- or actually,

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.150
not penalized, or
not gain-- because I

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:49.430
make this transformation,
this change better be 0.

01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:55.840
If it is not 0, if
this quantity is,

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.380
let's say, positive,
then I will choose

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:03.510
a delta v that is positive, and
delta S will become positive.

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:06.135
If this quantity
happens to be negative,

01:11:06.135 --> 01:11:08.710
then I will choose a
delta v that is negative,

01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:11.880
and then delta S will
be positive again.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.340
So the statement that
this thing originally

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:19.460
was sitting there by
itself in equilibrium

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:23.500
and did not spontaneously
go up or down

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:26.416
is this statement
this derivative 0.

01:11:33.178 --> 01:11:37.540
AUDIENCE: That's only 0 when
the system is in equilibrium?

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.290
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:39.260
Yes.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:46.000
So indeed, this is
then a relationship

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.460
that involves parameters of
the system in equilibrium.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:49.960
Yeah?

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.600
So there is
thermodynamically, we

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.810
said that once I specify
what my energy and volume

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:01.140
and number of particles
are in equilibrium,

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.610
there is a particular
S. And what

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:06.780
I want to know is if
I go from one state

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:11.550
to another state in equilibrium,
what is the change in dS?

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:13.880
That's what this statement is.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.250
Then I can rearrange
it and see that when

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:21.190
I go from one equilibrium state
to another equilibrium state,

01:12:21.190 --> 01:12:23.560
I have to change
internal energy, which

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.992
I can do either by doing
work or by doing heat.

01:12:33.948 --> 01:12:34.448
OK?

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:56.110
Now, the second law
is actually obvious.

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:05.050
I have stated that I start
from this configuration

01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:09.810
and go to that configuration
simply because of probability.

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:15.290
The probabilities are inverse
of this omega, if you like.

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:20.780
So I start with some location--
like the pack of cards,

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:22.655
all of the black
on one side, all

01:13:22.655 --> 01:13:27.920
of the red on the other
side-- and I do some dynamics,

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.800
and I will end up
with some other state.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.730
I will, because why?

01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:36.990
Because that state has a much
more volume of possibilities.

01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:38.880
There is a single
state that we identify

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.260
as all-black and
all-red, and there's

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:45.130
a myriad of states that we say
they're all randomly mixed,

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:47.120
and so we're much
more likely to find

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.780
from that subset of states.

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:57.520
So I have certainly stated
that S1 evaluated at E1 star,

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.480
plus S2 evaluated at
E2 star, essentially

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:11.140
the peak of that object, is much
larger than S1 plus E1 plus 0

01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.616
plus S2 [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:28.270
And more specifically,
if we sort of follow

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:34.790
the course of the system
as it starts from here,

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:39.120
you will find that it will
basically go in the direction

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:46.490
always such that the derivatives
that are related to temperature

01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:51.960
are such that the energy
will flow from the hot air

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.460
to the colder body,
consistent with what

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:56.710
we expect from thermodynamics.

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:04.920
The one law of thermodynamic
that I cannot prove from what I

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.565
have given you so
far is the third law.

01:15:07.565 --> 01:15:10.280
There is no reason
why the entropy should

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.450
go to 0 as you go
to 0 temperature

01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:14.519
within this perspective.

01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:28.310
So it's good to look at our
canonical example, which

01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:29.560
is the ideal gas.

01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:37.365
Again, for the
ideal gas, if I am

01:15:37.365 --> 01:15:39.740
in a microcanonical
ensemble, it means

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:42.880
that I have told you what
the energy of the box is,

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.250
what the volume of the box
is, and how many particles

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:48.190
are in it.

01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:52.100
So clearly the microstate
that corresponds to that

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.720
is the collection of
the 6N coordinates

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:00.540
and momenta of the
particles in the box.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:05.130
And the energy of
the system is made up

01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:10.150
by the sum of the energies
of all of the particles,

01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:17.700
and basically, ideal gas means
that the energy that we write

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.485
is the sum of the
contributions that you

01:16:20.485 --> 01:16:23.540
would have from
individual particles.

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:26.960
So individual particles
have a kinetic energy

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.810
and some potential
energy, and since we

01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:33.900
are stating that we
have a box of volume v,

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:39.450
this u essentially represents
this box of volume.

01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:43.450
It's a potential that is 0
inside this volume and infinity

01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:44.321
outside of it.

01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:49.230
Fine.

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:53.990
So you ask what's
the probability

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:56.220
of some particular
microstate, given

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.790
that I specified E, v, and n.

01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:02.290
I would say, well, OK.

01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:09.820
This is, by the construction
that we had, 0 or 1

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:16.910
over some omega, depending on
whether the energy is right.

01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:18.910
And since for the
box, the energy

01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:21.250
is made up of the
kinetic energy,

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:32.910
if sum over i p i squared
over 2m is not equal to E,

01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:37.755
or particle q is
outside the box.

01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:51.350
And it is the same value if
sum over i p i squared over 2m

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:56.490
is equal to v and q i's
are all inside the box.

01:18:07.921 --> 01:18:14.230
So a note about normalization.

01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:17.690
I kind of skipped on
this over the last one.

01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:23.400
p is a probability in this
6N dimensional phase space.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:32.820
So the normalization is that the
integral over all of the p i's

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:42.470
and qi's should be equal to 1.

01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:46.640
And so this omega,
more precisely,

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.920
when we are not talking
about discrete numbers,

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.530
is the quantity
that I have to put

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:58.890
so that when I integrate this
over phase space, I will get 1.

01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:03.940
So basically, if I write this
in the form that I have written,

01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:11.830
you can see that omega is
obtained by integrating over

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:18.850
p i q i that correspond
to this accessible states.

01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:27.670
It's kind of like
a delta function.

01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:32.240
Basically, there's huge
portions of phase space

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:38.060
that are 0 probability,
and then there's

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:43.990
a surface that has
the probability that

01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:48.610
is 1 over omega and it is
the area of that surface

01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:52.000
that I have to ensure
is appearing here,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.730
so that when I integrate
over that area of one

01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:59.070
over that area, I will get one.

01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:03.230
Now, the part that corresponds
to the q coordinates

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:06.190
is actually very
simple, because the q

01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:09.340
coordinates have to
be inside the box.

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:12.820
Each one of them has a volume
v, so the coordinate part

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:16.041
of the integral
gives me v to the m.

01:20:16.041 --> 01:20:16.540
OK?

01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:24.170
Now, the momentum
part, the momenta

01:20:24.170 --> 01:20:26.480
are constrained by
something like this.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:38.040
I can rewrite that as sum over
i p i squared equals to 2mE.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:47.290
And if I regard this 2mE as
something like r squared,

01:20:47.290 --> 01:20:49.680
like a radius
squared, you can see

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.310
that this is like
the equation that you

01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:54.620
would have for
the generalization

01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:57.600
of the sphere in 3N dimensions.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.090
Because if I had
just x squared, x

01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:03.030
squared plus y squared
is r squared is a circle,

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:05.140
x squared plus y
squared plus z squared

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:07.700
is r squared is
a sphere, so this

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:15.410
is the hypersphere
in 3N dimensions.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.740
So when I do the
integrations over q,

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:32.880
I have to integrate
over the surface of a 3N

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:45.270
dimensional hypersphere of
radius square root of 2m.

01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:49.744
OK?

01:21:49.744 --> 01:21:54.140
And there is a simple
formula for that.

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:59.800
This surface area,
in general, is

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.460
going to be
proportional to r raised

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:07.880
to the power of
dimension minus 1.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:12.210
And there's the generalization
of 2pi r over 4pi r squared

01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:14.940
that you would have in
two or three dimensions,

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.900
which we will discuss next time.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:22.170
It is 2 to the
power of 3n over 2

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:26.980
divided by 3n over 2 factorial.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.950
So we have the formula
for this omega.

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:34.150
We will re-derive it and
discuss it next time.

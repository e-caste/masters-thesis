00:00:07.776 --> 00:00:11.160
PROFESSOR: All right, let's
resume our discussion.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.850
And we'll finish it for sure
by the end of today.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.715
And as you say, you can tuck
this away for study on your

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:24.010
own or for future reference or
whatever you want to do.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.480
So if we could assign sizes to
atoms and ions, we could do a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.320
lot towards predicting what sort
of structures they might

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.500
form if we knew the
composition.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.680
The composition--

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.000
again, assuming there is only
one type of anion and one type

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.380
of cation, the composition is
determined by the valence.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.320
The composition fixes the ratio
of coordination numbers.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.900
And the structure will have
lowest energy when we have the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.300
maximum number of anions around
cation and vice-versa.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.570
So we're in great shape.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.270
And this is simple, idealized,
but very powerful stuff if we

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.770
knew the sizes that were
assumed by ions.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.800
And that, really, is an absurd
notion, to talk about an atom

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.090
as though it behaved like a
sphere with finite dimensions.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:33.710
If we plotted the density of the
electrons as a function of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.690
distance R from an atom, it
does something like this.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.790
At very small distances, that
defines a shell of a rather

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.090
small volume, so there are
not many electrons.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.170
Rises up to a maximum, and
then tails off gradually.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.710
So what is the radius?

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.176
The maximum in the distribution
of density.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.990
So the notion of radius is
absolutely nonsense in terms

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.640
of the actual distribution
of electrons on the atom.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.710
However, one can get from your
fraction measurements a

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.590
determination of the
lattice constant.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.680
And even with routine methods,
you can get the dimension of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.530
the lattice to extraordinary
precision.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.520
The typical lattice constant
is about 10 Angstroms.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.270
You can get this through routine
methods to plus or

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.550
minus 1 in the fourth
decimal point.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:50.910
So this is a precision of
1 part in 10 to the 5th.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.840
You can get atomic positions
when they are not fixed by

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:11.705
symmetry to get a coordinate to
plus or minus 0.yyyy plus

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:14.200
or minus 1 in good cases.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.920
So that is 1 part in
10 to the 5th.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.170
Missing a factor or
10 somewhere.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.430
This is plus or minus 1.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.075
That's 1 in 10 to the 4th.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.850
So you can get this information
very accurately.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.620
One thing I always like to
point out here is that a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:46.990
thermal expansion coefficient
for most inorganic materials

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.080
is something that never gets
much lower than about 1 or 2

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.410
times 10 to the minus 6.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.210
So if you're going to push the
measurement of a lattice

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.610
constant to the ultimate
accuracy, you'd better have a

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.030
thermometer on the top of the
X-ray generator, or your

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.880
measurement is meaningless.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.190
The thermal expansion can be
more than the uncertainty in

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.420
your measurement.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.360
So you should report, for very
precise measurements, the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.218
temperature at which you
made your measurement.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.220
OK, you can get interionic
distances with very high

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.750
precisions.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.100
And if you look at a series
of compounds--

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.520
and these are the ones that are
discussed in the notes,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.340
which have the rock salt
structure type.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.670
So here is the cation,
here is the anion.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.590
The anion-cation distance is
simply equal to 1/2 of A for

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.840
the rock salt structure.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.400
So that's easy.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.700
You don't even have to know
the atomic positions.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.670
Just measure the lattice
constants.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:01.030
And then you would find, for
example, that R, NA plus R, CL

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.700
is equal to 1/2 of A for NaCl.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.370
Very precisely know the sum.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.640
How do we split this up?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.700
Well, let's look at
another compound.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.780
Let's look at R, NA plus
R for bromine.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.010
And that would be 1/2 of the
lattice constant of NaBr.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.810
Hm.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.890
More data, but we haven't
solved anything.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.220
We have three radii, only
two measurements.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.540
And you can see, if you try to
push this further, you can

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.330
never get enough information
to split up the interionic

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.050
distances into sums of
individual radii in any sort

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.300
of unique fashion.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.070
So you have to start
somewhere.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.120
And there are different sets
of ionic radii that were

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.910
proposed early in the game.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.760
And they are discussed
in the notes.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:13.910
I give you an example of some
of the sums of radii for the

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.430
oxides and sulfides
and selenides of

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.120
the transition metals.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.560
You can see that as the anion
atomic number increases, the

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.620
size of the lattice
constant goes up.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.560
So you could get, for example,
the difference in size between

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.660
a sulfur and an oxygen and the
difference in radius between a

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.920
selenium and a sulfur.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.715
But you could never get
the absolute values.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.570
There are four early
sets of radii.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.950
And they are tabulated for you
part way through the notes.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:04.500
And there's a cautionary
lesson here.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.290
One the early series
of radii--

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.180
see, even the old workers in
this field appreciated the

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.560
role of ionic sizes in
determining structure.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.170
So they wanted to set up

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.030
self-consistent schemes of radii.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.030
And the earliest one is by,
really, the founder of crystal

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.660
chemistry, a man named
Goldschmidt.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.460
Linus Pauling got into the
act very early on.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.360
If you look at this table that
I copied from these separate

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.590
publications, four different
people--

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.130
Goldschmidt, Pauling, Zacharias
and Ahrens.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.270
Some people left out the radii
of certain species.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.190
Other people left out different
radii depending on

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.070
the compounds that
they looked at.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.950
If people looked at the same
ion, they very often got very,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.800
very different values,
depending on

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.170
their starting point.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.640
Look at the size of barium,
for example.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.590
Zacharias said 1.29.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.660
Ahrens said 1.34.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.520
Pauling said 1.35.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.240
Goldschmidt said 1.43.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.930
Depends on the starting
point that they used

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.580
for the initial radius.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.890
And once you've determined
that,

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.280
everything falls into place.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:32.850
Another basis for determining
radii, Bragg determined a

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:38.880
number of the structure of
important silicates.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.970
Why silicates?

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.030
Because as you walk
along the ground,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.500
you're walking on silicates.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.230
These are part of the minerals
that form the Earth's crust,

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.630
so there was a lot of
interest in those.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.520
Bragg, from his early work way
back in the late 1920s, found

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.100
that the size and shape of the
Si04 tetrahedron forms

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.060
tetrahedral coordination because
silicon is so small

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.970
compared to oxygen.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.230
The interionic distances were
always about the same.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.370
The tetrahedron was
always regular.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.520
So what Bragg said was, a-ha,
this is a tough little nut in

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.970
silicate structures.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.910
Doesn't deform.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.330
The size is always the same.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.600
It's always regular.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.680
The reason must be that the
oxygens are just in contact.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.200
So he used the dimensions of an
Si04 tetrahedron, took the

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.320
radius of oxygen as
half the edge.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.950
Pauling used a different
starting point

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.310
that has been followed.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.500
There's still another way
of determining radii.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.380
Is there any physical property
of a material which might also

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.330
be shown to be proportional
to the size of the ion?

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.790
And the answer to that,
which I'll pass

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.880
over quickly, is yes.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.600
Quantity called the ionic
electrical polarizability,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.850
which is the relation between an
applied electric field and

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.130
the dipole moment that is
induced on the atom when you

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:15.560
separate the electron cloud
and the nucleus.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.140
And a simple model shows--

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.780
and this is carried
out for you--

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:30.380
that you can relate the ionic
electronic polarizability to

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.680
the volume of the atom, and it
turns out to be beautifully

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.010
simple, that the polarizability
is simply 4 pi

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.500
epsilon 0 times the radius
of the ion cubed.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:47.510
So therefore, you can split up
ionic radii in proportion to

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.910
the cube root of the
polarizability of the ions.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.000
Well, that trades one
problem for another.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.430
How do you get polarizabilities?

00:10:54.430 --> 00:11:00.230
It turns out that the index of
refraction of materials is

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:07.480
given by the sum of the number
of each species per unit

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.800
volume times the ionic

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.050
polarizability of that species.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:16.530
And there is a famous
equation called the

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.850
Lorentz-Lorenz equation.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:23.040
I can never resist calling
it not the Lorenz-Lorentz

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.250
equation but the Lorenz-Lorentz
equation

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.610
equation because it
sounds like you're

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.140
saying everything twice.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:37.130
If you note that the dielectric
constant of a

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.960
material is related to the
square of the index of

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.640
refraction, instead of n
squared, you can replace the n

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.970
squared by epsilon, the
dielectric constant, and then

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.860
the equations become
known as the

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.720
Clausius-Mossotti equations.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.400
And I always take that as a nice
illustration of the fact

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.760
that a very simple change of
variables can be all it takes

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.722
to become famous and immortal.

00:12:03.722 --> 00:12:04.270
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.570
what happened to Clausius
and Mossotti.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.500
Where do you get
polarizabilities from?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.440
This was looked at by
a number of people.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.540
One of the most complete were
three people, Tessman, Kahn,

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.540
and Wild Bill Shockley
of transistor fame.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.480
So you can find these numbers,
and you can get a

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.520
self-consistent set of radii.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.740
But note in the table that
I give you here that the

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.490
individual numbers are
very different.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:36.600
And two caveats that I have to
issue is you can't mix ionic

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.530
radii in different people's
tables because they have

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.060
different starting assumptions
for the standard radius.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.000
If you do that, you're mixing
apples and oranges.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.660
And I wish I had a cookie for
every half-baked book on

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.440
chemistry that said, hey, Ahrens
has got something for

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.060
americium and Pauling doesn't.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.430
Let me put the value for
americium in there.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.580
Totally wrong that they
are established

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.140
on different bases.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.730
So you can't mix apples
and oranges.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.780
You have to use a
self-consistent set of radii.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.590
The ones that were followed
until very recently are

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.900
Pauling's radii.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.820
And Pauling's radii are based
on a standard radius for

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:26.210
oxygen, which is 1.40
Angstroms for

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.460
the radius of oxygen.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.670
The other thing that I have to
issue as a caveat, which I

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.710
hope you won't forget, is that
radius ratios do a pretty good

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:44.850
job of predicting the expected
coordination number.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.070
But if you are very, very close
to a limiting critical

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.980
radius ratio, all
bets are off.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.430
Because then you're really
asking the question, if I have

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:02.500
this polyhedron of ions, if I
squish them a little bit so

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.130
that I increase the coordination
number, does that

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.250
give me a lower energy in return
for the price that I

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:14.060
have to pay to deform the ions
that I'm packing together?

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.560
And that is not possible to
answer on the basis of a rigid

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.840
sphere model.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.710
So when you're very close to a
critical radius ratio, you

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.900
really can't say for sure
whether the structure will go

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.110
to the lower coordination
number or the higher

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.140
coordination number.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.700
So you have to be
careful of that.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.670
Finally, people have
continued on.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:42.190
And stuck in the margin of
these older radii is a

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:48.670
reference to a paper by two
people, Bob Shannon, who was a

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.380
crystallographer at DuPont,
and Charlie Prewitt.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.260
I'm very proud that he became so
notable, because he was my

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.840
office mate in graduate
school.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.030
So I like to promote his
radii whenever I can.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:07.080
And in Acta Crystallographica in
1969, they published a set

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:15.620
of radii, which is in the nice
typeset version that's Xeroxed

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.470
directly from their paper in
Acta Crystallographica.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:24.060
And the headings need
explanation.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.890
There's the ion and its valence,
then the electron

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.810
configuration.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.600
And what's interesting is that
some of the transition metals,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.870
for example iron, can be in
a high-spin or a low-spin

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.410
configuration depending on
whether the moments on the

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.660
electrons are all parallel
or anti-parallel.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.810
High-spin and low-spin
configurations give ions with

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.910
very, very distinct radii.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.880
So the second column, EC,
stands for Electron

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.030
Configuration.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.310
Then comes coordination
number.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.900
And here is another feature
that we really should not

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:14.280
overlook, that as even
rigid spheres--

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.280
here's an A, and here's a B--

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.880
acquire progressively higher
coordination numbers--

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.580
let's look at just coordination
number three and

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.105
coordination number four,
because they're easy to draw.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.980
In addition to the attractive
force between anion and

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.470
cation, there is also
a repulsive

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:41.850
force between the anions.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.790
So here's the repulsive force
between this B and its

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.750
neighboring B and this B and
its neighboring B. And the

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:54.900
resultant is a force that
tends to push apart

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.720
the A and the B ion.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.770
For four-coordination, remember
first of all, the Bs

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.650
are closer, so the repulsive
force is stronger.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.410
But there are four
of them, as well.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.280
So this turns out to be a
larger repulsive force.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.730
So the conclusion is that the
radius of A would be expected

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:24.790
to go up slightly as the
coordination number increased,

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.800
simply because there is a
repulsive interaction between

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.240
the coordinating Bs.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.380
And that will tend to push them
apart more strongly as

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.970
the coordination goes up.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.930
So the third column in the
Shannon and Prewitt tables is

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.770
coordination number.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:46.200
And if you look at several
ions, they're--

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.740
for example, barium has
6-coordination,

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.840
7-coordination.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.690
8, 9, 10, and even 12.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:58.250
And as you go down that list
of radii, it gets larger as

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.020
the coordination goes up.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.240
And it's a relatively small
effect that's on the order of

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.300
5 or so percent.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.560
But still, when trying to
calculate an interionic

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.950
distance, you should use the
radius that is appropriate for

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.090
the coordination numbers.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.930
The fourth column is spin.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.630
And the spin stands for
high spin or low spin.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.700
And you will find that for the
transition metal atoms--

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.990
for example, CO2 plus low spin
or high spin, and note the

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.640
rather different radii for these
two configurations of

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.410
the electron moments.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:37.878
Yeah.

00:18:37.878 --> 00:18:40.686
AUDIENCE: Under coordination
number, what's the difference

00:18:40.686 --> 00:18:44.785
between 4SQ and just Q?

00:18:44.785 --> 00:18:50.140
PROFESSOR: You would guess
that the lowest energy

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.290
configuration for
four-coordination would be

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.560
tetrahedral, because
that keeps the

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.390
anions most widely separated.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.020
There are cases where the
coordination is plainer.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.350
So the "SQ" stands for square,
and that's unusual.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.590
And you'll notice that that
appears for things like

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:18.040
silver, which has a considerable
covalent

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.800
character to it.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.110
For gold, 3-plus.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.270
That's one of the noble metals,
again, that has a

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.590
considerable covalent
character to it.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.240
So you'll notice that as the
coordination number goes up,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.490
you get a different radius.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:44.020
Now, there are then a set of
numbers, and these are numbers

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.460
that are based on different
starting points.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:57.240
The furthest column to the
right, quote "IR" quote, this

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.430
is based on Pauling's
starting point.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.230
And Pauling's starting point,
if you go way down the list

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:09.090
onto the second page, is that
for 02 minus for oxygen in

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:13.950
six-coordination, the standard
radius from which everything

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:18.010
else hinges is 1.40.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.650
The Pauling radii had been so
commonly used that Shannon and

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:26.810
Prewitt decided to use 1.40,
Pauling's radii.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.060
So all of their numbers are
compatible with the early

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.320
Pauling radii, except they're
based on thousands more

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.570
crystal structure
determinations.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.930
There is another column,
second from the

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.900
right, called CR.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.750
And that stands for
Crystal Radii.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:52.810
And there were two people that
proposed that Pauling's radii

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.880
really didn't give a feel for
the proper sizes of the ions.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.070
And they went on at great
length to explain what

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.750
"proper sizes" is.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.560
And the only difference for the
sizes that are based on,

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.190
quote, "crystal radii" is that
if you go all the way down to

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.540
oxygen, the size of the oxygen
ion in six-coordination is

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.020
given by 1.26.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:23.240
So all of the anions in the
crystal radius column are

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:29.080
smaller by 1.40 minus 1.26.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.290
I can do that in my head.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.990
That's 0.14 Angstroms.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.790
Run down the list.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:38.180
They're 1.4 Angstroms smaller
for the anions.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.340
And the cations are 0.14
Angstroms larger.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.130
So there are two alternative
sets of radii, one based on

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:51.860
the traditional Pauling radii,
1.40 for oxygen in

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:58.600
six-coordination, and the
Fumi-Tosi radii, 1.26, which

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.650
maybe give a better picture
of what the sphere sizes

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.660
actually, quote, "look
like," unquote.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.040
But note the tendencies.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.590
There is a progressive
change--

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.420
whoever's starting point you
use, there's a progressive

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.250
change in size with coordination
number.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.500
And let me give you, if I may,
at this point, give you--

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.010
again, a little knowledge
is a dangerous thing.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:32.890
One of the structures which I
worked on many years ago was a

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.810
puzzle, and this was the
prototype fast ion conductor

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.280
silver iodide.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.880
And nobody had been able to
determine the structure for

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.590
several reasons.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.760
Nobody had ever made a single
crystal of it, and all the

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.110
diffraction data you had
available for the structure

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.830
were five or six intensities.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.040
And there were about seven
parameters necessary to fully

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.890
describe the structure, so
you were out of luck.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.740
We learned how to make
single crystals.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.990
But before that--

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.500
no, he will go nameless.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.125
He said, OK, let's see
what's going on here.

00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:12.670
Oh, we'll get the radius
of silver.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:17.280
We know that in silver iodide,
the iodines are in

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.800
body-centered cubic packing.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.530
And we know what the lattice
constant is, because we got

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.640
that from powder diffraction
data.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.690
Huh, the silver ion is too
big to fit in either the

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.580
tetrahedral interstitial site or
the octahedral interstitial

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.160
site in silver iodide.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.600
So he said, therefore, the
structure has to distort, and

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.410
it's really tetragonal.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.770
But there are going
to be domains.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.400
a tetragonal domain in one
orientation here, a tetragonal

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.580
domain in another orientation
here.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.370
So he gets himself a random
number generator and takes

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:58.000
numbers one, two, and three and
puts it on a cubic lattice

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.080
to determine what the
distortion will be.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.130
Said, hey, I got a bunch of
ones here and a bunch of

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.360
threes here.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.100
This crystal is built
of domains.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.540
And the reason the silver ions
migrate rapidly is that a

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:15.940
domain can pop from one mode of
distortion to another, and

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.360
that's essentially going to
transport the silver ion from

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.760
one end of the domain
to another.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.800
This guy got two papers
out of it.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.370
What he had done was he looked
up the radius of silver in

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.630
Pauling's tables.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:31.870
And he didn't realize that all
of Pauling's original radii

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:39.140
were normalized to octahedral
six-hole coordination, which

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.760
makes the radius larger.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.420
And that's why the silvers
didn't fit in any of the

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.490
interstices.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.660
If you take the tetrahedral
radius for silver, which is

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.040
where it actually sits in the
structure, it fits as snugly

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.210
and nicely as you please in the
tetrahedral interstitial

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.660
site in the body-centered
cubic arrangement.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.980
So this guy made an idiot of
himself because he didn't

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.160
realize the basis on which
these tables had been

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:02.630
established.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.050
But he's nameless, so I
can call him names.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.120
So anyway, again, a little
knowledge can

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.420
be a dangerous thing.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.560
Moving on, in the few minutes
that we have left to devote to

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.810
crystal chemistry.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:22.140
Pauling's radii, and even
better still now, the

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.280
Shannon-Prewitt radii, let you
predict nearest-neighbor

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.690
configurations--

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:34.680
coordination numbers with fair
degree of confidence.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.370
Pauling--

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.890
and this was one of the things
that he received the Nobel

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.860
Prize for--

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.830
proposed a set of five rules
that are called Pauling's

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.050
Rules for ionic structure.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.490
The first thing he said was
something that we've already

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.480
stated, a coordination polyhedra
of anions is formed

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.320
about each cation, and the
cation-anion distance is

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.570
determined by the sum of the
radii, and the coordination

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.490
number is determined
by radius ratio.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.350
So there are three principles
in here.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:12.380
The two most important ones is
that expressing faith in a set

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.660
of radii to determine interionic
distances and the

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.490
fact that if there are radii
that can be assigned to the

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.140
atoms, you can predict a
coordination number.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.770
So that's Pauling's
first rule.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.550
Actually, Pauling's first
rule was first stated by

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.740
Goldschmidt.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.730
But to have a complete listing
of guiding principles, he

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.000
included that there and didn't
claim it was his own.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.160
But then he does something that
is rather interesting.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.790
This is the only one of the
rules that is quantitative.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.470
If you had an ionic structure,
and you could determine its

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:53.360
unit cell, the structure should
be electrically neutral

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.520
if it's composed of ions
that are charged.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.570
So therefore, you would not make
a structure in which all

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.380
the cations were up in one
corner of the cell, and all

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.830
the anions were down in the
opposite end of the cell.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.140
That would be something that
might be electrically neutral,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.660
but it would be a high-energy
configuration.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:17.940
So Pauling's second rule is a
very cute way of expressing

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.880
the fact that a structure
should be atomistically

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.690
electrically neutral, as well
as microscopically.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:29.570
And he did that in the
following way.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:37.970
He said, let us look at the
coordination number the

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.790
cation, A, and look at the
coordination polyhedron.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:54.850
And let's define as the bond
strength, S, as the ratio of

00:27:54.850 --> 00:28:01.020
the cation charge plus Q divided
by the coordination

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.720
number of A.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.130
And then he said that in a
stable structure, if we look

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:14.810
at the anion, the sum of all
the bonds donated to--

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:19.230
he visualize the charge being
donated to the anion.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:24.980
The sum of all of the bonds from
the same cations or from

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.870
different cations, if that's the
nature of the structure,

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.525
should be equal to the
charge of the anion.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.680
So let me say "cation" here.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:45.070
So it's a cute way of
expressing local

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.320
electroneutrality.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.930
Actually, that's been superseded
by an extension of

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.510
this general principle.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:02.340
And I may not have time to
discuss it today, but I'll

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.730
give you a handout next time.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:04.900
It's not in the notes, either.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.800
This is a relatively recent tool
that most people are not

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:14.210
familiar with, so I'll return
to it briefly next time.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:21.840
The next rule says, OK, we
know how to determine the

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.090
coordination numbers.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:32.140
To describe the structure, we
should be able to say how

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.840
these coordination polyhedra
fit together.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.730
So looking at the coordination
numbers--

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.490
well, let me do a
three-dimensional case,

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.890
because that's the realistic
situation.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.920
Let's suppose we have
coordination number eight,

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.040
which we often do.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.990
And besides, that's
easy to draw.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.130
So he says that in a stable
structure, the coordination

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:59.760
polyhedra tend to
share corners.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:09.780
And I might say also that they
tend to have the line between

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.970
cation, anion, cation to be a
straight line, as opposed to

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.220
sharing edges.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:28.890
So for eight-coordination, this
might be a pair of cubic

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.850
coordination polyhedra
sharing edges.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:39.430
And especially corner sharing
is more favorable

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.680
than sharing faces.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.380
It's a very specific statement
on how the coordination groups

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.380
whose geometry is determined by
size should fit together in

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.210
a structure.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.290
And it has a very
simple basis, an

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.410
almost trivial basis.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:03.200
As the polyhedra of the given
size share corners and then

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.780
edges and then faces, the
cations inside of these

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.600
polyhedra are progressively
getting

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.720
closer and closer together.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.890
And clearly, that increases
the repulsive energy.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:21.850
So the cations are most widely
separated if not faces, not

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.360
edges, but corners tend
to be shared.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.660
Puckered a little bit.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:31.010
Maybe this is not exactly
a 180-degree bond angle.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.590
But corner sharing is
still favorable.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.370
And rule D is essentially an
appendix to that, and it says,

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.680
and how, if the charge of the
cation is high and the

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.640
coordination number is low, the
higher the charge of the

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.520
cations, the stronger that
repulsive interaction.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.830
The smaller the coordination
number of the cation, the

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:01.670
closer together they become in,
let's say, face sharing

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:05.500
for tubes as opposed to face
sharing for tetrahedra.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.400
The lower the coordination
number, the closer together

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.780
the cations come, regardless
of the precise shape of the

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.370
coordination polyhedra.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:18.840
So rule D says, and how for
high charge and low

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.090
coordination number.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.240
The last rule, sometimes
called the "rule of

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:30.030
parsimony," the "rule of
stinginess," says that the

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.200
number of different kinds
of atoms in a

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.020
structure tends to be small.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.630
You can read in two different
interpretations of the term

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:46.840
"different kinds of cations,"
and both of them are right.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.460
You could mean different
in terms of

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.300
different chemical species.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.160
In other words, if you take
a pot and dump half of the

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.480
elements in the periodic table
into the pot, melt it up, and

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.400
then cool it down to crystallize
the phase, you're

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.930
not going to incorporate
all of those ions

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.200
into one crystal structure.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.520
They have different sizes.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.490
They have different coordination
polyhedra.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.270
The different coordination
polyhedra

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:18.950
have different sizes.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:22.160
So to try to fit all of those
things together in one

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.870
structure is just going to
cost you a lot of energy.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.450
It's going to be much more
efficient to form two or more

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:32.100
phases, which have much lower
energy, and then pay the price

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.360
of an interface between them.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.520
So have a chemically complex
melt or solution, you're going

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.710
to get different phases.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.210
You want to incorporate
everything into one structure.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.230
The other interpretation of
different is in terms of their

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.645
coordination number and their
coordination polyhedra.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.680
If the size is such that a
particular cation wants to

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.590
have tetrahedral coordination,
you would expect them all to

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:03.500
have tetrahedral coordination
and not have a mixture of

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.750
cubes and tetrahedra
and octahedra.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.989
If it works for one coordination
through the

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:12.330
chemical species, it'll
work for them all.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:20.960
That rule tends to have some,
but not terribly many,

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.850
exceptions.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:25.360
But there are cases where
you find two different

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.389
coordination numbers.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:33.340
But very often, that's because
of a covalent character.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.929
So there's some discussion
and elaboration of

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:37.870
each of those rules.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.400
I'm just about out of
time, and therefore

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.420
out of crystal chemistry.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:48.320
Another entirely different
approach to structure is to

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:56.389
say that the anions are
the big things.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:35:03.390
And if the energy of the
structure is lowered by taking

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:09.660
ions of like charge and getting
them as close as

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:14.790
possible to the larger ions,
say the anions of opposite

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:19.040
charge, there is a strategy for
making the arrangement.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.720
And I think it's the same
strategy that I use when I'm

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.350
packing a suitcase for a trip.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:27.050
Take the big things--

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.440
the books, the shoes--

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.130
and arrange them
in the suitcase

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.040
as densely as possible.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.140
Then I take the little things--
the toothbrush, the

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.590
socks, and so on--

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:41.040
and I stick them into the
interstices that are left.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.470
And this other view of examining
structures and

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:48.020
interpreting says
the same thing.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.810
Take the big things--

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.090
not the shoes but the anions--

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.790
and arrange them as densely
as possible.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.320
And this gets into
the question of

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.040
close packing of spheres.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.260
Then take the little guys, the
tiny little cations, and stuff

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.120
them into the holes that
are left in the

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.030
close-packed arrays.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:10.720
So another way of interpreting
structures and predicting

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.640
structures is to look at the
sort of interstices that exist

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.010
in a close-packed array.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.990
Regardless of the stacking
sequence of spheres, there are

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.440
always two kinds of interstitial
sites, one

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.910
tetrahedral, one octahedral.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:31.400
And there are two common, but
not exclusive, types of

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.790
packing arrangements, which
you probably know.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:38.310
There is the cubic close
packed array.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:41.490
There's a little diagram of
close-packed sheets here.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:45.230
And there are two sorts of
interstices shown in the

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:49.690
figure on the first page
of the notes on packing

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:50.730
considerations.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.160
There's one set of triangles
that points in one orientation

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.850
that forms a hollow in which
you can drop down a second

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.210
layer of spheres, another
triangle that is the closest

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:01.870
triangle to the first
one that points in

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:03.900
the opposite direction.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.440
Each represents a potential
location for the next

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.620
close-packed sheet, but those
two different locations are

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.800
too close together
to both be used.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.790
So you have to pick
one or another.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.400
And if you label those three
different locations A, B, and

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:25.830
C, any arrangement of spheres
that does not place two

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.190
letters in succession will
give you a close-packed

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.660
arrangement with exactly
the same density.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:39.280
So ABC AC, AC, ABC, AC, AC is
a packing of close-packed

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.750
spheres that is exactly the same
density as AB, AB, which

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:48.100
is hexagonal close packed, or
ABC, ABC, ABC, which could be

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.490
shown to be the face-centered
cubic structure.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.890
So that is another way of
looking at structures.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.400
And specifying the space
filling in simple ionic

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.910
structures is another way of
looking at structures.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.770
And at that point, I'll quit.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.460
There are some examples of
close-packed structures and

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.890
derivatives thereof that
form the last pictures.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:12.640
And I'm going to stop and suck
in air and mention as one last

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.740
thought that only five
of Pauling's

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.190
rules are stated here.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.780
There was a sixth Pauling's
rule, and that's

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:21.820
not commonly listed.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.540
And I'll tell you what it is.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.960
The sixth rule says, massive
doses of vitamin C can cure

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.210
the common cold.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.970
Actually, that was something
that Pauling pushed.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.110
And interestingly, about three
years before he passed away,

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.620
Pauling came to MIT and gave
a lecture in 6120.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.940
And as you might expect of MIT
undergraduates, after he

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.410
finished his lecture, there
were a few questions.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.710
But there were about a dozen
students who came up with

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.540
bottles of vitamin C and
asked Pauling to

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.350
autograph them for them.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:59.800
And he did so with good humor
and thought he had perhaps won

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.990
a few converts in the process.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.880
So that's it.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.230
Getting silly, so it's time
for all of us to go home.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.070
DUANE BONING: OK, so today
we're going to talk about some

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.800
of the probability models
associated with variation

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.260
in manufacturing processes.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.880
The last couple
of classes, we've

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.040
tried to go and do two things.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.070
One is give you a little
bit of perspective

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.370
on a couple of
different kinds of--

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.140
or actually, a
fairly wide family

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.930
of manufacturing
processes, give you

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.420
a little bit of exposure
to semiconductor processes

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.070
as well as a couple of
different mechanical--

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.100
mechanically-oriented
processes, and give you

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.340
some ideas or ways to think
about those processes,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.250
including just the physical
action that's going on,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.350
as well as some of the
sources of variation.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.200
So we're going to
dive in a little bit

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.530
today on dealing with data
taken from some manufacturing

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.230
processes, and start to look
at random components of that

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.330
and systematic
components of that.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.210
But back on the theme
of trying to make sure

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.120
that you have at least some
exposure, given everybody's

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.730
different backgrounds,
to these processes,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.970
we would like to make sure
you have the opportunity

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.370
to at least see a couple
of the kinds of tools

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.360
and equipment in
the facilities--

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.010
especially those associated with
semiconductor manufacturing,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.985
if you haven't
previously seen those.

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.360
So let me turn it
over to Hayden,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.520
who can check in with
you well the problem

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.100
is that as well, but also
about arranging opportunities

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.770
for you to see a little bit
more, if you would like.

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:11.320
HAYDEN TAYLOR: So yes,
on the problem set, well,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.990
if you still have
questions about it,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.350
then feel free to
email or call today.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.810
See me afterwards.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.890
And problem set 2 is
now up on the website.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.330
That's due on Tuesday,
the 26th of this month.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.260
So there's a bit
longer for that,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.960
and I'm willing to start
helping you with that too.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.860
So thank you.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.050
DUANE BONING: Any
questions for Hayden?

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.170
Any big issues with
the problem set?

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.970
AUDIENCE: Actually, I have a--

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.928
DUANE BONING: Go ahead.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.670
HAYDEN TAYLOR: OK.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.212
AUDIENCE: So I have
a quick question.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:54.080
So if you can refer to the
Question 3 of the Problem Set

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.090
1, and you say it's proportional
to the water and the time--

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.390
the KOH.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.880
And when you talk about
these [INAUDIBLE],,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.010
you're talking about
the concentration

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.835
or you're talking
about the molarity?

00:03:13.237 --> 00:03:15.530
HAYDEN TAYLOR: What am I
saying is proportional to KOH.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.170
DUANE BONING: The square
brackets around the KOH.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.120
HAYDEN TAYLOR: Oh, I see.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.245
AUDIENCE: The very last
figure [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:20.730
HAYDEN TAYLOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.030
AUDIENCE: --proportional.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.140
The [? edge 3 ?]
is proportional.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.395
So it's proportional
to the concentration,

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:27.825
or it's proportional
to the molarity?

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:36.060
HAYDEN TAYLOR: Well, for a
fixed volume, it's the same.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.070
There are two
lines on that plot,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.970
and the models that are
put forward by [? Seidel ?]

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.080
to explain the data.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.070
The data are the open
circles on that plot.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.950
And there are two models
that have plotted.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.720
And what I want you
to use are primarily

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.530
the experimental data.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.850
So look at the curved line
that is plotted on that graph.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.150
AUDIENCE: OK and for
the curved line that you

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.350
want us to look at, the x-axis
should be the concentration,

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.850
right?

00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:14.570
HAYDEN TAYLOR: That's right.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.050
Yes, the x-axis--

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.925
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:18.355
HAYDEN TAYLOR: --is
the weight of KOH.

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:19.730
In other words,
that's the number

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.315
of grams of KOH
per gram of water.

00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:25.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
just want to clarify.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.350
That's it.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.876
HAYDEN TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:27.312
Thank you.

00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:27.750
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.250
Thank you.

00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:29.612
HAYDEN TAYLOR: Anybody else?

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.110
OK.

00:04:35.168 --> 00:04:36.960
DUANE BONING: I was
just also going to say,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.670
it's sort of a
manufacturing process

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.950
that we use for making
up these problem sets.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.360
And they are not expected to
be completely defect-free,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.740
so we expect part
of the process is

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.670
detecting errors or questions.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.350
And then we try to correct them.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.910
Also, as a follow-up to that the
schedule for the next problem

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.090
set, just looking ahead for
the next couple of weeks,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.090
the reason that the problem
set is due not next Thursday,

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.040
but rather, the
Tuesday after that--

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.840
a little bit longer
than a week--

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.220
is that here at MIT, next
Monday, this coming Monday

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.670
is President's Day, a holiday.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.060
And then Tuesday is one
of these strange days.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.940
You folks out in Singapore--
you may recall this.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.810
Tuesday is a Monday.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.370
So it's on a Monday
class schedule,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.490
so we will not be meeting.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.540
OK?

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.090
Go to whatever classes you
would normally have on Monday.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.020
Go to those on Tuesday
out here to MIT.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.790
And so then our next lecture
will be a week from today,

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.160
on Thursday.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.350
OK, so also going
with the material

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.940
that we're starting
to talk about now

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.500
and the second problem set
that's just been released

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.230
is another reading assignment.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.150
And in particular,
what we're trying

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.090
to do this year is focus--

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.980
do sort of the concentrated dive
of May and Spanos Chapter 4.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.840
In the past, sometimes
we've assigned

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.110
instead Chapters 2
and 3 of Montgomery,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.140
which are much longer.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.580
Chapter 4 in Spanos
is a shorter overview

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.000
of basic statistical
distributions

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.030
and some very basic manipulation
and use of statistics

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.300
that we'll talk about today.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.640
So we're not formally assigning
chapters 2 and 3 in Montgomery,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.380
but the intent here--

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.840
what I mean by this
reading assignment is,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.210
if you don't have very much
background on statistics,

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.760
you may want to read
Chapters 2 and 3.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.710
Or you can skim
them to know what's

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.790
in there, and in particular,
that's probably the right place

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.440
to go for a longer explanation,
if you need more material.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.370
If May and Spanos
is too condensed

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.950
for you or you'd like
additional examples,

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.630
there's a very nice
articulation in Montgomery.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.340
Now, I have not made a formal
assignment of May and Spanos

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:29.640
Chapter 3, but that
is where you should

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.400
go if you want to
read more or need

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.990
to read more about semiconductor
fabrication process physics.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.570
That chapter is a
very nice, again,

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.170
relatively condensed
description,

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:51.180
articulation of the key process
steps used in microfabrication.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.510
We'll, throughout the
term, be popping in and out

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.340
of a few of those
unit processes,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.640
and I just want you to be aware
that's what's in that chapter.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.310
And you will quite likely want
to go in and skim that or read

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.050
that, and dive in
on some of those

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.080
processes if you
need more background

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.230
on some of those things.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.220
And I think, especially
before this tour

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.290
that Hayden is organizing,
it'd be at least really good

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.470
to skim chapter 3.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.240
Again, it's mostly on
the process physics,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.907
but every now and
then, it does at least

00:08:25.907 --> 00:08:30.030
show you a little bit about
the equipment that's used.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.070
And it's very nice to be able--

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.860
for Hayden to be able to
point to some of the equipment

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.000
and components of that, and have
you visualize what's going on

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.400
in the process physics, or
be able to ask questions

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.120
about that.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.260
OK, so what I'm going
to do here at the start

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.120
is just run through
some example processes.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.190
And in particular, these
are little not quite

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.960
manufacturing processes.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.950
They are more like research
scale implementations

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.650
of some basic manufacturing
processes that we have actually

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.650
generated some data from, or
students have generated data

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.460
from over the years.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.880
So I'm going to show you
some actual measurements

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.580
from a few simple cases.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.040
And we're going to
look at that data,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:29.330
and what I think we're
going to see is variation.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.860
And the puzzle for
you and for us--

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.680
and to some extent,
for me, because

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.930
in many of these
processes, I was not

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.280
involved in the
generation of the data--

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.520
our puzzle here is
to look at the data

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.620
and try to think about what
might be going on in the data.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.990
So here's some-- a
basic turning process.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.660
So we've got a work piece.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:59.990
We've got under computerized
numerical controls, CNC.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:06.620
We've got the ability to cut
into that work piece, which

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.220
is rotating, to try to get
to diameter work pieces

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:15.120
of a specified dimension.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.880
So here's the diameter measured
on a particular location

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.750
on that work piece
as a function of 47--

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.570
I think it's 47 or 48--

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.370
different repetitions.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.300
Now, I believe this
may have involved

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.230
more than one set of students,
or more than one class.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.020
We can think of that
as a shift change

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.600
in a manufacturing process.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.870
We're simply gathering here
a measurement of a diameter

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.120
on that work piece.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.390
So talk to me.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.520
Tell me what you see.

00:10:55.767 --> 00:10:56.350
Is it uniform?

00:10:58.915 --> 00:11:00.700
Not especially--
although you always

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.620
have to be really
careful looking,

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.950
because on any kind
of plot, you want

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.600
to really look at the spread.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.410
Here it's kind of magnified,
because here's 0.7 inches,

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:22.510
and we're down to about
0.697 up to 0.702.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.790
That's not full scale.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.460
But if we zoom in around
whatever nominal is--

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.380
and in fact, it's not even clear
what the target dimension was--

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.690
I might guess and think
that it was 0.7 inches,

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.410
because that's a nice round
number, but who knows?

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.780
So it's definitely not uniform.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.000
What else do you see?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.262
Yeah?

00:11:43.262 --> 00:11:46.542
AUDIENCE: The data is sort
of drifting up over time.

00:11:46.542 --> 00:11:47.250
DUANE BONING: OK.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.910
So it looks like there might
be a long-term trend of a drift

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.840
over the number of runs.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.330
What might lead you to
think that that would

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.264
be a physically reasonable--

00:12:00.264 --> 00:12:04.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:07.277 --> 00:12:08.110
DUANE BONING: Right.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.240
So if the tool wears-- and
in fact, if the tool wears

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.380
or some long-term change in
the state of the equipment--

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.220
that's often the source
of these long-term trends.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.780
Other things people see--

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.210
Yeah?

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.710
AUDIENCE: It's
fairly systematic.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.110
It constantly goes up and
down, and up and down.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.080
There's only two or three
points before it goes back up.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.450
DUANE BONING: Yeah,
that's very interesting.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.030
Even the variation here--

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:46.220
it seems to be cyclical,
or periodic, or something

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.980
systematic going on in there.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.270
Again, I wasn't there for
the generation of this data,

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.190
but what might some
reasons for that be?

00:12:58.495 --> 00:12:59.995
AUDIENCE: The worker
might be trying

00:12:59.995 --> 00:13:03.260
to correct with
the subsequent one,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.467
and he overshoots constantly.

00:13:05.467 --> 00:13:06.800
DUANE BONING: Interesting-- yes.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.100
That's a good idea.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.000
I guess, in fact, one
can imagine, especially

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.670
if you're taking a
measurement after every tool,

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:25.240
and the target was 0.7, say,
then maybe, near the beginning,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.917
we're starting to
see a deviation.

00:13:26.917 --> 00:13:28.750
Maybe this one was a
little low, and they're

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.903
trying to get back up, making
an overcorrection-- because

00:13:32.903 --> 00:13:35.320
near the end here, it looks
like there's a little bit more

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.464
centered around 0.7.

00:13:37.464 --> 00:13:39.089
AUDIENCE: I think
that might be because

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:41.570
of backlash [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:44.922 --> 00:13:45.630
DUANE BONING: OK.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.030
DUANE BONING: So backlash
being an operator adjustment

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.620
that is made as perhaps part
of this compensation strategy?

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.625
DUANE BONING: Interesting--

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:00.593
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.190
DUANE BONING: Anybody
in Singapore--

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.410
any other observations or ideas?

00:14:11.858 --> 00:14:14.180
AUDIENCE: Since
measurement is measured

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.070
at a different
place of the things,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:22.090
so maybe you can see
every three point

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.500
will be a larger diameter.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:30.980
I think maybe this is
measured at the other side

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.050
of the thing [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.280
And maybe for the lower--
for the smaller diameter,

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.320
it's measured in the inner side.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.600
DUANE BONING: Yes,
it's quite possible--

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.960
at least on this plot.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.940
We might learn more if
we look at more data.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.380
I read this as run number,
rather than measurement number.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.520
So somehow, perhaps,
this is intended

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.620
to be representative
of the whole part,

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.590
but it's possible those
are multiple measurements

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.060
on different part--

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.520
portions of an overall turning.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.490
You could start to look
and hypothesize on that.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:16.440
Is the 1, 2, 3-- is that the
same pattern you see each time?

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.610
And it's not clear whether we
see exactly that same pattern

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.140
or not.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.375
Other ideas?

00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:26.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:29.857 --> 00:15:30.690
DUANE BONING: Right.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:35.440
So run number is a stand-in for
time, and these are occurring.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.770
So your point here is--

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.702
DUANE BONING: Sure.

00:15:39.702 --> 00:15:40.597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:40.597 --> 00:15:41.430
DUANE BONING: Right.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.560
So it may not be
equipment state,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.220
or indirectly, it may be
also the rest of the facility

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.470
environment or the line.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.370
And over time, who knows?

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.760
Maybe this thing
starts heating up,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.700
or the work pieces
that are coming in

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.560
have a different temperature--

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.880
quite possible that there could
be some other long-term state

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.040
change.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.760
We do notice there's
this shift change.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.770
And referring back to
this long-term trend,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.520
if we actually look
at this early part,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.550
it may or may not be
drifting that much.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.440
It may actually
be fairly steady.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.570
And what we're
actually seeing in here

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:29.010
is an overall mean shift, but
maybe not even a long-term

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:29.710
trend.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.600
So one might actually
pose, maybe even apply

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.370
some statistical
methods to look and say,

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.480
is there a statistically
significant mean difference

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.020
between this set and
this set of data?

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.040
So it may look like
a long-term trend,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.670
or it may simply be a
reflection that there

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.360
is a setup change on
the equipment when

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.160
a new shift comes
in, or there may

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.850
be just inherent differences
in how the operator interacts

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.050
with the equipment.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.202
How they load the part
might be slightly different.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.470
Any other ideas?

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.525
Let's go back to the--

00:17:12.525 --> 00:17:13.900
because I think
you had mentioned

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:20.170
something interesting about
possible oscillation in here.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:26.680
What might other sources or
causes of oscillatory behavior,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:34.290
or what looks like two
distinct sets of data here--

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.447
in fact, I'm not completely sure
that it's purely oscillatory,

00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:39.030
because you can come
down here, and it

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.150
seems like sometimes
you've got two things that

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.380
are down low, and then one up,
or three things that are low,

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.250
and one up.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.250
AUDIENCE: Well, this is
a little bit farfetched,

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.570
but maybe you could have
[? stock ?] material

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.260
of maybe 1 meter,
and they always

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.310
cut it into three pieces.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.390
So they always have the first
piece of stock material,

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.630
and they had some
material properties that

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.240
led to have [INAUDIBLE] maybe.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.550
And the middle piece led
to middle dimensions,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.520
and the last piece led
to smaller dimensions.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.270
DUANE BONING: I like that.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.980
That might be very interesting.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.050
So if I were generalizing
that, it may well be--

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.920
very often, there may
be more than one set

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.200
of starting material.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.600
So it may have been all one
piece and cut into three,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.500
and so they're randomly
picking one of the three,

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.170
and therefore, you're getting
a different mix of those three

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.330
points in here.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.420
But in general, it may
well be in many cases

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:45.090
that you've got two
different incoming streams.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.950
If I were looking at this,
instead of thinking of three,

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:54.240
it kind of almost looks to me
like this set of data here--

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.060
it's kind of randomly
around some value,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.850
and this is a different set of
data around some other value.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:05.010
So it may be that there's just
two boxes apart sitting there,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.340
and they're just pulling,
randomly, starting material out

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.060
of one of the two.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.100
Yeah?

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.683
AUDIENCE: I also
don't know if there's

00:19:12.683 --> 00:19:15.455
any control on how far from
the [INAUDIBLE] the materials

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:18.270
[INAUDIBLE] you could put it
in, be a little bit farther,

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.220
and then it would have
a larger cantilever

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.200
arm than the next user.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.390
DUANE BONING: Right, right.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.810
So there could be
lots of sources

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.630
of both random and
deterministic variations.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:34.980
So we talked in here about
things like a mean shift.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.850
Maybe there's a deviation
between these two shift

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.400
changes.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.580
And that would be a
either deterministic or--

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.290
systematic maybe is a
better word of a deviation.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.080
And then, within
different sets, we

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.550
may have no detailed
explanation of why

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.970
we have these small
deviations, and a random model

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.850
for some of those components
might be appropriate.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.460
So that's part of the
idea that we're after.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:13.980
So over here on the side, we're
just referring back again to

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.300
of our variation equation.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.803
Maybe I'll put that
up so that we can also

00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:20.970
refer to that, because I
think we've touched on some

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.906
of these different components.

00:20:24.906 --> 00:20:28.080
We said that our
deviations in our output

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.510
y you can often characterize
as some component that

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:39.060
has a sensitivity to
disturbances in our process

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:44.250
parameters, and
those disturbances,

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:50.370
and some component that
relates to our controllability

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.370
when we make small
changes [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.230
and then control inputs.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.460
Among other things,
we said, well,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.320
maybe some of our input
feedstock, maybe delta a's--

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.547
changes in the parameters.

00:21:06.547 --> 00:21:08.880
We also-- and I thought it
was very interesting, talking

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.080
about overcompensation
in the control scenario.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.640
It might be, in
fact, that there are

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.928
deviations or errors in
active control, changes

00:21:19.928 --> 00:21:20.595
to the settings.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.280
There may also be-- and we
also talked about it here--

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:35.400
is recognition that the function
y of our alpha may, in fact,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:42.800
be time-dependent, or that--

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.190
put it another way--

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:49.760
some of the delta a's have
time components and time trends

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.460
to them.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.270
We'll come back, and I'm sure
come up with more examples

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.680
as we look a little bit further.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.850
And I think this is some
of the same process.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:07.880
It has different run numbers
on it, but this is explicitly--

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.370
it looks like there's,
again, a dimension and run

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.870
number along the horizontal
axis, but in this case,

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.940
there's the yellow, our
inner; the purple, our middle;

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.310
and the blue, our
outer dimensions.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.180
So you can imagine here
that perhaps measurements

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:30.160
are being made at different
locations on the work piece.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.650
And I believe that
this line right here

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.970
is, again, a shift change.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.920
So talk to me a
little bit about this.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.610
What else do we
notice in this case?

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:49.070
There's one important
difference in this data compared

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:54.530
to this data that I'm
looking for in particular.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.350
What additional
characteristics-- or what else

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.170
could you say about this data?

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:04.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I guess
the spread on the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:11.512 --> 00:23:12.220
DUANE BONING: OK.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.150
So one observation is,
if we were just looking--

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.130
well, right here,
this is a good one,

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.860
where inner, middle, and
outer are all close together.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.200
But your point is,
generally, we're

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.770
seeing a very huge
spread in the measurement

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:33.590
within that particular
part than we do over here.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.930
DUANE BONING: Much
tighter band--

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.693
so now you're talking
like a band here?

00:23:45.693 --> 00:23:49.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.700
DUANE BONING: Good, good--

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.540
yep?

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:07.405 --> 00:24:08.780
DUANE BONING:
Interesting-- yeah,

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.540
so it's a situation
here where we don't know

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.950
the specifications, so it's a
little hard to actually know

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.000
which is better--

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.950
because your point you were
making is, in this case,

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.160
the blue's always above--

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.860
or almost always
above the purple,

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.940
always above the yellow.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.190
And it may well
be that it's meant

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.620
to have a slight taper to it.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.505
We'd need to more.

00:24:31.505 --> 00:24:33.380
And actually, that's a
really important point

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.310
in manufacturing processes.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.580
You can't just look at
the data and always know

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.310
what's going on.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.880
You also have to have
information from design,

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:46.190
know what the
intended results are.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.310
So certainly, just
to highlight a couple

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:55.730
of the things
[INAUDIBLE] mentioned,

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.580
one here is, very
often, we are also

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.700
interested in within
part variation.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.820
So assuming that
maybe they all really

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.740
were supposed to have
the same dimension,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:11.780
then this spread here is
very different than this

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.530
spread here.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.770
So characterization of
within part variation

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.170
may be very important
in understanding that.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:25.390
And then the other thing
here is, unlike this--

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.220
we still have all
that gook on here,

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.960
but in here we were basically
having a similar band,

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.590
and it was all just kind
of moving or shifting.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.730
But the part-to-part variation
did not seem to change.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.740
The variance of the process
did not seem to change.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.770
The mean shifted.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.690
So that's a very
common characteristic

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.080
that we're worried about.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.680
And your point here
is that, in this case,

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.960
this looks like a much tighter
band, or the standard deviation

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.640
of the invariance of the
process in a run-to-run sense

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.080
is very different
than in this process.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.040
And so it may be somebody with
a slightly steadier hands,

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.540
or a more consistent process,
or a more consistent operator,

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.660
or the equipment-- maybe
some change was made--

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.610
improvement to the
equipment saying,

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.640
hm, that little screw
is a little loose.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.160
Let me tighten that down.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.120
Who knows?

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.980
But something clearly
changed in order

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.973
to apparently
improve the process.

00:26:31.973 --> 00:26:33.765
So those are a couple
more characteristics.

00:26:33.765 --> 00:26:34.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.870
DUANE BONING: Yes-- question?

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:36.745
AUDIENCE: Professor--

00:26:36.745 --> 00:26:37.650
DUANE BONING: Yes?

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.770
AUDIENCE: Since you
mentioned that maybe

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.740
with the shift change
there's some improvement

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.350
in the [INAUDIBLE]
of data, and that's

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:49.390
why it gives us a
smaller band right now.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:53.510
But I noticed that the outer,
middle, and inner data--

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.710
they are pretty
close to each other,

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:59.600
as in the difference between
these three sets of data

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.320
are much wider in the previous
shift than in this right now.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.300
So can we still say
that maybe this--

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.870
the object we are
measuring is tapered?

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.780
Because it doesn't look
like it's tapered right now.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:18.740
DUANE BONING: Absolutely--
well, but the point

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.770
was made that we don't actually
know the design intent,

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.710
so this was a
hypothesis in here.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.740
I think it's probably
unlikely that there

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.890
was an intended taper,
and I'll agree with you.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:35.450
But in here, it
looks like there is

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:40.430
somewhat closer within
part correspondence

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.560
in these dimensions.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.848
OK, so let me go to one more.

00:27:46.848 --> 00:27:47.640
Here's another one.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.220
This is brake bending
of a metal sheet.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.610
The basic idea in
this process is

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:57.840
we're trying to change the
geometry under the application

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.310
of force in a bending process.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.660
So we might have some tooling.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.980
We have some piece of metal,
say, and we press down,

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.880
and the intent is to create
some permanent deformation

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.990
in the part.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.940
An important component
here is that, when

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.700
we remove that force,
remove that pressure,

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.120
there can be spring
back in that part--

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:31.040
so little bit of the inherent
characteristics of this.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.320
And so here's some data looking
at using the same tooling,

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:42.880
and I believe the same
set of downforce, with--

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:48.420
I believe this is a measurement
of the resulting angle.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.670
Alpha is not a good
variable to use here, is it?

00:28:53.790 --> 00:29:02.790
We call that just angle of
the resulting component.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.660
And what else is changing here
is that the source material

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.170
is changing.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:12.630
So in some cases, we're using
aluminum, some cases steel--

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.900
and also with
different thicknesses.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.520
So I won't even
ask you to share--

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:26.040
the most obvious observation is,
depending on the material type,

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.050
we certainly get different
angles, different degrees

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.120
of spring back.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.870
That's the most obvious thing.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:41.200
What else do you see in this?

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.280
Yeah?

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.142
AUDIENCE: It depends on the
thickness of the material.

00:29:45.142 --> 00:29:45.850
DUANE BONING: OK.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.040
AUDIENCE: So for the
same material [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.570
the springback, it will be more.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.470
DUANE BONING: Right.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:00.130
OK, and one could certainly
imagine good physical reasons

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.870
for that, that
thicker material is

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:11.590
going to perhaps spring
back more readily.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.810
And one could even
go off and imagine

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.380
trying to build a first
principle physical model that

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.140
would tell you what
the resulting angle

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.080
or degree of spring back would
be as a function of that.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.440
And in fact, it's
probably worth it

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.150
to go and consult
some literature

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.320
and see if there is
physical insight.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.850
But if I were to ask you to
actually tell me what you think

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:44.660
the result might be if we
had a 0.45-inch steel part,

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.090
what would your
first inclination be?

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.540
Would it be to go to
the technical literature

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.820
and look up a physical
model for this?

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:01.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] averaging
between the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.500
DUANE BONING: Yeah.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.870
You would be basically
using some averaging

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.970
to deal with noise and
manufacturing variation,

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:12.370
but you would be building a very
simple empirical model based

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:16.090
on the data that you have, and
then interpolating in some way.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.230
And here we've only
got two data points,

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.890
so you might pick the middle.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.030
We don't know.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.090
You might want to actually
go and design some experiment

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.840
where you add a
third point so you

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.070
know if there's some non-linear
dependence, and so on.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.410
So that's certainly
an important thing.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.560
There is a very
clear input-output,

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.180
a deterministic effect
that, again, you

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.730
would like to be able to
understand enough to be

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.160
able to deal with that.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:51.090
And the same may also be true of
other discrete design choices--

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.408
discrete choice
being the material,

00:31:53.408 --> 00:31:54.700
whether it's aluminum or steel.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.895
You would like to know,
is it a similar trend?

00:31:58.895 --> 00:32:00.270
One thing that's
very interesting

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.850
here is it appears
that the delta

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.500
as a function of
those thicknesses

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.830
is about the same--
very nearly the same

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.300
in the two material cases.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.470
And then there's
a material delta.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.850
So I'm already
starting to think, OK,

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:21.990
I can have a very simple
additive empirical model that

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.960
has a delta effect due
to the material type.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.270
It's a binary choice--

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.550
or a binary coefficient,
depending on that.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.690
And then an additional component
is a function of thickness,

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:36.960
and maybe that function of
the thickness is independent.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.080
That delta from amine is
independent [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.140
material type.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.620
OK, anything else going on?

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.375
Yes?

00:32:45.375 --> 00:32:51.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
there is kind

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.248
of a drop in the
middle of the set.

00:32:55.996 --> 00:32:56.820
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.240
DUANE BONING: Yes--
very interesting,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.480
and maybe a hint almost of
something, but then it--

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.020
yeah.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.810
So there might be something
systematic going on there.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.500
The human eye is wonderful for
looking for patterns, isn't it?

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.750
Actually, one of
the challenges often

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:23.640
is using both engineering
judgment and when

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.030
the data is simple enough
to detect trends, but also

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:30.930
have statistical methods when
the volume of data is huge

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.270
or there are many things
changing at the same time

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.880
to detect possible
shifts and trends.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.760
Anything else?

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.570
Yeah, you had more.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.388
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:47.388 --> 00:33:49.810
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:50.560
DUANE BONING: Yes.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.871
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:57.763 --> 00:34:00.180
DUANE BONING: So you're worried
about this, and maybe this

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:00.660
also.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:00.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:02.250
DUANE BONING: In
fact, we don't even

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:06.090
know if that's a still
component or an aluminum.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.290
Yeah.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.590
So in some sense here, if I
were looking at this data,

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:14.940
I almost start to think
these are relatively--

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.810
well, you'd have to ask as
a function in comparison

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.940
to specifications
to actually say

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:26.850
how well-controlled that is, but
there is relatively tight bands

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:36.239
with a couple of these shifts,
and then almost outlier points.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.100
Now, would you think
that these points

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:42.659
are coming from the same
source of deviation that

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:47.270
might be at work in this band?

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:52.659
Might be-- but it's such
a large deviation that it

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.730
starts to feel unlikely.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.620
And another use of
statistical methods

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.200
will actually be to
quantify, how likely is it

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.080
that we would observe
by chance alone

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.750
a deviation within the natural
variation band of such a point?

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.820
And the key reason is, if you
see something big like that,

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.740
there might be a
[? point cause. ?]

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.220
And it's quite possible in
here that the operator is

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.980
making a measurement on
each part and said, whoops--

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.660
something just happened here.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.760
Something got
misadjusted on the tool.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.640
I need to readjust it
and get it back in.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.180
Maybe there's even a little bit
of something going on there.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.180
Or it might have been
a single event that

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.250
wasn't-- didn't
require adjustment.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.840
Maybe you go in,
you investigate,

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.740
and you go, that one piece
of source material coming in,

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.940
that piece of metal
coming in was much thicker

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.160
than it was intended to be.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.882
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.760
DUANE BONING: Yeah, maybe
that's a piece of aluminum right

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.430
in there, or this
was-- exactly--

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:06.030
this was a steel [? 0.3 ?]
in the aluminum set,

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.390
or steel [? 0.3 ?] in
the first one of those.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.900
Absolutely-- that's
a cool observation.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.570
Yeah, that point seems to fit
down in that distribution,

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.650
doesn't it?

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.810
Very interesting-- so
a couple of the points

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.450
here-- the kinds of things
we might be looking for here

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.970
are deterministic
and systematic kinds

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.030
of effects that we might
want to use modeling for.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.010
And then we also
are starting to get

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:33.600
close to the statistical
process control thinking, which

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.020
is to say we would like
to be able to know what

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.130
the inherent or natural
variation of the process

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.010
is having to do with
these sorts of bands,

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.630
and then be able to detect
with high degree of confidence

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.760
that something
strange has happened,

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.890
and I better take action.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:55.070
And that SPC, or
statistical process control.

00:36:58.165 --> 00:37:00.790
Maybe we're going to see many of
the same characteristics here.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.070
This is just a
little observation

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.720
from injection molding.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.370
So this is a
plastic molded part.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.200
We've got a wit, the part
along this dimension,

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.590
and down here we've got
a number of the run.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.000
And also notice--

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.860
I'll just draw your
attention here--

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.580
there are clear
intentional bands here,

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.980
where this first segment
here says holding time

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.630
was five seconds,
injection press 40%.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.760
And we're changing
here-- this is

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.907
a holding time of 10 seconds.

00:37:36.907 --> 00:37:38.990
Here's another holding
[INAUDIBLE] of five seconds

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.640
and 60%--

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.200
and whatever is
lurking under there.

00:37:45.092 --> 00:37:49.870
I think it's a holding
time of 10 seconds.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.080
We could find out, but--

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.470
talk to me about this one.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.570
Oh, I guess also
here, notice, we're

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.360
plotting two pieces of data.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.150
We've got a width and
then some average.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.420
So it's quite possible
that what we're doing here

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.690
is this is a point width
at a well-known location,

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.270
and than the average is
we take that measurement

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:17.040
on many, many locations
around the part.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.330
Or it's possible we also
actually run multiple parts,

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.810
little mini batches of-- who
knows-- maybe five parts,

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:30.000
and I'm plotting the average
across that little batch--

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.390
that five-part batch, which
is another very common thing

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:38.783
to do in SPC. So tell me
a little bit about this.

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:39.450
What do you see?

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.170
Yeah?

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.781
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:50.268 --> 00:38:51.060
DUANE BONING: Yeah.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:55.500
So you're talking about
this band here to here.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.210
Right.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.400
In fact, this
might be the result

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.730
of a designed experiment,
where somebody

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:07.230
is trying to explore the
effective different process

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:11.380
conditions, these
four different cases.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.930
And part of the
goal of that may be

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.130
to identify not only things that
are closer to a mean target,

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.840
but are also more robust--

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:25.930
inherently robust, meaning
they have a smaller delta a,

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:30.310
or are the process
itself has a smaller

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:36.400
sensitivity among at that
operating point to whatever

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.370
inherent disturbance, whether
it be temperature deviations

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:40.880
or what have you.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.490
So that's a good observation.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:50.890
It's also kind of amazing to
me here that the average looks

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:54.700
rock steady in these cases,
but these individual width

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.576
measurements have a
substantial deviation.

00:39:58.576 --> 00:40:01.212
AUDIENCE: Is that the
average of all [INAUDIBLE]??

00:40:01.212 --> 00:40:02.670
DUANE BONING: We
don't really know.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.290
I don't know.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.730
Yes, it's quite possible
that this is just a plot.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.340
So that's your point.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:19.710
This may be [INAUDIBLE]
suspiciously so, right?

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:22.560
This may be the average
across that ensemble,

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.570
and all that is
doing it's not saying

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.490
it's an average of
multiple measurements

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.910
or multiple samples, but
that's just highlighting

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.850
that there's this delta.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.570
And that's got to
be it, because--

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.070
exactly.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.910
There's zero deviation
in those average points.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.690
OK, but these are some of
the same kinds of themes.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:50.150
We're, again, looking at offsets
from deterministic process

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.750
conditions.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.260
We're looking at inherent
variation, ranges.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.450
We may be doing
design experiments.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.270
You could start to think
of empirical models that

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:05.870
would help to guide us to an
optimal point, the point being

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.690
there that maybe these
four conditions give you

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:12.260
a little bit of an exploration
across two different process

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.700
parameters.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:20.840
One approach would be maybe
your target is 40.85 or 40.87.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.170
You might pick the one
that was closest to it.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.530
But if you actually
built a model, including

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.690
a model with
continuous parameters,

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:34.252
you could then interpolate and
drive even closer to a target.

00:41:34.252 --> 00:41:35.710
Yeah-- another
question or comment?

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:39.908
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:39.908 --> 00:41:41.450
DUANE BONING: Right,
one would guess.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:44.697
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:44.697 --> 00:41:45.530
DUANE BONING: Right.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:49.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.430
DUANE BONING: Yes.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.372
So that's actually a
very interesting point.

00:42:04.372 --> 00:42:06.330
When we start talking a
little about more about

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:11.490
design of experiments, about
the synergistic effects,

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.890
it may not be a
simple additive model.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:18.910
You're saying, as we
go here, from 5 to 10,

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:20.350
we got an increase.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:23.330
Here, when we went to 5
to 10, we got a decrease.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.560
So the effect of holding
time may be completely

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.158
in the opposite direction
at two different pressures--

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.150
very good point.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.420
So that means there is
some strong interaction

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.360
between those two-- or mutual
dependence between those two

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.442
parameters.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.090
Man, we're getting very
abstract in this data.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.210
We've got measurements on
the output and we've got--

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:53.712
some number of run
number on the side.

00:42:53.712 --> 00:42:56.170
This is actually looking very
similar to some other things.

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.230
We see definite shift effects.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:00.180
We see mean effects.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:05.090
Again, we see
perhaps an outlier.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.840
The point here was that-- and
this didn't come up earlier--

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.390
we keep looking and
trying to put blame back

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.990
on the manufacturing equipment
or the source material.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.250
You also have to look carefully
at your measurement apparatus.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.680
There's inherent
measurement error.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.180
Even if the parts
were almost perfect,

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.860
very often, you're going to
have an inherent measurement

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.310
limitation and deviations
due to measurement error.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:39.970
And you may have
loading problems

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.610
into the measurement apparatus.

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:49.503
So it's not always an indication
that there's part deviations.

00:43:49.503 --> 00:43:51.170
In some sense, the
measurement equipment

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.890
is manufacturing process,
tool, or equipment

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:58.880
itself that is also
subject to deviations.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.550
And in fact, part of
the applications of some

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.550
of the statistical methods
we'll talk about seek

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:08.540
to characterize or do gauge
studies of the accuracy

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.880
and capability of your
measurement equipment

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.130
and the components of
variation that affect that.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:20.750
So for example, there's
a pure reproducibility

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.820
and there's a
repeatability component

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.770
to typical gauge studies.

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:26.690
One component,
just real quickly,

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:30.410
would be I've loaded the part
on the measurement apparatus,

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:34.070
and then I just fire whatever
the measurement sequence is

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:38.960
multiple times, and think of
that as a pure repeatability--

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.190
somehow the physical--
maybe there's--

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.560
it's an optical measurement.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:50.720
There's scatter from extraneous
light sources nearby off

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.665
of that.

00:44:51.665 --> 00:44:53.540
And then there might be
a separate component,

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.990
if I pulled that same part out,
took it out, and put it back

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:01.830
on, and did that
sequence of operations,

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:04.550
including the
operator operations.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.210
Then you have a reproducibility
component that might be,

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.230
in fact, much larger.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:14.780
So you'd need to understand, and
maybe decompose and break down

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.700
to those different components.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.220
And then, if you
started to see that one

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.320
was a source of
deviation, then you

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.180
might look at strategies to
control or compensate for that.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:25.680
Yeah?

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.233
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:27.233 --> 00:45:28.025
DUANE BONING: Yeah.

00:45:28.025 --> 00:45:30.344
AUDIENCE: At one
of my internships,

00:45:30.344 --> 00:45:34.440
the company was getting
a lot of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.840
They were really
trying to figure out

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.450
[INAUDIBLE],, and
when it went bad,

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:40.355
at the supplier [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.960
DUANE BONING:
Absolutely, absolutely--

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:56.940
in some sense, it's often the
analogy of it's not working--

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.390
oh, check the plug on the wall.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:04.610
Always check your measurement
equipment and apparatus

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.780
before you start diving and
tearing your hair out, going

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.690
too deep into debugging of
the manufacturing process.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.450
Check each step along the way--

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:17.460
glad they discovered that
pin problem back in the--

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.440
at the case.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.970
Oh, here's more.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:22.990
What do we see here?

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:31.620
Again, some output as a function
of run number [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.870
again, maybe this
is another sheet

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:40.910
bending kind of component.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:46.770
We see effects of shift
change multiple times here.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.430
These are different shifts,
maybe different shifts

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.360
or different parts.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.150
What's very interesting here
is that, under some conditions,

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:58.770
we have a nice stable,
not drifting in time--

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:01.850
fairly nice, stable,
or stationary mean,

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:03.512
with some deviation--

00:47:03.512 --> 00:47:04.970
every now and then,
maybe something

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:07.550
that looks outside
of the distribution.

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:11.170
But in some cases, holy cow--

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:15.430
that's a very different effect
than what's going on in here.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:22.420
And it's back to this is a very
clear drift that is definitely

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.210
not just a one-time shift.

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:26.120
Yeah?

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:31.776
AUDIENCE: When I looked at
the [INAUDIBLE],, and the first

00:47:31.776 --> 00:47:32.720
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:40.192
I'm wondering if
maybe the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:48.330
DUANE BONING: Perhaps--
or maybe this worker

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:54.060
finds a way that corrects for
it in a comparatively effective

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:59.040
fashion, whereas the strategy
used in this case over here

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:05.190
is not nearly as effective or
quick at trying to get back,

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.690
if that was the target.

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:12.390
And so in fact, one of the
challenges often in SPC

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:16.350
or other control algorithms--
or not even algorithms,

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:19.140
but control practices,
especially involving people--

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:26.340
is one shift or one set
of operators or engineers

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.070
in charge of a process
may learn things

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.500
that don't necessarily
get captured

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:37.060
and conveyed to other shifts.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:43.880
OK, so what is going on in lots
of these examples is perhaps

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.500
the most important point here--

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.460
is that, very often, there
are two highly different

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:51.650
characteristics
that keep coming up.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.440
There's systematic or
deterministic effects

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.440
having to do with the type
of the material, settings

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.750
on the equipment, choice
of process conditions.

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:04.220
And then there's also
random components.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.030
There's the inherent spread.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:10.700
And a key point here is inherent
spread you can almost never

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.470
completely get rid of.

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:15.500
I guess, philosophically, you
could ultimately maybe appeal

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:19.460
to quantum mechanics, that there
would always be some deviation.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.840
I think very rarely--

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.730
perhaps in some
semiconductor processes,

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:31.690
we do approach truly
inherent physical randomness.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:35.630
But generally, it's that
the understanding is limited

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:39.550
in what is contributing to
that small degree of spread,

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:44.410
or it's impossible to
completely control those--

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:46.450
that inherent randomness.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:49.780
But then we also have
big disturbances.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:54.550
They may still be random
events, but they are not

00:49:54.550 --> 00:50:02.200
this little band, but they are
big events with a clear cause.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.780
We may not always be able
to discern the cause,

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:08.260
or may not always be able to
discover it, but in many cases,

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.300
we've been
hypothesizing about many

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:14.560
of these big shift
changes or a big drift.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.930
And a bit of investigation
and more knowledge

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:21.010
about the process
would readily show us

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:22.930
what's going on in those cases.

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:25.210
And in those, when
there's something

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.580
systematic or
deterministic going on,

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:32.540
the whole idea is you make
some changes to the equipment

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.770
to stamp those out.

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:37.680
And what we're often
going to be dealing with

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.320
is designing
experiments and whatnot

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.950
to try to understand systematic
components and eliminate them,

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:46.500
maybe as part of
the initial design

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.360
implementation of a process.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:53.010
Or in an ongoing process,
when we see a deviation,

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.860
we've got to go and debug it,
find out what caused that,

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.730
and eliminate it.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:00.460
And the natural
occurrence then is

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:04.120
that, over time, as you have
learning about your process

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.560
and manufacturing system,
you're generally squeezing out

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.630
these deterministic sources.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.960
It's something-- was
repeatable, systematic,

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.050
and therefore, you can
come up with strategies

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:19.750
either to eliminate it
or to compensate for it.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:23.140
Maybe you have to have
a control strategy that

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.090
recognizes that
source of variation

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:26.930
and keep squeezing it out.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:30.730
And what you generally
are left with

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:33.100
are these random
components, hopefully

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.410
in a very nice, narrow band.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:39.140
But we still need to
understand and model those,

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.230
and so that's actually where--

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:44.860
another place where the
statistical analysis tools are

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:48.640
really crucial, because then we
want to be able to understand,

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.570
what is the natural
or reducible--

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.920
irreducible component that we
don't know how to stamp out one

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.030
at a time--

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:01.730
and use that information
to be able to detect

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:07.500
in that small scatter when
something unusual happens.

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.020
And that's the idea of
statistical process control.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:15.640
So what we want to do is
characterize the process--

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.140
particularly just
the random component,

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.060
assuming that we've
been able to squeeze out

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:27.220
many of those other
systematic components.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:31.550
Why do we want to
characterize that process?

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:33.950
There's some of the things
that I've mentioned,

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:36.570
and that you've mentioned.

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.760
If I see one of
these points that

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.970
looks a little bit different
than the distribution,

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:46.410
we said that [? by i, ?] but
very often, the question is,

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.840
maybe there's a point that's
a little bit above some

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.950
of the other points.

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:52.770
Then you would often
want to ask the question,

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:58.520
do I really believe the
output changed, or is it

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.170
part of that natural variation?

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.620
And if we start to think
about some natural variation

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.760
and models for that,
including distributions--

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.617
which we'll get to
in just a moment--

00:53:08.617 --> 00:53:10.200
then we can start
to ask that question

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:16.000
in a very systematic way, in
terms of actual probabilities.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.490
Other reasons is
we may go back to,

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.480
did the input actually
cause the change?

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:25.680
Did I make some output change?

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.680
A very important point
here is, how confident

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.600
are we have these answers?

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.760
Very often here, we
were appealing to it

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.330
looks like that's a bigger
change, or this is--

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:42.490
it was a mean offset.

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:48.100
Well, that's OK to try to
convince your management

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:52.750
or convince your operators
that, look, something changed,

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.460
but in many cases,
you'd actually

00:53:54.460 --> 00:54:00.840
like to be able to quantify how
confident you are that that was

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:06.480
either a deviation point or that
some specific decision that you

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.920
made had a true effect.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.630
And so the probability
and statistical tools

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.960
are really, really
important for that.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.710
So what are some ways
that we can actually

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:20.190
characterize and model
the random components?

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.440
Well, that's where we're
getting into random processes

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.270
and random variables.

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:27.060
And I hope you're
seeing this is the basis

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:31.530
for statistical process
control I've referred to.

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:37.510
And we'll dive into some of the
tools and techniques, as well.

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.530
Design of experiments--
so if we were

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:42.050
making that pressure
change or that time

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:45.080
change, how big of
an effect is it?

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:49.190
How certain are we within
the random natural variation

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:52.100
that the deviation-- or
the controlled decision I

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:54.870
made actually had a big effect?

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:59.420
And then finally, even with
compensation strategies--

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:02.960
like this-- one of the very
first things that we said--

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.920
in that oscillating case,
there might be inherent noise.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.570
And it's quite
possible that somebody

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:11.840
could be making process
control feedback

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:15.180
changes to try to compensate.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.880
But if they're trying to
compensate for something that

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.870
doesn't have, in fact, a
connection between the control

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.990
decision and the
true source of noise,

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:29.730
they may, in fact, be injecting
more noise in the process.

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:33.470
So understanding actually
how feedback control works

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:37.610
when we've got random, and not
just the systematic component,

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:39.632
is very important.

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:45.120
What are some ways of
describing randomness?

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.280
Actually,
philosophically, there's

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.460
a couple of very different
ways of thinking--

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.520
if you open up a statistic
book, in the first few pages,

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.850
we'll talk about this.

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:03.280
And from a manufacturing
perspective,

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.490
well, we're really
dealing with data.

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:09.440
In many ways, the
data tells us a lot.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.210
And one approach here is to
look at actual large ensembles

00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:16.730
or collections of data,
and look at histograms,

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:18.080
frequency distributions.

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.270
And we'll look at
some examples of that.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:24.080
A very different approach is to
start with a pure probability

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:29.060
model that assumes
there is a universe of

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:31.900
and an infinite
number of samples,

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.360
and there are characteristics
of that infinite number

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.670
of samples.

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:41.350
And that gives us the tools
to put empirical observations,

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:45.880
like frequency histograms, on
a mathematical basis that we

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.870
can reason with.

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.190
So for example, a way of--

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:58.230
let me jump forward here-- this
is some thermoforming data.

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:00.750
Again, this is some
dimension, and then,

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:04.500
over this collection
of parts, we have a--

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.770
this bar chart, this
frequency histogram.

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:11.160
And what that's really saying
is, for each of the bends

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.610
in that histogram, I'm simply
plotting the frequency--

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:17.520
or relative frequency
that some output was

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.380
between the bounds of that bin.

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:28.810
And so what we are doing is
converting from historical data

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:30.820
into bins.

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:33.160
This is still discrete
bins, but then we're

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.070
associating that and
interpolating forward

00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:39.880
to say, well, the probability
in most applications--

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:42.820
if I were to do
some more part, we

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.670
think that this
histogram, in some sense,

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:49.150
represents a larger
set of data, and I

00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:53.050
can use it to talk about the
probabilities of occurrences

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:56.620
of new data in here.

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.240
So what do you see in here?

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:08.280
Whoops-- there's a little
insert here with the raw data.

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.360
Now, if I hid that from you--

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.400
it's hard for me--

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.560
I'm trying to put
my hand over this.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.230
If I hid that from you here,
and I hid that from you here,

00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:21.130
and you just looked at this
data, typical things you would

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:21.790
say about it--

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:29.850
it looks normal, or
Gaussian distributed.

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:33.102
Maybe you would think almost
it's completely random.

00:58:33.102 --> 00:58:34.560
It's got to mean
and the deviation.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.510
It's got a normal distribution.

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:40.232
Now look back at the data.

00:58:40.232 --> 00:58:41.440
It's kind of drifting around.

00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:48.660
Just a peek forward to other
things to be cautious about--

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:51.840
don't always believe or just
look at your statistics.

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.990
Always go back to the
raw data, because if this

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:56.730
were a characteristic
of my process,

00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:59.490
I would say there is
a random component,

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:04.440
I think, here, but then
I'm also seeing maybe

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.020
some systematic drift that--

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:11.440
I'd like to go in
and squeeze that out.

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:15.180
And then, if I were able to
get that out of my process,

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:17.700
then I might have
a random component

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:20.190
that doesn't have that
deterministic or systematic

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:20.735
component.

00:59:20.735 --> 00:59:22.110
And it might have
a distribution,

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:24.750
but it might be
much, much tighter.

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:29.030
So an important
point here is purely

00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:31.910
empirical data doesn't always--

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.660
it may look random, but it
may have embedded in it--

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:39.560
if you were to deconvolve all
of the sources of variation,

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.180
this big random--

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.180
or this big normal distribution
may have mixed into it

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.610
lots of different
systematic components,

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:51.050
as well as underlying
natural variation.

00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:53.270
Imagine, for example,
that I actually went in

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:55.835
and I got rid of
this long-term drift.

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.700
Would you believe that the
remaining variation is all

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.200
random?

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.370
I bet I could go and I could
plot it, and I bet it'd look--

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:12.570
the remaining deviations would
look mostly normal as well.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.300
You think so?

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.970
Well, who knows?

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:22.930
You might go in and do some of
the other kinds of hypotheses

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:25.108
about systematic sources
that we were talking

01:00:25.108 --> 01:00:26.150
about in the other cases.

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:29.620
For example, it looks like
there may be a bit of an up,

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:34.000
down-- there might be something
cyclical or periodic going on.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.070
That might be another
systematic source.

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:40.090
It could masquerade as a
random normal distribution.

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:44.900
So there's always that mix in.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:50.990
However, in many cases, maybe
you also want to live with--

01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.600
it's not worth it to you,
or too expensive to go

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.270
in and eliminate, or
you tried and we're not

01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:00.320
able to eliminate also some
of these wandering drifts.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.200
And in that case, maybe
the best you can do

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.130
is at least characterize that
remaining variation, which

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.690
has a systematic component.

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:13.160
But you would still like to
have a probability model for it

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.720
so that you could detect
deviations that were outside

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.550
of that variation source.

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:23.480
So if I saw a big
shift up, I would

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.070
say I've got a
point way out here

01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:27.500
in the tail of the distribution
that's highly unlikely.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.920
And you'd still
want to use that.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:40.270
So now, we might want more
compact ways of describing

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:41.810
this distribution.

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.630
Actually, in the
age of computers,

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:47.860
I think, with lots of big
disks and lots of great data

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:53.290
collection, one of the most
underutilized opportunities

01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:55.240
is keeping around
all the raw data,

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:59.280
and actually using
empirical distribution.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.230
So in some sense, it's kind
of a holdover from the days

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:06.770
when it was really tough
to keep track and use

01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:08.240
vast amounts of data.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.280
And we almost always
would start to say,

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.880
OK, I'd like a compact
way of describing this,

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.600
and I want to describe it
as something that only has

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.080
maybe a couple of parameters.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:27.110
It has a mean and some
variance component.

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:30.540
But that's a different
philosophical point.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.330
There's, actually, I
think, a huge amount

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:35.720
of statistical methods
that are underutilized

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.670
that deal with sampling or
resampling from raw data

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:45.290
that actually can capture subtle
things going on in the data.

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:48.410
We're, in this course, not
going to be using those things.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:52.520
We're pretty much going to
seek compact descriptions

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:56.060
of randomness in ways
that we can reason about.

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:59.330
There are data-intensive
ways of doing

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:01.230
the same kinds of reasoning.

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:04.400
So one important point
here is we're often

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.980
going to take this discrete
binned kind of information--

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:15.110
we want to characterize it with
perhaps a continuous parameter

01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:19.710
variable and a
compact distribution,

01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:22.320
such as a normal or
Gaussian distribution.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.720
And this is especially good
when the outputs are themselves

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.960
truly continuous
parameters, like a width,

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.930
a dimension of the part.

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:35.870
And one point here, just
to remind you-- especially

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:38.138
when we go to
continuous parameters,

01:03:38.138 --> 01:03:39.680
you've got to be a
little bit careful

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:45.710
about talking about the
probability of your part

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:49.430
or your variable taking
on any specific value

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:52.220
in that continuous distribution.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.820
Back here when we
had things binned,

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.550
I could talk about
the probability

01:03:55.550 --> 01:04:01.250
of measuring
something in that bin,

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:07.470
within that range,
1.485 to 1.487.

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:09.770
But now, if I were to ask,
what is the likelihood

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:16.790
that I measure exactly
1.486, be careful.

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:22.520
That is a very, very
discrete value that--

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.890
when we talk about
continuous probabilities,

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:27.800
the probability of
getting any one value--

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.430
and it's truly continuous--

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:33.120
is 0.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.890
You're never going
to see exactly that.

01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:40.360
Now, with real
measurement tools,

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.990
we never have perfect
continuous measurements either.

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:47.140
There is always a precision
and a discreetness

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:51.040
capable from the tool.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.410
So this is an
abstraction dealing

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:57.220
with the mathematical niceties.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:01.450
I'd just point out
it's not exactly true

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:06.470
and measured reality and data.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:09.965
So very often, when we
talk about probabilities,

01:05:09.965 --> 01:05:10.840
we got to be careful.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.980
The probability of
any one value is

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:17.380
0 what we talk about
really is the probability

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.130
of our measurement or whatever
being in some range that's

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:24.100
inherent in the distribution.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.820
But we can also talk about,
for example, the probability

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.000
that the value be in
the range from minus

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.390
infinity up to
some value y star,

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:37.420
and that is a
reasonable question

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:39.880
to ask in terms
of probabilities.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.690
And that is embedded
in this notion

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:48.400
of a cumulative probability
function, or cumulative density

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.160
function, or CDF.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.230
Just to illustrate
that a little bit more,

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:56.380
we can do the same thing,
have a cumulative frequency

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.640
with discrete data.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.470
So if I had that
underlying histogram here,

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:07.090
I could also build a
cumulative frequency histogram

01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:10.120
that simply was giving
me the probability

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:15.280
that a part or measured
value was up to, but less

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.890
than some particular value.

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:19.450
And that's simply
the integration

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:24.940
across the PDF up to that
cumulative density function.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.680
And we can do the
same thing that we

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:34.170
did with the discrete
probability frequency

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:35.200
relationship.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.870
So we can approximate
the frequency with a PDF.

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:42.450
We can also look at the
cumulative frequency

01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:46.220
and approximate that
with a cumulative density

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:49.520
function, or a CDF.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.850
So we can have that
kind of an equivalent.

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:56.600
And those equivalents also,
again, help us interpolate

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.670
and ask probability
questions also

01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:04.140
on values that may not have been
exactly lined up with our bins.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:07.010
So very often, we're
going to be, I guess,

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:10.020
talking either about
the density function--

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.090
the PDF of some variable--

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:14.970
or the cumulative probability.

01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:19.080
And there is this inherent
relationship between the two.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.710
I describe the cumulative
probability as an integration

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:23.340
up.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.970
The probability that some
value is less than or equal to

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:33.090
would be an integral
up to some x star.

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:38.080
And so that value right
there corresponds to that.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.570
And then the inverse is--

01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:41.290
relationship is true as well.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:44.790
If I had a cumulative
density function,

01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:48.480
I can differentiate that to get
down to the probability density

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.750
function.

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:54.000
So this is some basic
statistical concepts

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.630
that you probably
have seen before.

01:07:57.630 --> 01:08:04.830
Many of you have seen it in
much more detail in 2.853.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:06.690
OK, so very often,
the histogram does

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:12.450
suggest an underlying
approximate or convenient

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:14.550
probability density function.

01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:18.210
Very often, we've talked
about normal distributions,

01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:21.720
but a key thing to look at is
always look at your raw data,

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:27.540
because there may be other
perfectly reasonable continuous

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:31.800
or discrete probability
density or probability mass

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.140
functions that apply
in the discrete case,

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:38.135
such as a uniform distribution.

01:08:38.135 --> 01:08:39.760
And so one of the
things that we'll see

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:46.540
is the family of some typically
emerging or typically observed

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.534
kinds of distribution models.

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:53.060
So very often,
what we're doing is

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.970
we're gathering data,
looking at these histograms,

01:08:55.970 --> 01:09:00.580
and looking to see, is there
a consistent pattern, such

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:07.850
as we saw with the underlying
normal distribution?

01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:13.090
And we're often then
trying to intuit

01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:17.020
what that reasonable
underlying distribution may be.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:20.170
There are ways-- and we may
touch on them a little bit--

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:23.800
to be able to test
whether or how

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:30.370
good a particular distribution
model may fit with that data.

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:33.010
And on the problem
set, in fact, you'll

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:36.010
explore things
like a qqnorm plot.

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:38.240
And I'm not going to
go into detail here,

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.939
but essentially, that--

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:43.090
assume a model-- for example,
what the probability density

01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:46.660
function probabilities would be
associated with certain kinds

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:50.200
of observations, if it were
a normal distribution--

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.180
and then you plot
your data against that

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:55.300
and start to see how
well the data fits

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:56.740
that particular model.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.360
Let's go back to
that original set

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.130
of data, the
[? c and c turning. ?]

01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:08.220
If I were to plot that
as a distribution,

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.840
I might get something like this.

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:16.630
I might argue that my bins
may be too coarse here,

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:17.860
but what do you see?

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.410
This is a little tricky, right?

01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:24.630
If I were to plot that
data as a distribution,

01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:29.010
I might be tempted to say,
OK, that's one big Gaussian

01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:31.760
distribution.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.490
You could try that.

01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:36.510
But again, if we look
back at the data,

01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:39.830
another interpretation
here is, really--

01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.330
you can start to see it--

01:10:44.318 --> 01:10:45.690
it's bimodal.

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:49.380
It's a mix of two distributions.

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:54.090
So I guess the simple
point here is don't always

01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:58.350
assume it's going to be just
a single distribution that's

01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.982
underlying it.

01:10:58.982 --> 01:10:59.940
There may be a mixture.

01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:05.940
Similarly, here's another set.

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:10.450
And very often, again,
plotting your empirical data

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:13.660
in time order tells you
a lot more, but also

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:16.480
be sensitive to those
kinds of questions.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.940
I could have started the
whole class off and never

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:22.390
shown you the raw data, and just
started plotting distributions.

01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:25.570
And in some cases, things
might be more observable there.

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:31.060
Usually it's easier to see
perhaps lurking up here,

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:33.760
when there's such a
very clear time shift.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.650
But here, this is the histogram
associated with these,

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:43.780
and it sure looks like one
normal distribution here

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.760
and another normal
distribution here.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.780
Now, by the way, if
these things were ping

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.400
ponging back and forth, or
they were randomly picking

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.560
and it was one of those
source material deviations,

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.350
it might actually be
hard to detect that,

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:03.390
whereas the
bimodality-- the fact

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:06.300
that I've actually got what
looks like two mixtures-- may

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:14.990
actually appear more easily
in a histogram kind of form.

01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:19.670
There's another example.

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:22.700
Here we start to see,
again, these two shifts,

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:26.450
and now you can start
to convert these perhaps

01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:29.570
to two statistical
distributions, two

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:31.850
Gaussians with different means.

01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:35.210
And now you can also
estimate parameters,

01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:37.100
like what the mean shift is.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.900
So once you've
got distributions,

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.870
now you've got
mathematical approaches

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:45.810
for being able to
estimate those parameters.

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:50.230
So this is just going back
to some of that other data.

01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:55.690
OK, so some of the key points
here out of this portion

01:12:55.690 --> 01:13:00.250
is, even if there's no
strong input effect,

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.970
there may still be disturbances.

01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:08.080
And we'll often see a consistent
histogram pattern emerge.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.130
And what we often
want to do is use

01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:15.490
that either to detect
deterministic deviations

01:13:15.490 --> 01:13:20.930
and squeeze them out, or once
we've done all those process

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:23.960
improvements and gotten
those all squeezed out,

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.710
we may still have an underlying
inherent distribution.

01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:32.300
Maybe it's random
variation associated

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.280
with a Gaussian distribution.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.410
And the key idea
is we can even use,

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:39.620
and importantly, we want to use
knowledge of that underlying

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.170
pattern.

01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:42.590
It's not a systematic pattern.

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:45.460
It's a random pattern associated
with that distribution--

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.430
so that we can predict
behavior, and in particular, set

01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:50.480
limits on normal behavior.

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:54.640
This is a nice case.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.780
Maybe this is what we'll
consider normal behavior.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.180
And again, I want to be
able to statistically

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.930
say, what's the
likelihood that some

01:14:04.930 --> 01:14:09.190
of these points or a new point
belong to the natural variation

01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:11.170
or not?

01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:15.360
So we're going to typically use
analytic probability density

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.690
functions to do that.

01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:22.550
I think we've already talked
about most of these things.

01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:26.030
I've been emphasizing, by
the way, continuous values,

01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:31.220
these width or
geometry parameters,

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:34.550
but there's also a set
of different statistical

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:38.150
distribution than the normal
distribution associated

01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:41.060
especially with the occurrence--
random occurrence of point

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:41.990
defects.

01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:43.940
And a little later
in the term, we'll

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.580
actually do some
yield modeling dealing

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:49.280
with things like
Poisson distributions

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.830
and in these sorts of
discrete distributions

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:56.720
that are more appropriate
to discrete events

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.310
or discrete occurrences.

01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:00.620
We're going to be, in
the first part here,

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:04.710
dealing pretty much with
continuous parameters.

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.920
So this is just laying
out, again, a little bit.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.420
We've talked about
some of these.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.880
I want to build up
just very briefly,

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.850
get you going on some of
the basic definitions.

01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:16.670
And then Chapter 4 in
Spanos really articulates

01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:17.970
these much more.

01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:20.000
So we have our probability
density function

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.360
and cumulative density function,
and there is that relationship

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.920
between the two.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.160
And then we can ask
about certain moments

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.910
or characteristics of these
continuous probability density

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:32.980
functions.

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.310
These should be familiar to.

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:38.540
We can ask, what is the mean
or the expected value of one

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.980
of these distributions?

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:45.290
And here I'm using t as a
stand-in for time or run

01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:46.310
number.

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:50.540
And if I have a probability
density function associated

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:56.000
with the random variable,
and even time, then

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.260
there we have a definition
of the expected value

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.880
of x as a function of time.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.810
Now, I'm kind of being
pedantic here and giving

01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:10.660
this definition, because
we also saw trends--

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.220
long-term trends in our data.

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:16.195
And we could ask what the
mean is as a function of time.

01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:22.060
Again, we're in a
situation where I'm trying

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.070
to squeeze out those drifts.

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:30.610
So usually we're in a situation
where we want to avoid

01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:35.740
non-stationary drifting
processes or analyses where

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.450
some of these functions--

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:40.390
the probability density
function and its parameters,

01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:41.470
like the mean--

01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:43.030
drift over time.

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:48.400
We typically want to be having
stationary processes where

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:54.430
the mean and other
moments, like variance, are

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:57.940
independent of time.

01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:06.400
So in the stationary case,
which is what we're mostly

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.560
going to be dealing
with, now I've

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:11.680
removed the time dependence
on the underlying

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.600
statistical model.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.520
Let's say, from time to
time, it should be stable.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.770
And then we have a mean,
this mu of x-- the true,

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:24.070
or theoretical true mean--

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:26.830
that we would calculate
with the same formula.

01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:29.950
But again, the idea of
the stationary process--

01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:33.770
important characteristic there
is that the mean is a constant,

01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:35.455
and not wandering or drifting.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.820
Similarly, in the case when
it's a stationary process,

01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:47.570
the variance, defined here
as the second moment--

01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:52.430
the expectation of the
distance squared of your data

01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:53.990
from the mean--

01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:56.600
[INAUDIBLE]
expectation of that--

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.830
is the variance.

01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.480
That's just the definition.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.750
And in the stationary
case, that is also

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:04.400
a constant of the process--

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.060
has a nice alternative
little description,

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.560
if you work through
the mathematics,

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:15.080
where it can also be
calculated as the expectation

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:18.230
of the square of your data
minus the mean squared.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.190
By the way, you can ask the same
questions-- variance, mean--

01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:27.530
for any continuous distribution.

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:29.930
They're perfectly good moments.

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:33.830
In some cases, they completely
characterize the distribution.

01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:37.670
In other cases, there may
need to be additional moments.

01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:40.800
And an example here
is we could ask,

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.910
what is the mean of a uniform
distribution-- uniform, where

01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:50.190
the probability density is
equal across an entire range?

01:18:50.190 --> 01:18:55.310
And so one could
calculate those as well.

01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:59.320
Everybody is seeing the
normal distribution.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.990
Again, we can actually have
an explicit description

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:05.020
for what the PDF is.

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:11.780
We'll often be talking about
the unit standard normal or unit

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.670
normal distribution.

01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:18.440
The full distribution here
actually has the mean in it,

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.150
and it has the variance in it.

01:19:21.150 --> 01:19:23.330
So for your particular
process, those

01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:27.500
may be very different for
whatever collection of data.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:33.520
In order to be able to talk
generically about properties

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.480
of the normal distribution, and
to use tabulated values and so

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:42.040
on, this normalization, where
we subtract off the mean

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.430
to get a 0 mean
description, and then we

01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:48.460
divide by the
standard deviation,

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:51.890
gives us the unit
normal distribution.

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:54.580
And that's exactly
always this distribution

01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:58.840
in terms of z units.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.750
Now we've made it independent
to the mean, independent

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:04.000
of the variance.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.320
And the exact values,
the probability densities

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.450
for any values of z are
well-known and tabulated.

01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:16.990
So we've made it 0 mean
and made it unit norm--

01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:18.950
unit variance.

01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:21.860
There is also a cumulative
distribution here.

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:25.550
I'm describing this
as p of z, so now we

01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:27.440
can ask the cumulative
distribution

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:32.900
function for that unit
normal, and plot that.

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:38.530
For the normal
PDF, what's nice is

01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:40.690
this is the whole
distribution, and all

01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:44.470
we need are those two
parameters, mean and variance,

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:48.010
and it completely
characterizes the process.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.050
And then there's some
statistical operations

01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:53.680
that we can do for when we--
that are really convenient when

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.200
we have normal distributions.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:00.160
For example, if we have
multiple effects, we can look,

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.580
and the sum of multiple
normal random variables

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.555
still has a normal distribution.

01:21:06.555 --> 01:21:08.680
So I'm just giving you a
little bit of a peek here.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.450
You can do some reading,
which is probably

01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:15.130
more effective than me just
flashing by these things.

01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:17.680
There are important
operations, for example,

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.260
where, if we have
an output y that

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:23.170
is a sum of multiple
random variables,

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:26.410
there are things like
the mean of the overall y

01:21:26.410 --> 01:21:28.780
is simply the sum
of the mean of each

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.730
of these individual
random variables.

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:34.270
And if there's a scaling in
the mean, that simply scales.

01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:37.360
There are also
operations when these--

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:42.880
if these are independent random
variables, the variances add.

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.890
And you've got to be
careful any constant.

01:21:44.890 --> 01:21:47.230
If you run that through
the definition of variance,

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:48.950
those are also squared.

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:51.580
So you'll see the
basic description

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.260
of some of these
mathematical operations

01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:57.850
and these distributions
in May and Spanos.

01:21:57.850 --> 01:22:00.040
And you'll also
start to get a feel

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.820
for using these
distributions to ask

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.980
some very standard
questions, like what

01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:09.630
is the probability
that you would

01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:13.600
observe a value in some range?

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.490
So I think, with
that, we'll close.

01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:17.620
If you want to get
started on problem set 2,

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:20.200
there's some problems that--

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:24.550
this is just basically
giving you some familiarity

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:28.330
with manipulating things
with Gaussian distributions

01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:29.470
and other statistics.

01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:34.380
And then we'll start building
up more detail next Thursday.

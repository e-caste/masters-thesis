00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.180
PROFESSOR: Let's look
at storyboard two.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.840
We're going to
look in more detail

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.624
at carbohydrate
catabolism at this point.

00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:30.040
We're eventually
going to be doing

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.220
the pathway of glycolysis, but
we have to get there first.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.870
And it depends on
what precursors

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.980
are available to enter
the pathway of glycolysis.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.730
One option that we'll
look at a little bit

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.520
later is to take in
glucose from the blood

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.190
by way of a glucose
carrier, and then

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.560
phosphorylate the glucose
using either hexokinase or

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.960
glucokinase.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.530
The second option is to take
glycogen, the polymeric storage

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.370
form of glucose, and degrade it
to glucose 1-phosphate, which

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.010
will be then converted to
glucose 6-phosphate which

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.260
will enter the
pathway of glycolysis.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
We're going to start with this
pathway of glycogen breakdown,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.170
or glycogenolysis.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.760
Panel A shows the
structure of glycogen,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.630
which consists of glucose
monomeric units connected

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.360
by a bond between
the 1 and 4 carbons

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.580
in the alpha configuration.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.140
Chemistry is going
to be happening

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.800
at the non-reducing end,
which is to the left.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.030
The reducing end,
which is to the right,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.660
is connected to a scaffolding
protein called glycogenin.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.460
We'll come back to glycogenin
later in the course.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.600
Let's look next at panel
B. The reaction begins

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.320
with the proteination of the red
oxygen between the terminal two

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.220
glucose moieties by a proton
on the glycogen phosphorylase

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.150
enzyme.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.180
The intermediate product is
a resonant stabilized pair

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.090
of positively charged
species, or cations,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.300
an oxonium ion at
the 1 prime oxygen,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.940
and a carbocation
at the 1-carbon.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.220
The electrophilic
carbocation is attacked

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.160
by the negatively charged
phosphate residue, which

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.745
is non-covalently associated
with glycogen phosphorylase

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:07.070
to form glucose 1-phosphate.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.440
Note that the glucose
1-phosphate that forms

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.460
has the covalently attached
phosphate on the alpha,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.650
or bottom face, as it's
drawn in the figure.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.020
The structure of
glycogen phosphorylase

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.170
allows attack of it's
phosphate from the bottom,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.594
giving rise to alpha isomer
only of glucose 1-phosphate.

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:28.010
The structure of
the phosphorylase

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.290
precludes access
of its phosphate

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.360
to the top face of
the sugar molecule,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.930
so you get only one stereoisomer
of glucose 1-phosphate out

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.320
of this reaction.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.710
The other product shown
at the bottom of panel C

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.650
is the glycogen chain, which
is truncated or shortened

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.540
by one glucose unit.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.720
Now looking at the big picture,
the epinephrine molecule

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.850
produced as part of
the stress response

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.210
interacted with the cell
membrane of the muscle cell.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.700
And that interaction
ultimately activated glycogen

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.480
phosphorylase to enable it to
degrade glycogen, the storage

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.200
form of glucose, and liberate
glucose 1-phosphate, which

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.290
is going to then find its way
into glycolysis to generate

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.270
fast energy to
enable the student

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.670
to be able to stand
up in class and avoid

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.410
the stressful situation.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.600
I'm not going to go
through all of the details

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.790
of the chemical
reactions of glycolysis.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.320
You can find those
in the book which

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.750
does a good job of
presenting those details.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.660
In the first step
of glycolysis, we

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.380
see the phosphorylated
hexose, glucose 6-phosphate,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.040
be converted by
phosphoglucoisomerase

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.800
into the furanose
fructose 6-phosphate.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.930
The next step involves
the phosphorylation

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.950
of the fructose 6-phosphate
by phosphofructokinase 1.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.070
ATP is the phosphate donor,
and you form fructose

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.200
1,6-bisphosphate as the product.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.930
You'll notice that
phosphofructokinase

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.230
catalyzes one way, a
thermodynamically irreversible

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.560
reaction.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.280
This step, like hexokinase
we talked about earlier,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.870
are sites of regulation
of the pathway.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.820
The word glycolysis comes from
the Greek word sugar splitting,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.740
and we're now at the
step where the splitting

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.560
of the sugar from one
6-carbon compound into two

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.840
3-carbon compounds occurs.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.290
The enzyme that splits the sugar
in half is called aldolase.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.940
And, again, I advise
you to take a look

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.300
at the book to see the detail
of the chemical reaction.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.589
Briefly, the enzyme is going to
form a proteinated Schiff base

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:25.340
at the number two carbon of
the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.820
That proteinated Schiff base
is going to draw electrons all

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.660
the way over from the hydroxyl
group on carbon 4 of fructose

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.430
1,6-bisphosphate.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.110
That movement of
electrons is going

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.570
to result in cleavage
of the molecule

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.010
into two parts at the broken
line shown in the figure.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.880
Carbons 1, 2, and
3 are going to form

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.520
DHAP, or dihydroxyacetone
phosphate,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.570
and carbons 4, 5,
and 6 are going

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.110
to form GAP, or
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.720
GAP and DHAP are the products
of the aldolase reaction.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.420
As an aside, this is also a
branch point in the pathway.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.350
Dihydroxyacetone phosphate
is an opportunity

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.470
for the cell to make the
glycerol backbones of lipids

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.550
that we'll come to later.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.940
So we see here that
glycolysis is indeed

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.860
a resource that can
be used for things

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.810
other than energy generation.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.000
Now let's look at panel B.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.510
Imagine that a cell is
committed to make as much energy

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.500
as it can.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.210
For example, the
stand up, sit down

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.740
scenario we talked
about earlier.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.470
In that case, the enzyme TIM,
or triosephosphate isomerase,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.680
is going to interconvert
very quickly dihydroxyacetone

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.590
phosphate and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.230
and glyceraldehyde
2-phosphate is

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.370
going to be the
molecule that progresses

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.270
along the glycolysis pathway.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.900
In the next step of glycolysis,
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.900
will be oxidized by
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.960
dehydrogenase, or GAPDH.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.330
Again, take a look at the
mechanism in the book.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.380
In brief, it involves attack
by a thiol residue of a GAPDH

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.260
cysteine on the aldehydic carbon
of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.270
The product is a thiohemiacetal
which is then oxidized.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.950
Its electrons are transferred
as hydride to NAD+ on the enzyme

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.500
to form NADH.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.400
This is the only oxidation step
in the pathway of glycolysis.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.780
The oxidation of the hemiacetal
produces the thioester,

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.810
and that thioester is a
very high energy compound.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.080
The thioester is attacked by
inorganic phosphate to form

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.410
an acetylphosphate, another
high energy compound,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.710
which is called
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.170
The acetylphosphate of
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate then

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.230
phosphorylates ADP to form ATP
in the first ATP forming step

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.610
of glycolysis.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.590
Keep in mind that
two molecules of GAP

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.646
have been formed in the
upstream part of the pathway.

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.270
So for each molecule
of glucose, you're

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.030
getting two molecules
of ATP at this step.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.100
The enzyme that does
this phosphorylation

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.950
is phosphoglycerate kinase.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.670
After 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate
has lost its terminal phosphate

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.750
from the 1-carbon, it forms
the acid 3-phosphoglycerate.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.060
As a reminder,
mutases are enzymes

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.280
that move a functional
group from one atom

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.230
to another on the same molecule.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.520
The next enzyme in the pathway
is phosphoglycerate mutase,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.950
which in effect moves
the phosphate from the 3

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.220
to the 2-carbon, forming
2-phosphoglycerate, which

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.850
is the next intermediate
in the glycolysis pathway.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.040
Although it's easy to
say that the phosphate is

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.326
quote unquote "moved," that
is somewhat inaccurate.

00:07:36.326 --> 00:07:38.450
If you look at the details
of the step in the book,

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.020
you'll see that the reaction
starts with the transfer

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.050
of a phosphate from the mutase
protein to the substrate

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.400
3-phosphoglycerate, forming an
intermediate bis-phosphorylated

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.850
product 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.710
As an aside, this is the same
powerful allosteric effector

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.810
that JoAnne described when
she taught us about how small

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.840
molecules can dramatically
reduce the affinity

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.770
of hemoglobin for oxygen. In
the case of the mutase, however,

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.640
the enzyme will take the
phosphate off of the 3-hydroxyl

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.430
of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate
and the enzyme will

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.900
re-phosphorylate itself.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.740
So the final product of
the phosphoglycerate mutase

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.150
reaction is 2-phosphoglycerate.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.390
Now let's turn to
storyboard four.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.160
In panel A, we see
the enzyme enolase,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.560
which removes the
hydrogen from the 2-carbon

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.210
of 2-phosphoglycerate.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.950
This is not an easy task.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.130
The PK of that
hydrogen is about 30.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.820
Nevertheless, the reaction
does occur and liberates water.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.520
The product is
phosphoenolpyruvate,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.770
usually abbreviated PEP, or PEP,
a very high energy compound.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.160
We're now almost at the end
of the pathway of glycolysis.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.170
And as I mentioned
earlier, one usually

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.650
looks for highly exergonic
steps near the beginnings

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.460
or ends of pathways to see
where the pathway is regulated.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.270
Pyruvate kinase, or PK, the
last step in the pathway

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.980
is such a regulation point.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.280
The pyruvate kinase reaction
occurs in two steps.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.470
In the first step,
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.560
phosphorylates ADP to form ATP.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.430
The enol product then undergoes
enol-keto tautomerization,

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.740
yielding the ketone pyruvate.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.040
And pyruvate is the
end of the pathway.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.450
Let's turn now to
story board five,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.130
panel A. Let's take a
look at this pathway

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.110
from a higher altitude.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.760
First, as I just
mentioned, the pathway

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.920
is regulated at
the top and bottom

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.290
specifically at the
hexokinase step,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.100
the glycogen phosphorylase step,
and the pyruvate kinase step.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.620
It's also regulated in
the middle, specifically

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.010
at the phosphofructokinase
one step.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.320
Regulation can be
allosteric, which we

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.960
shall see as the case with PFK.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.115
It also can be covalent.

00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:55.740
We saw that this is the case
with glycogen phosphorylase,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.342
or GP.

00:09:57.342 --> 00:09:58.800
The last lecture,
we'll take a look

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.680
at regulation of these
enzymes in great detail.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.500
As a second issue, let's
now look at the pathway

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.490
as drawn in summary form in
panel B of this storyboard.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.600
We start with a single molecule
of the 6-carbon sugar glucose.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.600
Hexokinase or
glucokinase will utilize

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.140
one ATP to form a
phosphorylated intermediate.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.040
Phosphofructokinase-1 will use
a second ATP to form a doubly

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.670
phosphorylated hexose,
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.490
Bis-phosphorylated
hexose will split

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.210
into two trioses,
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.310
dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.320
These are inter-convertible.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.590
The chemical species
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.630
is subjected to oxidation.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.200
Because we get two molecules
of GAP per molecule of glucose,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.030
GAP oxidation will produce
two molecules of NADH.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.680
In the next step,
we're going to make

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.730
two ATP's using the enzyme
phosphoglycerate kinase.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.000
At this point,
we're ATP neutral.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.210
We've consumed two ATP's and
we've generated two ATP's.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.050
And lastly, the enzyme pyruvate
kinase is going to generate

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.210
an additional two ATP's.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:13.140
I put those in a box, because
these are the two net ATP's

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.410
for the whole pathway.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.101
So that's the pathway
of glycolysis.

00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:19.350
I want to give you a little
bit of a preview of coming

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.180
attractions at this point.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.940
What you'll notice is that the
pathway involves an oxidation

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.800
step in which we consumed two
NAD+ molecules and generated

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.630
two NADH's.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.000
NAD+ is derived from a vitamin.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.400
We'll only have
limited amounts of it.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.490
We need to find a way to
regenerate the NAD+ in order

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.950
to process the next
molecule of glucose,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.440
and we'll see that nature has
several ways to solve that

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.940
problem.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.960
Nature actually has three
ways to regenerate NAD+.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.140
The first we'll call
alcoholic fermentation.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.780
The second is
homolactic fermentation,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.940
and the third is respiration.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.060
Alcoholic fermentation and
homolactic fermentation

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.390
occur in the absence of
oxygen. That is, anaerobically.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.050
Respiration by definition
is an aerobic process.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.470
Now we'll look at each of these
mechanisms of regeneration

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:15.090
of NAD+ in some detail, but
also, in addition to NAD+,

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.910
you're going to have to generate
a number of other products that

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.980
can be useful to the cell.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.450
We'll see those later.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.110
Let's look at panel C.
Under anaerobic conditions,

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.840
yeast will take pyruvate
and convert it initially

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.610
to acetaldehyde, and then reduce
the acetaldehyde to ethanol.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.610
These are the reactions
of alcoholic fermentation.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.240
Yeast uses an enzyme called
pyruvate decarboxylase

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.850
to process the pyruvate.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.730
Pyruvate decarboxylase,
or PDC, has on it

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.240
a covalently attached
thiamin pyrophosphate.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.750
Thiamin is derived
from vitamin B1.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.650
As we go through the pyruvate
decarboxylase reactions,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.540
at the outset I want
you to keep in mind

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.120
that PDC, pyruvate
decarboxylase,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.090
is very similar to the front
end of the chemical reaction

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.910
series that's conducted by
an enzyme present in mammals

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.840
like us.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.200
That enzyme complex has
pyruvate dehydrogenase,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.120
which we'll come to a
little later when we

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.100
talk about respiration.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.490
The thiazole ring in
TPP forms an ylide.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.750
That means that despite the
fact that the PKA of the thiamin

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.880
pyrophosphate is
about 19, you are

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.970
able to form a carbanion at the
carbon of the thiazolium ring

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:28.470
system.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.470
That carbanion attacks the
middle carbon of pyruvate,

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.140
converting it from a
ketone to an alcohol.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.710
Now you have the thiazolium ring
system with the positive charge

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.590
beta to the carboxylate
of pyruvate.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.660
That system readily
decarboxylates

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.080
as shown, liberating thiamin
pyrophosphate and the product,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.820
acetaldehyde.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.800
The next enzyme in
this small pathway

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.770
is alcohol dehydrogenase
which utilizes

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.550
NADH, which came in, in
principle, from the GAPDH

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.740
step of glycolysis.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.690
Alcohol dehydrogenase uses
the glycolysis-derived NADH

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.650
to reduce the aldehyde
functionality of acetaldehyde

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.130
to form the product of
this pathway, ethanol.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:17.240
Ethanol is an alcohol, hence
the name alcoholic fermentation.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.070
So looking at this small
pathway in total, what you see

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.820
is that you form CO2 as
a first product, which

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.040
could be the bubbles in
a carbonated beverage

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.250
or what makes bread
rise, and form ethanol

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.200
as the other major product.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.630
And, of course, you
get your NAD+ back,

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.030
which you can then
return to glycolysis,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.200
specifically the GAPDH
step of glycolysis,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.780
to enable metabolic processing
of the next molecule

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.320
of glucose.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.050
So this is the
pathway that yeast

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.450
and other
alcohol-forming organisms

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.300
use to maintain redox
neutrality within the cell.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.412
I'm on storyboard six, and we're
going to start with panel D.

00:14:57.412 --> 00:14:59.620
The second general mechanism
that we're going to look

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.170
at that concerns the
regeneration of NAD+

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.950
for glycolysis is called
homolactic fermentation.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.800
This occurs in mammals and
in lactic acid bacteria.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.170
And like alcoholic
fermentation, it

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.640
is also a process that
occurs anaerobically.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.300
That is, in the
absence of oxygen.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.570
As you can see,
pyruvate is a keto acid,

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.470
and the ketone at the number 2
carbon can be easily reduced.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.310
In this case, NADH will
transfer hydride to the ketone

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:31.000
in order to reduce it
to the alcohol lactate.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.600
The net reaction here involves
consumption of one NADH

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.110
and the production of one NAD+.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.570
And this NAD+ of course, can go
back and be utilized to enable

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.390
oxidation of the next molecule
of glucose passing through

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.130
the glycolytic pathway.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.870
When a mammal is
running hard, this

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.120
is the pathway by
which we achieve redox

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.280
neutrality and glycolysis.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.100
When we exercise
intensely, lactate

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.040
is produced in excess to keep
the glycolytic pathway active.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.820
The lactate causes the
blood pH to go down.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.110
That is, the blood becomes more
acidic because lactic acid has

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.030
a low PKA.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.750
I also want to point out that
this anaerobic pathway is also

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.050
the basis for production
of lactate by lactic acid

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:18.580
bacteria, which is critical to
the manufacturing of yogurt.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.690
Let's look now at panel E. The
third pathway to regenerate

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.660
NAD+ for glycolysis
is respiration.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.540
We're going to be going through
respiration in some detail

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.670
later, but right now
I'm going to give you

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.160
a very high level view of it.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.280
In the way of an introduction,
the mitochondrial intermembrane

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.030
is very well equipped to be
able to transport electrons.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.770
Those electrons
will travel along

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.700
in an electron transport chain
to oxygen, reducing the oxygen

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.710
we breathe into water.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.660
This is a highly energy
generating process,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.110
and the energy that's generated
is part of the driving

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.670
force for the synthesis of ATP.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.780
The details of how a respiring
organism generates ATP

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.930
is covered later.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.130
For right now, however, let's
just say that the mitochondrial

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.660
membrane oxidizes NADH to
regenerate the NAD+ needed

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.130
to sustain glycolysis.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.810
And, again, we'll
see the details

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.510
of how this happens later.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.089
Later, I'll also cover the
ways that redox neutrality is

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.190
maintained in a mammalian cell.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:23.500
In brief, NAD+ is generated
from NADH in aerobes by a series

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.560
of reactions that I call
quote unquote "the shuttles,"

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.870
which will be covered
in section 12.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:32.525
Before we go on, let me give you
a little recap of where we are.

00:17:32.525 --> 00:17:34.900
We've seen that there are a
couple of optional beginnings

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.650
for glycolysis.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.250
It can begin with intake
of glucose from the blood,

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.560
or it can begin with the
breakdown of glycogen

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.340
by glycogenolysis.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.950
The formal pathway takes glucose
as glucose 6-phosphate down

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.390
to pyruvate.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.300
We get a total of two
ATP's in that process,

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.720
and we produce two NADH's.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.530
Now, however, we've got to have
a way to be able to regenerate

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.970
our NAD+ from those NADH's
in order to be able to make

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.870
the pathway ready to process
the next molecule of glucose.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.980
Accordingly, nature developed
three endings to the pathway

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.370
that result in the
regeneration of NAD+.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.160
These endings are
alcoholic fermentation,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.280
homolactic fermentation,
and respiration.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.670
Looking at that picture in
panel E once again, in us,

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.020
respiration happens
in the mitochondria

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.740
and primarily in the
mitochondrial intermembrane

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.550
and in the jelly-like
mitochondrial matrix.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.860
Pyruvate generated
in the cytoplasm--

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.560
that's the compartment
where glycolysis occurs--

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.650
goes through the porous outer
membrane of the mitochondria.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:45.180
Then, the pyruvate encounters
the membrane-bound pyruvate

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.760
dehydrogenase complex,
which is our next topic.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.210
In bacteria, which are in
many ways like mitochondria,

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.610
respiration happens in
the cellular membrane

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.980
and in the cell's cytoplasm.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.820
Let's take a look at panel
A of storyboard seven.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.710
We're about to start our
discussion of respiration,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.890
which is the
oxidative metabolism

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:10.090
of all metabolic fuels via the
common intermediate acetyl CoA.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.040
In mammals, as I
said earlier, these

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.350
are mitochondrial reactions.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.360
At the outset, I also
want to point out

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.220
that we have seen
that carbohydrates

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.110
can be metabolized either
anaerobically or aerobically.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.140
As we'll see when we use
lipids as our metabolic fuels,

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.510
they can only be
metabolized aerobically.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.170
Lipids break down to
acetyl CoA, which is then

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.840
oxidized by the TCA cycle.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.670
Let's take a look
at panel B. When

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.460
we talked about alcoholic
fermentation earlier,

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.480
I said that yeast have a
pyruvate decarboxylase complex,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.200
and I said that the reactions
of the pyruvate decarboxylase

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.310
complex are very similar to
the reactions in the early part

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.400
of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction, which

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.450
is a little bit more complex.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:02.440
Pyruvate dehydrogenase has three
activities, E1, E2, and E3.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.530
As with pyruvate
decarboxylase, E1

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:12.100
has a thiamine pyrophosphate
unit, TPP, and ylide on the TPP

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.350
attacks the middle
carbon of the pyruvate.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.882
Specifically, it's
ketone carbon.

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.340
At this point,
you're going to want

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.800
to take a look at detailed
notes that I've provided

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.880
as supplemental material.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.670
This supplemental
material will be

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:29.000
referred to as slide one,
slide two, and so on.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.210
Looking at slide one, you
can see that decarboxylation

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.220
happens exactly
the same way that I

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.200
described for the pyruvate
decarboxylase system.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.020
Now take a look at
slides two through six.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.080
In the case of PDH,
pyruvate dehydrogenase,

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.610
unlike the situation with
PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase,

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.190
restructuring of the
carboxyethyl group

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.310
is going to result in the
formation of our carbanion

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.610
that's going to attack the
disulfide of lipoic acid.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.040
Looking at slide seven,
you'll see the conversion

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.520
of the hydroxyethyl to
a keto functionality

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.410
jettisons the TPP, resulting
in a thioester in which there

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.110
is an acyl group
connected to lipoic acid.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.110
At this point, the
thiol of coenzyme A

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.140
attacks the keto oxygen
of the thioester,

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.630
producing acetyl
CoA, which is going

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.750
to become a very important
molecule as we move ahead.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.900
The second product is
reduced lipoic acid.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.320
Technically, the formation
of reduced lipoic acid

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.070
is the oxidation step of
the pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.120
reaction.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.490
The decarboxylation
step that happened

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.880
a few steps earlier is
basically the production of CO2

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.720
that we eventually will
breathe out when we exhale.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.940
Now let's look at slide eight.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.940
The reducing equivalents
on the E2 subunits

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.280
present as reduced
lipoic acid will

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.840
move across the E2 subunit
toward the E3 subunit.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.860
The E3 subunit has an
oxidized disulfide bond on it,

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.070
which was created by
the connection of two

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.060
cysteines on the protein.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.550
That oxidized disulfide
is then reduced

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.650
by transfer of the
reducing equivalents

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.100
from the reduced lipoic
acid to the disulfide.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.050
And then finally, the
reducing equivalents

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:20.890
are passed from the reduced
disulfide to FAD to form FADH2.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:25.270
That FADH2 passes along its
reducing equivalents to NAD+

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.860
forming NADH.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.670
This NADH is soluble and will
move to its next location.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.910
Specifically, this NADH will
return to the mitochondrial

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.820
membrane-- actually to another
place in the mitochondrial

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.840
membrane--

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.230
an enzyme called complex one,
and be oxidized in the electron

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.000
transport chain.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.810
Overall, one pyruvate
enters the PDH complex.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.750
We lose its carboxylate as CO2.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:56.390
We generate from pyruvate's
residue an acetyl coenzyme A.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.700
And at the very
end, we get an NADH,

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.310
which will then go on to the
electron transport complex

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.870
to be oxidized.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.570
The formation of NAD+,
as I mentioned above,

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.840
is critical to allow
further oxidation of reduce.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.490
That is, energy rich
molecule such as glucose.

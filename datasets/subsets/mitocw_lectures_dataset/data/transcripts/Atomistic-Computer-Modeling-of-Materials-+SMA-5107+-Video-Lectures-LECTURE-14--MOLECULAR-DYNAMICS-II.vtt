00:00:00.548 --> 00:00:01.340
NICOLA MARZARI: OK.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.330
Welcome, everyone,
lecture 12, second part

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.350
of molecular dynamics, also
after the spring break.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.110
So I decided to spend two or
three slides in reminding you

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.430
what was going on
from last time.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.000
And I've actually
been intrigued.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.030
I'm starting with
Heraclitus because this

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.220
is a beautiful citation.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.470
So this is, you know,
fifth century BC.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.940
But there is the intuition
that a macroscopic property,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.320
like the river, actually comes
from a microscopic property.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.570
That is the water molecules.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.540
Though he wouldn't know
what a water molecule

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.570
is, but comes from what the
water molecules are doing.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.550
So Heraclitus was saying, you
cannot step twice in the same

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.050
river.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.540
Because the molecular
conformation

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.260
is always different, but the
river is always the same.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Anyhow, reminder of what
we have seen last time--

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.890
first of all, of course,
the standard thing

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.340
is that we have looked at
Newton's equation of motion.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.220
Really, molecular
dynamic simulations

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.730
involve the integration
of these couple

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.620
set of second-order
differential equation.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.650
So if we have n
particles, there are

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.930
going to be n
trajectory defined by,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.210
for each particle, how the
vector position evolves

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.230
with time.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.400
And the force acting
on each particle

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.440
can be obtained
from the derivative

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.910
of the potential field.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.860
And all the particles
interact with each other.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.010
So this is still a
many-bodied problem,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.170
although a much
easier one to solve

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.230
than the electronic problem.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.320
And we sort of remind
you how we integrated

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.250
this equation of motion.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.970
But sort of one of the
fundamental concepts that we

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.430
have seen is how
we can use actually

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.580
the integration of the molecular
dynamics equation of motion

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.310
to obtain thermodynamical
quantities.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.180
And you see what I'm
writing here on the left

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.630
is really the Boltzmann
idea, the sort

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.930
of basic idea of
statistical mechanics.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.310
That is, if you have a certain
variable that I'm generically

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.410
calling here A, what we
know is that the expectation

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.500
value for that
thermodynamical variable

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.690
is given by the integration
over all the phase

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.960
space, integration
over all the position,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.420
integration over all the momenta
of the value of that variable A

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.670
for every position
and every momentum

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.580
weighed with the appropriate
probability distribution.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.130
So this would be,
say, for what we

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.990
call a canonical distribution,
a distribution in which

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.190
each microstate, its single
position and momentum,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.120
is weighed with the
exponential of the energy

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.850
with a coefficient
beta that is just 1

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.990
over the Boltzmann constant
times the temperature.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.030
And this fundamental sort of
statistical mechanics approach

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.360
can actually be translated into
a molecular dynamics approach.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.320
That is we can actually
obtain the same expectation

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.930
value for the operator A without
really doing these integrals.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.200
These integrals are obviously
impossible to perform

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.780
explicitly as soon as
you have many particles

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.160
because the dimension of
your phase space explodes.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.810
And we have seen it
over and over again

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.270
that, as the
dimension increases,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.470
it becomes increasingly
difficult or computationally

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.720
impossible to perform
these integrals.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.840
But what we can actually
do is evolve our system.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.690
But, remember,
our system is just

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.660
a point in phase space, the
collection of all position

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.710
and momenta.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.550
We evolve it with the molecular
dynamics equation of motion.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.870
And in particular,
say for this example,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.750
we need to evolve it in what
we call the canonical ensemble.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.250
That is we need to evolve
under the condition

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.130
that the temperature of
the system is constant.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.040
But in this trajectory,
in this evolution,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.840
we can average for each
instant of this trajectory what

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.380
is the instantaneous value
of your observable A.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.050
And the average
over the trajectory

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.279
gives us an expectation value.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.149
And these two quantities
are equivalent.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.230
They are obtained in
two different ways.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.470
Here, as an average
over the trajectory,

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.990
that is much, much simpler
to do computationally.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.260
And here is an average
of all phase space.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.950
And there is a subtlety about
this equivalence that is called

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.110
the hypothesis of ergodicity.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.470
That is, in order for this
equivalence to be valid,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.670
we really need to think that
our system spans the phase

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.820
space with the appropriate
probability distribution

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.150
without being confined
in corner of phase space.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.000
And I'll give you an
example later on of what

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.890
means being confined.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.010
So in a way, we sort of
work under the hypothesis

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.300
that really this trajectory is
spanning an appropriate sample

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.693
of trajectories.

00:05:03.693 --> 00:05:06.110
And so when you do a molecular
dynamic simulation-- again,

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.840
reminder of last class--

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.400
you really perform an ideal
computational experiment

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.920
in which you start
deciding what are

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.700
the position and the velocity
of all your particles.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.330
And then this is sort of the
computationally important step.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.400
You integrate the
equation of motion.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.970
And this is the sort
of step in which

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.590
you need to pay particular care
and attention on the algorithm

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.110
you use to integrate
your equation of motion

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.980
and, also, on the accuracy
that is needed to integrate

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.870
this equation of motion.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:50.060
And once you have put all
your particles in motion

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.240
and you are sort of integrating
them and evolving them

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.160
according to the
appropriate equations,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.020
well, you just need to make
sure that you wait long enough.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.270
That is that you
equilibrate your system,

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.160
so that you
basically lose memory

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.630
of your initial condition.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.620
You see, your system
starts from a choice

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.010
that has been made
by you and by hand.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.220
And in data, it's
never representative

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.100
of what could really be a
microscopic configuration

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.760
of your system.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.980
You're putting molecules
certain position,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.750
and you're giving
them velocities.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.510
But that's just your assumption.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.290
And so you need to lose memory
of this initial condition.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.930
And that's accomplished
by evolving the system

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.190
long enough.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.480
And how long is the time
needed to reach equilibrium

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.640
is something that
depends on your system,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.350
depends on the
temperature at which you

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.850
are performing a simulation.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.280
But it's something
that you can check

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.500
in the course of
your simulation.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.420
And again, I'll
show you an example

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.620
on how you check for
appropriate equilibration.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.870
And once you have
reached equilibrium,

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.770
well, then it becomes
straightforward to just

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.350
calculate the results
of your experiments.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.700
That is calculate, say, what are
the thermodynamical averages.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.920
And so you start
accumulating what are

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.310
your quantities of interest.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:23.440
And again, sort of reminder of
last class, the initialization

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.040
step involves choosing
the initial position

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.720
and the initial velocities.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.670
And we need position
and velocity

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.480
because really we are dealing
with second-order differential

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.250
equations.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.590
It's more critical to
choose appropriately

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.500
the initial position
and more difficult.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.850
If you are studying a
system that is crystalline,

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.310
obviously it's very simple.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.970
You start just with sort of a
periodic arrangement of atoms.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.360
But say if you are starting
something more complex,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.620
like, say, liquid water,
it becomes more critical.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.740
Because your liquid,
as a structure,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.215
that is not immediately
evident to you

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.570
when you try to put
molecules around.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.510
Anyhow, there are sort of
obvious things to avoid.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.250
That is you want to avoid that
atoms overlap too closely.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.860
Because if you put two
atoms too close together,

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.600
they will have an
initial repulsive

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.130
force that is very strong.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.940
And they'll just zoom away
very quickly from each other.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.020
It's much more critical to
equilibrate with respect

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.950
to position than with
respect to velocities.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.194
Velocities, or if you want
the phrase space part,

00:08:34.194 --> 00:08:38.070
the momentum part
of your phase space,

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.929
is much easier to integrate.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.500
Basically, because in any
collision between atoms

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.480
or between molecules, the
velocity, if you want,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.190
get reversed.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.800
And so in the momentum, in the
velocity part of phase space,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.060
your representative points
can really jump around.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.360
Say, if you had an ideal
gas of hard spheres

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.870
that only collide when
they touch each other--

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.760
and in an elastic
collision, they

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.100
just reverse their velocity--

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.160
well, in that case, your
representative point

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.520
is really jumping
around discontinuously.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.020
So in velocity space, you
really move around very easily.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.840
And you span all
the phase space.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.410
It's really in the position
part of the phase space

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.500
that you need to be careful
and where your system

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.600
can become entangled.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.500
Once you have set up
your initial position

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.150
and your initial
velocity, you have

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.720
everything you need to integrate
your equation of motion.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.240
And to integrate
equation of motion,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.310
there are a variety
of algorithms.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.770
And I have mentioned,
and you'll see again,

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.790
the standard or simple
Verlet algorithm.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.330
That is actually a very robust
and very accurate algorithm.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.220
So it's what you'll
see in the next slide,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.630
but there are sort of different
varieties of Verlet algorithm.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.800
Sometimes you see them called
leapfrog Verlet or velocity

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.130
Verlet depending on the
specific integration scheme.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.310
And then there is another class
that I'll also mention briefly

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.320
just for reference
that are called

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.200
the Gear predictor-corrector
integration algorithm.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.970
So this, more or less,
relies on all the zoology

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.730
of integration algorithm.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.380
And obviously, one of
the important qualities

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.580
of your integration algorithm
is that it must be robust.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.960
That is it shouldn't be
too sensitive on the choice

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.550
of discretization.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.950
Remember, we have sort
of differential equation

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.860
that are basically perfect
analytical equation.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.020
But in order to integrate
them on a computer,

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.880
we need to discretize them.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.930
And again, sort of one of the
key features of your simulation

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.280
is figuring out what is
the discretization interval

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.080
or what we call the time step.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:08.300
That is how much
time you can spend

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.040
before you calculate another
point in your trajectory.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.050
And there are sort of
a lot of subtleties

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:22.130
that we won't go into on what
really makes a good integrator

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.570
for the equation of motion.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.120
In particular, one of the
properties that we would want

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.090
is that it's time reversible.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.010
And that's what the
simple Verlet is.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.880
That is, if you invert
all your velocities,

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.200
your trajectory is recovered
in the opposite direction.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.620
And not all algorithms
actually are time reversible.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.140
And then there is something
a little bit more subtle.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.810
That is a sort of
criterion of robustness

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.210
for an integrator
is that it preserves

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.690
the volume of your
representative system in phase

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:58.670
space, but we really want
to go into these details.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.000
There are sort of, you
know, several classes

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.610
of molecular dynamic
simulations depending

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.220
on what is the thermodynamical
ensemble that you

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.540
want to represent.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.610
That is, if you
straightforwardly

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.400
integrate Newton
equation of motion

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.100
we have seen in the
last class, you actually

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.980
conserve the total
energy of the system.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.890
That is you conserve the
sum of the kinetic energy

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.990
plus the sum of the
potential energy.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.180
And as you know from
statistical mechanics,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.860
that is what is called the
microcanonical ensemble.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.180
Sometimes it might be
more worthwhile to perform

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.060
your simulation at a
constant temperature.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.460
And so that is what you would
call the canonical ensemble

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.260
in statistical mechanics.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.730
And so you need to find a way
to impose a constant temperature

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:50.750
in your system.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.000
Your system, in principle,
would conserve the energy.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.450
And so it would have a
fluctuating temperature.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.510
And again, from
statistical mechanics,

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.200
the larger your system is,
that is the closer you get

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.600
to the thermodynamically
limit, to the limit

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.760
of an infinitely large system.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.650
It really doesn't matter because
an infinitely large system that

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.460
is simulated with, say, a
microcanonical algorithm

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:21.320
will also have 0 fluctuations
on the average temperature.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.990
And so you would obtain the
same results in a microcanonical

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.490
or in a canonical simulation.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.290
But as always, we deal with
finite systems maybe replicated

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.340
with periodic
boundary condition.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.690
And so it might be more
convenient to choose

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.270
a canonical simulation,
so that we can fix

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.650
the temperature of our system.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.870
Suppose that, again,
you want to study water.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.670
You want to make sure
that you are studying

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.670
your system at a
temperature that is

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.190
consistent with liquid water.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.410
Suppose that you
were studying water

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.810
with a microcanonical
simulation.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:01.550
Again, what would you do is
choose your initial positions,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.990
choose your initial velocities,
and let your system evolve.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.290
But it's only after you
have let your system evolve

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.640
for a long time, that is after
your system has equilibrated,

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.570
that you can actually
measure, start averaging, some

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.190
of the macroscopic properties.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.450
And so in the
microcanonical ensemble,

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.960
you could start, after
a while, to average

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.390
as a macroscopic
property the temperature.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.090
The temperature is nothing else
than the average kinetic energy

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.980
of the ions.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.730
Well, suppose that you
are studying water.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.320
You have set up your
initial position,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.580
your initial velocity.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.990
You let this evolve.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.780
And after a while, you discover
that the average temperature

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.550
is 150 kelvin.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.140
And your system is frozen.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.740
OK.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.520
Well, what you have to do is
then restart your simulation.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.700
It's not going anywhere if you
want to study liquid water.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.230
And how could you change this?

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.550
Well, you could try using the
same initial configuration

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.690
that you had used before,
but much larger velocities,

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:04.100
hoping that once the system
evolves deterministically

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.100
from that initial point,
your average temperature

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.850
is going to be a temperature
in which your water is liquid.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.520
But maybe you do it again, and
your velocity is too large.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.100
And now, the temperature of
your system is 500 kelvin.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.700
OK.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.980
So you see the
problem, in this case,

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.900
in starting with a
microcanonical approach.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.830
So it would be much
more convenient to have

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.590
an integration scheme
that actually allows

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.530
you to fix the temperature
instead of allowing

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.510
you to conserve the energy.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.660
And there are several ways
in which something like this

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.720
can be done.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.380
And again, you'll see examples.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.810
But generally speaking,
we say that we

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.320
couple our dynamical
system with a thermostat.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.340
That is nothing less than, if
you want, a computing device

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.690
that allows us to control,
in this case, the temperature

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.590
of our simulation.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.080
And if instead of
the temperature

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.720
we wanted to control
the pressure,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.990
we would couple our
system with a [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.590
and so on and so forth.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.400
But if we focus for a moment
on the thermostat that's

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.580
the simplest, well, there
are sort of several ways

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.280
in which we can control the
temperature of our system.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:21.200
And I've mentioned here sort
of three classes of devices

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.610
that we use to couple our
system with a thermostat.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:30.290
And one approach could
be the Langevin dynamics

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.360
or the stochastic approach.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.740
That is you try to sort of
simulate a constant temperature

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.800
by letting your system evolve
with the microcanonical

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.220
equation of motion.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.340
But every now and
then, you give little

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:48.350
kicks to random atoms in which
those atoms either accelerate--

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.580
so they start picking
up more velocity.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.760
And so the temperature
of your system rise.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.080
And so you drive your system
to your required temperature.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.870
Or instead of sort of kicking
and accelerating them,

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.470
you slow them down sort of
with a kick in the direction

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.910
opposite to its velocity.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.250
And so you cool the system down.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.410
And this is really sort of
analogous to the thermal bath

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:13.460
if you want.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.609
You have all your
molecules moving around,

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.130
and collisions thermalize them.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.000
So this would be a stochastic
or Langevin approach.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.010
Another approach would be
a constrained approach.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.310
Often, the simplest one
is the velocity rescaling.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.820
Suppose that, again, you want
to keep a constant temperature.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.640
Well, constant
temperature means that you

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:44.480
have fixed overall average
kinetic energy for your ions.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.020
And so when integrating
the microcanonical equation

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.390
of motion, at
every time step you

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.110
have the velocity on every atom.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.020
And if the average
kinetic energy

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.320
is below your target
temperature or above your target

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.330
temperature, the only
thing you need to do

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:07.760
is change your velocity in
order to have the constraint

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.240
that, at every time step, the
total kinetic energy of the ion

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.210
is fixed.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.500
So if you want, a
constrained thermostat

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.000
involves keeping the total
kinetic energy of your system

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.270
fixed.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.880
And in order to
do this, you need

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.790
to have actually an
integrating algorithm

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.700
that uses the
velocities to integrate

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.380
the equation of motions.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.705
So something like the leap
frog Verlet that we want,

00:18:32.705 --> 00:18:36.830
see, or the velocity Verlet that
we want, also see, would work.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.410
But the simple Verlet that
I'll show you again in a moment

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.900
wouldn't actually be useful.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.660
Because in the simple
Verlet, you never

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.720
control or never
use the velocity

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.670
of the system to integrate
the equation of motion.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.970
So you are not able
actually to control

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.660
the velocity of your system.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.000
And so you can't thermostat
your dynamical ensemble

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.630
using the simple Verlet.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.300
And sort of the last
approach that is probably

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.840
the more generic and
the more powerful

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.370
is actually adding
to your sort of set

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.990
of equation of motion an
additional dynamical variable.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.270
So up to now, the
dynamical variables

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.570
are all the position and all
the velocity of your particles

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.810
in the system.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.090
Well, you could add an
additional dynamical variable

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:34.310
that I tend to sort of compare
it to some generic wind going

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.380
through the system.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.590
And that sort of additional
dynamical variable

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.880
is something that either
slows down your particle

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.570
or accelerates your
particles in order

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:51.320
to fluctuate appropriately
around your target temperature.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.070
And this is the
most elegant sort

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.890
of solution to the problem
of the thermalization,

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.430
and it's also the most powerful.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.000
And we'll see examples
both in this class

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.740
and especially the
next class of applying

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.430
this extended approach.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.240
And often, it goes under the
name of Nosé that was the first

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.680
one to develop the equation
of motion for a canonical

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.750
simulation at
constant temperature,

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.610
or actually Nosé-Hoover.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.420
That was the other person that
made this equation a little bit

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.430
more tractable.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:29.090
And again, a reminder
of the simple Verlet,

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:32.440
the only algorithm that we
have seen, that is sort of

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.790
summarized in here.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.550
And what we are doing
is we are looking

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:40.690
at this trajectory,
this vector that

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.370
evolves as a function of time.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:46.810
And we are just doing
a Taylor expansion.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.380
That is, if we know
the position at time t,

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.550
the position at times t plus
delta t, the Taylor expansion,

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.970
involves the derivative of the
position with respect to time.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.878
The second derivative
of the position

00:20:59.878 --> 00:21:01.420
with respect to
time, that is nothing

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.880
than the acceleration,
the third derivative

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.540
and so on and so forth.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.950
And I've only expanded
it up to the third order.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.800
But the very nice thing
is that we can expand it

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.860
both forward in
time and backward

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.910
in time around the
instantaneous position.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.600
And so using, you see, the
instantaneous velocity,

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.050
the instantaneous acceleration,
and the instantaneous third

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:31.090
derivative, we are able to
correlate the present position

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.570
with the next position in
time and the previous position

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:40.420
in time where delta t is this
fundamental discretization unit

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.490
that we call the time step.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.520
And that is the
unit that we choose

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.660
to integrate our equation
of motion accurately enough.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.700
And just by taking these two
expression and summing them,

00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:00.760
we see that all the
terms cancel out.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.230
And just by sort of moving left
and right the appropriate term,

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.410
we have just, by summing
these two Taylor expansion,

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.420
there's a fundamental
expression that

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.650
is really the core of the
simple Verlet algorithm.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.050
And you see, this is the
recipe that we use, actually,

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.530
to integrate our equation
of motion in time.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.760
That is what we are saying
is that the position at times

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.680
t plus delta t is related
to the position of time t

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.150
and the position at
times t minus delta t.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.800
And so by knowing this position
and the previous position

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.860
and by knowing what
is the acceleration

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.450
at the present time--

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.680
and the acceleration
is nothing else

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.010
than the force
divided by the mass.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.830
Here is where Newton's equation
of motion comes into play.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.340
We are able to
predict what is going

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.180
to be the next position
with an accuracy that

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:03.310
is of the order of the fourth
power of your time step.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:07.930
So if you want, if you are
going to have your time step,

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:13.310
the accuracy that you obtain
is going to be 16 times higher.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.550
So one of the fundamental
sort of checks

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.490
that you want to do in your
molecular dynamic simulation

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.210
is that your time
step is small enough.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.220
But obviously, it doesn't
need to be too small.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.050
And again, we'll see an example
on how you can check for this.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:32.710
And you see the simple
Verlet algorithm never uses

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.510
the velocity of your system.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.690
It's able to calculate the
new position just using

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.410
the present acceleration
of the present force.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.930
And so it's not
an algorithm that

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:48.680
allows you to control the
velocity of your particles.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.560
So the velocity of
your particle is

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.930
something that is given to
you and you can, of course,

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:54.880
calculate.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.920
Suppose that you
want to calculate

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.650
what is the kinetic
energy of your system.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.870
Suppose that you
want to find out what

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.430
is the average temperature.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.670
Well, you need to
calculate the velocity.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:12.500
And again, you can use a simple
finite difference formula.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.580
And you see, what we use is
actually the position of t

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.940
plus delta that's written
here and the position at t

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.950
minus delta that
is written here.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.500
And these are
symmetric derivative.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.390
And you could actually
do the homework

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.590
of inserting these
quantities and finding out

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:34.330
what is the order of error
in a power of delta t

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.710
for your velocity
and why we use,

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.620
actually, this
symmetric formula,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.800
say, compared to a left
or a right derivative.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.150
You could also calculate the
velocity as rt plus delta

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.500
t minus rt divided by delta t.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.310
And it's easy to do it here.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:25:06.990
If you want to calculate what
is the velocity at times t,

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.130
you obviously need to know
what is the derivative here.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.870
This is the definition
of velocity.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.520
And you can see that the
most accurate definition

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.620
of a derivative is obtained
by taking the value at rt

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:28.620
plus delta t and t minus delta t
and measuring this slope rather

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.770
than, say, measuring this
slope or measuring this slope.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.020
So this slope here is given
by the symmetric derivative

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.290
that I have written
down here and is

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.960
the sort of most
accurate representation

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.380
of the true slope that is
the green position here.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.290
And you can also do this not
only sort of graphically,

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:55.440
but analytically, just writing
out the explicit expressions.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:04.220
I won't go into the details of
other integration algorithm.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.890
But just to mention
another very common one

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.270
is what is called the Gear
predictor-corrector algorithm.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.270
This is actually
not time invariant.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:19.640
And it tends to be probably
more accurate than the Verlet

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.660
algorithm if you have
an analytical expression

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.090
for your forces, so
if you can actually

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.720
derive from a potential
field your force

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.240
and then obtain
your acceleration.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.100
It tends to be much worse
than the Verlet algorithm

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.310
if you have noise in your data.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.930
And that's actually
the case when

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.710
you perform an ab initio
molecular dynamic simulation

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.590
because the forces that
you obtain in an ab initio

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:53.750
simulation are exact only,
if at each time step,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:57.510
you have reached the
perfect self-consistency.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.690
And so ab initio
molecular dynamics

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:05.270
has some inherent
amount of noise

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.620
that calls for the use of a more
robust integration algorithm,

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.450
like this simple Verlet.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.880
But if you are doing
classical molecular dynamics,

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.830
this is often superior.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.290
And really it's sort of
an extension of the Verlet

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.130
algorithm.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.880
That is, instead of
using just the first

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.310
and the second derivatives
of your trajectories,

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.520
it uses the third, the fourth,
and the fifth derivative,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.240
and so on and so forth.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.260
And then sort of it
estimates the error

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.740
and corrects, once you
have taken your time step,

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.460
for the difference
between your predicted,

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.560
say, acceleration
or third derivative

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.370
or fourth derivative that comes
from your Taylor expansion

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.010
and actually, say, the
acceleration that you

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.000
calculate.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.920
That is the force
that you calculate

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.750
once you move in that position.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.830
And again, using higher
order expressions--

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.200
that is using third and
fourth derivatives--

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.610
can give you more accuracy and
allow you to use longer time

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:08.540
step to integrate appropriately
your trajectory if you

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.550
have no noise in your forces.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.560
But if you have
noise in your forces,

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.830
it can actually be more
catastrophic in the errors

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.040
that it obtains.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.950
OK.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.610
This was a reflection of some
of the things that we have seen.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.460
One of the sort of
very simple concept

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.000
I wanted to sort
of remind you that

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.670
takes place whenever
we try to do

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.060
numerical integration of
a differential equation

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.910
is the concept of
Lyapunov instability.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.330
That is sort of what you have
heard over and over again

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:45.360
called the butterfly
effect in weather forecast.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:51.060
That is, if a butterfly beats
his wings in northern Africa,

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.600
we have a tornado
in the Caribbean.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.390
And the reason
for that is saying

00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:00.260
that, in any of this
differential equation, when you

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:04.790
try to integrate them,
an infinitesimal error

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.890
at the beginning
of your integration

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.190
will exponentially
increase to the point

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.810
that what comes at the
end of your simulation

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.440
can be radically different
for infinitesimal differences

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.120
in your initial condition.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.520
That is to say
suppose that you have

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.530
an exact analytical trajectory.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.660
That is you are
able to integrate

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.850
your equation of motion starting
from a certain initial position

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.320
and initial velocity here.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.470
So in the limit of an
infinitesimal time step,

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:43.310
in principle you are going
to do a perfect integration

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.560
and recover this trajectory.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:51.830
In practice, it means that,
for larger and larger steps,

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.390
what you will have
is that you'll

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:58.370
be able to sort of follow this
trajectory for a certain time.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:03.080
But after a while,
you'll start diverging.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.950
And the smaller
your time step is,

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.780
the more accurately
you are going

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.160
to reproduce this
trajectory for a while.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.390
But at the end, the
exponential explosion

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.620
will always take place.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.720
That is you start having
an exponentially increasing

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.400
difference between the exact
trajectory and the trajectory

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.070
that you are calculating.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.290
Luckily, this doesn't
really matter.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.320
This is very important.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.370
And this is sort of true in
molecular dynamic simulation

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:45.020
of our small sample periodically
repeated in, which we want

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.210
to calculate thermal averages.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.110
And it also applies to
the case of the butterfly

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.660
beating its wings and
creating a tornado.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:58.070
What really happens is that all
these systems on the long time

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:02.860
scales are basically
inherently chaotic.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.970
So all these
trajectories diverge

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:10.710
from the ideal trajectory,
but it doesn't really matter.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.380
When we do a molecular
dynamic simulation,

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.330
we are not trying to reproduce
an exact trajectory starting

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:22.170
from the atomic timescales and
propagating for picoseconds,

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.480
nanoseconds, or microseconds.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:30.180
Because what we want to find out
are either average properties

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.500
of the system--

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.210
well, it doesn't really matter
that the trajectory diverges.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.450
Because even this
trajectory that diverge

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:44.130
still conserve the fundamental
macroscopic variables.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.700
If you are doing a simulation
at constant temperature, what

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.550
it really matters is that
all these trajectories

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.630
correspond to evolutions
at constant temperature.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.960
And then you are sampling
appropriately your phase space.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.550
And even if you want to do
molecular dynamics of an event

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.850
instead of using it to
obtain an assemble average,

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.950
even if you want
to, say, find out

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:12.870
how an atom diffuses across
a barrier, what is really

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:16.260
your macroscopic
observable is the average

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.880
over tens, thousands,
millions of these events,

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.000
all sort of slightly
different from each other,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.420
but all corresponding to
the overall constraint

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.910
of having the same
macroscopic observable.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:35.010
So it doesn't really matter
that we replicate exactly

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.760
the trajectory,
neither for an ensemble

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.420
average of thermodynamical
quantities, nor for the case

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.240
in which we simulate
a specific event.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.430
Because in any case,
what we need to do

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.850
is repeat the simulation
over and over again

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:54.510
to have appropriate statistics
and to have an average.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.630
Of course, the only case where
having the exact trajectory

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.850
matters is that
if you are sending

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.790
a satellite in outer
space because you are not

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:07.260
sending 1 million satellites and
seeing what they do on average.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.980
You want that satellite to
do something very precise.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.680
And so you need to integrate
things very accurately.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.980
And you need to keep
correcting your integration

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.260
as time goes by.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.350
And we can actually
sort of formalize

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:26.040
this sort of concept of
Lyapunov instabilities

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.030
in terms, basically, of
an exponential divergence

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:33.210
in some metric of
our actual trajectory

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:38.350
from the ideal analytic
trajectory of our system.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.850
OK.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.460
So now, everything is in place.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.950
We are doing our molecular
dynamic simulation.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.190
First of all, how do
we check that something

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.890
is working, that what we
are doing makes sense?

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.820
Well, the first thing
is just making sure

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.180
that what you are doing
makes sense computationally.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.940
It might still not
make sense physically,

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.580
but your sort of
order [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:06.420
is making sure that you are
integrating your equation

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.219
of motion appropriately.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.409
Because, remember, you
need to choose a time step.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:14.190
You need to choose a
discretization interval.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:18.239
And the size of that
interval depends really

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:20.730
on what is the
typical atomic motion.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.610
If you are studying a
system that is very cool

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.219
and is made of very
heavy atoms, you

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:28.170
can use very large times steps.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:31.380
If your system is very hot and
made of very light atoms that

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.790
move much faster, you need
to use very small time steps.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.630
But on average, there is really
a small range of time steps

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.090
that is really acceptable.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.300
And they are of the order
of the femtoseconds, 10

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.880
to the minus 15 seconds.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.170
So for something as light
as a hydrogen atom bound

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.480
to an oxygen, say,
in water molecule,

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.670
you might need to
use a time step as

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:59.970
small as 1/2 femtosecond.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.710
For something in which
maybe you are studying,

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.630
say, liquid caesium,
a free electron metal

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.190
that is very heavy,
you might have

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.530
a time step that
can be appropriate

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.380
and as large as 20 femtoseconds.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.420
But this is the
range, basically,

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.210
of the order of femtoseconds.

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.330
And the very important
thing is that you can always

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.160
check that your time
step is accurate enough.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.490
Because if you are doing a
microcanonical simulation,

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:33.300
what you need to have is
that the total energy--

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.170
that is the sum of the potential
energy and the kinetic energy--

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.920
is conserved or, if you
want, that the kinetic energy

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.340
of the ions and the
potential energy of the ions

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.280
mirror each other exactly.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.610
And again, in the limit of
infinitesimal time step,

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:55.830
this total energy line
should be perfectly flat.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:36:01.140
As you increase your time
step, well, this line

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:05.870
will start to have some
microscopic oscillation.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:10.780
So it will start fluctuate and,
depending on your algorithm,

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.960
could also have a
systematic drift.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.360
A systematic drift,
generally speaking,

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.730
is very bad because it means
that your system is really

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:22.930
cooling down.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:27.190
That is a systematic drift
means that your total energy is

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.740
going to get closer and closer
to the potential energy.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.550
So the kinetic
energy of your ions

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:35.750
is decreasing and decreasing.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:39.370
And so systematic drift
means that, after a while,

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.890
your system will
slow down to a halt.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:45.010
And so you need
to check for that.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.070
And then even if there
is no systematic drift,

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.740
a simple algorithm
like the Verlet

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.470
tend to be very good
at that, at not having

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:55.000
any systematic drift.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.690
You need to make sure that your
fluctuation that will always

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:02.200
exist as long as you are
using a finite time step

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.560
are actually small enough.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.590
So you want the fluctuation,
your total energy,

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.810
to be much, much smaller
than the fluctuation

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:14.170
in your potential energy,
say two orders of magnitude,

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.690
three orders of
magnitude smaller.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:23.960
So that locally your system is
varying its potential energy,

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:28.030
but its total energy
is actually unchanged.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.730
And again, thanks to the
power of the Verlet algorithm

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:34.810
that sort of scales as the
fourth power of your time step,

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.000
you can do very simple tests.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.860
You half your time step, and
you should see your total energy

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.560
curve becomes much flatter.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.380
And so you can basically
choose sort of what

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.300
is the optimal time step.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:55.450
And you can even use a sort of
real space picture in which you

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:56.800
can look at the trajectory.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.870
After all, what
you have are atoms

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.360
moving around and oscillating.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.530
And so what you want to do in
a real trajectory of an atom

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.440
moving around is
you want to have

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:13.960
enough points to
describe correctly, say,

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.180
a period of an atom.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:23.530
And the rule a thumb is that you
want between 20 to 100 points

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:26.470
in describing a full
period of an atom.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.050
And that, again,
sort of brings us

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:33.970
back to the order of magnitude
of femtoseconds for the time

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.780
steps of your systems involved.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:44.170
So once you have set up your
computational part correctly,

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:49.070
you still need to check out that
your simulation makes sense.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.150
And in particular, the
sort of trickiest part

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:56.450
is making sure that you reach
thermodynamic equilibrium,

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:00.550
so that you lose memory of
your initial conditions.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.380
And again, that's
actually something

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.470
in which the Lyapunov
instabilities, if you want,

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.430
help.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:12.880
No matter how bad our choice
is, if we let the system evolve

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.230
long enough, our
trajectory will sort of

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:22.790
diverge from our
initial exact trajectory

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:25.280
that was somehow poorly chosen.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.250
And it will become more
and more representative

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:32.150
of the thermodynamical ensemble
that we are simulating.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.300
But it's still very
tricky to understand

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.130
if we are reaching equilibrium.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.910
I've shown you here an example
in the case in which, say, we

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:46.040
are looking at a solid,
something like a slab of metal

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.790
in which we have a, say,
bulk atom in the metal.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:52.490
And then as we move
towards the surface,

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:56.120
we have sort of second layer
atom and first layer atom.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.160
And what we are
averaging here, what

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.120
is the sort of thermodynamical
observable we are interested,

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.160
is the mean square displacement.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.430
That is how much
the atom fluctuates

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.420
around the initial condition.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.420
And again, you'll see
more and more example

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:15.470
in what comes later of a
mean square displacement.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:17.600
But you see, somehow
it's written here

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.710
in a reverse scale.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:22.760
But if we start at time
t equal to 0 and we

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.700
measure what is the mean
square displacement,

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.030
well, at the beginning,
the atoms will keep moving.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:35.750
If you think, this peak
here, this sort of 1/3 to 1/4

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:38.840
of a picosecond, is
a measure of what

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.470
is the period of
oscillation of an atom.

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:45.590
Because at the beginning,
the atom starts moving.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:48.860
And from the point of
view of calculating

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.420
what is its average
displacement, it keeps moving.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.870
At the very beginning of
the simulation, atoms move.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:00.140
And then they start feeling the
potential from the other atom.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.800
And they sort of settle in
an oscillatory movement.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.650
And then you are
starting to average over

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.350
more and more oscillations.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.170
And you see sort
of, in the bulk, you

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:15.440
fairly quickly converge.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.360
These thin lines
are for the bulk.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.570
You very quickly
converge to your sort

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:24.140
of final exact results.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.320
But somewhere else
for the surface atoms,

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.640
it takes more time.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.120
It takes a few seconds
before you finally

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:37.670
converge to your
sort of final result.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.850
But again,
thermalization sort of

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:46.700
can be checked by looking at the
time evolution of the quantity

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.470
that you want to average.

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:51.320
Say, you could look at the
temperature of your system,

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.980
and you want to see
the quantity that you

00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:01.520
are sort of monitoring
converge to a final result that

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.218
doesn't change as you increase
the length of your simulation.

00:42:06.218 --> 00:42:07.760
And there are
quantities, again, that

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.360
are sort of easy to
converge and quantities that

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.790
are very difficult to converge.

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.990
Suppose for a moment that you
want to study actually, again,

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.810
the structure of liquid water.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:24.560
Well, you could start from
a sample that is frozen--

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.340
that is ice-- and
all of a sudden

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.430
you increase the temperature
with your thermostat.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:33.950
You bring it, say,
to 300 kelvin.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:36.530
And then you let it evolve.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:40.130
And you could sort
of look in time

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:44.210
as the sort of relative
position or the diffusion

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:48.170
coefficient of the water
molecule evolve in time.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.270
And you would discover
that, depending

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:55.220
on the temperature, maybe you
need 10, 20, 30 picoseconds

00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:00.920
to reach a situation after which
your expectation value do not

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.490
change if you increase your
simulation longer and longer.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:08.030
This is sort of the
concept of equilibration.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.250
If you were to do
the opposite, if you

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:13.400
wanted to find out what
is the structure of ice

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:18.470
by taking a sample of liquid
water and cooling it down,

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:22.070
your equilibration time
would be almost infinite.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:26.280
Because if you take liquid
water and you cool it down,

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.560
it will actually not freeze
in the perfect crystalline

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.720
structure of ice.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.710
But it will much more
likely sort of slow down

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:40.520
in a sort of glassy transition
in which it freezes.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:45.530
It stop diffusing, but it's
only sort of locally coordinated

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:46.920
as ice should be.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.130
But it's not in a
crystalline state.

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.100
What does that mean?

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.840
It means that what we
actually ended up with

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.100
is a situation that is not
at thermally representative

00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:58.730
situation.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.510
We are not in an equilibrium
state for a system,

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:08.120
but we have sort of and ended
up in a corner of phase space

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.210
out of which we are
never going to get out

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:14.570
unless we wait forever.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.760
That is, even after
their water is

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.790
sort of frozen in
this glassy state,

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:23.450
if you keep simulating it
longer and longer and longer,

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:27.020
every now and then you'll have
a fluctuation that changes

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.630
the position of two water
molecules and two more water

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.310
molecules and two
water molecules.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.040
And after a very long
time, you might actually

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.620
find that your system
has become crystalline.

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:39.800
But it's never going to
happen in the timescale

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.280
of your simulation.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.430
So one needs to be
careful when one

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:47.180
does one of these simulation to
make sure that, actually, you

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:51.060
are sort of finding yourself
in a representative state.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.480
And that's why some
of these issues,

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.450
like simulating
a solid to liquid

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:59.690
or a liquid to solid transition,
require particular care

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:04.160
and somehow require actually
knowing something of the system

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.750
that you want to discover.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:09.800
And again, there is
an enormous debate

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:16.340
on what are some of the
phases of supercooled water.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.030
That is, if you take
water, and it's very pure,

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.870
and you bring it down below the
regular freezing temperature,

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:27.260
well, you can keep
water liquid up to,

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:33.350
I think, 40 degrees
below the freezing point.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:35.270
And you can do that
experimentally.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:37.100
And you can do it
with simulation.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:41.570
And then, all of a sudden, your
system will ultimately freeze.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:46.490
And it will end up in phases
that neither the people doing

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:49.190
simulation, nor the
people doing experiment

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:50.490
can still agree with.

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.980
So there is sort of dark areas
in the phase diagram of water

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.210
at those low temperatures.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:59.600
And people this discuss about
high density liquid and low

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.710
density liquid.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:04.290
And a lot has been achieved
in the last 10 years.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:07.190
But it's still not
formally known.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:11.330
And this is why one really needs
to pay particular attention

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:15.060
to a number of these problems.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:15.560
OK.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.800
So suppose that
everything is going well.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.200
You have initialized
properly your system.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.320
You have sort of
weighted enough,

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.960
so that you have
actually lost memory

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.040
of your initial condition.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.280
And if you want,
you should always

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.570
throw away the part of your
molecular dynamic trajectory

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:38.810
that corresponds to this
initial thermalization time

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:42.380
because it doesn't really
represent high quality data.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:45.920
Only after you have
waited long enough,

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.890
say, in this
previous simulation,

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:52.130
only after you
have waited, say, 4

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:57.110
picosecond, you can start
taking averages of what is, say,

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:01.340
the mean square displacement
for a surface atom.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.830
So you throw away
from your simulation

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:05.990
your thermalization
time, and you

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.630
start accumulating averages.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.750
And again, the averages
that could be relevant,

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:14.330
if you are seeing a
microcanonical simulation,

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.700
you could look at the
average kinetic energy.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.220
Because that average
kinetic energy

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.730
gives you the average
temperature of your system.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:28.130
Or you could look at the
average pressure in your system.

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:30.980
Or I show you an
example in a moment.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.260
You could look at
the potential energy

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:37.080
or what is sometimes
called the caloric curve.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.040
So if you are actually
simulating a system

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.110
at different temperatures--

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:44.420
say, again, suppose
that you have water,

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.300
and you are still
in the frozen phase.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:52.340
Well, the potential energy
will oscillate around

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.030
a certain value.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:58.310
But remember, in order
to sort of melt water--

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:03.410
that is in order to go
at equilibrium from being

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.570
an infinitesimal
amount of temperature

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:09.020
below the melting temperature
and an infinitesimal amount

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.000
above the melting
temperature-- you

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.700
need really to give
to your system what

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.740
is called the latent heat.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.900
In this case, the
latent heat of fusion

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.990
would be the heat
released when it cools

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:25.040
or the heat that you
give in order to melt it.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.850
And so your average
potential energy

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:32.540
will have a discontinuity as
a function of temperature.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.220
And we'll see it in an example.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.710
And that's really a measure
from your molecular dynamic

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:40.610
simulation of this fundamental
thermodynamical quantity.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:44.480
Or you could look, say, in
liquid water at the diffusion

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.780
coefficient, so the means
square displacements.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.130
And we'll see this.

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:51.740
Or you could look
at the structure,

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.870
the geometric structure,
of your liquid.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:58.010
And again, sort of molecular
dynamics techniques

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:00.410
were actually initially
developed for system

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:03.260
like liquids in which
it was much more

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:07.760
difficult to have analytical
expression for something

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.170
like the structure.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:10.970
I mean, if you are
studying a crystal,

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:13.100
the structure is
somehow trivial.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.920
And you can obtain it
from X-ray experiments,

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.670
but you can also obtain it
from total energy calculation,

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.640
minimizing the energy with
respect to your volume.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.190
If you are studying
a liquid, again, you

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:30.180
can have information on your
sort of local structure.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:33.660
That is how far the
molecules keep on average

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:37.020
from each other in the
simulation from diffraction

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.160
experiments.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:43.380
But you don't have an
immediate computational way

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.840
to calculate data
like you have done it

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.690
for a solid in which you
were, again, minimizing energy

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:49.950
with respect to volume.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:53.790
What we really need is to do a
molecular dynamic simulation.

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:56.670
And this is sort of the
first of the examples

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.430
I want to show you
today of application

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:00.750
of molecular dynamics.

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:05.220
That is one in which we
calculate ensemble average.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.100
And in particular, we,
say, calculator, say,

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.410
the structure of liquid water.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.560
I'll also give you an
example, a couple of examples,

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.350
of a chemical
reaction that is using

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.330
molecular dynamics to
look at the evolution

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:20.220
in real time of a system.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.930
And I'll sort of hint at
this more general idea

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:27.660
that we can use these
thermodynamical analogies

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.360
and sort of molecular
dynamic analogies

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:34.560
to actually solve complex
optimization problems.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.070
OK.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:39.750
And so this is an example from
a molecular dynamic simulation,

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.690
actually an ab initio
molecular dynamic simulation,

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:45.420
and one in which one
tries to figure out

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:49.450
what is the local
structure of the liquid.

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:53.460
And so how do you actually
define structure in a liquid?

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.580
Well, sort of one of the
fundamental quantities

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.670
is what is called the
pair correlation function.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:02.160
Suppose that we are
looking, again, at water.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.600
We have the water molecules.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.260
So say we have an oxygen
atom on each molecule.

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.340
And so what we can
sort of ask ourselves

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:16.230
is, what is the probability
of finding another oxygen

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:21.120
atom at a certain
distance from one oxygen?

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.640
So you could sort
of imagine yourself

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.730
sitting on a water molecule
sitting on that oxygen

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:31.110
and sort of
monitoring on average

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:35.670
what is the distribution of
all the other oxygen atoms.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:38.970
And this would be one of these
pair correlation function.

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.580
This is specifically
for the case of water.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.590
I'll tell you in a moment
what the difference

00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:46.740
between these curves is,
but what we are plotting

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.320
is the probability
of finding an oxygen

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.260
atom at a certain
distance if I'm

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.200
sort of sitting on one
of these water molecules

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.770
and running around.

00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:00.450
And as you can see, the
probability below roughly 2.3,

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.150
2.4 angstrom is 0.

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:08.982
So you never find an oxygen atom
closer than 2.3, 2.4 angstrom.

00:52:08.982 --> 00:52:10.440
And this is because,
obviously, you

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.260
know, molecules
by Pauli repulsion

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.950
and electrostatic repulsion,
sort of repel each other very

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:18.930
strongly at close distance.

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.120
This, in the
Lennard-Jones potential,

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.400
was the 1 over r
to the 12th term.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.320
When you get very
close, the repulsion,

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:29.970
it's so strong that you never
get very, very, very close.

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:34.920
Actually, the only time you
sort overcome this short range

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.070
repulsion is in something
like nuclear fusion

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:42.330
in which you can manage to
get, say, hydrogen atom to get

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:45.160
so close together that
actually their nuclei melt

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.950
into a helium.

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:50.640
But you see, at this standard
condition of pressure

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.950
and temperature,
really the probability

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:57.780
of finding some oxygen atom
up to 2.3 angstrom is 0.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.330
And then all of a
sudden, the probability

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:03.390
of finding an oxygen
atom skyrockets.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:04.510
What does this mean?

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:08.820
Well, it means that,
actually, to have,

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.350
if you add an oxygen
atom in a water molecule,

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:19.080
it's very likely to have other
water molecules surrounding you

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.800
at a distance that is a
tad shy of 3 angstrom.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.370
OK.

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:26.830
This is what the chemists would
call the first solvation shell.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:27.510
OK.

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:31.440
The water molecule sort of
runs around in the liquid.

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.040
And there's a certain
number of water molecules

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.070
that are at a certain
average distance that

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.460
is around 2.6, 2.8 angstrom.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.740
And so this is a
solvation shell,

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:47.100
a shell of water molecules
that, on average, surround

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.540
this molecule.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:52.560
And because there is a sort
of average shell of water

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:57.000
molecules around, once you
move outwards from this oxygen,

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.720
then there is going to be a
depletion of water molecules.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.960
Because there is one shell
at a certain distance.

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.240
You move further,
it becomes much more

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.120
difficult to have
water molecules

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.770
at an intermediate distance.

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.770
And this is really sort
of a general description

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:15.480
for all kinds of liquids.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.640
And then you sort of
move farther away.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.990
And then there is a
second solvation shell.

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:23.020
OK, there is structure
in the liquid.

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.400
You have a water molecule.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.250
On average, it's surrounded
by a first shell.

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:30.730
And then, on average, that's
surrounded by a second shell.

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:33.010
And as you move
farther and farther,

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:35.390
the boundaries become
farther and farther.

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.590
So you can sort of spot
a third solvation shell.

00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:42.590
But once you move
farther and farther away,

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:45.550
if you look at what is the
probability distribution 10

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:51.220
angstrom, 100 angstrom, 1
meter away, it becomes flat.

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:54.790
That is, if you look what is the
probability of finding a water

00:54:54.790 --> 00:55:00.280
molecule 1 meter away or 1
meter plus 1/10 of an angstrom,

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.870
there is really no difference.

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:06.010
Because you have lost
long range order.

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:07.750
You have lost structure.

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:11.590
This would be very different,
say, in a perfect crystal.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:16.220
So if you study something like
silicon at 0 temperature--

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:20.060
and for a moment, forget about
zero-point motion and quantum

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:20.560
effects.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.110
Think just at a silicon
crystal as being

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:25.780
made of classical
particles at 0 temperature.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.280
They are perfectly periodic.

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.610
And so what you would
find, you could still

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:33.580
define pair
distribution function.

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.750
And what you would
find is Dirac's delta.

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:40.030
That is the probability
of finding a silicon

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:43.830
atom at a certain distance
from new silicon atoms,

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:45.880
say, sitting on
the origin is going

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:51.400
to be 0 until you hit the
distance of your first shell

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.420
of neighbors.

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:55.360
And then it's sort of infinite
or properly normalized

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.530
at Dirac's delta.

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:59.140
And then it's 0 again, and
then another Dirac's delta,

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.600
and 0 again, and then
another Dirac's delta.

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:05.140
And as you move farther
and farther away,

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:07.630
the density of
your Dirac's delta

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.460
becomes higher and higher.

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:13.000
Because, again, if you are
at 1 meter of distance,

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.940
there are an enormous
amount of possibilities

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:19.660
of finding sort of a
combination of lattice vectors

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:23.450
that give you a silicon
atom in that position.

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:28.720
And so if we were to smooth
out those Dirac's delta, that

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.820
is if we were to have
some temperature,

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.700
we would start seeing something
a little bit like this.

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.360
The first Dirac's delta
would become slightly larger.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.790
The second Dirac's delta,
the third Dirac's delta,

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:41.830
we move farther
and farther away.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.170
There are so many
close to each other

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:46.300
that they all start overlapping.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.020
And also, for a crystal
at final temperature,

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.210
you would start to have
this pair correlation

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:54.790
function that goes towards 1.

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:58.390
In a liquid, it's a
much more dramatic.

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:02.470
And this quantity tells you
also something fundamental

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:06.640
about the appropriate size
of your simulation cell.

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.640
Remember that you are studying
something in periodic boundary

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.580
condition.

00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.720
So the question is, if we
want to study liquid water,

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.240
how large should
our unit cell be?

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.070
I mean, does it
need to contain 10

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:20.020
to the 23, the
Avogadro's number,

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.610
of water molecules in
a macroscopic sample?

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:23.110
No.

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:26.350
And this is a
fundamental concept.

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:30.880
It needs to be large enough
so that the correlation

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.400
between your molecule
in the origin

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:37.870
and that molecule
periodically repeated is 0.

00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:44.410
That is, by the time this pair
correlation function reaches 1,

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:47.450
it means that you have
lost any structure.

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:50.860
So somehow you
don't have any way

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:55.180
of recognizing that there
is a molecule in the origin

00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:59.180
or that molecule is 0.1
angstrom displaced away.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.660
So a molecule that is on
the origin and a molecule--

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.490
suppose that you
continue this curve

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.190
and maybe becomes
15 angstroms away.

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:09.010
Well, those two
molecules are not

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:12.320
aware of each other's existence.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.260
And so if you are
studying your system,

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.020
such data, the distance
between a molecule

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:20.650
and your periodic
image is 15 angstrom.

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:23.290
Actually, from
all point of view,

00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:26.080
you are studying a
system that behave

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.840
as it was an infinite system.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:32.290
Your molecule sitting on
the origin moves around.

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:37.510
And it sees independently
all the molecules with which

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:39.160
on average it interacts.

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.920
And the molecule that
is 15 angstroms away

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.250
is so far away that
there is no correlation.

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:47.600
And so for all
practical purposes,

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:52.270
this molecule on the origin
sees an infinity liquid system.

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:55.030
It doesn't recognize
that there is a boundary

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:57.470
and things are
periodically repeated.

00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:59.740
And this is absolutely
very important.

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:04.570
And that's why we can actually
simulate a realistic liquid

00:59:04.570 --> 00:59:06.640
with actually very
few molecules.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.880
It turns out that, for
something like water,

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:15.250
you need only 32 water molecules
at sort of regular conditions

00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:19.120
in the liquid, 300
kelvin, 350 kelvin,

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.050
to actually simulate
an infinite system.

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:25.780
You don't need to put
more water molecules.

00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:28.330
It won't change anything.

00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:32.500
Of course, as you sort
of get closer and closer

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:37.000
to a phase transition, remember
that, at the exact temperature

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.730
of the phase transition,
the solid and the liquid

00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:40.880
are in equilibrium.

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.180
So the free energy of the
solid and the free energy

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.220
of the liquid are identical.

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:48.580
So it doesn't cost anything
in terms of free energy

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:50.950
to transform the solid in
the liquid and the liquid

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:52.060
in the solid.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:56.920
And that means that you can have
fluctuation, bubbles of solid

00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:02.610
and bubble of liquid,
that have arbitrary sizes.

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:06.000
So at the exact temperature
of the phase transition,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.130
you have a divergence in
this characteristic length.

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:13.590
That is you can have
fluctuations of all sizes.

01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:16.490
So if you were to study
the system, exactly

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:19.700
the phase transition, you
need an infinite sized system.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.610
But as you move away from
the phase transition,

01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:26.000
very quickly the correlation
function dropped down.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.350
And it's something like 25
kelvin above the melting point.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.800
It's so short that you
need only 32 molecules.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.650
And water is actually
an excellent example

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:40.750
to sort of show you also what
goes wrong in the simulation.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.360
OK.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.020
Because what I've
plotted here are actually

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.810
a result of accurate
or very accurate

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.190
ab initio molecular
dynamics simulation.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:52.190
And we know that sort of
density functional theory

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:55.250
actually describes
very well the hydrogen

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.250
bonds, so describes the
interaction between water

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:00.030
molecules very well.

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:02.300
But you can see it here.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.850
You see, these are the
pair correlation function.

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:07.130
You see this sort of
set of curves here,

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:14.270
the more structural set of
curves, taken at 325, 350, 375

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.260
kelvin.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.310
There is actually very, very
little difference between them.

01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:20.630
And that's a bad sign.

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:23.420
So what we are seeing is
that this sort of structure

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:27.010
is not changing as we
increase the temperature.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:28.760
And then we increase
the temperature, say,

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.820
from 375 to 400 kelvin.

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.990
And you see this
different set of curves.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.480
You see the red and the green.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.420
So there is really a
discontinuous change

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:41.720
in going from 375 to 400 kelvin.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.610
What has happened
in our simulation?

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:48.500
Well, it turns out that, at 400
kelvin, our water is liquid.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.520
At 375, it's a glassy system.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.620
So it's an amorphous glass.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.010
And you see it doesn't
change with temperature.

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:02.660
And you need to get to 400
kelvin for it to become liquid.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.250
What is the bad thing here?

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:08.090
It's not that the water is
in an amorphous glass state.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:11.270
It's reasonable, as I said, even
if it's not the result that we

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:16.850
want, to find an amorphous
states for a lot of liquids

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:20.330
that have been cooled down
below the melting temperature

01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:23.630
especially sort of liquids
that tend to have sort

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:25.700
of pseudo-covalent bonding.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:29.840
You study carbon
below its melting pot.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.750
You study silicon.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.460
You study something like water.

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.720
They tend to want to be sort
of tetrahedrally coordinated.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.730
And they tend to sort of form
a lot of glassy structure.

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:44.930
What is really bad is
that the melting of water

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:48.620
doesn't seem to be taking
place at 273 kelvin,

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.020
but it takes place
at 400 kelvin.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:51.710
OK.

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:55.250
So if you want, if you were to
use densely functional theory

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:58.490
and sort of molecular dynamics
to predict what happens,

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:00.600
we would all be frozen to death.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.940
You need to be at 400 kelvin
to see something liquid.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.340
And you see, then
you can also compare.

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.090
This is very good.

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:10.910
There are a lot of
experiments that

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:13.160
look at what is the
structure of water.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.350
You can do this with
neutron scattering.

01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:17.580
You can do this with
X-ray scattering.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.760
So you can probe
the local structure.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.430
And you see this is
what the experiment is.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:26.510
So it's sort of good, but
it's really not perfect.

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:29.060
And so what's going on here?

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.400
What's wrong in this?

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.820
Well, in many ways,
we actually think

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.090
that density functional
theory is good enough

01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:39.170
to simulate water.

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.770
OK.

01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:43.310
So the energy for any
given configuration

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:46.760
is given accurately
by quantum mechanics.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.450
But there is something
very important

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:52.490
that I sort of hinted in
some of the discussion.

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:56.330
300 kelvin, 400 kelvin
is a temperature

01:03:56.330 --> 01:04:02.270
at which molecules can still
display quantum effects

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:05.120
in their vibrational
degrees of freedom.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.300
That is when we discussed
at certain point

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.710
the fact that a simple
molecule like hydrogen

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:17.780
is actually only discrete
vibrational energy

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:19.880
and discrete vibrational states.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.280
And at 0 temperature,
it's in the state

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.110
called zero-point motion.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:27.380
That is a purely quantum
mechanical effect

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:32.060
and doesn't really come
from describing correctly

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:36.020
the energy of the electrons
in the potential of the ions,

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.990
but comes from the fact
that the ions themselves

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:40.640
are quantum particles.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.520
And the excitation
of a quantum particle

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.760
from one state to
another vibrational state

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.020
is in itself quantized.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.650
And so what turns out
to happen in water

01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:57.000
is that the hydrogen oxygen
stretching frequency.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:57.770
OK.

01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:01.040
So the frequencies by
which one hydrogen beats

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.280
against another oxygen
are actually very high,

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.210
are of the order of 3,000
centimeters to the minus 1.

01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:10.280
So that's a typical
sort of measure

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.720
of vibrational frequency.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:15.050
They are, in particular,
sort of 10 times larger

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:17.210
than the average
kinetic temperature

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:18.930
at room temperature.

01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:24.740
So that means that, in reality,
those vibrational modes cannot

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:25.760
be excited.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.830
They are frozen in
their ground state.

01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:32.780
So in all this liquid, you have
a variety of vibrational modes,

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:35.330
some that are very
soft and that involve

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:39.470
sort of how one water molecule
correlates with other water

01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:40.280
molecules.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.760
But you have some very
stiff intermolecular

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.050
vibrational degrees of
freedom that you can't excite.

01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:52.890
And so the classical
description of the ions is good,

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:54.020
but it's not perfect.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:57.140
And that's what brings
us this error here.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:00.230
If we were to study-- sadly,
there are no experiments, say,

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:01.820
at 3,000 kelvin.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.230
But if you were to do an
experiment of, obviously,

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:09.320
water at a sort of
fixed volume, so

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.070
at very high pressure
at 3,000 kelvin, then

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:17.420
the ions would all sort of
behave as classical particles

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.370
and probably our agreements
would be much better.

01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:22.520
But at this low
temperature, some

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.130
of these vibrational degrees
of freedom are actually frozen.

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:29.390
And they can't
exchange temperature.

01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:31.580
They can't exchange
vibrational energy

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.400
with the rest of the
degrees of freedom.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:39.800
It's the same concept by which
the specific heat of solids

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.140
follows the Dulong
and Petit law.

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:45.740
And it's much smaller than
its ideal sort of value

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.820
at low temperatures.

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:50.570
Because even in a solid,
where vibrational frequencies

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:54.140
tend to be much lower than 3,000
centimeters to the minus 1,

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:58.190
it tends to be of the order 300,
400 centimeters to the minus 1.

01:06:58.190 --> 01:07:01.400
So they tend to be all
populated at room temperature.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.900
But in the regime
of low temperatures,

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:07.790
much lower 300 kelvin, some
of those degrees of freedom

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.020
are also frozen out.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:11.450
So they can't
exchange temperature

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:14.150
when you increase the heat.

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:16.610
And so the specific
heat of the system

01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:20.090
is much smaller because a lot
of those degrees of freedom

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:24.450
can't actually talk
with your heat bath.

01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:24.950
OK.

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:26.480
So this was an example.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.160
Let's see another
example in which

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:32.750
we look at ensemble averages.

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:35.490
And this is the example
of the caloric curve.

01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:39.590
So that is plotting
the potential energy

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:41.430
as a function of time.

01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:45.210
This is done for a sort of
classical molecular dynamic

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:46.350
simulation.

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:53.060
So you see it's using
6,400 particles, so

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:54.710
a very large amount.

01:07:54.710 --> 01:08:00.680
This is actually a slab of
lead in the 1, 0, 0 direction.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:04.040
And you see, if we simulate
this at 600 kelvin,

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.120
well, this is as a
function of time.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.000
This is a very long
simulation, you see.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.820
We are talking about
the nanoseconds.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.600
OK.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:17.370
So it's of the order
of 1 million time steps

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:19.850
if we were using times
step for a femtosecond.

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.979
And you see, this
is how the sort

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:29.930
of average potential energy
fluctuates at 607 kelvin.

01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:32.390
And then we increase
the temperature,

01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:35.930
and you see it fluctuates
around another value.

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.840
Increase the temperature,
it fluctuates another value.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:44.720
We increase the temperature a
little bit more from 625 kelvin

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.439
to 630 kelvin, and what
happens in this solid?

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:52.550
You see, at the beginning,
during, if you want,

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:55.850
your thermalization
time, you oscillate

01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:57.680
around a certain value.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.370
But then something
happens, and your system

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:05.899
goes into a new state in which
the average potential energy

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:08.479
oscillates around a new value.

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:10.580
What your system
has done, it's gone

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.740
through a melting transition.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.410
And so the difference
between, if you want,

01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:19.580
the potential energy just
below the melting temperature

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:24.080
and the potential energy just
above the melting temperature

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.930
is this latent heat of
fusion, the energy that

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:34.250
is needed to melt the crystal
or the energy that is released

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:36.560
when the crystal solidifies.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.620
And this is actually a sort
of very specific system

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.910
in which there is a sort of
more exotic phase transition.

01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:46.310
And that's why molecular
dynamics simulations

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:47.090
were needed.

01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:49.220
It was a system
in which there was

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:52.340
what is called incomplete
surface melting.

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:55.310
That is, if you look at
the surface of lead 1,

01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:59.570
0, 0, it starts melting
at a temperature that

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:03.830
is lower than the temperature
at which the bulk melts.

01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:06.380
And this is because
surface atoms are really

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.360
different from bulk atoms.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.920
So they have their
own phase transition.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.400
And it's temperature for
that phase transition

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.140
that is different from the
bulk melting temperature.

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:18.320
So you heat up lead.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.370
All of a sudden, you see that
the surface becomes liquid.

01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:28.430
And then you need to reach
another critical temperature

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:31.140
before also the bulk melts.

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:31.640
OK.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.420
So a couple of examples we have
seen from ensemble averages.

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:38.810
As I said, we can also
use molecular dynamics

01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:42.210
to actually follow
a chemical reaction.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:45.440
And so this is another
example from ab

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.600
initio molecular
dynamic simulation.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.150
Because what we really
want to investigate

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:55.460
is how we can take a molecule
of methane-- you see C and H4.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.440
There are four hydrogen atom.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.670
One is sort of the pink and
below, beneath the yellow.

01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:04.550
We want to figure out
how to break this apart.

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:07.310
This is a fundamental
technological problem

01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:11.060
because we have enormous
reserves of methane is

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:13.500
what people call natural gas.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.390
But it's extremely expensive
to transport because you really

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:22.250
need to liquefy it and carry
it in sort of cryogenically

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.170
frozen containers.

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:26.760
So it's much more expensive
to transport methane

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.980
than to transport oil.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:30.500
And that's why we are
actually not using

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.100
sort of all the methane natural
gas reserves that exist.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.670
So one of the important
things that we could do

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:44.150
is actually transform methane
in some higher and heavier

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:46.430
hydrocarbons, like
methanol, that we

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:48.800
can transport much more easily.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.780
And that, in principle,
is very doable.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:53.600
Methane has an enormous
amount of energies

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.950
ready to be released.

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:58.160
But sadly, in order to
release the energy, in order

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:01.910
if you want to burn methane
or in order to break it apart,

01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:06.770
you need first to break apart
the first carbon-hydrogen bond.

01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:08.100
And that's tough.

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.520
Once you break
that hydrogen bond,

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.760
all the other hydrogen go
and release a lot of energy.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.160
But breaking this
is very difficult.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.460
And we want to do this in
a very controlled manner

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:24.290
in order not to burn methane,
but construct some higher

01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.760
hydrocarbon, like methanol.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.960
And so one sort of very
suggestive hypotheses

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.690
is actually using
nanostructured catalyst, that

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:36.900
is using well-known
catalyst transition metals,

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:40.350
like platinum in this
case, but catalysts

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:43.590
that have a very exotic
surface, so that they

01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:44.820
become more reactive.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:49.090
They can help break part of
this carbon-hydrogen bond.

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:52.770
And so this is where ab
initio molecular dynamics come

01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:56.040
into play because we
can study the system

01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:06.430
and try to figure out what
happens when we take a methane

01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:11.000
molecule, and we throw
it to a platinum surface.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.230
And as you can see,
nothing happens.

01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:16.750
And we are very, very
happy, not so much

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:18.970
because we have sort of
simulated an interesting

01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:23.230
system, but because actually we
can measure the kinetic energy

01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:25.060
of the molecules coming down.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.400
And we can measure
when it comes out.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.970
And we find out that it
has the same velocity,

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:32.440
but opposite direction.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:36.550
So our system is conserving
energy very accurately.

01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:38.500
But you know, what
you can do now

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.780
with your molecular
dynamic simulation

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:43.930
is try to figure out if
this is the whole story.

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:46.300
That is, well, as you
see, we have sort of

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:49.480
thrown this molecule
into the trough here.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.990
Because we thought
that maybe this area

01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:54.850
is the most
catalytically active.

01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:58.420
It's where there are more
platinum atoms able to sort

01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:59.950
of rip this thing apart.

01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:01.690
Well, it turns out
that, actually,

01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:05.920
the most catalytically
active part of the surface

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.550
is the under-coordinated
platinum atoms sitting here

01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:10.510
on the ridge.

01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:15.400
And you see, when the
molecule falls down on this,

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.760
it very easily
breaks apart this.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.390
And so doing our
ab initio MD, we

01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:26.380
discover that these
under-coordinated atoms

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:29.020
are actually much more
active than the sort

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:32.020
of surface-like atoms down here.

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:34.900
So under-coordinating
a transition metal

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.730
is actually very helpful.

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:40.180
And this is actually
what bacteria that

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.790
eat methane for a living do.

01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:46.690
So what those bacterias
do, they have an enzyme

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:49.720
that is called a methane
monooxygense that

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.130
actually is able to break apart
this carbon-hydrogen bond.

01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:57.370
And what it has, it
has sort of two iron

01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:01.810
atoms in the middle of a sort
of porphyrin like structure.

01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:04.930
And those under-coordinated
transition metals

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:06.940
do all the trick.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:11.650
Other examples in which a
molecular dynamic simulation

01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:14.770
helps us understanding
the structure

01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:18.320
of microscopic system--

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.370
as shown here.

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:23.080
In this case, what we
are doing is taking

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.330
a liquid droplet of aluminum.

01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:29.980
So this is aluminum above
its melting temperature.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:33.340
That is sort of 933 kelvin.

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:36.910
It's been thermalized,
and so it's a liquid.

01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:39.160
And then we have a
surface that could

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.340
be, say, two different
crystallographic orientation,

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:46.860
the 1, 1, 0 surface and
the 1, 1, 1 surface.

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:51.610
And what we do is we drop this
liquid droplet on the surface.

01:15:51.610 --> 01:15:55.390
And we sort of see what is
the evolution of the system.

01:15:55.390 --> 01:16:00.340
And on the 1, 1, 0 surface, that
is one of these metal surfaces

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.700
that undergo a pre-melting
transition where the surface

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.810
itself--

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.190
you can see it here--

01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:07.810
becomes liquid-like.

01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.210
What happens is that you
have a liquid droplet falling

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:12.350
on a sort of liquid surface.

01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:17.080
And so it wets completely the
surface, and this moves around.

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.760
You throw this same liquid
droplet on aluminum 1, 1, 1,

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.130
that is a surface
that doesn't matter

01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:26.260
and that actually overheat.

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:30.250
You can sort of bring a
crystalite of aluminum,

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:32.440
and you can look at
the 1, 1, 1 surface.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.140
And you can bring it above
the melting temperature,

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:37.600
and it will not
melt until you reach

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.510
sort of a critical
temperature of 1,000 kelvin.

01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:44.560
Well, this liquid droplet
actually doesn't wet away,

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.170
but it forms, you
see, a little disk.

01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:49.150
And you can actually
sort of measure

01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:51.070
what is this contact angle.

01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:53.950
And so you can figure out
what is the surface tension.

01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:56.290
And you can understand
a lot basically

01:16:56.290 --> 01:17:01.360
about the free energy of the
liquid and the solid just

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.240
by those contact angles.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.090
Another example for which
I have another movie

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.360
is sort of related
to what you have seen

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.280
in the sort of previous slide.

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.350
And it's sort of
looking at actually

01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:20.470
what do adatom on aluminum
1, 0, 0 surface do.

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:24.100
And so you see what we do is,
in ab initio molecular dynamics,

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:26.170
we put an atom here.

01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:29.980
And we let the system evolve
at a certain temperature.

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:33.310
In this case, it's
evolving at 500 kelvin.

01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:36.890
That is roughly 1/2 of
the melting temperature.

01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:39.460
And again, you can
see some features

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:42.610
of an ab initio molecular
dynamic calculation in which we

01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:44.740
can simulate very few atoms.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.240
And so actually,
in this simulation,

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.610
you see our surface area is
given just by 16 atoms, this 4

01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:52.690
by 4 here.

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:55.340
And then we have periodic
boundary condition.

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:59.830
So this atom and this atom are
doing exactly the same thing,

01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:02.440
but we are actually
ourselves in the condition

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:08.390
in which there is no correlation
between what this atom does

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:10.010
and what this atom does.

01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:13.580
So these atoms sort of
behave independently

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:16.040
from what this atom does.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.870
Just because, at
this temperature,

01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:22.070
the correlation length between
these two is very, very short.

01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:24.710
And what I'm not showing
here in this simulation

01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:29.120
is actually the lower
layers of out aluminum slab

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.000
just because they are not
doing anything interesting.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.830
And so we want to understand
how the atoms move around.

01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:38.580
And everyone would
have sort of guessed

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.930
that adatoms on the
surface hop around,

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:44.390
sort of the classical
model of diffusion,

01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:47.690
from one side here in the
middle to another side

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:48.710
here in the middle.

01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:50.240
But you see, you
do your ab initio

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.950
molecular dynamic
simulation, and you

01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:54.470
discover that something
very intriguing happens.

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:58.070
Actually, adatoms do
not diffuse by hopping,

01:18:58.070 --> 01:19:00.800
but they diffuse
by sort of diving

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.865
into the surface layer and sort
of pushing another atom out.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:06.740
And you'll see it again
in a cleaner fashion.

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:10.820
You see the diffusion takes
place by an atom diving in.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:11.450
Look at this.

01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:14.750
This sort of, in a
moment, will dive in

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:19.160
and pushes this sort
of second atom out.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.800
And by the time it
reaches here, now you

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.560
see it appearing in
periodic boundary condition.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.820
And again, the molecular
dynamic simulation

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:32.630
has given you an insight on
the microscopic process that

01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:35.150
provided density functional
theory is accurate.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:37.460
And it, for this
particular system,

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:42.950
is actually very different from
any kind of physical intuition

01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:44.890
would have told you.

01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:46.790
And it's 1 more minute.

01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:49.700
Let me finish this movie because
something more interesting

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:54.630
takes place once you increase
the temperature to 700 kelvin.

01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:56.840
This is what we have done
in the simulation here.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.350
And what you actually see
is that the first surface

01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:04.080
layer starts really
behaving as a liquid.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:04.760
OK.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:07.280
So we actually have
a phase transition

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:10.340
that is induced by the
presence of that atom in which

01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:14.240
this first layer, if you
monitor long enough what

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.770
the mean square
displacements are,

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:18.890
how the atoms are, well,
the atoms in this layer

01:20:18.890 --> 01:20:21.200
move around like a liquid.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.100
But they don't move
around below the surface.

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:28.190
And the surface
remain crystalline.

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.410
And I'll finish the movie.

01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:33.290
We actually then, in our
computational experiment,

01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:37.520
all of a sudden we can remove
atoms from our liquid sample.

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.100
That is we can sort
of take them away.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:44.330
And we actually see very quickly
that the system crystallizes

01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:45.050
again.

01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:46.920
And you'll see it in a moment.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.050
See, we have removed atoms.

01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:49.600
We have actually
removed two atoms.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.040
So we have created a vacancy.

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.020
And the system has
become crystalline.

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:57.590
Now, the atoms vibrate again
around the crystalline surface.

01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:59.390
And there is a vacancy here.

01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:02.600
And from this, we also
discover how the vacancy moves.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:07.310
And you'll see that there is an
atom from below that hops out.

01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:10.460
You see this hops out,
leaving a hole here.

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:13.520
And an atom from the
first layer pops down.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:17.400
So the vacancy that was
here has moved here.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.330
And again, the way
it has moved is not

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:23.000
sort of the usual way in
which one could imagine

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.140
a vacancy moving by a
surface atom moving around,

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:31.460
but it actually involves a
second layer atom jumping out.

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:31.970
OK.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.890
With this movie,
I'll finish today's

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:35.660
molecular dynamic simulation.

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:39.780
We'll sort conclude the
MD part on Thursday.

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.780
And as a reminder,
today was also

01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:45.770
the deadline for your
second assignment, lab two.

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:48.950
And you can give it to
me or to one of the TAs.

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:51.790
And otherwise, we'll
meet on Thursday.

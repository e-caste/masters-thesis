MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.740
Welcome back.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.810
Today's problem is about solving
homogeneous linear systems,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.210
A*x equals 0, but it's also
an introduction to the next

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.774
lecture and next
recitation section,

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:21.190
which are going to be about
solving non-homogeneous linear

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.000
systems, A*x equals b.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.350
The problem is fill
the blanks type.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.880
And it says the set S of all
points with coordinates x, y,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:39.420
and z, such that x minus 5y plus
2z equals 9 is a blank in R^3.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.730
It is in a certain relation
to the other blank S_0

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.730
of all the points
with coordinates x, y,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.210
and z that satisfy the
following linear equation,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.730
x minus 5y plus 2z equals 0.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.880
After we solve this,
we have the second part

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.170
of the problem, which
says all points of x have

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.569
a specific form, x,
y, z equals blank, 0,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.740
0, plus some parameter
times blank, 1,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.880
0 plus some other parameter
times blank, 0, 1.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.810
And we need to fill
out all six blanks.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.992
Now you should pause the
video, fill in the blanks,

00:01:17.992 --> 00:01:19.950
and then come back and
see some pretty pictures

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.950
that I prepared for you.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.130
And we're back.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.040
So you probably picked this
up in lectures already.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.130
If you have a three-dimensional
space with three degrees

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.910
of freedom, and put in
one constraint, so put

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.790
in one equation,
you get something

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.820
that has two degrees
of freedom, something

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.450
that's two-dimensional.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990
If this equation is linear,
rather than quadratic

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.050
or cubic or exponential,
this something

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.420
is something
two-dimensional and flat.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.210
Something two-dimensional and
flat in R^3 is also called

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.740
a plane, or a two-plane.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.050
Similarly, S_0 is also a plane.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.990
Now, what's the relation
between S and S_0

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.850
if they're given by
these two equations?

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.130
Well first let's look at the
general positions in which two

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.450
planes in R^3 can be.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.270
First one is that they're
intersecting along a line.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.820
What's going to happen here is
that all points on this plane

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.160
are points whose
coordinates satisfy

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.070
the equation of this plane.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.240
The points in this
plane are points

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.020
whose coordinates satisfy
the equation of this plane.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.650
And the points on the line
are points whose coordinates

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.090
satisfy the system of this
equation and this equation.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.420
The other position in
which two planes can be

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.210
is that they're not intersecting
at all, that they're parallel.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.810
So let's start by trying
to find this line here.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:14.920
The equation of one plane is
x minus 5y plus 2z equal 9.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.690
The equation of the other one
is x minus 5y plus 2z equals 0.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.730
Now you can just
look at it and see

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.700
how many solutions
it's supposed to have,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.160
or you can try
doing elimination,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.760
and after one step
of elimination

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.970
get 0 equals 9,
which never happens.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.050
There cannot exist numbers
x, y, and z such that this

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.060
combination of them produces
0, and the same combination

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.440
of them produces 9
at the same time.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.910
So this red line
here doesn't exist,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.830
and the situation of these two
planes S and S_0 is this one,

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.900
they're parallel.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.810
So let's add the word
parallel in here.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.640
And let's move on to the
other half of the problem.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.640
The other half said all points
of S have this specific form.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.680
Now let me call
this point here P_0.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.120
If all points of
S have this form,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.980
we can plug in any
parameter c_1 and c_2 here

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.040
and we're going to get
a point of the plane.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:30.270
So in particular, we can plug
in c_1 and c_2 equal to 0.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.440
What we get then is
that the point (x, y, z)

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:43.890
equals P_0 is a point of
the plane S. So P_0 is in S.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.290
What do we know
about the point P_0?

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.500
Well the fact that
it's in S means

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:58.920
that its coordinates, x
minus 5y plus 2z equal 9.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.400
That's the equation
of S. But we also

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.675
know that y and z
are equal to 0 and 0.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:18.360
Solving this system we get that
the x-coordinate of this point

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.235
P_0 is 9, and we
can just add 9 here.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.556
So we just have two
blanks left to fill.

00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:30.180
Before we'll fill
them, let me show you

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.760
a picture that I drew here.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.790
So we have these two planes,
S_0 and S, which are parallel.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.070
They're given by
these equations.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.780
And the plane S_0
has a point 0 in it,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.090
because the equation is x
minus 5y plus 2z equals 0,

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.310
so it satisfied by 0, 0, 0.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.240
The plane S has this point P_0
in it, which is (9, 0, 0)--

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.970
we just figured this out.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.720
And there's this vector
connecting one plane

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.260
to the other.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.640
Now, since those two
planes are parallel

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.280
and there's this vector going
between them, what we can see

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.340
is that a good way
to get any point in S

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.880
is to go to any point in S_0
and go up by this vector.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.340
Now let me write this down.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:36.350
What I just said is that any
point in S is of the form--

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:48.700
use this vector to go up--
plus any point in S_0.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.360
And if we compare this
to this expression here,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.930
we also get P_0 plus
this linear combination.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:03.130
So this here has to
be a point in S_0.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.390
Now we're left with a question
of how to parameterize

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.650
all points in S_0.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.620
What are all the points in
S_0, and what does this problem

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.430
have to do with solving
homogeneous linear equations?

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.680
Well, let me write
this equation of S_0

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.090
in a slightly different way.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:35.270
Let me write it as 1, minus
5, 2, x, y, z, equals 0.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.690
And let me think of this
as a matrix of the system.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.270
It's a very tiny matrix,
but it's a matrix.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.900
And think of it as a
matrix dot a vector equals

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.840
0, and trying to find all
solutions of the system.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.790
Well let's do row
reductions here.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.280
It's already as upper triangular
as these tiny matrices get.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.180
This is a pivot.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.255
So we have a pivot variable x.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:13.960
These are free
variables, y and z.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.080
And if you remember how
to solve these systems,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.000
for each free variable we
get one particular solution.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:29.820
So we get one particular
solution when we plug in y is 1

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.860
and all the other
free variables are 0.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.500
Plugging it in here, we
just get that in that case,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:46.990
x-- so we get x minus 5 times
1 plus 2 times 0 equals 0.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.270
So x is equal to 5.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.450
And the other solution
is for setting

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.630
all free variables
equal to 0, except z

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.290
which we set equal to 1.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:03.260
And then we get x minus 5 times
0 plus 2 times 1 equals 0.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:10.520
So we get that in this
case, x equals minus 2.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.130
And any solution of this system
is going to be of the form

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:20.800
some constant times this plus
some other constant times this.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.340
And if we walk back to
our original problem here,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.660
we see that these parameters,
these numbers here,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.890
have been set up exactly so that
we can just take these numbers

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:36.220
and just copy them
over, 5 and minus 2.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.650
And this is the general form
of any point of the plane S.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:44.210
It's go up this vector, and
then add a point in S_0,

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.820
in the parallel plane that
passes through the origin.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.910
This finishes our problem.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.760
But what I would
encourage you to do now

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.920
is to go on to the next lecture,
watch the next recitation

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.230
video, and then come
back here and think

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.480
about what is it that
we really did here

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.870
on this half of the board.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.630
Thank you.

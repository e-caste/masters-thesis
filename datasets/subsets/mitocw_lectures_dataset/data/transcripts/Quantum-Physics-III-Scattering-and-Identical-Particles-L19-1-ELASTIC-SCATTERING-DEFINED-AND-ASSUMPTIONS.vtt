00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.440
PROFESSOR: Today, we begin
with our study of scattering.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.580
And so scattering
is the next chapter

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.180
in our study of approximations.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.630
What is the purpose
of scattering?

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.610
Physicists want to study the
interactions between particles,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.080
the forces.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.500
We know, for example,
in a hydrogen atom

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.560
there is an electromagnetic
force within the proton

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.400
and the electron.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.070
We understand it rather well.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.410
But there are other
forces in nature

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.440
that we don't understand very
well, are harder to understand.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.490
Those at higher energies, the
interactions between particles

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.220
can be rather complicated.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.470
Also, it may happen that you
have a situation where there's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.020
a potential affecting particles,
maybe a trap or something that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.890
holds particles.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.420
And there's a potential.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.650
And you really cannot measure
directly this potential.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.620
There's no simple
way of doing so.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.010
And then what you do is
you send particles in.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.770
And you see how
they get affected.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.570
And by studying the
reflection or the scattering

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.660
of the particles off
of this potential,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.910
you'll learn a lot about
what this potential can be.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.730
So this subject
today is scattering.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:51.090
And in general, you have a
beam of particles, a target,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.700
and a number of detectors.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.880
That's what happens
in a big accelerator.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.420
And in general, you
have such situations.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.990
OK?

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:16.830
So a beam, some sort of target,
and particles get scattered.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.140
And you have detectors.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.860
And in general, the detectors
are all over in all directions

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.110
because particles
may back scatter,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.560
may go in different ways.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.570
So collisions, in general,
are rather intricate.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.840
Particles can change
identity, can do

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.560
all kinds of different things.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.380
For example, you can have a
proton colliding with a proton.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.700
This could be the case when
the beam is a beam of protons.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.890
And here, maybe there's
a target in which

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.700
you study what happens when
a proton encounters a proton.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.220
Or it may be that in
some cases there's

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.610
another beam that is
coming also with protons.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.660
And they collide.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.140
But when protons
collide with protons,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.580
funny things can happen.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.690
For example, you can
get the two protons

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.880
plus a pion, a neutral pion,
0 denoting zero charge.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.150
That's a hadron, a strongly
interacting particle,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.345
like the proton is.

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:36.280
It's made of quarks.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.230
And this can happen.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.510
There's no such thing
as a conservation

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.400
of the number of particles.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.690
That is one of the reasons you
need quantum field theory to do

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.960
this kind of computation.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.380
And this reaction is
allowed because it,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.510
at least the first
thing you can check

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.700
is that it conserves charges.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.010
Proton and proton go
to proton and proton,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.530
so a charge is conserved.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.360
And pi 0 is neutral.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.080
So that, for
example, can happen.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.980
Or proton plus proton can
go to proton plus neutron.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.810
Now, charge is not conserved.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.525
But this time, a positively
charged pion called pi plus.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.120
The particles can
completely change identity.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.870
You can have an electron
and a positron colliding.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.160
So that's electron.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.840
This is the positron, the
anti-particle of the electron,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440
equal mass, oppositely charged.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.310
And then they can go into
a mu plus plus a mu minus.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.830
These are charged laptons.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.670
Again, just like the
electrical laptons, as opposed

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.900
to these particles here.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.070
They're called hydrons.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.570
These particles are, as far
as we know, are elementary.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.930
These particles are
made out of quarks.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.670
And in this case, you have a
complete change of identity.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.230
The original particles
have disappeared.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.490
And new particles
have been created.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.770
And you can look forward
to study these processes

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.570
as you continue your studies
of quantum mechanics.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.900
But these are like reactions.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.690
Now, in our name, in our
nomenclature for scattering,

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.680
we will call the process
a scattering process

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.790
where the identity of the
particles is unchanged.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:54.020
So we will have
scattering, strictly

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:08.160
speaking, when there is
no change of identity

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.830
in the initial and final states.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:25.210
No change of identity of
the particles in the process

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:36.140
of going from initial
to final state.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:44.860
So a scattering process looks
like a plus b goes to a plus b.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.420
We don't change identity.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.790
Those processes where you change
identity are harder to discuss.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.360
And we won't discuss them here.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.030
Even here, there is still a
lot of things that can happen.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.370
It's very intricate.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.840
So we will demand even more.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.490
We will call or look
for elastic scattering.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.290
And that means that if these
particles or objects have

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:36.700
internal states, those internal
states are not changed.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.940
So the internal states of
the particles do not change.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.560
Of course, that can
happen essentially

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.710
when the particles are complex.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.010
They're bound states
of other particles.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.100
So you may have a bound
state of one form.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.440
And then when you
have bound states,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.040
you know you have all kinds of
energy levels internal states.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.750
And then when we say we
have an elastic process,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:24.050
it means that those internal
states are not changed.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:29.960
A classic example of
an inelastic scattering

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:35.390
experiment, the most
famous historically

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.700
of those experiments, is an
experiment by Frank and Hertz

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.950
in 1914.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.770
They were having a
chamber with mercury gas.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.600
And they shot electrons
from one side to the other.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.300
And the electrons and the
mercury atoms collided.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:05.660
And they found that the
electrons were slowed down

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.650
by some quantized
amount of energy.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:16.650
And that was the first evidence
that atoms had energy levels.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.670
Bohr's theory of atoms
had been proposed one year

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.400
before that, 1913.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.040
And then, the process in which
these electrons hit the atoms

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.510
and lost energy corresponding
to producing transitions

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.500
in the atoms.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.770
And that would be an
inelastic scattering

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.940
because the atom changed
its internal state.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.880
This is a collision between
an electron and an atom,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.160
but the atom has
changed internal states.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.280
So we will want
to consider cases

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.230
when we don't change
the internal state.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:02.370
And that will be when we
have elastic scattering.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.940
So a few more things that
we're going to assume as we

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.030
do elastic scattering.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.920
We will work without spin.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.040
All we will do in the
next lectures, one or two

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.440
more lectures in this, will
be particles without spin.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.200
As we're doing in
our course, we also

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.350
work in the nonrelativistic
approximation.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.920
So these are the first
things that we will assume.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.200
One, no spin.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.790
This doesn't complicate
matters as far

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.100
as the scattering is concerned.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.190
It just complicates the
algebra and the calculations

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.680
you have to do because you
have more degrees of freedom.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.920
We will be working
nonrelativistically.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.760
Moreover, we will assume
there are interactions.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.800
There are interactions
between the particles

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.480
that produce the scattering.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.930
And those interactions
are simple enough

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.370
that they just depend on
the difference of position.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:35.000
So the interaction
potentials are

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.430
of the form v of R1 minus R2.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:45.580
So processes in which will
have two incoming particles

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.720
and they interact, and
they scatter elastically.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.190
And the potential depends
on just the difference

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.800
of the two positions.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.530
Eventually, we will
even assume it's only

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.840
on the magnitude of
these differences

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.520
for particular cases.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.300
But if you have a
potential like this,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.670
like when we were
studying with hydrogen

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.610
atom for the first
time, a potential

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:18.590
that just depends on the
differences of positions

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:23.120
can be treated in the
center of mass frame.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.730
It's a nice frame where
you can work on it.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.540
And then you can think of
it as a single particle

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.890
scattering of a potential.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:38.750
So you translate the
Schrodinger equation

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.810
into a center of mass
degrees of freedom

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.450
that are generally simple.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.460
And we don't worry about and
a relative degree of freedom.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.770
So this can be done here.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:59.770
So this makes a process
equivalent to scattering

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:12.130
of a particle of a
potential V of r.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.670
And that particle
has the reduced mass,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.020
just like happened
with a hydrogen atom.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.390
The real mass of the
equation we solve

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:26.660
for showing the Hamiltonian
for a hydrogen atom,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.020
the mass that shows up
there is the reduced mass,

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.790
which is approximately
equal to the electron mass.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.630
But in general, in this
scattering process,

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.820
it may be between two identical
particles in which case

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.310
a reduced mass would be half
the mass of the particle.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:51.900
So again, we will
work scattering

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.670
with energy eigenstates.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.780
You may have studied
already in 804

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.970
a little bit of problems
of scattering off

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.890
of rectangular barriers,
tunneling, all these things.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.690
And we work with energy
eigenstates in those cases.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:15.030
And we will work with energy
eigenstates as well here.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:22.020
Now, in some versions of 804,
you discuss a lot wave packets.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.330
I used to discuss
a lot wave packets.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.690
We would build wave
packets and send them in.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.600
And use a transmission on
reflection coefficients

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.480
to figure out what
the wave packets do.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.800
And in general, a wave packet
is a somewhat more physical way

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.870
of thinking of the processes.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.430
Because the energy states,
eigenstates, are unnormalizable

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.730
and don't have a
direct interpretation

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.170
in terms of particles.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.270
Rigorously speaking,
you should always

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.280
do things with wave packets.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.380
But the fact is that we all
work with energy eigenstates.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.740
And most of the times, what
happens with wave packets

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.040
can be more or less gleaned
from what is happening

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.560
with energy eigenstates.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.460
So we will not new
wave packets here.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.960
We will not bother to
construct wave packets.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.810
They would not teach us
too much at this moment.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.120
So we will work with
energy eigenstates.

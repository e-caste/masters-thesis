00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:06.260
DEEPTO CHAKRABARTY: A pivoted
rod held horizontal, parallel

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.000
to the ground, and
released from rest

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.590
will simply fall, rotating
about the pivot point.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.720
In particular, suppose
we have a mass attached

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.340
to one end of a pivoted rod.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.650
So here is my pivot.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.020
Here's my pivoted rod, which
we'll assume is massless.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.720
And I have-- and
it has a length d,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.860
and I attach a
mass m to one end.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.670
If I let this go from
rest, it will simply

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.532
fall, rotating about the pivot
point, which I'll call s.

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:41.240
And it's easy to
understand that in terms

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.110
of the action of gravity
which is acting downward

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.660
and the resulting
torque about point s.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:01:02.490
If I replace this point mass
with a wheel of the same mass,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.590
so this disk is a
wheel with, let's say,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.750
a radius r and the same mass
m attached to a pivoted rod.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.360
The rod is massless
and has length d.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.970
If I hold this horizontal,
parallel to the ground,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.520
and release it from
rest, it will still just

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.020
fall to the ground.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.340
Not a surprising result.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.550
What is surprising is if
I then spin up the wheel,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.900
so if I have the
wheel rotating about

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.090
its axle with some large
angular velocity, little omega,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.670
and then I hold it horizontal,
parallel to the ground,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.160
and release it from rest, then
remarkably this wheel plus axle

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.540
will not fall.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.570
It will remain horizontal,
parallel to the ground.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.150
But the center of
mass of the wheel

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:58.590
will execute a small circular
orbit about the vertical axis

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.690
through the pivot point.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.160
This remarkable and
very non-intuitive

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.190
motion is called
precession and the system

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.460
that's undergoing precession
is called a gyroscope.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.470
Let's see if we can
understand this behavior

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.090
in terms of the angular
momentum of the system.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.270
So what I've drawn here is
a side view of the system.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.330
So let's define
some coordinates.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.520
So we have r-hat in the
radial outward direction,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.770
k-hat in the direction of the
z-axis, the vertical axis.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.495
And then we'll define theta-hat
pointing into the screen.

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:55.250
OK, so that's a side view.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.480
I'd like to now draw a top view.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.740
So let's say we're looking
down along the z-axis

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.580
from the top on the system.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.230
So now here is my
pivot point, and here

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.840
is a top view of my wheel.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.240
Again, this is a distance d.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.220
Now this is still
the r-hat direction.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.790
This is the theta-hat direction.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.480
And the k-hat direction. is
pointing out of the screen.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.910
Let's draw the forces
acting on our diagram here.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.560
So the weight is acting at the
center of mass of the wheel.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.400
That's mg downward.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.210
And there's a normal
force acting upwards

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.700
at the pivot point.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.670
The torque is just
given by r cross f,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.700
and so relative to
point s at the distance

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.280
d times the weight mg.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.000
So the torque is mgd.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.400
And by doing r cross f
with the right hand rule,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.640
we see that it's directed in
the plus theta-hat direction.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.500
Now again, let's
suppose that I'm

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.190
holding the wheel horizontal
and release it from rest.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.910
If the wheel is not spinning--

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.200
so this is not rotating,
this is a stationary wheel

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.220
that I'm holding horizontal,
and I release it from rest,

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.980
then its initial
angular momentum,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.160
with respect to point s, is 0.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.280
Over a short time
interval, delta t,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.740
the torque which is acting
in the theta-hat direction,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.760
will cause an angular impulse or
change in the angular momentum.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.470
That change in angular
momentum, delta l vector,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.240
is equal to the torque
times that short time

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.710
interval, delta t.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.792
And it will act in the
theta-hat direction.

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:56.250
The change in
angular momentum will

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.070
be in the theta-hat direction
because that's the direction

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.060
that the torque is in.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.220
So for this case--

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.220
and by the way, this view here,
I should have labeled this.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.660
This is a top view.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.710
So this is the side view.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.570
This is the top view
of the same system.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.880
So the torque is mgd in
the theta-hat direction.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.290
So in the side view, that's
going into the screen.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.260
And in the top view, that's
going pointing upward.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.130
That's the theta-hat direction.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.890
So in the case where
the wheel is not

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.770
spinning, if we think
about the top view,

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.201
the initial angular
momentum is 0.

00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:39.700
Right?

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.200
So I'll just draw that as a dot.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.590
So that's l initial equals 0.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.080
And then I add a small torque,
or small angular impulse

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.540
due to the torque,
delta l, which

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.290
is in the theta-hat direction.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.490
So that's pointing in
the theta-hat direction.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.260
So that's my delta l.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.920
And when I sum those
together, I start out with 0.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.750
I add a small delta l.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.220
So my final angular momentum,
a time delta t later,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.400
is just equal to my delta l.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.880
So this is l final.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.090
And that's pointing in
the theta-hat direction.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.240
So a torque in the
theta-hat direction,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.670
into the screen
for the side view,

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.550
is consistent with the
wheel falling down.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.970
So with theta-hat
pointing into the screen,

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.210
the wheel will
basically fall this way.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.810
It's rotating about point s.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.990
And that's consistent
with the torque pointing

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.000
in the theta-hat direction.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.760
Now as the wheel
falls, the torque

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.370
continues to point in
the theta-hat direction.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.860
And so the angular
acceleration will increase.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.840
Now what happens if this wheel
is not stationary, but instead

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.360
is spinning rapidly?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.010
In that case, the
torque remains the same.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.510
It's still mgd in the
theta-hat direction.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.350
But now the initial
angular momentum is not 0.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.000
Rather it is a very large vector
pointing along the spin axis.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.950
Let's choose the
sense of rotation

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.190
such that l points in
the plus r-hat direction.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.020
That's actually the
way I've drawn it here.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.360
So in that case, the
angular momentum vector

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.100
initially points in the
plus r-hat direction.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.680
So then what happens over
a short time, delta t?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.705
So now let's consider the case
where the wheel is spinning.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.620
So now my initial
angular momentum

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.600
is a large vector pointing
in the r-hat direction.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.500
That's l initial.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:01.580
I'm adding a small
perpendicular vector, delta l,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.090
in the theta-hat direction.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:09.730
And so the sum of
those two things,

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.790
if this is the original r-hat
direction, what's happened

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:18.147
is that my new vector is at
a small angle with respect

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:19.480
to the original r-hat direction.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.260
I'll call that
angle delta theta.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.890
So what I've done is I've
rotated my initial angular

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:32.909
momentum vector by a small angle
without changing its length.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.289
Notice the two very
different situations.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.490
In one case, I start out
with 0 angular momentum.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.500
And all the angular
momentum I end up with

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.800
comes from the angular
impulse due to the torque.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.020
In the second case, where
the wheel is spinning,

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.390
I start out with a very large
initial angular momentum.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.890
I then add a small
angular impulse,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.320
small compared to my
initial angular momentum,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.630
in the perpendicular direction.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.500
And that causes not a change
in the length of the vector,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.850
but a change in its direction.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.390
Which means that the angular
momentum vector rotates.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.930
That's why the
system precesses when

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.500
the wheel is rotating rapidly.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.340
Before we can understand
precession more carefully,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.900
it'll be useful to review
the mathematics of rotating

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.010
vectors.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:30.010
So first, suppose we have
a vector that I'll call r1.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.562
And I'm going to add a
vector delta r to this.

00:09:33.562 --> 00:09:35.020
And I'm going to
have the condition

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.560
that the length of
delta r is much,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.210
much smaller than the length
of my original vector r1,

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:58.250
and that delta r is
perpendicular to R1.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:03.830
So here's my delta r.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.120
And so if I add
these two vectors,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:15.440
let's say r2 is the
sum of r1 plus delta r,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.910
so that's my vector r2.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.210
And I'm going to call
this angle delta theta.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.340
And now few things to note.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.710
First of all, since this
is a right triangle,

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:35.270
notice that the length
r2 is equal to r1 divided

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:41.640
by the cosine of delta theta.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.920
But if that angle is small, if
delta theta is a small angle,

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.110
then cosine theta is
well approximated by 1,

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.320
and so this is just
my original length r1.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.720
And since r1 is equal to r2,
I'm just going to call that--

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.550
call them both r.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:06.690
And this is for
small delta theta.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.140
So that tells us that
the vector just rotates.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.070
When I have a large vector,
and I add a small perpendicular

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.300
vector, the result is to
rotate the original vector

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.920
without changing its length.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.500
As long as the angle is
small or, equivalently, as

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.970
long as delta r is very small
compared to my original vector

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.670
length, I'll get
a pure rotation.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.050
In addition, again
looking at this triangle,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:39.340
notice that delta r is
equal to [AUDIO OUT], which

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:47.050
I can describe as r, times
the sine of delta theta.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.810
And again, if the
angle is small,

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.820
if delta theta's a
small angle, then this

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.990
is well approximated by
r times the angle delta

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.180
theta in radians.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:06.920
And again, this is
for small delta theta.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.530
So now if I divide
this last equation

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:16.870
by delta t, small time interval
in which this rotation is

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:24.420
happening, then I write this
as delta r vector divided

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.560
by delta t.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.850
And I take the
magnitude of that.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:37.530
That is equal to r delta
theta divided by delta t.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.640
And if I go to the limit
as delta t gets small,

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.690
as delta t approaches
0, then I can write this

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:50.497
as the derivative of the
vector r, the time derivative,

00:12:50.497 --> 00:12:52.080
I should say the
magnitude of the time

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.730
derivative of vector r.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:13:00.630
And that's equal to the length
r times the time derivative

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.350
of the angle d theta dt.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.500
But d theta dt is just
the angular velocity.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.760
So I could write that
as r times capital omega

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.320
for the angular velocity.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.140
And this is just
our familiar result

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:21.780
that for circular motion, for
the rotation of a position

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.330
vector, the velocity
is equal to the radius

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:34.044
of the circle times the angular
velocity of the rotation.

00:13:34.044 --> 00:13:35.460
Another way of
thinking of that is

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.780
that the magnitude of the
rate of change of the position

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.030
vector, which we
call the velocity,

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.520
is equal to the length
of the rotating vector

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.680
r times the angular
velocity of the rotation.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.740
But there's nothing special
about the position vector

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.110
that I used in order
to do this analysis.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:02.970
So if instead of a position
vector I considered any vector,

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:11.780
so let's say this is my
rotational motion of a vector

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:17.000
that I'll call A. So
that's A at time t.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.790
And then at some later time,
that's A of t plus delta t.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:33.260
This vector is my delta A. I'll
call this angle delta theta.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.070
And so the vector A is
rotating in that direction

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.920
with an angular
velocity capital omega.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.560
Now in the example I just did,
my vector A is actually r of t.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.390
But so everywhere
where I have an r here,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.860
I can just write an A. This
is now just an arbitrary

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.120
vector in space that is rotating
at an angular velocity capital

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.050
omega.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.050
And what we see, using
the same analysis,

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:06.830
we would find that the magnitude
of the time rate of change

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.670
of the vector, of
the rotating vector,

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.760
is equal to the length of
the rotating vector, which

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:20.450
is A, times d theta dt.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.700
Or in other words, the
length of the rotating

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.750
vector times the angular
velocity of the rotation.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.500
That's true for any vector.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.000
OK?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.330
This is a general
result. v equals

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:36.920
r omega is just a special
case of this general rule

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.010
where, in that case, my rotating
vector is a position vector.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.280
But this is true for any vector
that's rotating in space.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.610
In particular for a
rotating angular momentum--

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:58.440
for a rotating angular
momentum vector,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.410
I have that the magnitude of the
time derivative of the rotating

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.111
angular momentum vector is
just equal to the length

00:16:09.111 --> 00:16:11.610
of the angular momentum vector,
the magnitude of the angular

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:16.570
momentum, times the angular
velocity of rotation.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.176
Now in addition, in the
particular case of a rotating

00:16:19.176 --> 00:16:21.550
angular momentum vector or of
any angular momentum vector

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:27.160
rather, we know that the time
derivative of the angular

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.920
momentum vector is also
equal to the torque vector.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.930
So I can set these
two things equal.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.510
In the case of a rotating
angular momentum vector,

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.000
the magnitude of
the torque is given

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.260
by the magnitude of the
rotating angular momentum

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.600
vector times the angular
speed of rotation.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.680
And that's just using
the general behavior

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.430
of a rotating vector in space.

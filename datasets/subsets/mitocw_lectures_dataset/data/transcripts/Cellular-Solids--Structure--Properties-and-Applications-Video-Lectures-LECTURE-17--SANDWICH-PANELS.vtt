00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.480
LORNA GIBSON: OK, so we
should probably start.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.130
So last time we finished up
talking about energy absorption

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.870
in foamy cellular materials.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.560
And today I wanted
to start a new topic.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.630
We're going to talk
about sandwich panels.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.140
So sandwich panels have
two stiff, strong skins

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.180
that are separated by some
sort of lightweight core.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.110
So the skins are typically,
say, a metal like aluminum,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.350
or some sort of fiber composite.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.310
And the core is usually some
sort of cellular material.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.630
Sometimes it's an
engineering honeycomb.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.740
Sometimes it's a foam.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.540
Sometimes it's balsa wood.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.400
And the idea is that
what you're doing

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.840
with the core is you're using
a light material to separate

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.466
the faces, and if you
think about an I-beam--

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.340
so if you remember when
we talk about bending

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.270
and we talk about I-beams, the
whole idea is that in bending,

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.080
you want to increase
the moment of inertia.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.040
So you want to make as
much material as far

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.610
away from the middle
of the beam as possible

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.290
to increase the
moment of inertia.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.480
So if you think about an I-beam,
you put the flanges far apart

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.810
with the web, and that
increases the moment of inertia.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.530
And the sandwich
panels and the sandwich

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.080
beams essentially
do the same thing,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.490
but they're using a lightweight
core instead of a web.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.510
And so the idea is you
use a lightweight core.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.270
It separates the faces.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.975
It increases the
moment of inertia.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:43.600
But you don't add a
whole lot of weight

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.330
because you've got this
lightweight core in the middle.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.410
So I brought some examples
that I'll pass around

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.690
and we can play with.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.420
So these are some examples up
on the screen, and some of those

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.810
I have down here.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.820
So for instance, the
top-- turn my little gizmo

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.770
on-- the top left here, this
is a helicopter rotor blade,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.160
and that has a
honeycomb core in it.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.530
This is an aircraft flooring
panel that has a honeycomb core

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.740
and has carbon fiber faces.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.840
So that's this thing here.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.160
I'll pass that
around in a minute.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.520
This is a downhill ski.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.190
This has aluminum faces and
a polyurethane foam core.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.940
And that's the ski here.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.600
And it's quite
common in skis now

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.570
to have these sandwich panels.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.050
This is a little piece
of a small sailing boat.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.160
It had, I think, glass fiber
faces and a balsa wood core.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.840
And I don't know
if any of you sail,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.680
but MIT has new sailing boats.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.552
Do you sail?

00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:36.010
AUDIENCE: I do not
much these days.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.110
LORNA GIBSON: OK,
but those little tech

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.735
dinghies that you
see out in the river,

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:40.640
those have sandwich
panel holes to them.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.610
So those are little
sandwich panels.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.240
This is an example
from a building panel.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.390
This has a dry wall face and a
plywood face and a foam core,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.830
and the idea with
panels for buildings

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.370
is that usually they use a
foam core because the foam has

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.680
some thermal insulation.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.700
So as well as sort of
separating the faces

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.840
and having a
structural role, it has

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.640
a role in thermally
insulating the building.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.200
The foams are a
little less efficient

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.435
than using a honeycomb core.

00:03:07.435 --> 00:03:10.480
So for the same weight,
you get a stiffer structure

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.370
with a honeycomb core
than a foam core.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.850
But if you want thermal
insulation as well as

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.160
a structural requirement,
then the foam cores are good.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.040
And these are a couple examples
of sandwiches in nature.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.060
This is the human skull.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.450
And your skull is a
sandwich of two dense layers

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.950
of the compact bone,
and you can see

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.470
there's a little thin layer of
the trabecular bone in between.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.950
So your head is like a sandwich,
your skull is like a sandwich.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.492
And I don't know if I'll
get to it next time,

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:39.950
but in the next
couple of lectures,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.740
I'm going to talk a little
bit about sandwich panels

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.380
in nature, sandwich
shells in nature.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.620
You see this all the time.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.210
And this is a bird wing, here.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.442
And so you can see
there's got the dense bone

00:03:48.442 --> 00:03:49.900
on the top and the
bottom, and it's

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.000
got this kind of almost
trust-like structure

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.762
in the middle.

00:03:52.762 --> 00:03:54.720
And obviously birds want
to reduce their weight

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.000
because they want to fly,
so reducing the weight's

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.390
very important.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.490
And so this is one of the ways
that birds reduce their weight,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.954
is by having a sandwich
kind of structure.

00:04:03.954 --> 00:04:05.370
So I have a couple
of things here.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.320
These are the two
panels at the top there.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.920
This is the ski, and you
can yank those around.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.985
I also have a few panels
that people at MIT have made.

00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:20.860
And I have the pieces
that they're made from.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.020
So you can see how effective
the sandwich thing is.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.470
So this was made by a
guy called Dirk Moore.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.350
He was a graduate student
in ocean engineering.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.252
And it has aluminum faces and
a little thin aluminum core.

00:04:33.252 --> 00:04:35.710
So you can see, if you try and
bend that with your fingers,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.980
you really can't bend it
any noticeable amount.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.430
And this panel here is
roughly the same thickness

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.340
of the face on that.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.960
And you can see how
easy it is for me

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.270
to bend that-- very easy.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.470
And this is the same kind
of thing as the core.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.970
It's thicker than
that core, but you

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.480
can see how easy it is
for me to bend this, too.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.690
So each of the pieces is
not very stiff at all.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.310
But when you put them all
together, it's very stiff.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.290
So that's really
the beauty of this.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.274
You can have
lightweight components,

00:05:04.274 --> 00:05:06.190
and by putting them
together in the right way,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.310
they're quite stiff.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.920
So here's another example here.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.700
This is a panel that one of
my students, Kevin Chang made.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.137
And this has actually already
been broken a little bit,

00:05:15.137 --> 00:05:16.970
so it's not quite as
stiff as it used to be.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.520
And you can kind of
hear, it squeaks.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.860
But you can feel that and
see how stiff that is.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.720
And this is the face panel here.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.970
And you can see, I can bend
that quite easily with my hands.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.230
Doodle-doot.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.840
And then this is
the core piece here.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.214
And again, this
is very flexible.

00:05:34.214 --> 00:05:36.505
So it's really about putting
all those pieces together.

00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:39.270
So you get this
sandwich construction

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.186
and you get that effect, OK?

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:44.145
[? Oop-loo. ?]

00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:46.370
All right, so what
we're going to do

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.610
is first of all look at the
stiffness of these panels,

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.640
calculate their deflection.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.220
We're going to look at the
minimum weight design of them.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.050
So we're going to
look at how for,

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.220
say, given materials
in a given span,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.790
how do we minimize the weight of
the beam for a given stiffness?

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.590
And then we're going to look
at the stresses in the sandwich

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.090
beams.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.160
So there's going to be one
set of stresses in the faces,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.493
and a different kind of stress
distribution in the core.

00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:12.530
So we'll look at the
stress distribution.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.420
And then we'll talk
about failure modes,

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.510
how these things
can fail, and then

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.990
how to figure out which
failure mode is dominant, which

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.770
one occurs at the lowest load.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.680
And then we'll look at
optimizing the design,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.626
minimizing the design for a
certain strength and stiffness.

00:06:26.626 --> 00:06:29.000
So we're not going to get all
that way through everything

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.320
today, but we'll kind
of make a start on that.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.820
OK.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.950
So let me start.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.860
So the idea here is we have two
stiff, strong skins, or faces,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.576
separated by a lightweight core.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.080
And the idea is that by
separating the faces,

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.770
you increase the
moment of inertia

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.153
with little increase in weight.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.224
So these are particularly good
if you want to resist bending,

00:07:40.224 --> 00:07:41.640
or if you want to
resist buckling.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.806
Because both of those involve
the moment of inertia.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.004
And they work like an I-beam.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.100
So the faces of the sandwich are
like the flanges of the I-beam,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.480
and the core is like the web.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:36.059
And the faces are typically
made of either fiber reinforced

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.511
composites or metals.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.809
So typically, something
like aluminum,

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.220
usually you're trying
to reduce the weight

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.000
if you use these things, so a
lightweight metal like aluminum

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.640
is sometimes used.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:09:03.570
And the cores are usually
honeycombs, or foams, or balsa.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.045
And when they use balsa
wood, what they do

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.170
is-- I brought a piece of
balsa here-- what they do

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.670
is they would take
a block like this

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.470
and chop it into
pieces around here.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.410
And then they would lay
those pieces on a cloth mat.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.870
So typically the pieces are
maybe two inches by two inches.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.060
They lay them on a cloth
mat, and because they're not

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.380
one monolithic piece, they
can then shape that mat

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.580
to curved shapes.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.650
So it doesn't have to
be just a flat panel.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.510
They can curve it around a
curved surface if they want.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.990
So we'll say the
honeycombs are lighter

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.065
than the foams for a given
stiffness or strength.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.840
But the foams provide
thermal insulation as well as

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.450
a mechanical support.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.260
And the overall mechanical
properties of the honeycomb

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.300
depend on the properties
of each of the two parts,

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.126
of the faces and
the core, and also

00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:44.500
the geometry of
the whole thing--

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.700
how thick's the core, how
thick's the face, how dense is

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.270
the core?

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.440
That kind of thing.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.840
And typically, the panel has
to have some required stiffness

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.960
or strength.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.820
And often what you
want to do is minimize

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.170
the weight for that required
stiffness or strength.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.650
So often these panels are
used in some sort of vehicle,

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.300
like we talked about the
sailboat, or like a helicopter,

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.950
or like an airplane.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.080
They're also used in like
refrigerated trucks--

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.829
they would have a foam
core because they'd

00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:34.560
want the thermal insulation.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.330
So if you were going to use
it in some sort of a vehicle,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.079
you want to reduce the
mass of the vehicle

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:40.905
and you want to have the
lightest panel that you can.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:45.570
Yup?

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.740
AUDIENCE: So if you
saw the base material

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.410
and you'd have the
[INAUDIBLE] sandwich

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.100
panel, that piece [INAUDIBLE]
the sandwich panel

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.317
with something
[? solid ?] in the middle?

00:13:00.317 --> 00:13:01.150
LORNA GIBSON: Well--

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.110
AUDIENCE: So, as we're getting
[INAUDIBLE] aluminum piece

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.273
that's was as thick
as a sandwich panel.

00:13:06.273 --> 00:13:07.064
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah.

00:13:07.064 --> 00:13:08.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.990
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, well, if
you have the solid aluminum

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.540
piece that was as
thick as the sandwich,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.956
it's going to be
stiffer, but it's

00:13:13.956 --> 00:13:15.440
going to be a lot, lot heavier.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.850
So the stiffness per unit
weight would not be as good.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:20.490
OK?

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.460
So we're going to calculate the
stiffness in just one minute.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.620
And then we're going to look at
how we minimize the weight, OK?

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.120
OK.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.026
So what I'm going
to do is set this up

00:13:49.026 --> 00:13:50.150
as kind of a general thing.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.110
We're just going to look at
sandwich beams rather than

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.620
plates, just because
it's simpler.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.737
But the plates, everything
we say for the beams

00:13:55.737 --> 00:13:57.070
basically applies to the plates.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.952
The equation's just a
little bit more complicated.

00:13:59.952 --> 00:14:01.827
So we're going to start
with analyzing beams.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.386
And I'm just going
to start with a beam,

00:14:28.386 --> 00:14:31.210
say, in three-point bending.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.063
So there's my faces there.

00:14:35.063 --> 00:14:35.562
Boop.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.117
And I've made it
kind of more stumpy

00:14:43.117 --> 00:14:45.700
than it would be in real life,
just because it makes it easier

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.500
to draw it.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.130
And then if I look at
it the other way on,

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.740
it would look
something like that.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.040
So say there's some load P here.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.880
Say the span of the beam is l.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.810
Say the load's in the middle,
so each of the supports just

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.240
sees a load of P/2.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.780
And then let me just define some
geometrical parameters here.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.190
I'm going to say the
width of the beam is b.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.650
And I'm going to say the
face thicknesses are each t.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.490
So the thickness
of each face is t.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:25.200
And the thickness of
the core is c, OK?

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.020
So that's just sort
of definitions.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.480
And I'm going to say the
face has a set of properties,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.234
the core has a
set of properties,

00:15:33.234 --> 00:15:35.150
and then the solid from
which the core is made

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.550
has another set of properties.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.480
So the face properties
that we're going to use

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.110
are a density of the face.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.840
We'll call that row f.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.760
The modulus of the face, Ef,
and some sort of strength

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.640
of the face, let's imagine
it's aluminum and it yields,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.060
that would be sigma
y of the face.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.080
And then the core
similarly is going

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.180
to have a density, rho star c.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.639
It's going to have
a modulus, E star c.

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:03.180
And it's going to
have some strength,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.180
I'm going to call sigma star c.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.850
And then the solid
from which the core

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.540
is made is going to
have a density row

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:17.580
s, a modulus Es, and some
strength, sigma ys, OK?

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.700
So the core is going
to be some kind

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.090
of cellular material, a
honeycomb, or a foam, or balsa.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.190
And typically, the
modulus of the core

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.595
is going to be a lot less
than the modulus of the face.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.820
So I'm just going to say here
that the E star c is typically

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.720
much greater than Ef.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.437
And we're going to
use that later on.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.700
So we're going to derive
some equations, for example,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.040
for an equivalent flexural
rigidity for the section, an Ei

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.280
equivalent.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.180
And that has several terms.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.379
But if we can say
the core stiffness

00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:00.920
is much less than
the face thickness,

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.653
and also if we can say the
core-- the stiffness is less

00:17:04.653 --> 00:17:06.069
and also the
thickness of the core

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.089
is much greater than the
thickness of the face,

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.550
a lot of the expressions
we're going to use simplify.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.540
So we're going to make
those assumptions.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.480
So let me just draw
the shear diagram here.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.120
So V is shear, so that's
the shear diagram.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.880
We have some load
P/2 at the support.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.660
There's no other load
applied until we get to here.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.510
Than the shear diagram goes down
by P, so we're at minus P/2.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.380
Then there's no load here,
so this just stays constant,

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.590
and then we go back up to 0.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.670
And then let me just draw
bending moment diagram.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.550
The bending moment
diagram for this

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.637
is just going to
look like a triangle.

00:18:02.637 --> 00:18:04.470
Remember, if we integrate
the shear diagram,

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.960
we get the bending
moment diagram.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.730
And that maximum moment
there is going to Pl over 4.

00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:17.420
OK.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.980
So initially, I'm going to
calculate the deflections.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.980
And I don't really need
those diagrams for that,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.450
but then I'm going to
calculate the stresses,

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.700
and I'm going to need those
diagrams for the stresses.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.150
So just kind of keep
those in mind for now.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:38.200
So to calculate the
deflections, sandwich panels

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.360
are a little bit different
from homogeneous beams.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.750
In a sandwich panel,
the core is not

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.090
very stiff compared
to the faces.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.930
And we've got some shear
stresses acting on the thing.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.820
And the shear stresses are
largely carried by the core.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.880
So the core is actually
going to shear,

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.350
and there's going to be
a significant deflection

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.210
of the core and shear as
well as the overall bending

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.020
of the whole panel.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.396
So you have to count for that.

00:19:05.396 --> 00:19:08.020
So we're going to have a bending
term and a shear term-- that's

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.850
what those two terms are there.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:20.171
So we're going to say there's a
bending deflection and a shear

00:19:20.171 --> 00:19:20.670
deflection.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.890
And that shearing
deflection arises

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:38.470
from the core being sheared and
the fact that the core, say,

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.750
Young's modulus or
also the shear modulus,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.920
is quite a bit less
than the face modulus.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.420
So if you think of the core
as being much more compliant

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.000
than the face, then
the core is going

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.564
to have some deflection
from that shear stress.

00:19:53.564 --> 00:19:55.480
OK, so we're going to
start out with this term

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.650
here, the bending term.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:04.550
And if I just had a homogeneous
beam in three-point bending,

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.270
the central
deflections-- so these

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.890
are all the central deflections
I'm calculating here-- with Pl

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:14.200
cubed over it turns out to be
48 is the number, and divided

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.580
by EI.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.580
And because we don't have
a homogeneous beam here,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.362
I'm going to call
that equivalent EI.

00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:23.070
And to make it a little
bit more general,

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.440
instead of putting
48, that number,

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.760
I'm just going to
put a constant B1.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.350
And that B1 constant
is just going

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.670
to depend on the
loading geometry.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.080
So any time I have a
concentrated load on a beam,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.290
the deflection's always
Pl cubed over EI,

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.830
and then the sum number in the
denominator and that number

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.610
just depends on the
loading configuration.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.510
So for three-point
bending, it's 48.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.795
For the flexion of a
cantilever, B1 would be 3.

00:20:49.795 --> 00:20:51.170
So think of that
as just a number

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.710
that you can work out for
the particular loading

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.250
configuration.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:00.702
So here we'll say B1 is
just a constant that depends

00:21:00.702 --> 00:21:01.910
on the loading configuration.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:21.715
And I'll say, for example, for
three-point bending, B1 is 48.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.580
For a cantilever end
deflection, then B1 would be 3.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.665
So it's just a number.

00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.290
So the next thing we
have to figure out

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.753
is what's the EI equivalent.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.825
So if this was just
a homogeneous beam,

00:21:46.825 --> 00:21:50.280
and it was rectangular, E
would just be E of the material

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.720
and I would be the width
B times the height H

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.239
cubed divided by 12.

00:21:57.239 --> 00:21:59.030
So here we don't quite
have that because we

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.740
have two different materials.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.210
So here we have to use something
called the parallel axis

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.430
theorem, which I'm hoping
you may have seen somewhere

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.100
in calculus, maybe?

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.520
But, yeah, somebody
is nodding yes.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.400
OK, so what we do,
what we want to do

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.130
is get the equivalent EI--
I'm going to put it back up,

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.660
don't panic-- of this
thing here, right?

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.380
So I want-- this is
the neutral axis here,

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.930
and I want the EI about
that neutral axis there.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.190
So, OK, you happy?

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.530
There.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.610
OK, so I've got a
term for the core.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.660
OK, the core, that is the
middle of the core, right?

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:46.360
So for the core, it's just
going to be E of the core times

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.660
bc cubed over 12.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.360
Remember, for a rectangular
section, it's bh cubed over 12

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.490
is the moment of inertia.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.290
And here our height for
the core is just c, OK?

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:02.130
And then if I took
the moment of inertia

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:06.660
for, say, one face about
its own centroidal axis,

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:13.130
I would get E of the face
now times bt cubed over 12.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.000
So that's taking the
moment of inertia

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.460
of one face about the
middle of the face.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.040
And I have two of those, right?

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.110
Because I have two faces.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.810
And the parallel axis
theorem tells you

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.750
what the moment of inertia is
going to be if you move it,

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:34.330
not to the-- you don't use
the centroid of the area,

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.760
but you use some
other parallel axis.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.230
And what that tells you
to do is take the area

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:46.050
that you're interested in--
so the area of the face is bt,

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.410
and you multiply by the square
of the distance between the two

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.746
axes that you're interested in.

00:23:52.746 --> 00:23:53.245
Oop, yeah.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.088
Let me change my
little brackets.

00:23:59.088 --> 00:23:59.587
Boop.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.436
So, oop-a-doop-a-doop.

00:24:05.436 --> 00:24:07.935
Maybe I'll stick this, make a
little sketch over here again.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:18.250
OK, all right.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.480
So this term here,
Ef bt cubed over 12,

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.750
that would be the moment of
inertia of this piece here,

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.500
about the axis that goes through
the middle of that, right?

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.485
Its own centroidal axis.

00:24:32.485 --> 00:24:34.110
But what I want to
do is I want to know

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.400
what the moment of inertia of
this piece is about this axis

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:37.900
here.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.660
This is the neutral axis.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.675
So let's call this
the centroidal axis.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.720
And the parallel
axis theorem tells me

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.600
what I do is I take the
area of this little thing

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.290
here, so that's the
b times t, and I

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.290
multiply by the square of the
distance between those two

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.650
axes.

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.870
So the distance between those
axes is just c plus t over 2,

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:05.930
and I square it.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:07.790
And then I multiply
that whole thing by 2

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.620
because I've got two faces.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.417
Are we good?

00:25:11.417 --> 00:25:12.371
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:12.371 --> 00:25:12.848
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah?

00:25:12.848 --> 00:25:15.056
AUDIENCE: The center
[INAUDIBLE] and the [INAUDIBLE],

00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:17.394
are those Ed's or Ef's?

00:25:17.394 --> 00:25:19.810
LORNA GIBSON: These are Ef's
because this is the face now,

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.610
right?

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.510
So this term here
is for the core.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:29.380
So here the core is E star c.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.090
And these two Ef's are
for the face up there, OK?

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.644
Because you have to
account for the modulus

00:25:36.644 --> 00:25:38.560
of the material of the
bit that you're getting

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.250
the moment of inertia for.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.287
Are we good?

00:25:43.287 --> 00:25:43.786
OK.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.020
So now I'm just
going to simplify

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.220
these guys a little bit.

00:26:09.645 --> 00:26:11.900
Doodle-doodle-doodle-do-doot.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.320
OK?

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.010
So I've just
multiplied the twos,

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.890
and maybe I'll just write down
here this is the parallel axis

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:20.389
theorem.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:32.900
Doot-doot-doot.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.852
Yes, sorry?

00:26:33.852 --> 00:26:36.212
AUDIENCE: So for the term
that comes from the parallel

00:26:36.212 --> 00:26:39.516
axis theorem, why do we
only consider Ef and not

00:26:39.516 --> 00:26:41.054
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:41.054 --> 00:26:42.470
LORNA GIBSON:
Because I'm taking--

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.581
what I'm looking at-- so the
very first term, this guy,

00:26:45.581 --> 00:26:46.080
here--

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.246
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:47.246 --> 00:26:49.380
LORNA GIBSON: Accounts
for this, right?

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.506
And these two terms both
account for the face.

00:26:53.506 --> 00:26:57.100
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK,
so the face acting--

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.840
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah,
about this axis.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.290
So the parallel
axis theorem says

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.970
you take the moment of
inertia of your area

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.000
about its own centroidal
axis, and then you

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.110
add this term here.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:13.910
But it's really referring
to that face, OK?

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:18.330
Let me scoot that down
and then scoot over here.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:53.860
And this is where we get to
say the modulus of the face

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.910
is much greater than
the modulus of the core.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.730
And also, typically
c, the core thickness,

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.770
is much greater than
t, the face thickness.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.290
So if that's true,
then it turns out

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.710
this term is small
compared to that one.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.440
And also this term is
small compared to this one.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.060
And also this term,
instead of having

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.010
c plus t squared, if c
is big compared to t,

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.200
then I can just call
it c squared, OK?

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.480
So you can see here,
if Ec is small,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.540
then this is going to be
small compared to these.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.360
If t is small, then this
guy is going to be small.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.240
So even though it
looks ugly, many times

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.401
we can make this
simpler approximation.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.880
OK, so we can just
approximate it

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.255
as Ef times btc squared over 2.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.760
So then this bending term
here, we've got everything

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.482
we need now to get
that bit there.

00:29:05.482 --> 00:29:07.898
So the next bit we want to get
is the shearing deflection.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.940
So what's the shearing
deflection equal to?

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.370
So say we just thought
about the core,

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.860
and all we're
interested in here is

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.290
what's the deflection
of the core and shear?

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:30.725
And so say that's P/2,
that's P/2, that's l/2.

00:29:30.725 --> 00:29:34.740
We'll say that's-- oops.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.990
That's our shearing
deflection there.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.100
We can say the shear
stress in the core

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:46.200
is going to equal the shear
modulus times the shear strain,

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.610
so we can say P over
the area of the core

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:54.610
is going to be proportional
to the Young's modulus times

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.350
delta s over l.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:00.186
And let's not worry about
the constant just yet.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.775
So delta s is going to be
proportional to-- well, let

00:30:06.775 --> 00:30:08.900
me [? make it ?]
proportional at this point.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:17.010
Delta s is going to equal Pl
divided by some other constant

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.440
that I'm going to
call B2, and divided

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.120
by the shear
modulus of the core,

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.810
and essentially the
area of the core.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.560
And here B2 is another constant.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.460
So again, B2 just depends on
the loading configuration.

00:31:00.414 --> 00:31:02.580
Yeah, this is a little bit
of an approximation here,

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.670
but I'm just going
to leave it at that.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.870
OK, so then we have
these two terms

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:12.867
and we just add them up
to get the final thing.

00:31:12.867 --> 00:31:13.700
Start another board.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:37.980
OK.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.160
So that would give us an
equation for the deflection.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.580
And one thing to note here
is that this shear modulus

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.784
of the core, if
the core is a foam,

00:31:54.784 --> 00:31:56.200
then we have an
equation for that.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.870
We also could use an
equation if it's a honeycomb.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.260
But I'm just going to
write for foam cores.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:04.760
Whoops.

00:32:20.635 --> 00:32:26.654
This is for-- that will be
for open-cell foam cores.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:36.830
Oops, don't want to--
and get rid of that.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.690
We won't update
just now, thank you.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.720
OK, so the next thing
I want to think about

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.640
is how we would minimize the
weight for a given stiffness.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.290
So say if we're
given a stiffness,

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.460
we're given P over delta, so
I could take out the two P's

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.090
here.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.260
If I divide it through
by P, delta over P

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.210
would be the compliance, P over
delta would be the stiffness.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.570
So imagine that you're given
the face and core materials,

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.320
and you're told how
long the span has to be,

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.600
you're told how wide
the beam is going to be,

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.350
and you're told the
loading configuration.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.179
So you know if it's three-point
bending, or four-point bending,

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.409
or a cantilever--
whatever it is.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.199
And you might be asked to find
the core thickness, the face

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:16.460
thickness, and the core density
that would minimize the weight.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.719
So I have a little
schematic here.

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:20.719
I don't know if you're
going be able to read it.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.385
So I'm going to walk
through it and then

00:34:22.385 --> 00:34:25.610
I'll write things on the board.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.080
Whoops, hit the wrong button.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:36.517
OK, so we start with the
weight equation here.

00:34:36.517 --> 00:34:38.350
The weight's obviously
the sum of the weight

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:41.590
of the faces, the weight of the
core, so those two terms there.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.469
So I'll write that
down in a minute.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.469
And then we have the
stiffness constraint here.

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:48.150
So this equation here
is just this equation

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.270
that I have down here
on the board, OK?

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:54.780
Then what you do is you solve
that stiffness constraint

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.020
for the density of the core.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.800
So this equation
here just solves--

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.870
we're solving this equation
here in terms of the density,

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.980
and we get the density by
substituting in this equation

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.390
here for the shear
modulus of the core.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.360
So you substitute that there.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.890
It's kind of a messy
thing, but you solve

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.660
that in terms of the density.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.360
Then you put that
version of the density

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.719
here in terms of this
weight equation up here.

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:22.010
So then you've eliminated
the density out of the weight

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.930
equation, now you've
just got it in terms

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.680
of the other variables.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.930
And then you take the partial
derivative of the weight

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.346
with respect to
the core thickness

00:35:29.346 --> 00:35:32.650
c, set that equal to 0, and
you take the partial derivative

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.110
of the weight with respect
to the face thickness, t,

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.830
and you set that equal to 0.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.264
And that then gives you two
equations and two unknowns.

00:35:39.264 --> 00:35:41.430
You've got the core thickness
and the face thickness

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.370
are the two unknowns.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.744
And you've got
the two equations,

00:35:43.744 --> 00:35:44.875
so then you solve those.

00:35:44.875 --> 00:35:47.000
So the value you get for
the core thickness is then

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.240
the optimum, so it's going to be
some function of the stiffness,

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.770
the material
properties you started

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.630
with in the beam geometry.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.380
And similarly, you get some
equation for the optimum face

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.410
thickness, t.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.440
And again, it's a
function of the stiffness

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.960
and the material properties
in the beam geometry.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.230
Then you take those two
values for c and t, those two

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:09.010
optimum values, and plug it
back into this equation here,

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.190
and get the optimum value
of the core density.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.040
And so what you end
up are three equations

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.840
for the optimal values of
the core thickness, the face

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.090
thickness, and the
core density in terms

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:22.050
of the required stiffness, the
material properties, and then

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.430
the loading geometry.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.330
So I'm going to write down
some more notes, because I'll

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.650
put this on the Stellar site.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.754
But it's hard to read just here.

00:36:30.754 --> 00:36:33.420
So let me write it down and I'll
also write out the equations so

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.020
that you have the
equations for calculating

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.200
those optimum values.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.664
So before I do that, though,
one of the interesting things

00:36:40.664 --> 00:36:42.580
though is if you figure
out the optimal values

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.996
of the core thickness
and the face

00:36:43.996 --> 00:36:47.290
thickness and the core density,
and you substitute it back

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.222
into the weight,
and you calculate

00:36:49.222 --> 00:36:51.430
this is the weight of the
face relative to the weight

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.730
of the core, no matter
what the geometry is,

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:56.500
and what the loading
configuration is,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.270
the weight of the face
is always a quarter

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:59.640
of the weight of the core.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.485
So the ratio of
how much material

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:03.440
is in the core and
the face is constant,

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.830
regardless of the core-- of
the loading configuration.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.580
And this is the
bending deflection

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.980
relative to the
total deflection.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.160
It's always 1/3.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.660
And the shearing
deflection relative

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.040
to the total deflection
is always 2/3.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.980
So regardless of how
you set things up,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.150
the ratio of what
weight the face

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:27.500
is relative to the core and the
amount of shearing and bending

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.650
deflections is always a
constant at the optimum.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:36.715
OK, so let's say we're given
the face and the core materials.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.390
So that means we're given
their material property, too.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:53.900
And say we're given the
beam length and width

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.375
and the loading configuration.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:07.490
So that means we're given
those constants, B1 and B2.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.260
If I told you it was
three-point bending,

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.020
you would know
what B1 and B2 are.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:22.570
So then what you need to do
is find the core thickness, c,

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:36.270
the face thickness, t, and
the core density, rho c,

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:39.732
to minimize the
weight of the beam.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.195
So there's two faces, so
the weight of the face

00:38:49.195 --> 00:38:51.900
is 2 rho f g times btl.

00:38:55.141 --> 00:39:01.442
And then the weight of the
core is rho c g times bcl.

00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:06.730
So I'm going to
write down the steps

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.313
and then I'll write
down the solution.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.230
So you solve.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.470
So you put this equation for
the shear modulus of the core

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.320
into here, and
then you rearrange

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.750
this equation in terms of
the density of the core here.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.150
So you have an equation for
the core density in terms

00:39:48.150 --> 00:40:02.080
of that stiffness, and then you
solve the partial derivatives

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.070
of the weight
equation with respect

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.615
to the core thickness, c,
and put that equal to 0.

00:40:10.415 --> 00:40:13.420
And then the partial
of dw [? over ?] dt

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.670
and set that to 0.

00:40:26.247 --> 00:40:27.830
And if you do that,
you can then solve

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.550
for the optimal values of the
face and core thicknesses.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.050
Yes?

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.894
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
for weight, what is g?

00:40:33.894 --> 00:40:34.810
LORNA GIBSON: Gravity.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:35.362
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:35.362 --> 00:40:37.695
LORNA GIBSON: Just density
is mass, mass times gravity--

00:40:37.695 --> 00:40:38.170
weight.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:38.878
That's all it is.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.200
And then you've got a
version of this that's

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.100
in terms of the core density.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.030
You can substitute those
values of the optimum face

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:24.980
and core thicknesses
into that equation

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.505
and get the optimum
core density.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:38.016
And then in the final equations,
you get, when you do all that,

00:41:38.016 --> 00:41:39.890
and I'm going to make
them all dimensionless,

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.910
so this is the core
thickness normalized

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:49.265
by the span of the beam is
equal to this thing, here.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.770
So you can see each of
these parameters here,

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:17.950
the design parameters that we're
calculating the optimum of.

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:21.400
I've grouped the constants
B1 and B2 together

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.120
that describe the
loading configuration

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.490
so you'd be given those.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:26.710
C2 is this constant--
oop, which I just

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:31.070
rubbed off-- that relates the
shear modulus of the foam core.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.290
So you'd be given that.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.970
These are the material
properties of the-- you

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.054
know, say, it's a
polyurethane foam core,

00:45:37.054 --> 00:45:38.970
this would be the density
of the polyurethane.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.428
Say it's aluminum
faces, that would

00:45:40.428 --> 00:45:41.770
be the density of the aluminum.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:42.728
so you'd be given that.

00:45:42.728 --> 00:45:47.820
You'd be given the
stiffnesses of the two

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:51.850
materials, the solid from which
the core is made and the face

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:52.610
material.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.020
And then this is the stiffness
here that you're given,

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.489
just divided by the width of
the beam, B. So the stiffness,

00:45:57.489 --> 00:46:00.030
you'd be given the width B. So
you're given all those things,

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:04.910
then you could calculate what
that optimum design would be.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:08.490
So the next slide here just
shows some experiments.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.300
And these were
done on sandwiches

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:14.250
with aluminum faces and a
rigid polyurethane foam core.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.000
And here we knew
what the relationship

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.150
was for the shear modulus.

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:18.800
We measured that.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.170
And what we did here was
we designed the beams

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:24.010
to all have the same
stiffness, and they all

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:27.130
had the same span in
the width, B, then we

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:29.702
kept one parameter
at the optimum value

00:46:29.702 --> 00:46:30.910
and we varied the other ones.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.770
So here, on this beam,
this set of beams here,

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:35.720
the density was at the optimum.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.190
And we varied the
core thickness,

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.890
and we varied the
face thickness,

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:43.560
and the solid line was our model
or our sort of optimization.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.925
And the little X's
were the experiments.

00:46:45.925 --> 00:46:48.144
So you can see there's
pretty good agreement there.

00:46:48.144 --> 00:46:50.310
Then the second set here,
we kept the face thickness

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.560
at the optimum value and we
varied the core thickness,

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.860
we varied the core density.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:59.600
So the same thing, the solid
line is the sort of theory

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.440
and the X's are the experiments.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.840
And here we had the core
thickness of the optimum value,

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.460
and we varied the face
thickness and the core density.

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:11.370
So you can kind of see
how you can see this here.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.960
And over here, just
because I forgot to say it,

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.860
this is the stiffness per
unit weight, over here, OK?

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.280
So these are the optimum
designs here, all right?

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.940
So there was pretty
good agreement

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:29.095
between these calculations and
what we measured on some beams.

00:47:29.095 --> 00:47:30.470
Do I need to write
anything down?

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:31.980
Do you think you've got that?

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:32.160
Yeah?

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.535
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
ask, for the optimum design

00:47:34.535 --> 00:47:36.470
column that you have
there, do those numbers

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:38.480
like fall out of these
equations if you do the math?

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.646
LORNA GIBSON: They do, yeah.

00:47:39.646 --> 00:47:41.860
I mean, it's-- yeah, exactly.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:45.600
So if you remember the
equation we had for the weight,

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:53.443
so the weight is equal to 2
rho f gbtl plus the density

00:47:53.443 --> 00:48:00.662
of the core, bcl, so if you plug
these things into there, then--

00:48:00.662 --> 00:48:03.120
so this is the way to the face,
that's the way to the core,

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.280
then it drops out
to be a quarter.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.280
So it's kind of magical.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.490
I mean, you have this big,
long, complicated gory thing,

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:10.031
and then, poof,
everything disappears

00:48:10.031 --> 00:48:12.220
except a factor of 1/4.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.660
And the same for the
bending deflection.

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.290
So we had those
two terms, so there

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:17.960
was the bending and the shear.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.380
If you just calculate
each of those terms

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.020
and take the ratio
of 1 over the total,

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.230
or the one over the
other, everything

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:26.359
drops out except that number.

00:48:26.359 --> 00:48:28.400
So that's why I pointed
it out, because it seemed

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.316
kind of amazing that
everything would drop out

00:48:30.316 --> 00:48:32.190
except for that one thing.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.300
OK, so then the next
thing-- so that's

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.510
the stiffness in
optimizing the stiffness.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.101
Are we happy-ish?

00:48:38.101 --> 00:48:38.600
Yeah?

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.440
OK.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.574
So the next thing--
oh, well, let's see.

00:48:42.574 --> 00:48:43.990
I don't think I
need to write any.

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.906
I think if you have that
graph, I don't really

00:48:45.906 --> 00:48:47.690
need to write much down.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:50.860
So the next thing then is the
strength of the sandwich beams.

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.280
So let me get rid of that.

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:23.600
You guys OK?

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.490
Yeah?

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:25.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.776
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, but you're
shaking your head like this

00:49:27.776 --> 00:49:29.230
is very, very helpful for me.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:30.466
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:30.466 --> 00:49:32.076
LORNA GIBSON: Oh OK, that's OK.

00:49:32.076 --> 00:49:33.532
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:33.532 --> 00:49:35.240
LORNA GIBSON: That's
OK, you can do that.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:35.781
I don't mind.

00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:38.830
But as long as you don't
have questions for me.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.540
OK, and so the
first step in trying

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.041
to figure out
about this strength

00:49:42.041 --> 00:49:44.165
is we need to figure out
the stresses in the beams.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.680
So we need to find out
about the stresses.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.950
And we're going to
have normal stresses

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.257
and we're going to
have shear stresses.

00:50:03.257 --> 00:50:05.090
So I'm going to do the
normal stresses first

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:07.012
and then we'll do
the shear stresses.

00:50:07.012 --> 00:50:08.470
So you do this in
a way that's just

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:10.303
analogous to how you
figure out the stresses

00:50:10.303 --> 00:50:12.260
in a homogeneous beam.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.900
So we'll say the stresses
in the face-- normally it

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.144
would be My over
I. M is the moment,

00:50:17.144 --> 00:50:18.810
y is the distance
from the neutral axis,

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:20.680
I is the moment of inertia.

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:24.610
So this time, instead of
having a moment of inertia,

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.810
we have this equivalent
moment of inertia.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:32.740
And we multiply
by E of the face.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.575
So you can think of this as
being the strain essentially.

00:50:35.575 --> 00:50:37.950
And then you multiply by E of
the face to get the stress.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:48.880
The maximum distance from the
neutral axis, we can call c/2.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.340
So that's y.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:57.840
Then EI equivalent we had
Ef btc squared over 2.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.100
And then I have a
term of Ef here.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.050
c squared.

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:08.730
So one of the c's goes,
the 2's go, the Ef's go.

00:51:11.745 --> 00:51:15.610
Then you just get that the
normal stress in the face

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.660
is the moment at
that section divided

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.970
by the width, b, the
face thickness, t,

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:21.454
the core thickness, c.

00:51:24.814 --> 00:51:26.530
And I can do the
same kind of thing

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:31.200
for the stress in
the core, except now

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.190
I multiply by the core modulus.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:55.760
So if I go through the
same kind of thing,

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.180
it's the same factor
of M over btc,

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:04.350
but now I multiply times E
of core over E of the face.

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:07.740
And since E of the core is a
lot smaller than E of the face,

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:09.890
typically these normal
stresses in the core

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:12.619
are much smaller than the
normal stresses in the face.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:37.935
So the faces carry almost
all of the normal stresses.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.380
And if you look at an I-beam,
the flanges of the I-beam

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.090
carry almost the
normal stresses.

00:52:57.881 --> 00:52:59.380
So I want to do one
more thing here.

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:02.740
I want to relate the moment
to some concentrated load.

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:16.930
So let's say we have a beam
with a concentrated load, P.

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:20.795
So for example, something
in three-point bending,

00:53:20.795 --> 00:53:22.920
typically we're interested
in the maximum stresses,

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.790
so we want the maximum moment.

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:30.230
So M max is going to be P
times l over some number.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:33.697
And this B3 is another constant
that depends on the loading

00:53:33.697 --> 00:53:34.280
configuration.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.000
So if it was three-point
bending, B3 would be 4.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.030
If it was a cantilever,
B3 would be 1.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.630
So if I put those
things together,

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:22.310
the normal stress in the
face is Pl B3 divided by btc.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.004
OK, so that's the
normal stresses.

00:54:39.004 --> 00:54:40.920
And then the next thing
is the shear stresses,

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.169
and the shear stresses are
going to be carried largely

00:54:43.169 --> 00:54:44.020
by the core.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.150
And if you do all the
exact calculations,

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:48.570
they vary parabolically
through the core.

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.550
But if we make those
same approximations

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:52.690
that the face is stiff
compared to the core,

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:54.812
and that the face is thin
compared to the core,

00:54:54.812 --> 00:54:56.520
then you can say that
the shear stress is

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.920
just constant through the core.

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:12.682
So we'll say the shear
stresses vary parabolically

00:55:12.682 --> 00:55:13.390
through the core.

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:27.820
But if the face is much
stiffer than the core

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.960
and the core is much
thicker than the face,

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.390
then you can say that the
shear stress in the core

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:39.130
is just equal to the sheer force
over the area of the core, bc.

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:42.595
So here, V is the shear
force of the cross-section

00:55:42.595 --> 00:55:43.470
you're interested in.

00:55:48.695 --> 00:55:53.235
And bc is just the
area of the core.

00:55:53.235 --> 00:55:56.270
And we could say the
maximum shear force is just

00:55:56.270 --> 00:56:01.180
going to be V over--
actually, let's make it

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:06.210
P, P over yet another constant.

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.209
And B4 also depends on
the loading configuration.

00:56:20.136 --> 00:56:21.510
So if I was giving
you a problem,

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:24.695
I would give you all these B1,
B2, B3, B4's and everything.

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:39.210
So the maximum shear
stress in the core

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:42.890
is in just the applied
load, P, divided by this B4

00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:44.615
and divided by the
area of the core.

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:28.650
OK, so this next figure
up here just shows

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:29.840
those stress distributions.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.652
So here's a piece of
the cross-section here.

00:57:33.652 --> 00:57:35.860
So there's the face thickness
and the core thickness.

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:39.080
You can think of that as a piece
along the length, if you want.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.950
This is the normal stress
distribution, here.

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:44.110
So this is all
really from saying

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:46.127
plane sections remain plane.

00:57:46.127 --> 00:57:48.460
These are the stresses, the
normal stresses in the core.

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:50.040
And you can see
they're a lot smaller

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.640
in this schematic than
the ones in the face.

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:58.070
And then this is the
parabolic stress in the core.

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:02.160
And similarly, there'd be a
different parabola in the face.

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.890
And these are the
approximations.

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:05.500
Typically these
approximations are

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.430
made so the normal
stress in the face

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:08.930
is just taken as a constant.

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:12.630
The normal stress in the
core is often neglected.

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:15.900
And here the shear stress in the
core is just a constant here.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.150
So the two things you
need to worry about

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:20.260
are the normal
stress for the face

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:23.630
and the shear
stress for the core.

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:24.750
Are we good?

00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:25.400
We're good?

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.600
Yeah, good-ish.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.430
OK, so if we want to talk
about the strength of the beam,

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:33.690
we now have to talk about
different failure modes.

00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:35.950
And the next slide just
shows some schematics

00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:37.340
of the failure modes.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.420
So there's different
ways the beam can fail.

00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.920
Say it's in three-point
bending just

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.730
for the sake of convenience.

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:45.980
One way it can fail is,
say it had aluminum faces.

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.800
This face here
would be in tension,

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.202
and the face could just yield.

00:58:49.202 --> 00:58:51.160
So you could just get
yielding of the aluminum.

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.360
That would be one way.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.860
It could be a
composite face and you

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.550
could have some sort of
composite failure mode.

00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:59.586
You can get more complicated
failure modes for composites,

00:58:59.586 --> 00:59:01.460
but there could be some
sort of failure mode.

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:04.160
This face up here
is in compression,

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.234
and if you compress
that face, you

00:59:07.234 --> 00:59:08.900
can get something
called face wrinkling.

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.710
You get sort of a
local buckling mode.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.900
So imagine you have the face,
that you're pressing on it,

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.730
but the core is kind of acting
like an elastic foundation

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:17.880
underneath it.

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.060
And you can get this
kind of local buckling,

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.240
and that's called wrinkling.

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.080
That's another mode of failure.

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.100
You can also get the
core failing in shear.

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:30.310
So here's these two little
cracks, denoting shear failure

00:59:30.310 --> 00:59:31.720
in the core.

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.750
And there's a couple of
other modes you can get,

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:36.350
but we're going to not pay
much attention to those.

00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:39.590
The whole thing can delaminate,
and, as you might guess,

00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:42.640
if the whole thing delaminates,
you're in deep doo-doo.

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.670
Because, remember when I
passed those samples around,

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:48.400
how flexible the face
was by itself and how

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.970
flexible the core is by itself.

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:51.512
If the whole thing
delaminates, you

00:59:51.512 --> 00:59:53.636
lose that whole sandwich
effect and the whole thing

00:59:53.636 --> 00:59:55.170
kind of falls apart.

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:57.030
We're going to assume
we have a perfect bond

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.870
and that we don't have
to worry about that.

00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:00.710
The other sort of
failure mode you can get

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:02.380
is called indentation.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.260
So imagine that you
apply this load here

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.120
over a very small area.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.580
The load can just
transfer straight

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.246
through the face and
just kind of indent

01:00:09.246 --> 01:00:10.362
the core underneath it.

01:00:10.362 --> 01:00:12.070
We're going to assume
that you distribute

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:14.570
this load over a big
enough area here,

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:15.989
that you don't indent the core.

01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:18.280
So we're going to worry about
these three failure modes

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.180
here-- the face yielding,
the face wrinkling,

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.270
and the core failing
and shear, OK?

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:26.258
So let me just write that down.

01:01:17.654 --> 01:01:25.460
And then you also can have
debonding or delamination,

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.375
and we're going to
assume perfect bond.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.335
And then you can
have indentation,

01:01:38.335 --> 01:01:39.960
and we're going to
assume the loads are

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.168
applied over a large enough
area that you don't get--

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.170
So you can have different
modes of failure,

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:28.420
and the question becomes which
mode is going to be dominant?

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.240
So whichever one occurs
at the lowest load

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.948
is going to be the
dominant failure mode.

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:35.510
So you'd like to know what
that lowest failure mode is.

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:40.630
So we want to write equations
for each of these failure modes

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:43.423
and then figure out
which one occurs first.

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:52.350
So we'll look at the
face yielding here.

01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:54.740
And face yielding is
going to occur just

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.322
when the normal
stress in the face

01:02:56.322 --> 01:02:58.030
is equal to the yield
stress of the face.

01:02:58.030 --> 01:02:59.805
So this is fairly
straightforward.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:12.840
So this was our equation
for the stress in the face.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.000
And when that's equal to
the face yield strength,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.070
then you'll get failure.

01:03:25.544 --> 01:03:31.680
And the face wrinkling occurs
when the normal compressive

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.890
stress in the face equals
a local buckling stress.

01:03:57.071 --> 01:03:58.820
And people have worked
that out by looking

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:02.100
at what's called buckling
on an elastic foundation.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.300
So the core acts
as elastic support.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.829
You can think that
as the face is

01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:07.495
trying to buckle into
the core, the core

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:09.500
is pushing back on the face.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.540
And so the core is acting like
a spring that pushes back,

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:16.210
and that's called an
elastic foundation.

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:21.410
So people have calculated
this local buckling stress,

01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:25.090
and they found
that's equal to 0.57

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:30.200
times the modulus of the
face to the 1/3 power

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.670
times the modulus of the
core to the 2/3 power.

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:58.650
And here, if we use our
model for open cell foams,

01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:02.580
we can say the core modulus goes
as the relative density squared

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:04.600
times the solid modulus.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.080
And so you can
plug that in there.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.200
So then the
wrinkling occurs when

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.310
the stress in the face,
the Pl over the B3 btc

01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:55.510
is equal to this thing here.

01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:52.310
OK, so one more
failure mode that's

01:06:52.310 --> 01:07:00.920
the core shear, and that's going
to occur when the shear stress

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:06.280
in the core is just equal to
the sheer strength of the core.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:12.260
So the shear stress
is P over B4 times bc,

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:17.360
and the shear strength is some
constant, I think it's C11,

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.300
times the relative density of
the core to the three halves

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.740
power times the yield
strength of the solid.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:29.367
And here, this constant
is about equal to 0.15,

01:07:29.367 --> 01:07:30.200
something like that.

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:40.730
So now we have a
set of equations

01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:42.930
for the different
failure modes, and we

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:45.550
could solve each of them,
not in terms of a stress,

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.660
but in terms of a load
P. The load P is what's

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.380
applied to the beam, right?

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:52.150
So we could solve each of
these in terms of the load, P.

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:55.049
And then we can see which one
occurs at the lowest load, P.

01:07:55.049 --> 01:07:57.090
And that's going to be
the dominant failure mode.

01:07:57.090 --> 01:07:59.150
So one way to do it would
be to, for every time

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:02.110
you wanted to do this, to work
out all these three equations

01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:03.990
and figure out which
one's the lowest load.

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:06.800
But there's actually something
called a failure mode

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.950
map, which we're
going to talk about.

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:12.534
So let me just show you
it and we'll start now.

01:08:12.534 --> 01:08:14.200
I don't know if we'll
get finished this.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.020
But there's a way that you
can manipulate these equations

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:21.740
and plot the results as
this failure mode map.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:24.750
And you'll end up plotting
the core density on this plot,

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:29.180
on this axis here, and the face
thickness to span ratio here,

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.550
and so this will
kind of tell you,

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:35.446
for different configurations
of the beam, different designs,

01:08:35.446 --> 01:08:37.529
for these ones here, the
face is going to wrinkle,

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:39.570
for those ones there, the
face is going to yield,

01:08:39.570 --> 01:08:41.750
and for these ones here,
the core is going to shear.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.710
So I'm going to work
through these equations,

01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:45.770
but I don't think we're
going to finish it today.

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.602
So this is just kind
of where we're headed

01:08:47.602 --> 01:08:48.560
is to getting this map.

01:08:53.370 --> 01:08:57.460
So we'll say the dominant
failure mode is the one that

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:58.890
occurs at the lowest load.

01:09:21.369 --> 01:09:22.910
So the question
we're going to answer

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.479
is how does the failure mode
depend on the beam design?

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.330
And we're going to
do this by looking

01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:40.310
at the transition from one
failure mode to another.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.900
So at the transition
from one mode to another,

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.980
the two modes occur
at the same load.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.380
So I'm going to
take those equations

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:32.076
I had for each of
the failure modes,

01:10:32.076 --> 01:10:33.950
and instead of writing
this in terms of, say,

01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:35.825
the stress in the face,
I'm going to write it

01:10:35.825 --> 01:10:49.540
in terms of the
load, P. So using

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:53.150
that first one over there,
the load for face yielding,

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:55.030
I'm just rearranging that.

01:10:55.030 --> 01:11:03.820
It's B3 times bc times t/l times
the yield strength of the face.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.280
And similarly for
face wrinkling,

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.880
I can take this equation down
here and solve it for this P

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.158
here, OK?

01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:53.130
And then I can take
that equation at the top

01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:56.490
and solve that for P2
for the core shear,

01:11:56.490 --> 01:12:03.210
and that's equal to C11
times B4 times bc times

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:08.110
sigma ys times--
oops, wrong thing--

01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:11.410
times the relative
density to the 2/3 power.

01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:19.910
OK?

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:25.660
And then the next step
is to equate these guys.

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:28.410
So you get a transition
from one mode to the other

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:31.125
when two of these guys are
equal to each other, right?

01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:33.000
So there's going to be
a transition from face

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.590
yielding to face wrinkling
when these guys are equal.

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:38.529
And I'm not going to
start that because we're

01:12:38.529 --> 01:12:39.570
going to run out of time.

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:43.450
But let me just say that I
can pair these two up and say

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:46.370
there's a transition
between those two.

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:50.180
And that transition is going
to correspond to this line

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.510
here, OK?

01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:54.460
So at this line here, that
means you get face yielding

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.690
and face wrinkling
at the same load, OK?

01:12:57.690 --> 01:13:01.280
And then if I paired
up-- let's see here.

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.030
If I paired up face wrinkling
and core shear, these two guys

01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:09.130
here, I'm going to get this
equation here on that plot.

01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:12.020
And then if I paired up
these two guys here, the face

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:16.300
shielding and the core shear, I
would get that line there, OK?

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:19.790
So once I have those lines,
that tells me, you know,

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:23.620
anything with a lower density
core and a smaller face

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:25.800
thickness is going to
fail by face wrinkling.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.840
Anything with a
bigger density is

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.530
going to fail by face yielding.

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:33.320
And anything with a larger face
thickness and a larger density

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.010
is going to fail
by core shearing.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.447
And so you can start
to see that it--

01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:39.030
I'll work out the
equations next time,

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:41.571
but you can start to see that
it kind physically makes sense.

01:13:41.571 --> 01:13:44.550
Intuitively, this
face wrinkling,

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:48.669
it depends on the normal stress
in the face, in compression.

01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:50.960
So obviously the thinner the
face gets, the more likely

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.168
that's going to be to happen.

01:13:52.168 --> 01:13:54.960
So it's going to happen at
this end of the diagram.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.040
And it also depends on that
elastic foundation, on how much

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:01.270
spring support the
foundation has, right?

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.960
So the lower the core
density, the more likely

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.500
that is to happen.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.570
Then if you, say you have
small t, so the face is going

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:12.070
to fail before the core, as
you increase the core density,

01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.030
you're making that elastic
foundation stiffer and stiffer,

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:17.280
and you're making it harder
for the buckling to occur.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.330
It can't buckle into
the elastic foundation,

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.480
so then you're going to
push it up to the yielding.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.230
And then as you make the
face thickness bigger,

01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:26.631
as t gets bigger, then the
face isn't going to fail

01:14:26.631 --> 01:14:27.880
and the core is going to fail.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.720
So you can kind of
see just looking

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.570
at the relative position
of those things,

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.910
they all kind of
make physical sense.

01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:35.420
So I'm going to
stop there for today

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:38.740
and I'll finish the
equations for that next time.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.730
And we'll also talk
about how to optimize

01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:42.400
for strength next time.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.080
And we'll talk about a few
other things on sandwich panels.

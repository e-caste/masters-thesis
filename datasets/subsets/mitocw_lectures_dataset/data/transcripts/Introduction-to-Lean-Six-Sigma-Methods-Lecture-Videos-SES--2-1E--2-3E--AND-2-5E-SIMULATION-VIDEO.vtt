00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.470
ANNALISA WEIGEL: So
let's start with--

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.420
HUGH MCMANUS: I'm Hugh
McManus, the co-creator

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.612
of the lean enterprise
value simulation.

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:47.070
I'm going to talk a little bit
about teaching lean thinking

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.350
principles through
hands on learning

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.770
with particular reference to
what we do in the Lean Academy.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.840
Credited here are
Eric Rebentisch Tisch,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.260
my co-creator in the lean
enterprise value simulation.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.980
And Earl and Alexis, who
were key in integrating

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.080
the lean enterprise value
simulation, part of it,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.450
into the Lean Academy.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.390
The reason we use
simulation-based education

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.870
for this is that teaching lean
is is a difficult challenge.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.050
A great deal of that is
because it's experience-based

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.500
and it depends on a context,
the context of existing

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.660
industrial and
engineering processes

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.500
that are not
familiar to students.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.560
So we really need to
give them something

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.610
to think about and work with
before a lot of these ideas

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.600
start to make real
sense to them.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.050
So we use
simulation-based education

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.870
to increase comprehension.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.420
To allow them to put
the ideas together

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.310
in a more holistic,
way not just bits

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.810
and pieces of
technical knowledge,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.730
but how does it
all work together?

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.490
And of course learning through
experience, getting a tactile

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.410
feel for the material.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.490
Final thing for an intensive
event like the Lean Academy

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.290
is also just to get
the energy rubbed off.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.240
To give them something to do.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.470
To get their blood
pressure up a little bit.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.150
To keep them awake and excited
and involved in the class.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.229
The simulation is
built around attempting

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.010
to build LEGO airplanes that
are actually relatively poorly

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.040
designed LEGO airplanes, if the
criteria for a LEGO airplane

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.960
is that it's relatively
easy to put together

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.860
and it stays together
once you put it there.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.750
This is not a very
good airplane.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.670
And it's built in
a very unlean way.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.580
It's built in a
legacy system which

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.280
has an unbalanced production
system with bottlenecks

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.420
and other problems.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.680
A long supply chain.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.630
A long and uncoordinated
supply chain.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.590
The LEGOs actually come
from someplace else.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.510
They have to be transported
to the table where

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.750
the airplanes are built. And
there's a lot of paperwork

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.020
and communications issues in
both getting the plane built.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.520
And then at the
end of each round,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.440
doing the accounting
necessary to figure out

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.170
whether you actually made
money or not from the airplane.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.480
The system used in the Lean
Academy is moderately simple.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.810
We have four
manufacturing plants

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.410
that build tails, fuselages,
wings, and final assembly

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.880
to deliver an airplane
to the customer.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.630
We have a supplier
quality representative

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.090
who interacts with a
supply chain consisting

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.150
of a single dedicated supplier,
but in a different place.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.640
At a table where
the suppliers sit.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.390
So there's a flow of information
between these people.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.690
And hopefully that
creates a flow of parts,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.450
of subassemblies in
parts, that result

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.270
in some value being delivered
in aircraft being delivered

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.470
to the customer.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.870
The simulation it's
not just a matter

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.400
of building LEGO airplanes.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.300
It's actually a fairly
rigidly defined simulation

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.850
that has a number of features.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.640
For one thing, each student
what they're allowed to do

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.970
is represented
visually like this.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.880
Each student is set is
told, take these pieces

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.850
and build that assembly.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.980
This both defines what
they need to do visually

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.650
so it's fairly easy to
understand and it's changeable.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.670
Very important.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.790
This is a rather difficult
assembly to put together.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.350
If the students
wish to change it,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.780
they can in an organized way.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.290
The processes that
they do are also

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.820
constrained by hourglasses.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.779
It's not a dexterity contest.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.300
It's not a race.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.320
It's a process.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.130
And this process is at
many steps constrained

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.010
by the pace of some hourglasses
in particular, the assembly

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.960
operations.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.540
Depending on the part
count, hourglasses

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.140
with different times are used
to represent the actual factory

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.210
operations that are happening.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.000
That are simulated
by the simulation.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.610
It's not just a matter of
the student's dexterity.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.740
And so this becomes a
constraint that the students

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.390
have to work with and
design solutions around.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.017
There's a fairly long paperwork
chain and it's fairly clumsy.

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:53.850
It's not that hard to
learn but it turns out

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.040
it's not that easy to use.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.738
Standard paper order form here.

00:04:57.738 --> 00:04:59.280
You could think of
that even as a web

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.810
form in the modern economy.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.260
But you're just saying, I
want this many of this part,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.200
handing it off to your supplier
quality representative, who

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.080
then hands it to the
supplier who has to fill it.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.220
And then they have to fill out
essentially an invoice sheet

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.260
that they send back to you.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.780
That means that every
transaction with LEGOs

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.670
involves two pieces of paper
and 1, 2, 3, 4 steps just

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.930
to get your parts to build.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.400
Not a very good system but not
atypical of the real world.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.430
And finally there's
an accounting system

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.330
for Lean Academy.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.600
It's a cash flow system that
tracks all the costs involved.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.402
A fixed costs.

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:38.360
How much does it cost to
keep your plants open?

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.530
The variable cost.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.060
How much do those parts cost?

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.450
What does it cost to
do various things?

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.390
And you can figure out whether
you're making money or not.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.910
Often you're not.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.660
And if you don't get
out enough airplanes,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.860
you don't make any money.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.860
Or if you do things
in a wasteful way,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.088
if you waste parts, you
won't make any money.

00:05:58.088 --> 00:05:59.630
ANNALISA WEIGEL:
All right everybody.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.290
Let's check in.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.130
I'd like to find out how
many planes each table built.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.450
Let's start here.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.307
One plane.

00:06:06.307 --> 00:06:06.890
AUDIENCE: One.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.260
ANNALISA WEIGEL: One plane?

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.305
Two planes.

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:12.650
One plane.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.790
All right.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.430
Who's making money?

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.330
AUDIENCE: No one.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.955
ANNALISA WEIGEL: Let
me ask a question.

00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:22.780
Is anybody's manufacturing
operations making money yet?

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.280
No.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.232
OK.

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:26.690
Tell me how much
money the supplier

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.260
is making whose profitable?

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.077
AUDIENCE: 14.

00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:29.910
ANNALISA WEIGEL: 14.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.410
OK.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.670
So you're barely profitable.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.087
That's better than
being negative.

00:06:33.087 --> 00:06:34.460
All right.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.010
So the supplier might be
doing well in that enterprise,

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.740
but it might be at the expense
of the manufacturing portion.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.323
So this is something
that you're going

00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:43.380
to think about as you go
through your simulation.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.880
HUGH MCMANUS: So
in the Lean Academy

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.295
we dedicate one day to
the simulation, about 2/3

00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:50.670
of the teaching
time in that day.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.780
There's some lectures
interspersed.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.820
It happens in 12
minute active rounds--

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.760
there's 12 minutes of frenzy.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.650
Followed by on-- preceded
by in many cases, time

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.920
for reflection, planning,
financial analysis,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.527
and so forth.

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.610
And these are separated
up into basically learning

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.250
how to do the simulation,
getting past the learning

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.150
curve.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.370
Understanding how lean
process improvements can

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.300
be used to take a legacy state
and make it lean and make it

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.630
work better.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.290
And then a final round where
the manufacturing suppliers

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.450
and also a not simulated, but
conceptual engineering process,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.690
is used to achieve enterprise
lean by redesigning

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.050
the airplane, tuning the supply
chain to a really high state,

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.440
and seeing what you can do
in an almost ideal state.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.430
ANNALISA WEIGEL: This is a
common tool around the industry

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.200
to go and look at
other facilities

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.908
and benchmark yourselves not
only with respect to companies

00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:54.200
that do the same thing as
you do, but also to benchmark

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.158
yourself against companies
that do other things

00:07:56.158 --> 00:07:57.623
but have similar
processes to you.

00:07:57.623 --> 00:07:59.540
So there's a lot to learn
by going and walking

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.100
around and seeing this.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.990
And from what I took
away from the tables,

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:08.850
I think we've got two different
build-to philosophies going on.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.180
So you'll notice
there are two kinds

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.730
of build-to packages going on.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.452
Just take a look at
that and see what

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.910
cause somebody else to think
differently than what you did.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.430
I also wanted you guys to
notice this table here.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.660
Because I saw you guys.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.180
You flipped your
bins upside down when

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.590
you are ready for a new ones.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.245
That was your signals?

00:08:27.245 --> 00:08:29.120
AUDIENCE: This wasn't,
we don't want anymore.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.750
This is, we do.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.920
ANNALISA WEIGEL: And
that's you do want more.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.799
So I saw that and I thought that
was an interesting practice.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.716
Anybody else have a
practice that worked well

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:37.549
for them that might not
come out when you're

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:41.690
doing your table tours and just
looking at the static display?

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.220
AUDIENCE: The clock [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.460
AUDIENCE: We used one
timer for all four of us.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.720
AUDIENCE: Oh no.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.348
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:49.348 --> 00:08:49.890
AUDIENCE: No.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:50.495
Then we're all synchronized.

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:50.995
We're all--

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:56.413
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:56.413 --> 00:08:58.580
ANNALISA WEIGEL: So there's
a best practice that you

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.470
might consider adopting.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.330
Did we have a comment
from this team here?

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.358
We color coded our
bins and then color

00:09:05.358 --> 00:09:07.213
coded our standard
order sheets so

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:09.600
that she would be able
to identify more quickly.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.600
ANNALISA WEIGEL: OK, so
did everybody hear that?

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.670
There's color coding
of bins and color

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.380
coding of the different
standard orders

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.120
to try to match
visual inspection

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.325
and get quality good.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.440
AUDIENCE: We also color coded.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.976
So the red bin goes here.

00:09:23.976 --> 00:09:26.210
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.300
ANNALISA WEIGEL: So they
have three marks of color

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.240
to try to get that
all coordinated.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.160
Other best practices
that won't come out again

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.500
if you're just looking around?

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.020
AUDIENCE: Yes, we did a
continuous delivery cycles up

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.640
until we're done.

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.590
Because we noticed that there
was variability on how long

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.840
it took to fill the bin.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.283
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:51.283 --> 00:09:53.200
ALLEN HAGGERTY: The Lean
Aerospace Initiative,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.935
which funded all
this stuff years ago,

00:09:55.935 --> 00:09:58.660
is the consortium
of all the aerospace

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.730
companies and the government.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.430
And in these conferences
that we have,

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.615
the suppliers, the
engineers, the manufacturers

00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:11.500
would get up and make
presentations to basically show

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.710
how they do things.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.590
And that's the benefit of this--

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.440
makes the benchmarking a lot
easier because people basically

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.860
put their heads together
and everybody benefits.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.910
I mean there's an annual
fee that the companies pay

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.332
that supports all that.

00:10:25.332 --> 00:10:28.180
But they in fact get
the advantages of--

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.090
gee, we took a tour
through so many factory

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.130
and they going a red light that
goes on or something like that.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:38.410
So all the aerospace companies
benefit from the conversation

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.350
and the discussion
and the presentations

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:46.965
and the factory tours of
each other's organization.

00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:48.340
HUGH MCMANUS: The
tools that they

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:53.890
use include simple
organization, which

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.280
they can use lean principles
like 5S and visual control

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.870
to clean up their workplace.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.670
Just get the basic
process working.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.720
OK?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.970
Balancing a workload.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.010
Which can be planned
around lean principles

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.080
like pack time,
single piece flow.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.320
Which essentially allows them
to move work between plants

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.880
to clear bottlenecks and
get the work balanced.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.210
They can tear down
or move facilities.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:24.340
Again, based on lean principles,
not just random action.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:30.130
And they can modernize
this archaic order system.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.350
Again, planned using
lean principles.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.860
And there's a mechanic in
the simulation to allow

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.350
a paperless-- there's actually
still a little bit of paper

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.640
but much less--

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.690
ordering system that would
simulate a modern web-based

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.840
perhaps, or certainly
electronics-based

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.180
inventory management system.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.310
One of the key features
is the simulation

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.710
allows us is to use data.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.150
It's very difficult to go out
to a real aircraft manufacturing

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.990
plant and play with it.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.220
With the simulation, we can
play with it in these 12 minute

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.440
rounds and create and
use data that we've

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.070
collected to both plan
improvements and track

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:12.670
processes.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.148
So we can keep track of how
long does it take to do things?

00:12:15.148 --> 00:12:16.315
How many parts are involved?

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.117
What's the delay involved in
ordering parts, et cetera?

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.950
And we can do that
quantitatively and that's

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.130
one of the key aspects of most
product improvement techniques.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.170
It's to use the data
and let it tell you

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.740
what to do, not just make
things up as you go along.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.500
Be entirely dependent
on common sense

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.380
or experience to do these
kinds of improvements.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.760
And this data can
be incorporated

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.940
into classic lean tools
like value-stream mapping.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.880
This is the same data plotted
in the classic lean value-stream

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.930
map.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.440
Again it gives them the
opportunity to touch a tool,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.700
to actually use it, to actually
fill out the data with data

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.060
that they've collected from
at least a simulated reality

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.350
and then use that to
analyze it, so that they

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.330
can find bottlenecks.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.900
They can find
non-value added steps.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.920
They can find places
where paperwork and lack

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.280
of synchronization are
slowing the process down

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.560
and then focus their
improvements on those areas.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.080
Finally at the end
of the simulation,

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.300
we essentially, as we do in the
real world with lean thinking,

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.630
ask them to expand
their horizons.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.370
Expand the boundaries
of the enterprise

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.828
that they're
considering and seeing

00:13:34.828 --> 00:13:37.300
if they can get bigger
payoffs by doing more.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.760
By bringing in more functions.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.130
In this case, there's not
an engineering function

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.160
in the simulation, but we
do allow them to redesign

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.980
the airplane to cut part count.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.330
Reduce part types.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.580
Fix problems with the airplane.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.320
Make it easier to assemble.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.470
Do all of the things--

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.620
all of the engineering
functions that facilitate

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.420
lean in the real world.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.260
And again, touch it, understand
it, understand it in context,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.230
and then see how it
works in the final round.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:13.390
And again, by rebalancing work,
by redesigning the airplane,

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:17.860
by changing the facility
organization and further model

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.770
modernizing the supply
chain, by getting

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:25.030
into a really clean modern
just-in-time supply chain.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.610
Using the lean principles
and implementing it

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:32.090
on the simulation, they can
get an outstanding process out

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.590
of it.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.950
And that gives them a real
intuitive and tactile feel

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.630
for how lean type product
improvement principles can

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.780
be used to not just
make a process better,

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.600
but to make it astonishingly
better in a way

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.630
that they usually do
not think is possible

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.660
when they start the simulation.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.810
Another thing that's done is
throughout the simulation,

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.960
we embed learning by
doing mini lessons.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.810
And this is just
a single example.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.310
Kanban systems.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.900
Kanbans are a inventory
management ordering

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.770
and transport system which
is difficult to lecture

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.627
to because it's a very simple
thing that does a lot of-- that

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:15.210
has a lot of different
functionalities

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.140
in the real world.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.170
And solves a lot of problems
in ways that are sometimes

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.190
not intuitive.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.910
In the simulation, they use
Kanbans to basically solve

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.720
their inventory management
and supply chain problems.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:33.390
And they get both repeated
reintroduction to the concept

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.090
and what they're doing,
and mentored execution

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.290
of that concept in
the simulated world,

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.580
so that they really do get
an understanding of how

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.820
a simple system like Kanban
can serve so many functions

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.945
and solve some problems.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.680
The overall result--
and this is typical data

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.390
from a real event
is that they can

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.150
go from producing no
airplanes, or maybe one,

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.770
the first time they try.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.770
To producing a dozen the
last time, in the same time

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:10.050
and using the same
basic capabilities.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.150
They never get to throw
the hourglasses away.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.550
It never turns into
a LEGO building race.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.540
This isn't just
a learning curve.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.680
What they've done is
the process as it exists

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.390
and made it much, much better.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:26.680
And tracking along with
that is the financials,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.370
which go from losing a lot
of money to making a lot.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.290
Not surprisingly,
but again, they

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.680
get a feel for how this kind
of production efficiency

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.550
can lead to financial
performance.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.940
OK, so we had a
successful conclusion

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.280
of our simulation exercise.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.140
All of our tables
managed to produce

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.940
at least eight aircraft.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.770
One table got all
the way up to the 12

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.480
that the customer really wanted.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.640
And we had an 11 and a 10.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.720
Everybody got there by a
somewhat different route

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.750
and we learned some
lessons along the way.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.940
Our group that produced eight.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.329
Now that was still better
than the theoretical maximum

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.190
six they were making before.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.420
But they didn't meet the
theoretical capacity of 12

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.329
because they still hadn't ironed
out issues with their supply

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:16.829
chain and with coordinating.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.410
It wasn't that they didn't
have the theoretical capacity,

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.890
it was that the coordination
of the different components

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.480
of their enterprise wasn't
completely ironed out yet.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.440
So they didn't meet
their production goals.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.340
Very interesting.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.340
The group that made 11 airplanes
did get everything coordinated.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.840
They did a very good job.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.010
One order.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.400
One order was one piece short.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.190
And in a lean system, you're
very vulnerable to that kind

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.820
of disruption.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.570
That one order.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.490
That one piece in that
one order cost them

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.800
an airplane,
because it disrupted

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.420
their synchronization.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.400
It took them a
minute to recover.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.140
That was an airplane.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:00.240
Still that is a known issue with
lean production systems, not

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.800
necessarily a bad thing.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.130
That the issue--
the problem that

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.895
caused the one order to be
bad was surfaced immediately.

00:18:08.895 --> 00:18:10.980
And in the future--
that happened actually

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.720
early in the round and
they didn't do it again.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.310
And of course they achieved
11, which is a lot better

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.230
than seven aircraft.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.780
And we had one group that
was hitting on all cylinders

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.960
and managed to produce
the aircraft a minute

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.390
that the customers
really wanted.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.940
Interestingly too, if
we look over the course

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:35.640
of the whole day, the
production-- a little bit

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.300
of variation.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.690
Basically everybody's improving
production as they go along.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.890
The financial results show
some interesting detail.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.720
It's harder to see in
the production diagram.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.200
Which is that although
everybody's profit improved,

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.820
people took different paths.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.280
And this has been a
great class for this

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.270
because basically the paths
that people took pretty much

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:05.430
mirror the kinds of things that
can happen in the real world

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.120
when you go into
improvement events.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.090
Group number one started
out losing a lot of money.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.560
As soon as they stabilized
their traditional process,

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.300
they actually managed
to make money.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.810
And when they disrupted
it, trying to lean it out.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.900
They had what we call
a worse-before-better.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.410
Things actually got worse
until they got better again

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.520
and stabilized at a
high profit situation.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:35.160
Group number two showed a much
steadier increase in profit.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.640
They basically showed an
almost linear improvement.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.900
So they were not so
disrupted by change.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.370
Didn't come to quick results,
but by learning slowly

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.800
and steadily as they went
through the transformation

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.820
process, managed to increase
their profits steadily.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.440
That's nice because
that looks good.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.940
It's not always what happens.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:04.550
The green te-- sorry,
blue team, showed again,

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.560
a typical reaction.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.550
They stabilized and then in
the actual improvement round,

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.040
the round where
they changed things,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.220
showed at best steady
financial results.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.320
So this was learning
in a given state

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.790
but they would have
maxed out there.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:25.280
During the transformation
they didn't make more money,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.253
but that set them up
for the next round

00:20:29.253 --> 00:20:30.170
where they made a lot.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.390
And again during the
next transformation

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.600
they flattened off again.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.320
This is a lot nicer than
that worse-before-better,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.820
but it's still very typical.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.950
While you're investing
the resources.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.270
While you're changing things.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.820
You can't expect the
dramatic financial results

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.200
to happen right away.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.800
What you do is set yourself
up for dramatic improvements

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.510
in the next period.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.740
And we had a final
group which also did

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.300
the worse-before-better thing.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.260
It had a little bit
of a unfortunate end

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.780
result, which is the very
last round they actually

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.410
had it worse.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.080
And that was the group that
only made the eight aircraft.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.110
They were quite certain if we'd
done another round that they

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.300
could have gotten
the 12 and in fact

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.860
completed their zig-zag
worse-before-better journey.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.050
So that's a description of the
simulation and how it's used.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.920
We're going to do
a brief description

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.820
of the pedagogical
goals of the simulation

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.690
and how we think they've been
achieved in the Lean Academy

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.580
context.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.040
We said that we wanted it to
increase the comprehension

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.370
of the curriculum.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:44.000
And there is some literature
evidence that this works.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.780
In particular, in the
computer world people

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.450
have played computer games
versus static computer

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.215
websites.

00:21:51.215 --> 00:21:53.090
And it has been shown
that the little games--

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:54.830
and these are little toy games.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:58.830
But the little games
basically make people retain

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.200
the material much better.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.070
And also if you
look at behavior.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.430
There's been studies on
things like healthy diet

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.240
that people that have learned
through game-based learning as

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.147
opposed to static learning
actually take-- not only learn

00:22:16.147 --> 00:22:18.230
and retain the information,
better but it actually

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.040
affects the outcome.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.140
So that's good.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.290
That evidence is there.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.710
We also hoped that there's
better understanding

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.410
of the context and the holistic
nature of the material.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.780
And we hoped that they
learn through experience.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.570
That it engages different
learning modes and that

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.980
it allows them to
practice field,

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.770
to actually touch
and use the ideas.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.255
These are supported as goals.

00:22:42.255 --> 00:22:44.630
But there's not really a whole
lot of scientific evidence

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:45.590
that this works.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.470
Intuitively, the evidence
is pretty powerful

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.470
and the anecdotal experience
from the students is powerful.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.380
It's not a proven outcome.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.090
And we can certainly
say that we've

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.730
observed greatly
increased student

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.410
involvement and excitement.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah, when we were
on the same team for the LEGO

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.870
simulation and it
was a lot of fun.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.870
Especially since we got
a little competitive

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.690
with the other teams and trying
to build the most airplanes.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.545
But that was really cool.

00:23:13.545 --> 00:23:15.170
It's something that
we played with ever

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.810
since we were little
kids and to be

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.840
able to build something but
then apply the lean principles.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.390
And it was really amazing
to see how much we

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.160
learned through that.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.900
AUDIENCE: It was
probably the best way

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.140
of demonstrating
how process that I

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.100
thought it was efficient at
first and after applying lean.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.370
We didn't think we could make
12 airplanes in 12 minutes

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.140
but well-- we almost made it.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.220
We made 10.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.800
But it is possible
to do what some

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.750
believe is impossible at first.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.440
And after applying the analysis
and getting all the processes

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.760
down correctly, we were
getting pretty close.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean
that's pretty amazing.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.340
I was looking at the chart up
there and I was like, wait.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.050
We really only made one in
12 minutes the first time?

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.093
And then went all
the way up to 10 so.

00:24:00.093 --> 00:24:01.520
AUDIENCE: We're impressed.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.680
HUGH MCMANUS: So we
think this is working.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:11.330
We also have had very positive
experience with basically

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.800
teaching complicated systems.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.630
Most of the previous
literature evidence

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.550
was on relatively simple things.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.550
Fact-based things.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.620
We're actually trying
to teach a system that

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.860
affects other systems.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.270
So it's a complicated
body of knowledge,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.980
body of understanding,
that the students

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.770
are expected to absorb in
a relatively short time.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.540
And most of these
systems are not

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.730
available for manipulation
for teaching purposes.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.065
You can't go play with
an airplane factory.

00:24:38.065 --> 00:24:40.190
We found that the students
have a good experience--

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.900
and this experience
is not limited

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.150
to this particular
simulation, although this

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.190
is a good exemplar of it.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.210
If the simulation is complex
enough to capture the key

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.180
features, including the emergent
behaviors of the system.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.630
If it's too simple, you're
not really changing anything.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.820
You're not really
changing a system that

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.090
has unexpected
behaviors, so you're not

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.130
going to capture this
kind of learning.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.450
On the other hand, it
has to be simple enough

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.992
to have an acceptable
learning curve.

00:25:06.992 --> 00:25:09.830
If it takes three
days to learn it's not

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.930
going to be a teaching tool.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.960
And of course, it has to
be fast enough that you

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.860
can do multiple cycles of
learning within the teaching

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.220
period.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.150
It also has to be
credible in the sense

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.010
that it can't have artifacts
that the students say,

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.510
well, this is not
realistic and therefore I

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.080
will dismiss the experience
because I don't believe it.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.840
And it has to be fun
to keep people engaged.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.900
And basically on
this set of criteria,

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.190
we think that the simulation
that we use in the Lean Academy

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.200
is pretty good.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.780
Students think it's
pretty good too.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.360
This is feedback from
about 200 students,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.600
194 students over a couple
of years of Lean Academies.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.140
And we consistently
get the highest score

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.050
of the types of learning,
both other active learning

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.870
and lecturing materials.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.913
That the Lean Academy simulation
provides positive reinforcement

00:26:06.913 --> 00:26:07.580
of the concepts.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.770
That's the wording
of the question

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.020
and the students agree
that that's the case.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.790
Just qualitatively we also
get some written feedback

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.470
and verbal feedback.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.540
And it appears, and
again this is unprompted.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.910
We asked them the
general question,

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.980
what do you like
about the course

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.150
and what do you don't like?

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.710
And what we find
is what they like

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.760
is what we're hoping,
which is that it increases

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.960
the comprehension
of the curriculum.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.870
That the hands-on learning
and practice field experiences

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.610
are valuable to them.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.450
And that it increases their
involvement and excitement

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.940
with the material.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.220
As well as-- this
was not an explicit,

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.650
but it does show up a lot
in the student responses

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.930
as a team building and
camaraderie building activity.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.610
It's also very effective.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.370
And this is just a
numerical breakdown

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.430
of those kinds of responses.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:08.600
Out of 106 written responses,
we got a lot of illuminatings.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.060
A fair number of, we
liked the hands-on aspect.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.540
And the excitement and bonding
were somewhat secondary

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.550
but mentioned.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.090
As well as a big blob is
just generic, we like it.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.970
But that doesn't tell us a whole
bunch about why they like it

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.930
but these do and it's
what we're hoping.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.860
Caveats.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.390
Always important.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.000
This evaluation is based
on satisfaction, not really

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.570
outcomes.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.630
We don't track the
students in their careers

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:41.660
as aerospace engineer so we
don't have outcome metrics yet.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.320
It's cost and time intensive
to do this kind of thing.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.970
You need trained facilitators.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.415
It takes money to
set up a facility

00:27:50.415 --> 00:27:52.040
to do this, couple
of thousand dollars.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.060
That's the startup cost.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.340
Not the per each,
although you do

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.650
have to pay these
people somehow.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.630
They're vulnerable
to disruption.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.710
Logistics, facility, failure
to keep on schedule errors

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:07.970
can degrade the
experience badly.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.080
Our simulation seems
to be fairly robust

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.140
but in general simulations
are vulnerable to disruption.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.390
And you can't satisfy
every learning style.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.030
Amusingly, we've
had written feedback

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.670
asking for both more
and last simulation.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.100
Because some people
feel they need more time

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.180
to internalize the
information that's there.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.800
Others get it quickly and
wish they could move on

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.290
to other learning modes.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.242
And another one, and it's
a unexpected psychological

00:28:39.242 --> 00:28:40.700
effect, is that
there's real stress

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.890
in the simulated process.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.650
And that this sometimes
creates difficulties

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:46.730
with people's learning.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.770
Could create competition
and bad feeling

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.210
if it's not managed carefully.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:53.870
We've learned that that's
something that is an issue that

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:54.860
needs to be managed.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.140
And these, by the way,
are typical issues

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.520
for teaching simulations.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.400
Conclusion to this part.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.280
We have a unique simulation
of aerospace enterprises.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.920
A subset of it is used
in the Lean Academy.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.030
We think it works
and it provides

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.990
a laboratory for experiential
learning of complex systems.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.530
There's not a whole lot of
work in this area going on.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.612
We've had a very good
experience with it.

00:29:20.612 --> 00:29:22.820
Certainly the feedback that
we have from our students

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.950
indicates that it's successful.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.080
And the caveats that we
have for our simulation

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.140
are typical of learning
simulations in general.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.990
ERIC REBENTISCH: There are other
aspects of the simulation that

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.090
replicate the entire
enterprise and I'm

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:38.090
going to talk a little bit
about each of those elements.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.960
And the simulations
are modular so you

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.870
can go through the
manufacturing part

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.820
or you can go through
the engineering part,

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:52.610
depending on what the learning
objectives for the course are.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.750
You can combine them
in various ways.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.110
You can combine
the manufacturing

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.390
with the engineering to
teach specific lessons

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:03.350
about transition to production
and engineering support.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.870
You can look at just
engineering alone

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.210
if you are interested
in understanding

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.090
how engineering processes
behave in a highly

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.657
variable environment.

00:30:12.657 --> 00:30:14.240
So there's a lot of
flexibility that's

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.250
built into the
simulation environment.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.900
So this is the simulation
that you all experience here

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.410
in the Academy that has
a manufacturing core

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:29.120
simulation and a
simplified supplier

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.090
base with a representative.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:35.810
If you expand out to the
full supplier simulation,

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.900
you get a much richer
experience of understanding

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:43.190
how ordering and
fulfillment processes are

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.140
dynamic in the enterprise.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:50.240
And learning much more about
network organization structures

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:56.030
and the way they behave and
how effective coordination is

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:56.900
critical to lean.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:04.640
For the full enterprise,
you can add the dynamics

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.830
of an engineering system that
is supporting the manufacturing

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.000
and supply base.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.280
And this is the full
[INAUDIBLE] sim,

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.460
where the engineering
changes that you

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.940
made during the course of
the redesign of the airplane

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.170
were done for essentially
free in this simulation

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.270
that you did in
the Lean Academy.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.813
In the real
enterprise simulation,

00:31:28.813 --> 00:31:30.230
you have to wait
for the engineers

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.330
to process those jobs.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.450
And that can lead to all
sorts of interesting dynamics

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.540
amongst the players and
simulated organizational

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.050
structures.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.390
There's also a
service and support

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:47.510
module that looks at aftermarket
field support for the products

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:52.330
and this introduces new and
interesting complexities

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.080
to the enterprise.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.260
Because you now
have two main value

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.970
streams and sources of revenues.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.490
You have to prioritize
where you make

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.060
improvements in the enterprise.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:03.560
All right.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.460
So there's another
variant of the simulation

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.730
that focuses on just an
engineering organization.

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.940
Most engineering organizations
have multiple projects

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.890
going on at a given
time and they're

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.090
competing for resources.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.350
And those projects
aren't always the same.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.497
So this simulation looks at
how you prioritize projects,

00:32:22.497 --> 00:32:24.580
how you structure the
organization, how you manage

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.610
the interactions so
that you get the highest

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.360
throughput through the
system and the most

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.310
return on investment
for improvements

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.030
through lean practices.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.740
So some of the things that we're
not covered in the Lean Academy

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.610
simulation are a more
advanced economic system

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:41.980
that allows you to
make trade-offs,

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.580
to understand what the impact
of lean improvements are,

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.520
and to actually calculate
financial performance

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.020
of the kind that
you would typically

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.450
track with a real company.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.580
There's also a lean
calculator that

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.450
can be used to evaluate whether
one proposed improvement

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.500
effort is better than another.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.910
And these are levels
of analysis that

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:08.710
are more in-depth tools, that
are more sophisticated that

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.210
can be added on to
the sim environment.

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.830
So in all, it's a fairly
sophisticated system

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.400
for teaching the impact of
lean principles and practices

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.570
on an enterprise.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.330
So there are a number
of organizations

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:26.710
that are using the web
simulation and its variants

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.960
and they have adopted
it for their own use

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.560
and are actually using it in
their own internal training.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.580
So we have a method for actually
disseminating these materials.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.780
And if there are any questions
about adopting the simulation,

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.340
the best place to
go would be to send

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.550
a message to ednet@mit.edu.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:49.030
And you can get more
information about how you might

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.050
adopt these training materials.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right.
Good morning,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
all.
So we take another big step

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
forward today and get onto a new
plane of understanding,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
if you will.
In the last week and a half,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
our focus was on the storage
element or storage elements

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
called inductors and capacitors.
And capacitors stored change

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and inductors essentially stored
energy in the field,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the magnetic flux.
And the state variable for an

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
inductor was the current while
that for a capacitor was the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
capacitor voltage.
We also looked at circuits

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
containing a single storage
element, we looked at RC

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
circuits and we also looked at
circuits containing a single

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
inductor.
And this was a single inductor

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
with a resistor and a current
source or a voltage source and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so on.
What we are going to do today

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is do what are called
"second-order systems".

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So they are on the next plane
now.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And with this second-order of
systems, they are characterized

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
by circuits containing two
independent storage elements.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
They could be an inductor and a
capacitor or two independent

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
capacitors.
And you will see towards the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
end what I mean by two
independent capacitors.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If I have two capacitors in
parallel, they can be

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
represented as a single
equivalent capacitor so that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
doesn't count.
It has to be two independent

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
energy storage elements and
resistors and voltage sources

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and so on.
And what we end up getting is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
what is called "second-order
dynamics".

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And much as first order
circuits were represented using

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
first order differential
equations, this kind you end up

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
getting second-order
differential equations.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Before we go into this,
I would like to start

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
motivating this and give you one
example of why this is important

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
to study.
There are many,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
many examples but I will give
you one.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What I would like to do is draw
your attention to our good old

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
inverter driving a second
inverter.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The same circuit that we used
to motivate RC studies,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
one inverter driving another.
So let me draw the circuit.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Here is one inverter.
This is, let's say,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
5 volts and this is,
let's say, 2 kilo ohms.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And I connect the output of
this inverter to a second

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
inverter.
And what we saw in the last few

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
lectures was that in this
specific example there was a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
parasitic capacitor or a
capacitor associated with the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
gate of this MOSFET.
And that could be modeled by

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
sticking a capacitor CGS between
the gate of the MOSFET and

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
ground.
And we saw that the waveforms

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
here, if I had some kind of step
here.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Let's say, for example,
a step that went from high to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
low.
Then out here I would have a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
transition that instead of going
up rapidly like this would

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
transition a little bit more
slowly.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And this transition was
characterized by an RC time

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
constant.
And this is what gave rise to a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
delay in the eventual output.
So that is what we saw

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
previously, single energy
storage element.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Today what we are going to do
is we are going to look at the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
same circuit,
the exact same circuit,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and have some fun with it.
What we are going to say is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
look, this thing is pretty slow,
so what I would like to do is

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
-- why don't we go ahead and put
that up.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
What we are going to see is
that the yellow waveform is the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
waveform at the input here.
And the green waveform here is

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
the waveform at this
intermediate node.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And notice that this waveform
here is characterized by the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
slowly rising characteristics
that are typical of an RC

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
circuit.
There are some other

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
weirdnesses and so on going on
here like a little bump and

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
stuff like that.
You can ignore all of that for

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
now.
It happens because of certain

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
other very subtle circuit
effects that you won't be

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
dealing with,
called Miller effects and so on

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
that you won't be dealing with
in 6.002.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So focus then on this part
here.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It is pretty slow.
And because of that slow

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
rising, I get a very slow
transition and I get some delay

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
in my inverter.
So you say ah-ha,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
we learned about this in 6.002,
I can make it go faster.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
How can you make the circuit go
faster?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
What could you do?
This is rising very slowly.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
How can you make it go faster?
Anybody?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
You have multiple choices,
actually.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
What are your choices here?
Pardon.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Decrease the time constant.
And how would you decrease the

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
time constant?
The capacitance is connected to

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
this MOSFET gate here.
I didn't want it in the first

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
place but it is there,
I cannot help it,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
so I can decrease the
resistance.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Good.
Let me go ahead and do that.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
What I will do is I am going to
knock this sucker out and stick

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
in a new resistance that is say
50 ohms, a much smaller

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
resistance.
That should speed things up,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
right?
That should make things go much

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
faster because this is a smaller
time constant because R is

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
smaller, correct?
OK, let's go do it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And let's see if we get what we
expect.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I have a little switch here.
And using that switch,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I am going to switch in this
little resistance.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Whoa, what on earth is
happening out there?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
This is so much fun.
What I did is I switched in a

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
small resister here to decrease
the time constant,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
but it looks like I got a whole
bunch of crapola that I did not

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
bargain for.
This is certainly very fast,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
it goes up really fast,
but I am not sure where it is

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
going, though.
Let's stare at that a little

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
while longer.
Let me expand the time scale

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
for you.
Look at this.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Instead of a nice little smooth
thing going up.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I get something that looks like
this.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It looks something like a
sinusoid.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It looks sinusoidal,
but then it is a sinusoid that

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
kind of gives up and kind of
gets tired and kind of goes

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
away.
Right?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It kind of dies out.
So nothing that you have

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
learned so far has prepared you
for this.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And, trust me,
when I first did some circuit

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
designs myself a long,
long time ago I got nailed by

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
that.
I looked at my circuit,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and what ended up happening was
I was noticing these sharp lines

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
at all my transitions.
When I looked at my scope,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I expected to see nice little
square waves but I saw these

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
little nasty spikes sitting out
there.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And then when I stared at it
more carefully,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
those spikes were really
sinusoids that seemed to kind of

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
get tired and kind of go away.
So those are nasty,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
those are real and they happen
all the time.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And what we will do today is
try to get into that and

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
understand why that is the case.
We will understand how to

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
design that away.
And that is a real problem,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
by the way.
And the reason that is a real

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
problem is the following.
Look at this.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Look down here.
Because this intermediate

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
voltage is meandering all over
the countryside here,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
at this particular point the
intermediate voltage dips quite

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
low.
And because it dips quite low

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
look at the output.
The output has a bump here.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And it is quite possible for
this output bump to now go into

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the forbidden region.
Or worse.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
If this swing here was higher,
this could have actually gone

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
onto a one, so I would have
gotten a false one pulse here.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Instead of having a nice one to
zero transition,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I would have gotten a one to
zero, oh, back to one,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
oh, back to zero and then back
down to zero.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So this is nasty stuff,
really, really nasty stuff.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
What we will do is understand
why that is the case today and

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
see if we can explain it.
What is going on here?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
What is really going on here is
take a look at this circuit

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
here.
I will take a look at this path

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
here.
So this is your VS voltage

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
source.
Path kind of goes like this and

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
around.
It turns out that this circuit

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
is a loop here.
And when there is current flow,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
going down to basic physics you
remember that I also enclose

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
some amount.
So there is a current flowing

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
in a loop.
And because of that there is an

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
effective inductance here.
And, in fact,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
any current flowing through a
wire above a ground plane,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
for that matter,
can be characterized by the

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
inductance.
So I can model that by sticking

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
a little inductor here.
So my real circuit is not

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
exactly a resistor and a
capacitor, but my real circuit

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
is an inductor as well that
comes into play because of this

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
wire.
Every wire, when there is a

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
current flow,
has an inductance associated

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
with it.
And because of that the real

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
circuit is resistor,
inductor and capacitor.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So I end up with two storage
elements now,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and the dynamics of that are
very different from that with a

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
single storage element.
That is just a bit of

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
motivation for why our study of
inductors is important.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And I can draw a quick circuit
here.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
If you look at the circuit,
start from ground,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
the voltage VS and there is a
resistor here.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And then I have an inductor and
then I have a capacitor.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So it is a voltage source,
resistor, inductor and

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
capacitor.
For this whole week we will be

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
looking at circuits like this.
Today what I would like to do

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
is start very simple,
start with the simplest

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
possible form of this so that
you can begin building up your

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
insight and then go into more
complicated cases.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Today what I will do is simply
begin with a case where I don't

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
have a resistor here and simply
study a voltage source,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
an inductor and a capacitor and
understand what the voltage

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
looks like out here.
So we look at the dynamics of a

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
little system like this.
Before we go on,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I want to caution you about
something.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
It is just happenstance that I
have introduced for you

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
capacitors based on the
parasitic capacitance here and

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
inductance based on parasitic
inductance.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I would hate to leave you with
the impression that inductors

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and capacitors are "bad".
Because when you think of a

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
parasitic, you know,
parasites.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
These are parasitic.
You didn't expect them there,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
didn't expect this here and we
got the weird behavior.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So parasitics have a bad
connotation to them.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I do not want to leave you with
a bad taste in your mouth about

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
capacitors and inductors that
these are just bad things.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We just have to deal with them
and deal with second-order

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
differential equations and all
that stuff because they're just

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
bad stuff and we just have to
deal with them.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I don't want you to end up
going through life hating

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
capacitors and inductors.
Just because of my choice of

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
examples, it just happened to be
introducing them as capacitors.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I want to point out that these
are fundamental lumped elements

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
in their own right.
They are very,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
incredibly important and useful
circuits where we designed

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
capacitors and inductors because
we want to have them in there.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
There are many circuits that we
will look at where we really

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
want the inductor in there.
We will design an inductor by

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
wrapping wire around in a coil
and get bigger inductances and

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
so.
Just remember that this can be

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
parasitic in some cases,
but in many cases it's good,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
inductors are good,
so just stick with that

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
thought.
These are mostly good so don't

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
go around hating them.
All right.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Let's go on and analyze a basic
circuit like this.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And what I would like to cover
in the next hour are the

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
foundations of something like
that.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I will take you through the
foundations so you understand

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
how it works.
And, as always,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
what I am going to end up with
is build up the foundations,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
help you understand why we got
where we were and then help you

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
build intuition.
And then show you a really,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
really simple intuitive way of
doing things in terms of how

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
experts do it.
And the real cool thing about

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
EECS is that the way experts do
things, things are really,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
really very simple in the end.
But you need to build up some

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
intuition to get there.
So our circuit looks like this

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
in terms of my two storage
elements.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I have a voltage vI,
inductor L, capacitor C and I

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
am going to look at the voltage
across the capacitor and my

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
current through the capacitor.
So v(t) is the voltage across

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
the capacitor and my current is
the current through this loop

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
here, which is the same as the
current through the capacitor or

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
the current through the
inductor.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And we are going to proceed in
exactly the same manner as we

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
did for first order differential
equations, write the equations

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
down and just boom,
boom, boom, boom,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
go down the same sets of steps
but just get to some place

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
different.
We are going to start by

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
writing a node equation for this
node here.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
That's the only node for which
I have an unknown voltage.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
The node here is vI,
so I need to find this,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
there's just one unknown node
voltage.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And I am going to need some
element laws.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
For the capacitor I know the iV
relation is given by the i for

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
the capacitor is Cdv/dt.
And just to show the capacitor

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I am just calling it dvc/dt.
Similarly, for an inductor,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000
L, the voltage across the
inductor is given by Ldi/dt.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So this is the vI relation for
the capacitor,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
the vI relation for an
inductor.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
It also suits us to write this
in an integral form.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So if I integrate both sides of
this equation and I bring L down

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
to this side,
I end up getting something like

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000
this, 1/L minus infinity to t,
VLdt, and that is simply iL.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I am just simply replacing this
with an integral form.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So this is a VI relationship
for the inductor and this is for

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
the capacitor.
So let me now go ahead and

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
apply the node method for my
circuit here.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Here, for the node method,
I have to equate the currents

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
coming into the node or sum the
currents coming into the node

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and equate that to zero.
And while I do that I simply

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
replace the currents by the
corresponding voltages using the

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
element laws.
So what do I get?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I get the current going in here
to the inductor is equal to the

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
current going through the
capacitor.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
What is the current going the
capacitor?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
In terms of its v relationship
it is Cdv/dt.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And the current going to the
inductor is given by this

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
relation here,
which is simply 1/L minus

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
infinity to t.
The voltage across the

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
capacitor is simply (vI-v)dt.
I have just written down the

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
node quotation for this node
here.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Now I will just apply a bit of
math and simplify it and get the

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
resulting equation.
What I can do is simply

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
differentiate with respect to t
here.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And get this to be Cd^2v/dt^2,
the second derivative of v.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And here what I end up getting
is 1/L(vI-v).

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.000
So I just differentiated the
whole thing by d/dt here.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.000
And then I just move L up here.
I bring d^2v/dt^2 out here.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And then I get a minus v here,
and that will be equal to,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
oh, I'm sorry.
Let me leave this here.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Bring the minus v to this side
so it becomes a plus and leave

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
vI on this side.
So I end up getting

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
LCd^2v/dt^2.
I bring L up here.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And then I take v to the other
side.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Plus v and leave vI here so I
get vI.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
That is second order
differential equation that

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
governs the characteristics of
the voltage, v.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
So much as the voltage across
the capacitor was a state

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
variable in our RC circuits or
the current through the inductor

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
was a state variable in our RL
circuits, out here both the

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
current through the inductor and
the voltage across the capacitor

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
are my two state variables.
And so here I have a

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
second-order equation in my
voltage, v.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Again, going through the
foundations here,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
I am now going to go through a
bunch of math.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Up to here it was circuit
analysis, and now I am just

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
going to do math.
For the next three or four

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
blackboards just math.
You can solve this second-order

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
differential equation any which
way you want.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
But just to keep things as
simple as possible,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
in 6.002 I solve all the
differential equations,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
it turns out we are fortunate
enough we can do that,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
using the exact same method
again and again and again,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
the same thing can be applied.
And the method that we use to

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
solve it is the method of
homogenous and particular

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
solutions.
So the first step we are going

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
to find the particular solution,
vP.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Second step we find the
homogenous solution,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
vH.
And the third step we are going

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.000
to find the total solution as
the sum of, v is simply the

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
particular plus the homogenous
solution and then solve for

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
constants based on the initial
conditions and the applied

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
voltage.
So let's write down initial

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
conditions.
Let's assume,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
for simplicity,
that my initial conditions are

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
simply the voltage across the
capacitor is zero to begin and

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
the current through my inductor
is also zero as I begin life.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Now, this is what is called
"zero state".

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
v and i are both zero,
and so the response of my

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
circuit for some input is going
to be called ZSR.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
You've probably heard this term
in one of your recitations.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
So zero state response simply
says I start with my circuit at

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
rest and looks at how it behaves
for some given input.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
That is a little term you may
end up using.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
My input next.
I am going to use the following

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
input.
vI of t is going to be a step,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
is going to look like this.
My input is at t=0 v is going

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
from zero to some voltage VI and
then stay at that voltage.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
It is going to be a step.
Kaboom.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And you can see why I am going
with this set of variables,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
because I want make this
situation as close as possible

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
to the funny behavior we
observed there.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Remember we had a step,
and because of the step we had

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
some behavior at that node?
So I will try to bring you as

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
close to that.
In tomorrow's lecture,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I am going to close the loop
around that and derive for you

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
exactly the behavior we saw on
the scope.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
And to get there I am going to
be try to be as close as

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
possible to the constants and
other parameters in the demo.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
So VI is a step and zero state.
Just in terms of notation,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
this kind of a step input
occurs pretty frequently.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
And we just have a special
notation for it.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
We simply call it VI is the
final value here.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And we call it u(t).
So VIu(t), u(t) simply

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
represents a step at time t=0,
steps from zero volts to VI.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
That is just a little more
notation that will come in handy

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
at some point.
More math now.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Three steps,
particular solution,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
homogenous solution,
total solution/constants.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
This is almost like a mantra
here, like a chorus.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Homogenous solution we compute
using a four-step method.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And four-step method for
homogenous solutions,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
it turns out that it happens to
be that way for all the

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
equations we will see in our
course.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
The first step would be assume
a solution of the form Ae^st.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Exactly as with RCs.
If you close your eyes and do

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
exactly what you did for RCs you
will get to where you want to

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
be.
You assume a solution of the

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
form Ae^st.
Substitute that into your

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
homogenous equation.
Obtain the characteristic

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
equation.
Solve for the roots.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And then write down your
homogenous solution.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Same sort of steps again and
again and again until you get

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
bored to tears.
Particular solution.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
For the particular solution,
I simply need to find a

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
solution, any solution,
if not the most general one but

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
any solution that satisfies the
particular equation which

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
satisfies that equation.
LCd^2vP/dt^2+vP=VI.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
My input is a step and I am
going to look for the solution

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
for time t greater than zero.
Notice that for time t less

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
than or equal to zero,
v is going to be zero.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
So I am looking for a solution
greater than t=0.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Here, if I substitute vP=VI,
that is a particular solution.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Because if I substitute VI here
this goes to zero and then I get

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
VI=VI, so this works.
I promised you this was going

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
to be simple.
You cannot get any simpler than

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
that.
I have done my first step.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
I found the particular
solution.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
And VI is a good enough
particular solution so I will

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
use it, I will take it.
As my second step I am going to

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
find vH or the solution to the
homogenous equation.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000
And the homogenous equation is
simply that equation with drive

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
set to zero.
What I get here is

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
LCd^2vH/dt^2+vH=0.
That is my homogenous equation.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
I simply set the drive to be
zero.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
And to find the solution here,
I go through my four-step

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
method.
Again, in 6.002 following the

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
kind of Occam's principle,
we just show you the absolute

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
minimum necessary to get to
where you want.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
The absolute minimum necessary
is it turns out that we can

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
solve all our differential
equations that we use here by

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
using the methods of homogenous
and particular solutions.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
And every homogenous solution
can be solved by a four-step

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
method.
That is about as minimal as it

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
can get.
So no extraneous stuff there.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
The four-step method,
four steps.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000
The first step is assume a
solution of the form vH=Ae^st.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000
What I have noticed is that
students starting out are

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000
usually scared of differential
equations.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
I know I was when I was a
student.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
And the trick with differential
equations is that it is all a

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
matter of psych.
Just because you see some

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
squigglies and squagglies and a
bunch of math and so on you say

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
oh, that must be hard.
But differential equations are

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
actually the simplest thing
there is because in a large

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
majority of cases the way you
solve them is you assume you

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
know the answer,
someone tells you the answer.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
And then all you are left to do
is shove the answer into the

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
equation and find out the
constants that makes it the

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
answer.
Just a matter of psych.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Psych yourselves that this
stuff is easy,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
because I am telling you what
the solution is.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
All you have to do is
substitute and verify.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
If you think about differential
equations that way or a large

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
majority of them,
it really is very simple if you

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
can just get past the squigglies
here.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Just get past the squigglies
and then just simply stick in

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
some simple stuff and it works.
I mean it just cannot get any

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
easier.
I cannot think of any other

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
field where the way you find a
solution is assume you know the

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
solution and stick it in.
It has never made any sense to

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
me but that is how it is.
So we assume the solution to

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
the form Ae^st,
you stick it in there,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
and you have to find out the A
and s that make it so.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
It cannot get any simpler than
that.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Let's stick the sucker in here
and see what we can get.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Substitute Ae^st here I get
LCA, and second derivative,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
so it's s^2 e^st.
And Ae^st on this one here.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
And that equals zero.
And then let me just solve for

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
whatever I can find.
Assuming I don't take the

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
trivial case A=0,
I cancel these guys out.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
And what I am left with is
simply LCs^2+1=0.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
In other words,
what I end up getting is B,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
s^2=-1/LC.
My first step was,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I am giving you solutions,
stick them in there,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
assume a solution of this form.
Second step is get the

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
characteristic equation.
And the way you get the

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
characteristic equation is that
you simply stick this guy in

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
there.
And what you end up getting is

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
some equation in s^2.
Do you remember what you got

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
for first order circuits?
What s was?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
What is s?
For first order circuits,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
what did you get as a
characteristic equation?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
s+1/RC=0.
The same thing.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Just remember to blindly apply
the steps.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
It will lead you to the answer.
This is called the

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
"characteristic equation".
This is incredibly important.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
You will see in about a couple
weeks from now that once you

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
write the characteristic
equation down for a circuit,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
it tells you all there is to
know about the circuit.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And often times you can stop
solving right here.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
To experienced circuit
designers this tells me

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
everything there is to know.
This is really key.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
That's why it's called a
characteristic equation.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
I believe in problem number
three of the homework that will

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
be coming out this week,
that is exactly what you are

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
going to do.
I am going to give you a

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
circuit, ask you to get to the
characteristic equation quickly

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
and then from there intuit the
solution.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Write the characteristic
equation and then just intuit

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
solution, it's that simple.
So, step A, assume a solution

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
of the form, step B,
write the characteristic

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000
equation down.
And let me just simplify that a

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
little bit.
I go ahead and find my roots.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
And my roots here,
remember that j is the square

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
root of minus one.
And so what I end up getting

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
is, my two roots here are,
plus j square root of 1/LC and

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
minus j square root of 1/LC.
Two roots.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
And just as a shorthand
notation, much like I had a

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
shorthand notation for RC,
what was my shorthand notation

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
for RC?
Tau.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Just as tau was big in first
order, we have a corresponding

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
thing that is big in second
order and that is omega nought.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Omega nought is simply square
root 1/LC.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Just as tau was RC,
omega nought is a shorthand

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
here.
And so s is simply plus or

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000
minus j omega nought.
Notice that in this equation

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000
here, if you take the square
root of LC there that has units

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:56.000
of time, so one divided by that
has units of frequency.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Notice that this guy is a
frequency in radians.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
I end up getting my roots of
the homogenous equation,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
and that is my third step.
And as my fourth step,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
I simply write down the
homogenous solution as

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
substituting s with its roots
and writing the most general

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
possible form of the solution,
and that would be A1e^(j omega

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
nought t)+A2e^(-j omega nought
t).

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Done.
Some constant times this

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
solution plus some other
constant times,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
the other solution.
Plus zero omega nought.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Remember it comes from here,
Ae^st.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
I assume the solution of this
form, so my solution in this

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
most general case would be s
being j omega nought in one

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
case, minus j omega nought in
the other case,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
and I sum the two to get the
most general solution.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
So blasting ahead.
I now have my homogenous

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
solution.
And as my third step of

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000
solution to differential
equations I write down the total

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000
solution, v=vP+vH,
particular plus the homogenous

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
solutions.
And v=VI, was my particular

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
solution, +A1e^(j omega nought
t)+A2e^(-j omega nought t) is my

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
complete solution.
The final step,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
write down the total solution
and find the constants from the

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
initial conditions.
To find the constants from the

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
initial conditions,
let's start with,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
the voltage is zero to begin
with.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
This equation governs the
characteristics of v,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
so I need to find the initial
conditions.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
First of all,
I know that know that v(0)=0.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
From there I substitute t=0.
And so this goes to one,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
this goes to one,
and I end up getting

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
0=VI+A1+A2.
That is my first expression.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
And then I am also given that
i(0)=0.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
And so I can get that as well.
How do I get i?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
This is v.
I know that i=Cdv/dt,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
so I can get i by simply
multiplying by C and

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
differentiating this with
respect to t.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
I get C, this guy vanishes so I
get d/dt of this.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So it is CA1(j omega nought)
e^(j omega nought t)+CA2(-j

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
omega nought)e^(-j omega nought
t).

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:21.000
From here I am given that that
is zero, and so therefore this

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
guy becomes a one,
this guy becomes a one,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000
j omega nought,
j omega nought cancel out.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:43.000
What I end up getting is A1=A2.
From the second initial

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
condition I get A1=A2.
From these two,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:58.000
if I substitute here for A2,
I get VI + 2A1 = 0,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000
or A1=-VI/2.
That is also equal to A2.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Therefore, my total solution
now can be written in terms of

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
the actual values of the
constants I have obtained.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
I get VI-VI/2.
So A1 and A2 are equal.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:33.000
I just pull them outside.
I pull VI-2 outside and I stick

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
these two guys in parenthesis
in.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Again, I promised you no more
circuits from here on until the

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000
very last board or something
like that.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
It is all math,
so not much else happening

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
there.
More math.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
If you would like,
I could skip all the way to the

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
end and show you the answer.
But I just love to write

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
equations on the board so let me
just go through that.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000
I am going to simplify this a
little further here.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And we should remember this
form by the Euler relation,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
ejx=cos x+j sin x.
And by the same token,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:47.000
(e^jx + e^-jx)/2=cos x.
You all should know this from

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000
the Euler relation.
So were are using this guy

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:04.000
here, ej^x + e^-jx=2cos x.
And so this one is 2 cosine of

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
omega nought t,
2 and 2 cancel out,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.000
and what I am left with is
v(t)=VI-VI cos( omega nought t).

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:24.000
And the current is Cdv/dt,
which is simply CVI sin( omega

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
nought t).
Just remember that omega nought

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000
is the square root of 1/LC.
We are done.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.000
In fact, I did not give that
answer the importance that was

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
due so let me just draw.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
There.
That is better.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Enough math.
In a nutshell,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
what did we do.
We wrote the node method,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
it's a very simple circuit,
to write down the equation

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
governing that circuit.
And then we grunged through a

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
bunch of math.
Not a whole lot here.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
It is pretty simple.
And ended up with a relation

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
that says the voltage across the
capacitor for a step input,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
assuming zero state,
is a constant VI-VI cos omega

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
t.
Notice that even though I have

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
a step input,
the circuit dynamics are such

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
that I get a cosine in there.
You can begin to see where

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
these cosines are coming from
now.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
They come in here.
And if you recall the example I

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
showed you earlier of the
inverter circuit,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
remember there was a cosine
that decayed,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
that was sort of losing energy
and kind of dying out?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
So you can see where the
cosines are coming from.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:11.000
And just to draw you a little
sketch here.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Let me draw v and i for you and
let me plot omega t,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:35.000
pi/2, pi and so on.
Let me plot VI.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
When time t=0,
VI=0, cosine omega t is one,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000
and so VI-VI=0.
That is simply a cosine that

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:56.000
starts out at zero here,
and at pi I get cosine omega t

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
is minus one,
so I get plus VI on the other

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
side.
So I end up at +2VI.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
At this point the voltage is
here.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
And notice that this guy looks
like this.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:27.000
It is a cosine that is
translated up so that its mean

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:37.000
value is not zero but VI.
It is just a translation up of

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
a cosine.
Similarly, in this case for the

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
current it is a sinusoidal
characteristic.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:56.000
And it looks something like
this where the peak is given by

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
CVI, oh, I messed up.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
When I differentiated this is
missed the omega nought out

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
there.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
What I would like to do now --
This is the form of the output

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
for a step input.
What I would like to do next is

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
show you a demo.
But before I show you a demo,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
I always found it strange that
I have a step input and then I

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
have two little elements,
how can I get a sine coming out

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
of the output?
I would like to get some

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
intuition as to why things
behave the way they are.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
I could go and pray to find
out, but let me just give you

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
some very basic insight as to
why this behaves the way it

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
does.
Let me draw the circuit for you

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
here.
And this is my inductor L and

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
capacitance C.
Remember this is v.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Let me just walk you through
what is happening there and get

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
you to understand this.
Now, you have seen sines occur

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
before.
If you go and write down the

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
equation of motion of a
pendulum, you know,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
you have a pendulum,
you move it to one side,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
let go.
It is also governed by

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
sinusoidal characteristics.
And you will find that the

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
equation governing its motion is
very much of the same form,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
and you get the sinusoid where
you have energy that is sloshing

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
back and forth between maximum
potential energy to maximum

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
kinetic energy and zero
potential energy back to maximum

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
potential energy,
zero kinetic.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
So it is energy sloshing back
and forth.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
The same way here.
Capacitors and inductors store

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
energy.
Let's walk through and see what

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
happens.
I start off with both of them

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
having the stage zero,
zero current,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
zero voltage.
I apply a step here.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Boom, the step comes
instanteously to VI.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I notice that the capacitor
voltage cannot change instantly

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
unless there is an infinite
pulse of a sort,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
so this guy cannot change
instantly.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
And so its voltage starts off
being zero.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
So the entire voltage here,
KVL must be true no matter

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
what.
They are absolutely fundamental

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
principles from Maxwell's
equations.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
KVL must hold,
which means that the entire

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
voltage VI must appear across
the inductor.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
I put a big voltage across the
inductor and its current begins

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
to build up.
There you go.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
A voltage across the inductor,
its current begins to build up.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
As its current begins to build
up that current must flow

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
through the capacitor,
too.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And as current flows through a
capacitor it is depositing

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
charge into the capacitor.
As the capacitor begins to get

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
charge deposited on it,
its voltage begins to rise.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Let's see what happens here.
Its voltage keeps rising.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
At some point,
the voltage across the

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
capacitor is equal to VI.
But then VI equals this VI

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
here.
So when the two become VI,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
the inductor has zero volts
across it.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
So there is no longer a
potential difference that is

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
increasing the current in that
direction.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
At that point,
at pi divided by 2,

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
I have some current going into
the inductor so there is no

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
longer a pressure that is
forcing more current through the

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
inductor because this voltage
reaches VI.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
But remember capacitors like to
sit around holding voltages.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Just remember that demo.
That rinky-dink capacitor sat

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
there stubbornly holding its
voltage.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
And it had a huge spark towards
the end.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
It just sat there holding its
voltage.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
In the same manner,
inductors love to sit around

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
holding a current.
They will do whatever they can

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
to keep the current going
through them.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
It has got the current going
through.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And few forces on earth can
change that.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
And so therefore,
even though the capacitor

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
voltage is VI and the voltage
drop across the inductor is

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
zero, it still keeps supplying a
current.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
It has got the current.
It's got inertia.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
It keeps going.
It is like a runaway train.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
You may not be pushing the
train from the back,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
but once it is running it has
got kinetic energy and is going

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
to run no matter what for a
least some more time,

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
even if you take away the force
on the train.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So I have taken away the force
on the punching more current

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
through, but it has kinetic
energy.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
It has current flowing through
it so it continues to supply a

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
current.
Because it continues to supply

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
the current the capacitor
voltage keeps increasing.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
This is a subtle insight which
is absolutely spectacular that

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
with zero volts across it,
it still keeps pumping that

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
current.
Capacitor voltage has gone up.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
And guess what?
The voltage on this side is

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
higher now but this guy is still
pumping a current.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Man, I have been born to do
this, you know,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
I shall pump a current.
However, because the voltage

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
has now gone up here gradually
the current begins to diminish.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
So the capacitor is concerned.
You pump a current into me,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
my voltage goes up.
At some point,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
like a runaway train,
it comes to a halt.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
The current through the
capacitor drains and now goes to

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
zero and the capacitor voltage
reaches 2VI.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
So this is at 2VI now and this
is at VI.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Now the situation is not in
equilibrium.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
At this point there is zero
current through it,

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
but guess what?
I have a VI pumping in this

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
direction now.
I have the same VI punching in

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
this direction.
So guess what?

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Its current must now build up
in this direction and its

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
current begins to build up in
that direction.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
That begins to discharge the
capacitor and the capacitor then

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
goes on to a negative,
or the current goes down to a

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
maximum negative current,
and this process continues.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
What you are seeing here is
energy.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000
It is sloshing back and forth
between the two,

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
and that is kind of a key.
I will just quickly put up a

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
demo that you can watch as you
are walking out.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
With a step input,
notice the green is the voltage

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
across the capacitor and the
orange is the current through

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
the capacitor.

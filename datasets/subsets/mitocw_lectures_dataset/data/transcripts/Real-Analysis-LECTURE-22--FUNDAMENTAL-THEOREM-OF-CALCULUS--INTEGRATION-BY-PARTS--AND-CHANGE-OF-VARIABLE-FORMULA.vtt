00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:14.850 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: We'll continue
our discussion of the Riemann

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.400 align:middle line:90%
integral.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So let me just recall
a few bits of notation

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.310 align:middle line:84%
from last time and then also,
the main result that we proved

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.620 align:middle line:90%
at the end of last class.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:84%
So we had partitions,
which are just finite sets.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So here, a is less
than b, and we're

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:90%
looking at an interval ab.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Partitions, they're
just finite sets of ab.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we also had tags,
which were finite sets

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:13.490 align:middle line:84%
as well with c one between
x0 and x1, which is less than

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.100 align:middle line:84%
or equal to xi 2, which is less
than or equal to x2 and so on.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And we call these
tag partitions.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And we also had the
norm of a partition.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:90%
This is the max of--

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
so we think of
partitions as being--

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
as breaking up the interval ab
up into smaller subintervals,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:90%
x0 up to x1.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.853 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.853 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I got to get a different
piece of chalk.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.620 align:middle line:84%
This one is going
psychedelic on me.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the xi ones are just
points chosen in these smaller

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:90%
subintervals.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
The norm of a
partition is the length

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:90%
of the largest subinterval.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we had the Riemann sum
associated to a partition, tag

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:84%
partition xi, which
is the sum from j

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:84%
equals 1 to n, f xi j
xj minus xj minus 1.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
This just some notation
from last time.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:90%
And then what did we prove?

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
We proved the following
theorem, which

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
is the existence for the
Riemann integral, which

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:84%
is the following that for all
continuous functions on ab,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:84%
they exist a unique number,
which we denote integral abf

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.715 align:middle line:90%
with the property that--

00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
with the following property.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.110 align:middle line:84%
That if I take any
sequence of tag partitions

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.080 align:middle line:84%
with norm going to 0--
so this is the partitions

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:90%
are getting finer and finer.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
They're all a sequence of tag
partitions with norms going

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:17.320 align:middle line:84%
to zero, we have the associated
Riemann sums, this sequence

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:90%
converges.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is now a
sequence of real numbers,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and equals this
number, integral abf.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
No matter what sequence
of tag partitions

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I take with norms
converging to 0,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:84%
the Riemann sums converge
to this number, which we

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:90%
call the Riemann integral of f.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Net, I think the very
last thing we proved

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:84%
was that the Riemann
integral is linear.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:84%
The integral of the sum is
the sum of the integrals.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And if I multiply a continuous
function by a scalar,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:90%
then the scalar pulls out.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.780 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to discuss
some properties of the Riemann

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:90%
integral.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So the next is that in some
sense, the area of the union,

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.180 align:middle line:84%
if you like, is the
sum of the areas

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:84%
if we think of the
integral as being

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:90%
the area underneath the curve.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So this next property
is the additivity

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Riemann integral,
which states the following--

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
if f is in cab, and I take
a point between c and b,

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:84%
then the integral
from a to b of f

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the integral from
a to c of f plus the integral

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:90%
from c to b of f.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So to prove it,
again, all we know

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:84%
about these numbers is that
they satisfy this property.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll do is, we'll take
a sequence of tag partitions

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.680 align:middle line:84%
of ac converging to this
integral in a sequence of tag

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
partitions from c to b
converging to this integral

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
when I stick them
into the Riemann sums.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But then when I take the
union of those tag partitions,

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I get a partition
of ab, which will

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:90%
approach the integral of ab.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:90%
That's the basic intuition.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what was I
saying a minute ago about area

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.680 align:middle line:84%
of the union being
sum of the areas?

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Well again, like I said, if we
think of the Riemann integral

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:84%
as being the area
underneath the curve,

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:84%
then this says that
the area from a

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to b underneath the curve
is equal to the area

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
curve from a to c,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
plus the area underneath
the curve from c to b.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's take--

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
someone needs to
write notation here.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's take two partitions.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Let be a sequence
of partitions--

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:84%
so a sequence of tag
partitions, I should say--

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
of ac such that norm of
this partition goes to 0.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:84%
So this is now a
partition of ac.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll take
another sequence

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.584 align:middle line:90%
of tag partitions of cb.

00:08:41.584 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
For those watching at home
wondering what these letters

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.938 align:middle line:90%
are, that's the Greek eta.

00:09:00.938 --> 00:09:01.855 align:middle line:90%
That's the Greek zeta.

00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So we have a sequence
of partitions of ac.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:90%
These are the y and eta.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have a
sequence of partitions

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
of cb such that the norm
of these guys go to 0

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:90%
as well as r goes to infinity.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So now if I have a partition
of ac and a partition of cb,

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
if I take their union, then
I will get a partition of ab.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.505 align:middle line:84%
This will be the
union of these guys.

00:09:49.505 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy to see
that this is now

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
a sequence of tag
partitions of ab.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And moreover, so what is the
norm of this new tag partition?

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
What is the maximum length
of the subintervals?

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just going
to be the maximum

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.005 align:middle line:90%
of the norms of y and z.

00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And note that the
norm of x sub r, this

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the maximum of the
norm of yr and the norm of zr.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And since both of these
converges to zero,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the maximum of them
also converges to zero.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:24.978 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.978 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So now we just put
this all together.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So by this theorem,
what do we know?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Riemann sum
associated to this converges

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:90%
to the integral ab of f.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The Riemann sum associated to
this sequence of tag partitions

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:90%
converges to acf.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, this sequence
of Riemann sums

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:84%
associated to these tag
partitions converge to cbf.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And now we just use the fact
that taking a Riemann sum

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:90%
is additive, right?

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Since the Riemann sum associated
to this partition, which

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:84%
is just a union of these
partitions, is equal to--

00:12:48.490 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
this implies taking the
limit as r goes to infinity.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:84%
The left hand side, as I wrote
down here, converges to abf.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the right hand
side, the limit of the sum

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:90%
is the sum of the limits.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:90%
So this converges to acf.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the right thing
here converges to--

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.110 align:middle line:84%
the second thing here
converges to the integral

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:90%
from c to b of f.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So really, the fact that
the integral is additive

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:51.320 align:middle line:84%
follows from the simple fact
that Riemann sums are additive,

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that limits
respect algebraic operations.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The limit of the sum is
the sum of the limits.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
All right, so the
Riemann integral

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:90%
is additive and also linear.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So we see that the
Riemann integral

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:32.170 align:middle line:84%
is something that respects
algebraic operations

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
with respect to the real numbers
namely, adding and scalar

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.640 align:middle line:90%
multiplication.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And it respects I
guess, what you could

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:90%
say topological considerations.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Or, not really topological,
but this additive property

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:90%
is a very natural property.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:90%
What am I getting at here?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So now one could ask,
how does the integral

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:90%
interact with inequality?

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:14.187 align:middle line:84%
So this is something we ask
about all limits, right?

00:15:14.187 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Or at least limits of
sequences that we saw.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.770 align:middle line:84%
If one sequence lies
below another one,

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:90%
taking limits respects that.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that's not
true for the derivative.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I can have two functions,
one bigger than the other,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and the derivative
of the smaller one

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
be bigger than the
derivative of the first one.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But so one can ask the
question let's suppose I have

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.895 align:middle line:84%
two functions, one
smaller than the other.

00:15:42.895 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:84%
What is the-- what's
the relationship

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:90%
between the integrals?

00:15:54.490 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.010 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So suppose f and g are now two
continuous functions on ab.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So then the first
part of this theorem

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:84%
is that if for all
x and ab f of x

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to g of x,
then the integral from ab of f

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to
the integral from ab of g.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind
of understandable.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean again, if we
think of the integral

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:84%
as being a theory of the
area underneath the curve.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
If I have one function sitting
above another function,

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.900 align:middle line:84%
then the area should be bigger
than the area of the smaller

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:84%
one underneath the curve,
which sits below the first one.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And now the Riemann integral is
a limit of sums in some sense,

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and a limit of certain
sums involving f.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And what?

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So we do have this
relationship involving

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.932 align:middle line:84%
sums and absolute values with
the triangle inequality, which

00:17:34.932 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
says the absolute value
of the sum is less than

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the sum of
the absolute values.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
of the integral as

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
being essentially in a limit
of sums, or if you like,

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:84%
a continuous sum,
then you should

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.212 align:middle line:84%
expect that the absolute value
of the integral is less than

00:17:55.212 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the integral
of the absolute value.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's indeed what we have.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Second is the absolute
value of the integral

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:84%
from ab of f is less than or
equal to the integral from ab

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of the absolute value of f.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Like this is the triangle
inequality for integrals.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we'll
prove one, using again,

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
the main property we
have about Riemann

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:38.990 align:middle line:84%
integrals that they
satisfy this property.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll deduce two
directly from number one.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a sequence
of tag partitions

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.665 align:middle line:90%
with norms converging to zero.

00:19:00.665 --> 00:19:09.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Then for all r, if we take
the Riemann sum with respect

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to f of this tag partition, this
is equal to j equals 1 to n.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:90%
This is just the definition.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
r here is just indexing the
sequence of tag partitions.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I should say
this doesn't have

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:90%
to end at some single number--

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:90%
in fact, it can't--

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:84%
in common with all of
these tag partitions.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So here n of r is just the
number of partition points

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that we have in our
partition x superscript r.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And since we're assuming f of
x is less than or equal to g

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.900 align:middle line:84%
of x for all x and
ab, this is less

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to sum
from j equals 1 to n

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.615 align:middle line:90%
of r, g of cj of r.

00:20:20.615 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, and what is this last thing?

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:84%
This last thing is just equal
to the Riemann sum of g,

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
with respect to this
tag partition x and xi.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So we started off with the
Riemann sum associated to f,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.975 align:middle line:84%
and we showed that's
less than or equal to--

00:20:58.975 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:90%
just kind of summarizing here.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.250 align:middle line:84%
That this Riemann
sum is less than

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:90%
or equal to this Riemann sum.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So now if I take the limit
as r goes to infinity,

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.190 align:middle line:84%
this on the left hand side
approaches the integral

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:90%
from ab.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And since limits
respect inequalities,

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:44.195 align:middle line:84%
I get this, which is
what we wanted to prove.

00:21:44.195 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:90%
All right, and from number two--

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for number two,
we get from number one--

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we get number
two from number one,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:90%
essentially quite quickly.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So since plus or
minus f is less than

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the
absolute value of f,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:90%
we get that plus or minus--

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:84%
so integral of
plus or minus f is

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal
to the integral

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:90%
from ab of the absolute value.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Now scalar multiplication we
proved last time pulls out.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So that means plus or
minus the integral of f

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the
integral of the absolute value

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:90%
of f, which is the same as--

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:84%
so for the minus sign this
tells me this inequality.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And for the plus sign,
I get that inequality.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's equivalent to
saying that the absolute value

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:13.303 align:middle line:84%
of the integral of f is less
than or equal to the integral

00:23:13.303 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:90%
of the absolute value.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's the proof
of the theorem.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Let me make a
small remark here--

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and this will be an exercise
on the homework to prove this--

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:90%
is the following.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
We know that taking
limits respects

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:84%
inequalities but not
necessarily strict inequalities.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So I can have two
sequences, one strictly less

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:90%
than the other for all n.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And then as n goes to
infinity, their limits

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:90%
could in fact equal each other.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if I
take the first sequence

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to be 0, the second sequence
to be 1 over n, 1 over n

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:90%
is always bigger than zero.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Yet, they both converge to 0.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So taking limits does not
respect strict inequality.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
However, in this setting,
which is very nice--

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's actually an
extremely important property

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
of the integral is that
this limiting process

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that we do to take
integrals in fact does--

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
it's not just any
old limiting process.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It actually does respect
strict inequality.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.360 align:middle line:90%
So what am I saying?

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Is that we can prove something
a little bit stronger.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- which I'll say
it in its kind of reduced form

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:84%
If I take a continuous
function and it's positive,

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
then we already know
that the integral of f

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to be non-negative
by what we just proved.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.520 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the integral
of f is positive.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is also
kind of important from

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:90%
a psychological standpoint.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:84%
If we're thinking
of the integral

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
as being a theory of the
area underneath the curve.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:90%
So what this states is that--

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and again, I'm not
going to prove this.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:90%
This will be on the assignment.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:90%


00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, this coincides
with our intuition

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:84%
of what a theory of the area
underneath the curve should be.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So this says if a
continuous function

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.760 align:middle line:84%
is positive-- like the
picture I drew you--

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
then the integral, which
we interpret again,

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:84%
as the area underneath
the curve, is positive.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So that matches what
our desire for this

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:84%
to be a theory of the area
underneath the curve should be.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And so we have- if you like--

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could approve this
from basic considerations

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.560 align:middle line:84%
in what the definition
of the integral is.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But we have the
following theorem

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:90%
that for all alpha and r--

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.522 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.522 --> 00:27:04.637 align:middle line:84%
or I could just
say the following.

00:27:04.637 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe not stated this way.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:90%


00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Going a little off
script here, but it's OK.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So we actually haven't
computed a single integral yet.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's tough to
with this definition.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:84%
In a minute, we'll prove the
fundamental theorem of calculus

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and be able to do
it very easily.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But let me first prove at
least the most basic integral.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So integral from ab of the
function 1 equals b minus a.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:14.880 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.370 align:middle line:90%
So what's the proof?

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Take a sequence of partitions
with the norms converging to 0.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And we just look
at the Riemann sum.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And for one this will
be quite easy to compute

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.970 align:middle line:90%
what the Riemann sums are.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is a sequence
of partitions

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:90%
with norm converging to 0.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Then if I look at
associated Riemann sums,

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to j
equals 1 to n of r.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:84%
No matter what I--
no matter what xi is,

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I just get 1, and then times
the length of the interval,

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.280 align:middle line:90%
the subinterval.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.425 align:middle line:90%
Now this is a telescoping sum.

00:29:13.425 --> 00:29:18.680 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Meaning this is equal to x1
minus x0, plus x2, minus x1,

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:84%
plus up until xn
minus xn minus 1.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.620 align:middle line:90%
So all I pick up is--

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.490 align:middle line:90%
not x1-- but x0 and xn.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to xj of r
xn, sorry, of r minus x0 of r.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is the last
point in the partition.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
point in the partition.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And as always for partitions,
the last point is b.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.510 align:middle line:90%
The first point is a.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:90%
So this is equal to b minus a.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Now this thing on the left hand
side is equal to b minus a.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So this tells me that
the integral, which

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:84%
is equal to this
limit of Riemann sums

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:90%
is equal to b minus a.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.035 align:middle line:84%
All right, and then the
assignment for this--

00:30:29.035 --> 00:30:32.050 align:middle line:84%
or I guess, when you
see this last week,

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.960 align:middle line:84%
was to essentially,
compute the integral for--

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:90%
the integral from ab of x, dx.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we get from this theorem
and this theorem following

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:90%
bound for the area.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So let me draw a picture so
that this is not so surprising.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I have a
function from a b.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:13.080 align:middle line:90%


00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:90%
There's the function f.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.213 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.213 --> 00:31:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So that was supposed to
go through this point.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.505 align:middle line:84%
So let's make that
a little bit--

00:31:22.505 --> 00:31:32.590 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I suppose I don't
need these parts.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:44.940 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I have-- so far
a continuous function,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.618 align:middle line:84%
it always achieves a
minimum and maximum.

00:31:49.618 --> 00:31:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And at least for this picture,
the minimum occurs here.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.010 align:middle line:90%
The maximum occurs here.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the comparison
about areas from this picture?

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the area
underneath the curve of f

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.590 align:middle line:84%
will be bigger than
or equal to the area

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.430 align:middle line:84%
underneath the curve of
the constant function

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.860 align:middle line:90%
equal to little m sub f.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's just b times a times
m sub f, again, by intuition.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.878 align:middle line:84%
But this is also seen from the
theorem we just proved along

00:32:20.878 --> 00:32:22.670 align:middle line:84%
with the linearity of
the Riemann integral,

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.700 align:middle line:90%
which we've already proved.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And the integral of f, the
area underneath this curve

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:84%
is also less than or equal to
the area underneath the curve

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.445 align:middle line:90%
where f achieves a maximum.

00:32:33.445 --> 00:32:36.240 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the 12th week
of class, and I still

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:43.110 align:middle line:84%
haven't brought colored
chalk, so hopefully, that

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.050 align:middle line:84%
was clear enough without me
having to color stuff in.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:50.590 align:middle line:90%
So the theorem is the following.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:84%
If f-- again, we're working
with continuous functions

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
because that's all we can
integrate or are going

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:90%
to integrate in this section--

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and I have these two numbers,
the inf of fx, which we know

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:18.280 align:middle line:84%
is in fact, a min, meaning
there exist a point in here--

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
so in fact, I'm going to write
"min." we know that by the min,

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:middle line:84%
max theorem that for
every continuous function

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:90%
it achieves its minimum--

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:29.720 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.890 align:middle line:90%
and max.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:39.040 align:middle line:90%


00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Then, as I was
saying a minute ago,

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.620 align:middle line:84%
the area underneath
the curve little m sub

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
f, which is this
smaller square, is

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal to the area
underneath the curve of f.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:55.130 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:84%
So little m sub f
times b minus a,

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:84%
the area underneath
the minimum, is

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal to the area
underneath the curve of f,

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.679 align:middle line:84%
which is less than
or equal to the area

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
underneath the curve of the
taller line, capital M sub f.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:24.179 align:middle line:90%


00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.150 align:middle line:90%
How do we prove this?

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, we just use these
previous two theorems, right?

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:84%
Since little m sub f is less
than or equal to capital

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.560 align:middle line:90%
M sub f--

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.300 align:middle line:84%
so since little m sub f is
less than or equal to f of x,

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.500 align:middle line:84%
which is less than or
equal to capital M sub f,

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:53.800 align:middle line:84%
for all x and ab we can apply
that theorem up there to get

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that the integral of
little m sub f-- again,

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.580 align:middle line:90%
this is just a fixed number--

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.165 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to
the integral from ab of f.

00:35:04.165 --> 00:35:08.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And now again, these
are just fixed numbers.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So by what we proved here that
the integral from a to b of 1

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.920 align:middle line:84%
is b minus a, the
fact that scalers

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
pull out-- so this number
here can come out--

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and this is just m sub f times
the integral from ab of one.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is little m
sub f times b minus a.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:38.665 align:middle line:84%
Over here, this is capital
M sub f times b minus a.

00:35:38.665 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's the proof.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:50.730 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So now let me make
a few comments

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:58.675 align:middle line:90%
about some conventions, really.

00:35:58.675 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:90%


00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.520 align:middle line:90%
So we've been talking about--

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.770 align:middle line:84%
or at least, I've been talking
about, you're not here.

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So we haven't been
talking at all.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So we've been talking
about the integral from ab

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:21.550 align:middle line:84%
to f when a is less than
b, But I'm going to use--

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to set
down some convention,

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.520 align:middle line:84%
or you could say this
is really notation.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.195 align:middle line:90%
When I have this--

00:36:35.195 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:43.130 align:middle line:84%
when I write down this symbol,
integral a to a of f, this

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.830 align:middle line:84%
is really just another
way of writing 0.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And another is that if,
in fact, b is less than a,

00:36:54.250 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:90%
then the integral from ab to f--

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.650 align:middle line:84%
so remember, we've been talking
about the integrals from--

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:09.170 align:middle line:84%
over intervals-- or where
the number on the bottom

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.720 align:middle line:84%
is less than the
number on the top,

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:84%
so whenever I write this
symbol with the bigger

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:84%
number on the bottom and the
smaller number on the top,

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:26.630 align:middle line:84%
you should read this as
minus the integral of,

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:31.010 align:middle line:84%
with this being in
the right place,

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.790 align:middle line:84%
meaning this number here is
less than this number here.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:41.480 align:middle line:84%
OK and so again, these
are really just notations,

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that if I write this, this
is a fancy way of writing 0.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:49.610 align:middle line:84%
When I write this, this
means minus the integral

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.760 align:middle line:84%
with the right numbers
on top and bottom,

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.120 align:middle line:84%
meaning the smaller numbers
on the bottom, the bigger

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.915 align:middle line:90%
numbers on the top.

00:37:56.915 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:90%
So maybe you ask-- so this is--

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.730 align:middle line:90%
so why do I define that to be 0.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you like, 1 is
consistent with the fact

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:84%
that for all
continuous functions,

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:31.225 align:middle line:84%
if I take the integral from
a to b with b bigger than a,

00:38:31.225 --> 00:38:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and I take the limit as b
goes to a, this equals 0.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.660 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.073 align:middle line:84%
And two is then consistent with
number one and then additivity.

00:38:42.073 --> 00:38:59.600 align:middle line:90%


00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.990 align:middle line:84%
With additivity in number one,
because then by number one,

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:04.790 align:middle line:90%
I get that the--

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:08.120 align:middle line:84%
so additivity will tell me that
the integral from a to a of f

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the
integral from ab to f,

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:16.580 align:middle line:84%
plus the integral from baf,
here assuming b is less than a.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So if by 1 this is 0, then to
be consistent with additivity,

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.970 align:middle line:84%
this would force
the integral from ab

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:84%
to f to be minus the
integral from ba of f.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So both of these
conventions, if you like,

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:47.010 align:middle line:84%
are consistent with the
properties of the Riemann

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.040 align:middle line:84%
integral, namely
that the limit as b

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:84%
goes to a of the area
underneath this curve,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.180 align:middle line:84%
as the base gets smaller
and smaller is 0.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And then from--
if I assume this,

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.060 align:middle line:84%
then additivity tells me
that the integral from ab

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.430 align:middle line:84%
has to be minus the
integral from b to a of f.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.945 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now we computed
successfully one integral.

00:40:23.945 --> 00:40:26.560 align:middle line:90%


00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when you took
calculus, that was not all

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.750 align:middle line:90%
you could do.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Calculus is what it is because
of the hero of the story, which

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.580 align:middle line:84%
is Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus,

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.830 align:middle line:90%
which is what we'll prove now.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
which states following.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:01.150 align:middle line:90%
If I have a function big F--

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:07.075 align:middle line:84%
so first off, let little
f be continuous function.

00:41:07.075 --> 00:41:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So the first
statement is basically

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:90%
how to compute integrals.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:27.670 align:middle line:84%
If capital F
integral from ab to r

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:40.960 align:middle line:84%
is differentiable everywhere on
ab and f prime equals little f,

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.110 align:middle line:84%
then the integral
from ab of little f

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:90%
equals f of b minus f of a.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.350 align:middle line:90%


00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Another way of saying
this is that the integral

00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:01.500 align:middle line:84%
from ab of capital F prime is
equal to f of b minus f of a.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:05.430 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
part-- so the first part

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.840 align:middle line:90%
is about computing integrals.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The second part is about
solving differential equations,

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.540 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So the function g of x equals
the integral from a to x of f.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So for each x and ab, I stick
it in as the upper limit

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:48.880 align:middle line:90%
on this integral.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.430 align:middle line:84%
This function is
differentiable on ab.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:43:01.380 align:middle line:90%


00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And it satisfies the
simplest differential

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:12.065 align:middle line:84%
equation, which is g prime
equals f, and g of a equals 0.

00:43:12.065 --> 00:43:18.040 align:middle line:90%


00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
Fundamental Theorem

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.760 align:middle line:84%
of Calculus, the first
part being about how do you

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.000 align:middle line:84%
compute integrals, the second,
how do you compute solutions

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.680 align:middle line:90%
to a differential equation.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Namely, how do I find the
solution to the problem

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.110 align:middle line:90%
g prime equals little f.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.430 align:middle line:90%
So little f is the given.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to find a function g that
satisfies g prime equals little

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.840 align:middle line:84%
f with initial condition
capital G of a equals 0.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.080 align:middle line:84%
That's given by this function
here where I take little left

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.630 align:middle line:90%
and I integrate it from a to x.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I interpret
the Fundamental Theorem

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.350 align:middle line:84%
of Calculus, the first
about solving integrals,

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:56.890 align:middle line:84%
the second about solving
differential equations.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:03.500 align:middle line:90%


00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:84%
All right so this is
the hero of calculus,

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.900 align:middle line:90%
the Batman of the story.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said at one point
that the Mean Value Theorem

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:90%
is the Alfred of this story.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it should
play a decisive role

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:27.555 align:middle line:90%
in proving this theorem.

00:44:27.555 --> 00:44:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:34.910 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:48.280 align:middle line:90%


00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
connect these two things.

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So in order to even
get at this guy,

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.950 align:middle line:84%
we have to take a partition,
a sequence of partitions

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.260 align:middle line:84%
converging with norm
converging to 0.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.750 align:middle line:90%
So and then see what we get.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:07.920 align:middle line:90%
So this is the proof part one.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:16.520 align:middle line:90%


00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a sequence
of tag partitions--

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I keep forgetting to write
tag and say the word tag,

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:32.290 align:middle line:84%
but you should hear that
even though I don't say it--

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:33.445 align:middle line:90%
with norm.

00:45:33.445 --> 00:45:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we're
not even going to--

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.210 align:middle line:90%
this is correct.

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:46.297 align:middle line:90%


00:45:46.297 --> 00:45:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually going to come
up with the tags in a minute.

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's first take a
sequence of partition.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually
completely correct.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So no tags yet, no
points chosen in between,

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:02.540 align:middle line:90%
with Norm converging to 0.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to choose
a special tag for each r

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:12.680 align:middle line:84%
so that in the limit I get this
equality between the integral

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
of f and capital F of b
minus f, capital F of a.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.210 align:middle line:90%


00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So here comes Alfred by
the Mean Value Theorem.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have this subinterval
x of j minus 1 and x sub j.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So by the Mean Value
Theorem, there exist--

00:46:46.780 --> 00:47:05.740 align:middle line:84%
for each j there exists a
point in between these two guys

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:17.660 align:middle line:84%
such that if I take f
of x sub j r minus f--

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.640 align:middle line:84%
so capital F, remember,
is this function

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that's differential and whose
derivative gives me little f--

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:28.482 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.482 --> 00:47:32.170 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to
capital F prime of xi j

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:37.795 align:middle line:90%
of r times xj minus xj minus 1.

00:47:37.795 --> 00:47:40.520 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And by assumption, the
derivative of capital F

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.560 align:middle line:90%
is equal to little f, right?

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to replace
this f prime with little f.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:56.010 align:middle line:90%


00:47:56.010 --> 00:48:01.005 align:middle line:84%
So now these xi's I will take
as my tag, my sequence of tags.

00:48:01.005 --> 00:48:05.040 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Put a star by this
relation here.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:18.080 align:middle line:90%
What do we conclude?

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:24.920 align:middle line:84%
If I look at the Riemann
sum for f associated

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to now this sequence of
tags, where now the xi's are

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:41.340 align:middle line:84%
exactly these xi's that
satisfy this relation.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.460 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to as
before, sum from j

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:51.090 align:middle line:90%
equals 1 to nr f of xg xi sub j.

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.810 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Now by how these xi's
were chosen-- remember,

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:02.340 align:middle line:84%
they were chosen to satisfy
this relation here, star

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:03.520 align:middle line:90%
by the Mean Value Theorem.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to the sum
from j equals 1 two n sub

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:15.600 align:middle line:84%
r, f of x sub j minus
f of x sub j minus 1.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.700 align:middle line:90%


00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
a telescoping sum.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And so all I pick up is when j
equals n of r, the last point.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And when j equals 0-- so this
is equal to f of the last point

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.525 align:middle line:90%
minus f of the first point.

00:49:40.525 --> 00:49:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Now for partition,
this is always b.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:49.150 align:middle line:90%
And this is always a.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:53.470 align:middle line:90%
So this is f of b minus f of a.

00:49:53.470 --> 00:50:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So every one of these Riemann
sums for this sequence of tag

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.650 align:middle line:84%
partitions gives me
f of b minus f of a

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So then I get to take the
limit, and I get the integral.

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
integral from ab to f,

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:21.640 align:middle line:84%
which is limited as r goes to
infinity of s of f equals--

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and we just computed
this is always

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:90%
equal to f of b minus f of a.

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.360 align:middle line:84%
We took a sequence
of-- just a recap--

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.650 align:middle line:84%
we took a sequence of partitions
with norms converging to 0.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And we chose special tags
using the Mean Value Theorem.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So by the Mean Value
Theorem, on each one

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:54.580 align:middle line:84%
of these subintervals capital F
evaluated at the right endpoint

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.310 align:middle line:84%
minus f evaluated
at the left endpoint

00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is equal to f, which is
the derivative of capital

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.550 align:middle line:84%
F evaluated at some
point in between times

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:90%
the length of the interval.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So now if we take the
Riemann sum associated

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:11.620 align:middle line:84%
to this sequence
of tag partitions

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:16.670 align:middle line:84%
where these xi's are
defined by this condition,

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:19.670 align:middle line:84%
then we can actually
compute this Riemann sum,

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and it just gives me f of
b minus f of a no matter

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.870 align:middle line:90%
what r is.

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So then when I take the
limit as r goes to infinity,

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.530 align:middle line:84%
the left side goes
to the integral,

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:34.670 align:middle line:84%
but it's always equal to
capital F of b minus f of a.

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:35.930 align:middle line:90%
So that proves number one.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So for number two, what
do we want to show?

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:00.460 align:middle line:90%
We want to show this function.

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So first off, it's
by convention g

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:09.570 align:middle line:84%
of a, which is the integral
from a to a of f, this is zero.

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have to check
the second condition.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I just need to check that this
function is differentiable,

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and the derivative of
that function is little f.

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:22.420 align:middle line:90%


00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Let c be in ab.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.820 align:middle line:90%
So what do we want to show?

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.090 align:middle line:84%
We want to show the
derivative of capital

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:35.130 align:middle line:90%
G is equal to little f.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So we would like to show
that the limit as x goes

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:47.150 align:middle line:84%
to c of the integral from a to
x of f minus integral from a

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:52.430 align:middle line:84%
to c of f, over x minus c, which
is just g of x minus g of c,

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.380 align:middle line:90%
equals f of c.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:00.280 align:middle line:90%


00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:04.270 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to do
this by the books--

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:05.770 align:middle line:90%
by the book, I guess.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:08.280 align:middle line:90%


00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.758 align:middle line:84%
When I say-- so that's
kind of a bad pun, I guess.

00:53:11.758 --> 00:53:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But meaning, an epsilon
delta proof for this limit.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:21.730 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:26.320 align:middle line:84%
The Delta that we pick
in the end depends on--

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and we'll use crucially the
fact that f is continuous at c.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:37.180 align:middle line:90%


00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So since f is
continuous at c, there

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:53.850 align:middle line:84%
exists a delta 0
positive such that what?

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:57.780 align:middle line:84%
t minus c less than
delta 0 implies

00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that f of t minus f of
c is less than epsilon--

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.600 align:middle line:84%
let's give ourselves a
little room-- over 2.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.670 align:middle line:90%


00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Choose delta to be this delta 0.

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we have to
show for every epsilon,

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.730 align:middle line:84%
there exists a delta so that if
x minus c is less than delta,

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:24.200 align:middle line:84%
then this minus this in absolute
value is less than epsilon.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm now saying, choose
delta to be this delta 0

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:34.610 align:middle line:84%
where this delta 0 is
ensuring this right here.

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:37.700 align:middle line:84%
OK as long as t minus
C is less than delta 0.

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.550 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Now because of sign
conventions, we'll do two cases.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So not really, I'm just
going to do one case.

00:54:51.710 --> 00:55:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that x is
between c and c plus delta.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.500 align:middle line:90%
So we want to also show--

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.870 align:middle line:84%
we'll also need to be
able to do the case that x

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:12.330 align:middle line:90%
is between c minus delta and c.

00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:16.170 align:middle line:84%
That would cover the whole
range of the absolute value

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.993 align:middle line:84%
of x minus c is less than
delta but bigger than zero.

00:55:19.993 --> 00:55:21.285 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to do this case.

00:55:21.285 --> 00:55:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So now we want to show
that if x is in here,

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.550 align:middle line:84%
then this thing minus this
thing in absolute value

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:34.425 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

00:55:34.425 --> 00:55:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So first off, I
would like to note

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that if t is in this interval
c to x, then that tells me

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:59.070 align:middle line:84%
that the absolute value of
t minus c, which is equal

00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:05.140 align:middle line:84%
just t minus c, this is less
than or equal to x minus c,

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:07.240 align:middle line:90%
which is less than delta.

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And remember, this equals
delta 0, all right?

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So as long as I'm in
this interval here,

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.560 align:middle line:84%
the absolute value of t
minus c is less than delta 0.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So let me just draw a picture
so that this is pretty clear.

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:25.360 align:middle line:90%
This length is delta.

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:31.210 align:middle line:84%
If I take any t in between,
then this distance from t to c

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.297 align:middle line:84%
is also going to
be less than delta.

00:56:33.297 --> 00:56:34.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's all I've written down.

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:41.440 align:middle line:90%


00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Thus, by now compute
the difference quotient

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.530 align:middle line:90%
minus the proposed limit.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:57:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So looking at 1 over x minus
c times the integral minus

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:10.600 align:middle line:84%
the integral from ac
of f minus f of c.

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing I want to
show is less than epsilon.

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Now by additivity, the integral
from a to x since x is--

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:19.810 align:middle line:84%
well, the integral
from a to x of f

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:23.560 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the integral
from a to c plus the integral

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.060 align:middle line:90%
from c to x.

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to 1
over x minus c integral

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:34.930 align:middle line:90%
from c to x of f minus fc.

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:40.130 align:middle line:90%


00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:43.175 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is just
a fixed number.

00:57:43.175 --> 00:57:45.730 align:middle line:90%


00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I'm going
to do a little trick.

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Minus the integral from--

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.680 align:middle line:90%
so in fact, let me do this.

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me throw in some
integration variables

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:05.420 align:middle line:90%
so that this becomes clearer.

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is f of t, dt minus
integral of f of t, dt.

00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been using
the notation where

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I just don't write down
the integration variable,

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:19.880 align:middle line:90%
but let me do that here.

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.910 align:middle line:90%
F of t, dt minus f of c.

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:30.820 align:middle line:90%


00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Now this is equal to minus f
of c over x minus c integral

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:43.400 align:middle line:90%
from c to x of 1 dt.

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Because the integral from
c to x of the constant 1

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:47.630 align:middle line:90%
gives me x minus c.

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:49.170 align:middle line:90%
That cancels with this guy.

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Now f of c is just a number.

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:52.320 align:middle line:90%
It's just a fixed number.

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So I can bring this
inside the integral.

00:58:55.110 --> 00:59:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And then use the linearity
of the integral to in fact,

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:03.800 align:middle line:84%
rewrite all of this as 1
over the absolute value

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:12.845 align:middle line:84%
of x minus c integral from c
to x of f of t minus f of c,

00:59:12.845 --> 00:59:16.235 align:middle line:90%
dt in absolute value.

00:59:16.235 --> 00:59:20.220 align:middle line:90%


00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Now 1 over x minus
c, this is positive

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.380 align:middle line:90%
because x is bigger than c.

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So I can pull this
out just like that.

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:31.110 align:middle line:90%


00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:32.090 align:middle line:90%
And now what do I know?

00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:39.860 align:middle line:84%
For t in between this c and x,
the absolute value of t minus c

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.290 align:middle line:90%
is less than delta 0, right?

00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So by what I have here, as long
as I'm in this interval cx,

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:54.625 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
this inequality hold.

00:59:54.625 --> 00:59:57.950 align:middle line:90%


00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So before I do that, let
me first apply the triangle

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:03.410 align:middle line:90%
inequality for integrals.

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:05.480 align:middle line:84%
This is less than or equal
to the integral from c

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.050 align:middle line:90%
to x of f of t minus f of c.

01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:13.340 align:middle line:90%


01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So by the second thing
that I've underlined,

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:19.400 align:middle line:84%
for t in this interval
c to x, this thing

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:23.720 align:middle line:84%
here is always less
than epsilon over 2.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So by what we know about
integrals respecting

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:30.610 align:middle line:84%
inequalities, this is
going to be less than

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 1 over integral
x minus c, integral c

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.000 align:middle line:90%
to x, epsilon over 2 dt.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.570 align:middle line:90%


01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:41.430 align:middle line:90%
And now this is just equal to--

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.600 align:middle line:90%
so this is a number.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.650 align:middle line:90%
It comes out.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So I get 1 integral
from c to x of 1.

01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So I get x minus c
times the integral of 1.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So x minus c, and that
cancels, less than epsilon.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.750 align:middle line:90%


01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And this was for x between
c and c plus delta.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.880 align:middle line:84%
The argument for c between
c and c minus delta

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.260 align:middle line:84%
is essentially the same,
just with minor sign changes.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:24.540 align:middle line:90%


01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, c minus
delta less than c

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
implies that the
integral from a to x

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
of f minus integral a to c of
f over x minus c minus f of c

01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:48.390 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So we've done x between c minus
delta and c, x between c and c

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:59.140 align:middle line:84%
plus delta, which
implies that if--

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:04.770 align:middle line:90%


01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:20.310 align:middle line:84%
then, which is what
we wanted to prove.

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:31.990 align:middle line:90%


01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:41.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we've concluded the proof
of the Batman of the story.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And this gives us not only a
way of computing integrals,

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
but useful way of, if you
like, shifting the burden

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
or shifting the
blame whenever we

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
do compute the integrals
of certain products.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm talking
about is the integration

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
by parts, which I
can't remember if I

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:07.030 align:middle line:90%
said it was first or second.

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I think he was second.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
First most useful
thing from analysis

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
is the triangle inequality,
the second being integration

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:17.250 align:middle line:90%
by parts.

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And a close third being the
Cauchy-Schwartz inequality,

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:24.460 align:middle line:84%
which in conjunction with
integration by parts is quite

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:24.960 align:middle line:90%
a--

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.800 align:middle line:90%


01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
most current research papers
are based on these two things

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and using them in
a very clever way.

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So integration by
parts is suppose f

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and g are continuously
differentiable,

01:03:57.050 --> 01:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
what that means is that the
derivatives exists on ab,

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and they're also continuous.

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:07.815 align:middle line:84%
So if you hear me
say continuously

01:04:07.815 --> 01:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
differentiable in
the future that

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:12.310 align:middle line:84%
means that the function has a
derivative that's continuous.

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:15.920 align:middle line:90%


01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Then the integral from
ab of f prime times

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
g-- so the one with the
burden, because remember,

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
differentiablity is
kind of a miracle.

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So miracles always come
with some sort of burden.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to f
of b times g of b

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
minus f of a times g of a
minus the integral from a to b.

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And now we shift that
burden to g times g prime.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:50.880 align:middle line:90%


01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So let me put a parentheses
around that so you can--

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- let's do it
this way, g prime f.

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I can take that
derivative and put it on g.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680 align:middle line:90%
And what's the proof?

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The proof is just the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:06.810 align:middle line:90%
and the product rule.

01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:11.820 align:middle line:90%


01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Since the derivative
of f times g

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:21.900 align:middle line:84%
is equal to f prime times
g plus g prime times f,

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.850 align:middle line:84%
we get by the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:29.530 align:middle line:84%
the integral from ab of,
let's say the right hand side,

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
so this is f prime
g plus g prime f

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:40.990 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the integral from
a to b of f times g prime,

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:45.840 align:middle line:84%
so by Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And now the integral
of the derivative

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
is the function evaluated
at the endpoint.

01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's f of b times g of
b minus f of a times g of a.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:14.040 align:middle line:90%


01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's integration
by parts, which

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
is a consequence of
the product rule.

01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:29.520 align:middle line:90%


01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
the quotient rule is something--
is just really the product

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.750 align:middle line:90%
rule in disguise kind of.

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So we don't get really
anything new from there.

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:38.910 align:middle line:90%


01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But we also remember,
have the chain

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:47.670 align:middle line:84%
rule, which then results in the
change of variables formula.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So theorem-- let b from ab to cd
be continuously differentiable.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So this means the
function is continuous,

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and its derivative
is also continuous.

01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:24.040 align:middle line:90%


01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
With the property that the
derivative is positive on ab.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.922 align:middle line:90%
b of a equals c.

01:07:36.922 --> 01:07:41.110 align:middle line:90%
b of b equals d.

01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:42.160 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to see that a.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:48.070 align:middle line:90%


01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of phi as being
a change of variables from cd

01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:52.450 align:middle line:90%
to ab.

01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:55.140 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Then the integral
from c to d of f of u,

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
du is equal to the
integral from a

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
to b of f of phi of
x, phi prime of x, dx.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So maybe instead of
change of variables--

01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:28.115 align:middle line:84%
so this is change
of variables, a.k.a.

01:08:28.115 --> 01:08:32.270 align:middle line:90%


01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:37.069 align:middle line:84%
u substitution, where you
said u equal to phi of x,

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:42.029 align:middle line:84%
then du is equal to
phi prime of x dx.

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
proof of this just

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.580 align:middle line:84%
follows from the
Fundamental Theorem

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:55.850 align:middle line:84%
of Calculus and the
chain rule that we know.

01:08:55.850 --> 01:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So let f be a function
from ab to r such that

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.640 align:middle line:90%
f prime equals little f.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
We can always find
one by the second part

01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:11.990 align:middle line:84%
of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus.

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:15.439 align:middle line:84%
We can always solve this
differential equation up

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:18.290 align:middle line:90%
to a constant.

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:25.479 align:middle line:84%
Then if I look at the
function f of phi of x,

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and I take its derivative with
respect to x by the chain rule,

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.609 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to f
prime of phi of x

01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:36.910 align:middle line:84%
times phi prime
of x, which equals

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:41.350 align:middle line:90%
f of phi of x, phi prime of x.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:44.010 align:middle line:90%


01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So then when I integrate that,
integral from ab, phi of x--

01:09:55.700 --> 01:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
f of phi of x phi
prime of x dx, this

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:15.150 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the integral from
ab of f of phi of x prime dx.

01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Now by part one of the
Fundamental Theorem

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.620 align:middle line:90%
of Calculus, this is equal to--

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.540 align:middle line:84%
the integral of the
derivative is this thing

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.900 align:middle line:90%
evaluated at the endpoint.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So f of phi of b
minus f of phi of a.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to f of d
minus f of c because phi of b

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:43.430 align:middle line:84%
equals d, phi of a equals
c, and phi of b equals d.

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:46.010 align:middle line:84%
But again, by the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.810 align:middle line:90%
since capital F is--

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
when you differentiate,
it gives me little f,

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to the integral
from c to d of f prime of u du,

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:06.790 align:middle line:90%
which is equal to f of u du.

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, so we just applied the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.800 align:middle line:90%
really, three times, OK?

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
First to find a function
whose derivative is little f.

01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Then we used the
chain rule to conclude

01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that the derivative
of capital F of phi

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
equals this thing, which is
the thing we're integrating

01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:23.957 align:middle line:90%
on the right hand side.

01:11:23.957 --> 01:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So then when we
integrate that, that's

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.740 align:middle line:84%
equal to the integral
of a derivative.

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we just
pick up the endpoints,

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:32.690 align:middle line:90%
f of d minus f of c.

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But because capital
F is equal to--

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
is an anti-derivative
of little f,

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's
derivative is little f,

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:44.700 align:middle line:84%
this number here is also
equal to this integral here,

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.110 align:middle line:90%
which is this guy.

01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And so then we get the
change of variables formula.

01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:53.318 align:middle line:90%
So I think we'll stop there.

01:11:53.318 --> 01:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And next time, we'll
do a quick application

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:59.910 align:middle line:84%
of the second most
useful thing on Earth,

01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:03.180 align:middle line:90%
which is integration by parts.

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll move on to
sequences of functions.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:13.000 align:middle line:90%

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.740
PROFESSOR: Let's do
it biogeometrically.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.140
There's a nice geometric
interpretation to this thing.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.105
So it comes from thinking
of this in phase space.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.426
So this is motion
in the x, p plain.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.310
So let's think of the
motion of this oscillator

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.100
in the x, p plane.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.810
Here, we have that the energy is
equal to p squared over 2m plus

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.220
1/2 m omega squared x squared.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.980
So this is an ellipse in the x--

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.560
a closed orbit.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:12.000
A constant omega solution
is an ellipse in this plane.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.150
That's because it's
some something squared

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.790
plus something squared
with different coefficient.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.590
So here it is.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.520
It's some sort of
ellipse like that.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.400
Semi-major axis,
semi-minor axis.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.310
I actually don't know which is
the major and which is a minor.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.020
But two semi axes.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.180
Well when p is equal to 0, what
is the value of x defines this.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.680
So a is the value of x when p0--

00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:00.060
so it's 2 square root of
2E over m omega squared.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.280
And b is the value of
p when x is equal to 0.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.970
So it's just square root of 2mE.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.270
And here is the particle doing
this motion in this orbit.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.090
As time goes by,
the position x goes

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.500
from a maximum to a minimum and
return with the momentum going

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.050
like that.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.480
It's a nice representation
of the physical motion

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.730
as moving on the ellipse.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.250
That's what this
system is doing.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.820
So you could ask, when you
have something like that,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.950
you would ask, OK,
you have an ellipse,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.370
what's the area of the ellipse?

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.650
Area is pi ab.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.310
That's the formula for
the area from an ellipse.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.270
Pi times the product of the
semi-major and semi-minor axes.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.910
That clearly generalizes
correctly to a circle.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.920
And it's the right formula.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.860
And then when we multiply
it, look what happens.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.920
There is-- do I have--

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.760
yeah, I think I have
everything here--

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.854
pi ab-- I get 2 pi.

00:03:32.854 --> 00:03:34.640
The m's cancel.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.870
The E's don't cancel.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.010
E over omega, hey, that's
our adiabatic invariant.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.640
2 pi E over omega,
the area of this thing

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.550
is our adiabatic invariant.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.230
That's a very nice
classical picture.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.520
You have motion in phase space.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.880
And as omega changes, maybe
the ellipse will change.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.570
But the area tends
to keep constant.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.950
That's what's happening.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.420
That's a statement of this
result. So that's nice.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.735
It also can be written as a
formula, which is kind of neat.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.900
So the area of the
ellipse is this.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:38.350
But the area of the
ellipse, it can also

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.550
be written in a
slightly different way.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.805
Let's assume the orbit is
going like this, for example.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.110
The motion is going like that.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.940
And then, what is the
area of the ellipse?

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:19.830
The area of this top part
is the integral of pdx,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.300
is the integral of the top part.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.430
But we'll write it,
that's just the top.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.870
But if I think of
this as an integral

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.800
over the whole
counter, I would be

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.990
having the whole
integral of pdx like that

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.950
into over the whole counter.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.150
I integrate here and I
get the area of the top.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.210
And when they
integrate down here,

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.570
I'm having the x's
that are negative

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.820
and p's that are negative.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.520
So I'm getting the area
of the bottom part.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.750
So actually this
full counter integral

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.960
over the whole boundary gives
you the full area of the thing.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.940
The top area in one part, the
bottom area in the bottom part.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.700
So that's the area
of the ellipse.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:27.310
So we get the idea that
the integral of pdx

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.770
is roughly equal to
2 pi E over omega.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:41.370
That's exactly equal when the
system is time independent.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.250
But then if it's not
time independent,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.560
this is an equation that can
help us think of this system

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.710
and identify an
adiabatic invariant,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.520
because we identify
this quantity

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.800
as an adiabatic invariant.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.040
The more general statement
in classical mechanics

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.790
is that this kind of integral
is an adiabatic invariant.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.560
So in classical
mechanics, people

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.200
search from adiabatic invariants
by integrals over phase space.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.570
It's a nice way
to think of them.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.780
But let's go quantum mechanical.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.950
It's the analogies that
we mentioned before.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.880
Let's use them.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:45.260
So here we go.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.290
We've said a little about this.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.670
And we'll say a bit more.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:58.910
So for quantum mechanics,
what do we have?

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.670
Well, we had the oscillator.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.020
We mentioned it.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:11.040
And we said that E over omega
was h bar omega occupation

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:18.315
number plus 1/2 over omega
and is therefore h n plus 1/2.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:30.900
So in quantum mechanics,
the adiabatic invariant

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.720
becomes a quantum number.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.070
And the adiabatic theorem
in quantum mechanics

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:43.230
is essentially going to say that
if you have quantum numbers,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:48.120
you are almost guaranteed, if
the system is slowly varying,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.180
to remain in that quantum state.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:58.340
We're going to try to make that
clearer, but that's the spirit.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.728
Quantum numbers don't change
under adiabatic approximation.

00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:09.860
Quantum numbers don't change.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.550
So in some sense, this whole
story was developed today.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.500
The classical
intuition, maybe it's

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.880
a little less obvious, is
integrals over phase space,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.730
a trajectory in phase space of
a particle conserves the area.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.120
And here, in quantum
mechanics is the idea

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.340
that if you have
a quantum number,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.280
you're going to find
it difficult to have

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.080
a change in quantum numbers.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.930
But that's all we've
been doing with time

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.170
dependent perturbation theory,
change of quantum number.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:54.140
So we'll think a little bit
about it why that happened.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.110
Now, there's more here
that is interesting.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.970
You remember your
WKB approximation.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.260
You did the quantization
when you had a system,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.140
say, with two turning
points, a and b.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.290
Bohr-Summerfeld
quantization, remember

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.800
you assume there's a decaying
thing here, therefore

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.950
a cosine in the middle
with a pi over 4,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.190
a decaying, another
close n with a pi over 4.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.690
And the compatibility gave you
the quantization condition.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.380
Now, what was that
quantization condition?

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:42.650
It was 1 over h bar integral
of the local momentum px a/b

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.760
equals n plus 1/2 pi.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:56.790
So if you multiply
by 2 this integral,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.110
that is the full integral
over the back and forth

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:13.750
of p of x dx is equal to
2 pi h bar n plus 1/2.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.890
That formula, if you remember,
gave the oscillator exactly.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:27.050
But look how nice
you see the intuition

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:32.150
that this quantity of classical
mechanics that we said

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.550
is the idea adiabatic
invariant also

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.600
shows in semi-classical
quantization telling you

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.450
that that quantity,
yes, doesn't want

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:47.340
to change because, in fact, it
represents a quantum number.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:53.450
So the WKB approximation is
also reinforcing the idea

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:59.060
that first this quantity,
this integral over phase space

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.030
is an adiabatic
invariant and second

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.420
that it represents a
quantum number that

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.440
doesn't want to change.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.900
Let me make one last
comment before we

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:21.990
start a real calculation in
quantum mechanics about this.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:27.740
Transitions, we
studied transitions.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.960
And transitions are
the kind of things

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:35.330
that don't happen
easily when you have

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.740
an adiabatic approximation.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.860
So what did we have
for transitions?

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.980
For transitions, we
had the probability

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.820
to go from some initial
to some final state

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.680
was the integral from
0 to t e to the i omega

00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:06.250
f i t prime delta h of t prime
f i over i h bar v t prime.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.510
Assume you have a
constant perturbation.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.750
So you can take this quantity
out of the integral, delta h

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:33.520
f i of t prime squared
over h squared.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:40.505
And you get this integral of
e to the i omega f i t prime.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.370
And that integral
can roughly be done.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.430
And you've done it a few times--

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:55.305
f i t minus 1 over
omega f i squared.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.680
So this is what we got for
a constant perturbation.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.080
And a constant
perturbation finds

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.170
it hard to induce energy
jumping transition.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:16.530
So if you have a
discrete system,

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:21.690
making that transition is
hard, because however time you

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.380
let go, this quantity is--

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.880
maybe there's a square here.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.710
Yes, there's a square--

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.830
this quantity is
bounded in time.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.890
This doesn't grow beyond
the particular quantity.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.530
But here you have a suppression
because the energies

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.300
are different.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.030
And if the energies
are fairly different,

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.542
this is very suppressed.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.910
The way our calculation
escape that,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.430
we'd said, oh, if
you have a continuum

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.070
behind these
discrete states, then

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.770
you can make a
transition because you

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:04.320
don't have to have a
large change of energy.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:11.220
So our transitions
are things that

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.410
illustrate a little
bit what we're

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:18.090
getting to that it's difficult
to change energy levels

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.910
for slowly varying processes.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:27.810
In fact, if this Hamiltonian
was not exactly a time constant,

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.770
it's still difficult to bank a
transition, because, you know,

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:36.420
if it varies slowly, this
is still roughly true.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.730
Over some period of time,
you could say, well,

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.440
it's the average value.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.160
In order to get an efficient
transition between two energy

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.370
levels, you had to
put the Hamiltonian--

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:52.050
a cosine of omega t at
the right frequency.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.050
And then you induce
the transition.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:59.070
But slowly varying
Hamiltonian finds

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:03.840
it difficult to
induce transitions.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:13.270
All right, so this is the end of
our introduction to the subject

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.240
of adiabatic evolution.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.180
And now we're going
to try to calculate

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.210
how a quantum state changes
under adiabatic evolution.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:29.244
PROFESSOR: Otherwise
class announcements.

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:31.160
Sprint task lists due
today, hopefully you all

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.412
turned them in.

00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:34.370
Paulina's going to check
that out and make sure

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.392
that each team has a new
sprint task list turned in.

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:39.100
We're asking for one
of those once a week

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.240
because we want to know
the state of your game

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.000
as it is right now.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.190
A lot of it is for our use to
track where your game is going

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.590
and how your game is going.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.320
The actual format you're
using isn't as important to us

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.220
for this last project.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.350
Again, if you're using
a non-standard format,

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.315
once we get to the next product
backlog presentation-- which

00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:01.840
I believe is next week, I
could be wrong about that, it's

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.519
in Stellar-- we'll be asking
about your project management

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.070
process, what you've been
using, how it's been working,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.245
what changes you've made,
stuff like that to know

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:11.870
how you're tracking what you're
doing and when you're doing it.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.300
Yeah, so today.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.990
I've got another minute.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.640
Today we're going to talk
about story in video games,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.348
then you have time to
work on your class,

00:01:24.348 --> 00:01:26.800
and then at 3:00 PM Ed
Barrett's class is coming in.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.221
We've got 18 folks coming
in to play test your games.

00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:31.720
Remember, we did
require you to have

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.620
a playable digital build today.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.810
Please test that build.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.400
If that bill does not
get you the test data

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.522
you need, also test another one.

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:42.980
So if you have a paper prototype
and you want to test that,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.180
you can test that concurrently.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.941
Again, just like before,
having three workstations open

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.190
at each team would be awesome.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.990
It means everybody gets to play
the games quickly and get out

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.390
quickly so that you can
then finish up working.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.690
You don't need to test
each other's games.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.067
So actually allow our
guests to test games first

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:04.150
before you start testing
each other's games today.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.990
Any questions about
procedures and whatnot?

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.680
All right, so we're going to
talk about stories in games.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.890
This is a lecture
that I've adapted

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.780
from a previous colleague of
ours, Claire Fernandez Vera.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.840
She studies adventure games.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.590
She studies games through
the lens of theater,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.300
so she's got a really
interesting view on play

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.680
as performance.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.530
This is much more
of a talk about what

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.530
is usable for you right
now in the games you're

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.930
making in this class.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.160
I'll start out with talking a
little bit about bigger games,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.640
but then I'm going
to move quickly

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.710
into talking about things are
more useful for you all right

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.210
now.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.240
Just a question for you.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.951
Do games tell stories?

00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:54.450
Yes?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.220
I see you nodded.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.630
Why?

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.130
How?

00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:02.027
AUDIENCE: Obviously
there are games

00:03:02.027 --> 00:03:04.485
that are more narrative-heavy
like with cutscenes and words

00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:05.673
and happening.

00:03:05.673 --> 00:03:08.903
But I feel like you can
also easily convey stories

00:03:08.903 --> 00:03:11.259
just with the images and
the way the player interacts

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:12.134
with the game itself.

00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:13.128
You kind of create
a narrative then.

00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:14.735
PROFESSOR: Great,
you did my lecture.

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:15.360
I'm done.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.985
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:16.910
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.435
Any other ways
games tell stories?

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.660
We heard cutscenes, we heard
narrative, we heard words,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.170
we heard pictures.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.580
Yeah?

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.350
One more hand?

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.990
Where?

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.460
AUDIENCE: Game books
also tell stories.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.750
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.340
Game books, the physical
things around games.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.304
AUDIENCE: It's also really
rare and hard to do,

00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:42.526
but it's really great when
games can tell the story

00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:43.270
through the mechanics.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.690
PROFESSOR: Yes, absolutely,
telling the story

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.675
through the mechanics.

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:46.800
Which game did you mention?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.430
Papers, Please?

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.535
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:51.404
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:03:51.404 --> 00:03:53.070
So when we talk about
games and stories,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.460
sometimes we think about these.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.668
Actually, you're good, you
mentioned some other types

00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:57.600
of games.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.395
Final Fantasy 13,
Metal Gear Solid

00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:03.260
4, both games kind of derided
for, in certain circles,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.310
the linearness of their games.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.860
You start the game,
you watch the movie,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.190
you hit some buttons,
you watch the next movie,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.260
you hit some buttons.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.650
Some people like that,
that's one way to play games.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.603
That's one kind of
game that is out there.

00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:18.269
Not exactly the kind
of games that we're

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.950
making in this class.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.160
But also not exactly the kind
of games-- not the only way

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.060
to tell stories in games,
as you just mentioned.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.610
To make those kind of games,
we're calling them AAA games

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.550
if anybody's heard
that phrase before.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.300
AAA just meaning expensive.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.520
Blockbuster.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.620
The Marvel blockbuster
movies are basically

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.400
what's happened to
film, Call of Duty

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.610
is the game version of that.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.720
So they require many
expensive resources,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.980
artists, sound designers.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.200
We heard an artist
talk earlier this week

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.070
about how art's important
and why art is important,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.750
and how difficult
it is for one person

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.780
to do all those different kinds
of tasks that are required

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.060
for a complicated game.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.070
Just to note that
those two games

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.530
that I mentioned
previously usually

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.880
borrow techniques from cinema.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.270
So things like camera placement,
lighting, visual effects

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.060
and sound effects, a
lot of those things

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.750
are their borrowing
concepts from cinema

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.500
that have been proven
to work in cinema,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.125
and then just throwing
them in the game

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:22.750
because they know they work.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.016
One way a AAA studio might think
about making a game with story

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:31.390
is, all right, so it's this
balance between interactivity

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.230
and narrative, right?

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.345
And there's this cost, so think
of that triangle as the cost.

00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:39.310
It costs money to
make these games,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.930
and that money is generally
either spent on people

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.342
or it's spent on time, so
people times time, basically.

00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:48.050
And the idea is that,
all right, so we've

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.220
got this interactive
stuff going on right here,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.922
the player presses
buttons, great.

00:05:51.922 --> 00:05:53.380
We've got this
narrative stuff here

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.600
and I'm borrowing
comedy and tragedy.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.810
When I say narrative, think
back to your Aristotle.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.700
So plot, comedy,
tragedy, melodrama.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.780
A lot of the AAA games
tend to just basically be

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.356
big melodrama pieces.

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:08.480
But it could be folk tales.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.890
That narrative could be--
sometimes it has conflict,

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.181
sometimes there's not conflict.

00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:15.677
Sometimes there's a
dramatic arc or not.

00:06:15.677 --> 00:06:18.010
So they say, all right, so
we've got to balance the two.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.950
And how do we do that?

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.690
State of the art AAA 2011, this
is Arkham City, that's Batman,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.960
his parents are dead.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.920
Press X to pay your respects.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.430
You press the X button,
he places down the rose,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.047
you get a nice little
cutscene reward with it

00:06:34.047 --> 00:06:35.630
so you can see a
little bit of a movie

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.017
going on with him being grim
and putting down the rose.

00:06:40.017 --> 00:06:42.350
But you also get a little
achievement, so it's a reward,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.292
it's an Easter egg.

00:06:44.292 --> 00:06:46.250
But it's a crucial back
story to the character,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.080
they put it in the game.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.660
They spend a lot of money
making that animation.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.201
Not all players are going to
see it, and when they do see it,

00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:55.190
it only lasts for a very
short period of time.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.270
That was 2011.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.190
It's 2014, we've got
really cool computers,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.990
we've got Xbox One, PS4.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.960
Your state of the art, AAA, 2014
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.300
We've got an upgrade.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.652
Hold X to pay respects.

00:07:09.652 --> 00:07:11.110
Basically, it's a
quick time event.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.160
We've seen quick time
events with other games

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.260
before, if anybody's played
Heavy Rain, if anybody's

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.120
played the Shenmue games,
Resident Evil games,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.100
things like that.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.690
Basically, you've got a
video footage going on,

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.620
and you can press a
button and it'll give you

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.690
a new set of video footage.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.190
There's a lot of
animation going on,

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.070
there's a lot of
cost going into this.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.320
I think the hope for
this kind of thing,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.880
why it's hold X instead of
press X, is by holding X,

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.170
you're embodying that action.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.920
Maybe you're grieving,
maybe it's praying,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.670
maybe it's holding the button.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.180
Maybe the longer you hold
it, the more you grieve.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.680
So maybe there should have been
a score that's counting down

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.590
how much grief you got.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.770
But if you've read the
internet about the game,

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.634
you notice that,
yeah, it hasn't quite

00:07:57.634 --> 00:08:00.050
worked out the way that they
might have thought it worked.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.160
You don't have AAA resources, so
why did I talk about all that?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.050
And you should probably just
give up on stories, right?

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.470
I'm going to say no,
of course, that's

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.580
why I'm talking about this
for about another 45 minutes.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.020
But some games
don't need stories

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.900
to be fun or have a meaning.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.940
Anybody recognize the
pieces on the screen?

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.000
Tetris.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.060
The tetrominos of Tetris.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.140
Is there a story to Tetris?

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.167
Some people say there is.

00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:35.750
And I'm talking about
this Tetris too,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.041
there's not even color in that.

00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:39.820
You can't even tell what the
tetrominos are once they hit

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.880
the pile, they're just there.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.880
And actually, that might
be that-- I don't know,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.870
I think the bottom
of that bottom row

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.040
is the bottom of the
bucket that's holding it.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.770
So our own MIT's
Media Lab Janet Murray

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.830
would say that Tetris is the
monotony of the work day,

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.306
of putting things
in their places.

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.680
Another professor, Jim G. over
at University of Wisconsin

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.210
Madison, he says
Tetris is an escape

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.830
into the very desire for order,
control, and workable solutions

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.080
that we have all the time.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.300
Some other less notable
but equally valid

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.390
people on the internet say
it's the story of life,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.230
it's never won, it
always has an ending,

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.850
and that ending is your
death or everything just

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.080
piling up to the top.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.830
Because it was made
in Russia, some people

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.180
might say that it's a
critique of communism, maybe,

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.710
or of sameness,
or of bureaucracy.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.540
Although the creator,
the Russian creator

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.780
Alexey Pajitnov would say--
he does say-- that for him,

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.890
it's about playing on the
edge of your abilities

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.280
and about playing to
a life well lived.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.350
So the point of
all this stuff is

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.150
people read patterns in
the most abstract things.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.650
So maybe you don't
need story, maybe

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.700
you just give them some
abstractness and then move on.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:59.260
Tetris was made in 1981 or
thereabouts, on that one, 1983?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.520
I should have put
that in the slide.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.350
So that was 30
something odd years ago.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.550
What if they made Tetris today?

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.600
Here's Tetris today, or one
version of Tetris today.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.170
Why would somebody make
a Tetris game with story?

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.234
This is the Japanese
only Puyo Puyo Tetris.

00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:17.900
It's taking two
different game mechanics

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.320
and splicing them together.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.660
Why would they put characters
in the Tetris game?

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.610
What's up?

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.232
PROFESSOR: It might, yeah.

00:10:28.232 --> 00:10:29.940
And people are used
to seeing characters.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.636
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:31.636 --> 00:10:33.620
PROFESSOR: Possibly, yeah.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.360
Any others?

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.121
Any other ideas?

00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:36.620
Yeah?

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.707
AUDIENCE: Tetris
already exists, so they

00:10:38.707 --> 00:10:40.540
need to make it at least
slightly different.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.529
PROFESSOR: Absolutely, yeah.

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:44.820
Actually, we were just talking
about this before class.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.540
Would you be able
to sell this today?

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.490
Do you think this
could sell today?

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.932
You've never seen Tetris
before, it's a brand new thing,

00:10:55.932 --> 00:10:56.640
you'd look it up.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.540
Maybe it would,
maybe it wouldn't.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.550
Has anybody played the game
Hexagon or Super Hexagon?

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.860
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.110
PROFESSOR: Does Hexagon or
Super Hexagon have a story?

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.610
AUDIENCE: No.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.130
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.530
Then why is there a
narrator and a voice?

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.420
Why is she telling you--

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.344
AUDIENCE: It sounds
like-- I feel

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.760
like it's partially to let the
player know where they are,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.260
maybe?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.380
PROFESSOR: How does she talk?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.050
Kind of robotic?

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.300
AUDIENCE: It's robotic, but
also like a woman's voice.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.120
PROFESSOR: There's a
little bit of story.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.140
Why is the character a triangle?

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.890
AUDIENCE: Why is the
character a triangle?

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.310
PROFESSOR: The thing that
you're moving on a screen.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.420
Why a triangle and not a square?

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.912
Or circle?

00:11:39.912 --> 00:11:40.828
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:41.977
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

00:11:41.977 --> 00:11:42.976
AUDIENCE: It shows you--

00:11:42.976 --> 00:11:44.580
PROFESSOR: I'm going to argue
that there's a little bit of--

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.580
AUDIENCE: Triangles
are non-deformable.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.590
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.405
AUDIENCE: They're more
sturdy than squares.

00:11:48.405 --> 00:11:50.738
If you squish a square it
turns into like a weird slanty

00:11:50.738 --> 00:11:50.982
square.

00:11:50.982 --> 00:11:51.981
PROFESSOR: There you go.

00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:53.810
AUDIENCE: Rhombus.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.960
PROFESSOR: There's little
hints of story there.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.876
AUDIENCE: The character
is the triangle.

00:11:58.876 --> 00:11:59.848
I think.

00:11:59.848 --> 00:12:00.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.250
AUDIENCE: One other reason
for characters is merch.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.740
PROFESSOR: Merchandise.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.050
Actually, yeah,
especially with this one.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.600
What do they call the characters
when they make-- like,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.052
Internet Explorer
as a character.

00:12:12.052 --> 00:12:13.510
Is it [INAUDIBLE],
or is it a tomo?

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.871
AUDIENCE: It's
like something tan,

00:12:14.871 --> 00:12:15.230
so like Internet Explorer tan.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.200
PROFESSOR: Something tan, yeah.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.920
So L-tan and other L-tan, maybe.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.950
So that's story.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.950
That's reason is the story
that historians of a game play

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.450
purpose I would argue
that Pac-Man has a story.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.310
A noticeable story, right?

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.070
There's cutscenes
in this Pac-Man.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.200
But what's the story of Pac-Man?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.307
Where are the hints
of story there?

00:12:42.307 --> 00:12:46.059
AUDIENCE: I guess it could be
in how the enemies have names?

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:47.070
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.125
And why did they give
the characters names?

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.735
Why is Blinky Blinky, and his
character, his personality

00:12:54.735 --> 00:12:55.460
is shadow?

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.424
AUDIENCE: I think as
far as I remember,

00:12:57.424 --> 00:13:00.070
that's really-- the English
translation is a really

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.332
poor translation of it.

00:13:02.332 --> 00:13:05.343
In the original, it's very
clear as to their names

00:13:05.343 --> 00:13:06.884
gives a hint as to
how they will act.

00:13:06.884 --> 00:13:08.090
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.880
They have deterministic actions.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.010
So I've given them a
little bit of character,

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.810
but that's going to help you to
identify one before the other.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.290
If anybody's played the Atari
2600 version of Pac-Man,

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.660
my first experience with it, all
the ghosts had the same image.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.400
You couldn't tell which one
had which type of action.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.990
They probably actually
didn't have different AI.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.990
It was a really difficult
game for them to make.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.310
They had to make it in two
or three weeks, I believe.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.860
What do we gain from story?

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.780
This is where I come
in and say, this

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.600
is what I think story is
going to give to your games.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.920
Even if you're making
a strategy game,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.795
it doesn't matter what
kind of game you make,

00:13:43.795 --> 00:13:45.940
you're going to get
something out of a story.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.660
We understand our lived
experiences as stories,

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.300
so providing a story is going
to help a player understand

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.592
what's going on in the game.

00:13:52.592 --> 00:13:54.800
If you think about what
you've ever done in the past,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.170
you're always telling it to
another person as a story.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.141
The way you are able
to memorize things,

00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:01.640
often, is you're constructing
stories in your head of things

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.780
that you've done.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.169
It's events with causes.

00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:06.210
You're placing together,
you're finding patterns,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.793
and you're putting
the story in there.

00:14:07.793 --> 00:14:10.380
It helps you understand
what's going on around you.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.720
A story can help you explain
the world to the player,

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.200
it can also encourage
the player to explore it.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.180
So if you've got something
in the game that's

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.390
hidden later on, you
want them to find it,

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.990
you can use story to
give them hints towards,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.450
there's this cool
thing coming up

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.700
that you might
want to check out.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.640
On a parallel level
to explanation,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.600
stories provide
consistency to the world.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.920
So if you've got various things
going on within your game,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.520
the way you can kind of massage
the differences between things

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.050
going on, between
the mechanics, is

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.920
by covering that up
with story, or rather,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.790
embellishing and
supporting it with story

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.460
rather than covering it up.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.322
So a couple quick videos.

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:49.780
When I'm talking
about story games,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.363
especially in this
lecture, I'm mainly

00:14:51.363 --> 00:14:54.444
talking about games with
story, not story-driven games.

00:14:54.444 --> 00:14:55.860
The games we talked
about earlier,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.610
those were story-driven games.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:02.228
This is a game with a story.

00:15:02.228 --> 00:15:07.664
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:07.664 --> 00:15:09.788
-The heroes finally meet
under the star of destiny.

00:15:09.788 --> 00:15:13.106
PROFESSOR: That's Sophitia, in
the white we've got Cassandra.

00:15:13.106 --> 00:15:16.910
-I'm sorry, but I
can't back down.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.905
-What do you want?

00:15:18.905 --> 00:15:21.380
-Battle one, fight.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.845
PROFESSOR: Have you
heard of this game?

00:15:24.845 --> 00:15:26.825
Soul Calibur, yeah.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:27.815
I think it's 3.

00:15:30.785 --> 00:15:38.210
2008 or 2010, I think it's from.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.695
Did anyone catch what she said?

00:15:39.695 --> 00:15:41.180
AUDIENCE: Don't
try to confuse me.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.150
PROFESSOR: Don't
try to confuse me.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.115
So KO, you basically have--

00:15:47.115 --> 00:15:47.615
-You win.

00:15:47.615 --> 00:15:50.090
-God, please forgive me.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.660
PROFESSOR: God, please forgive
me, what is she talking about?

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.020
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.478
PROFESSOR: Does anybody know
what what she was saying there

00:15:55.478 --> 00:15:57.205
and why she was saying it?

00:15:57.205 --> 00:15:59.580
You might only know this if
you've played the game before

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.700
and you're really,
really into the game.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.581
So Matt?

00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:04.080
Yeah.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.190
So Cassandra is
Sophitia's sister,

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.250
and they're fighting
for the Soul Edge,

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.400
for this demonic sword that's
going to destroy the world.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.590
And she has to fight her
sister and kill her sister

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.070
to get to the sword.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.740
I think that for Sophitia's
version it's to save the world.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.240
Why didn't she work
with her sister?

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.780
It's a fighting game, who knows?

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.330
I meant to update the
slides to something

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.526
a more modern audience
might understand.

00:16:29.526 --> 00:16:32.150
In particular, League of Legends
does this kind of thing a lot,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.734
right.

00:16:32.734 --> 00:16:34.400
There's story moments
going on in games.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.620
You had mentioned a
moment in the game.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.518
AUDIENCE: Certain
characters on the same team,

00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:42.450
I believe, they have
different voice prompts

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.543
or different vocal
lines that they

00:16:44.543 --> 00:16:48.610
would say to acknowledge
that they have a history.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.295
PROFESSOR: Does that help
you play the game Better

00:16:51.295 --> 00:16:52.795
AUDIENCE: No, no
gameplay mechanics.

00:16:52.795 --> 00:16:54.010
PROFESSOR: No.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.049
It's a valid use of
story, but it's not

00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:57.590
an efficient use of
story, especially

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.080
for your kind of games, right?

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.730
It doesn't directly connect.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.230
The story doesn't
directly connect

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.690
to the player's
experience of the game,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.066
but it is something
players like.

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.606
Like we talked about
with characters,

00:17:07.606 --> 00:17:09.222
like we talked with merchandise.

00:17:09.222 --> 00:17:11.180
And in particular, in
particular for this game,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.390
for Soul Calibur,
why is Soul Calibur

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.760
doing this but Street
Fighter isn't doing this?

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.440
Soul Calibur stands apart
from the other fighting games

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.234
by having these complex
story lines that

00:17:22.234 --> 00:17:24.400
are actually visible to the
player within the games.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.233
Street Fighter does
have complex storylines,

00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:30.940
but they're largely
fan service or outside

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.200
of the game, merchandise,
books, things like that.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.850
You maybe see a little cutscene
or two at the end of the game,

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.226
but not while you're playing it.

00:17:38.226 --> 00:17:40.100
And also, to really
enhance the single player

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.240
experience of the game.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.490
That's actually how I know
of the Soul Calibur series,

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.780
I played it single player.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.605
Because they added
an RPG to it that

00:17:47.605 --> 00:17:50.250
was really basic and stupid,
but it made the story

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.420
a little bit more concrete.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.925
They took the RPG
out, that's when

00:17:53.925 --> 00:17:55.120
I stopped playing the game.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.040
Because that story
didn't have any--

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.414
there's no reason for that
story in the gameplay anymore.

00:18:03.752 --> 00:18:05.710
So I was asking you about
games telling stories

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.504
and how do games tell stories.

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:09.670
What I'm going to say now
is that technically, games

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.260
don't exactly tell stories,
if you think about it.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.280
Like, who is the
storyteller in a game?

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.980
You.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.120
So it's not storytelling,
it's story building.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.420
The game, the
designer, the developer

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:29.000
is giving you the tools to
build a story of your own.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.460
Why we say they're different,
so just to compare and contrast,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.070
storytelling is continuous.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.820
There's a one way communication,
it is from auteur and author

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.590
to the player.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.030
The order and, more in
particular, the order of events

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.570
and disclosure of
information is determined

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:45.870
by the author of the game.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.328
I'm going to show you this,
and I'm going to show you this,

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:49.630
and I'm going to show you that.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.980
Story building is
more fragmented.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.381
It could be as simple as
I'm going to show you this,

00:18:54.381 --> 00:18:56.130
now you can go see all
these other things,

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.404
but I'm going to
pull you back and I'm

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:58.550
going to show you
this next thing,

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.620
and you have to see those
two things in order.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.100
In a more open
oriented game, you

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.500
can see everything
at any point of time

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.000
depending on when you like it.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.500
Rather than a one
way communication,

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.416
there's collaboration
between narrative design

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:11.310
and the players.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.300
Anybody heard the term
narrative design before?

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.010
Or the job title
narrative designer?

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.702
What do you think
that is in a company?

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:21.660
And let's say Rational.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.650
Rational has
narrative designers,

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.200
she was actually a CMS
student for Infinite.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.915
What would a narrative designer
do in Bioshock Infinite?

00:19:31.915 --> 00:19:35.715
AUDIENCE: Probably write all
the [INAUDIBLE] and stuff,

00:19:35.715 --> 00:19:37.341
and all the little
pops that you hear?

00:19:37.341 --> 00:19:38.174
And what's going on?

00:19:38.174 --> 00:19:39.910
PROFESSOR: A little bit.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.967
I think Ken wrote a lot of
that, Ken the director wrote

00:19:42.967 --> 00:19:43.550
a lot of that.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.445
They touch that, though.

00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:46.236
Yeah?

00:19:46.236 --> 00:19:49.163
AUDIENCE: Think of how the story
motivates the player and ties

00:19:49.163 --> 00:19:50.204
into the actual gameplay.

00:19:50.204 --> 00:19:53.676
So like, Bioshock, you're
told to do this and the reason

00:19:53.676 --> 00:19:55.164
is the story.

00:19:55.164 --> 00:19:57.283
I guess figuring
out how that fits in

00:19:57.283 --> 00:19:58.866
and how the mechanics
will be fit into

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:01.060
PROFESSOR: Yep, they
touch that, too.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.980
The other thing they do is,
you've got a level designer,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.980
and you've got a writer.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.313
And right in between, you've
got the narrative designer.

00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:09.630
In some companies, this
isn't for all companies.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.575
This is just for some.

00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:13.200
In particular, this
is how I understand

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.985
how Rational works, right,
is the level designer creates

00:20:15.985 --> 00:20:18.270
a level based on how a
person's going to play it,

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.770
how they're going
to get through it,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.690
how they're going to get
from point A to point B.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.960
Writer says, here's the story
I need everybody to see,

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.810
here's all the elements
I need them to see.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.018
Narrative designer figures
out where within the level

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:29.550
those things are going to exist.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.383
And we'll talk about
that when we're talking

00:20:31.383 --> 00:20:33.379
about environmental design.

00:20:33.379 --> 00:20:35.920
I'll point out a couple places
where a narrative designer had

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.320
an active role in that game.

00:20:39.887 --> 00:20:41.470
All right, so I'm
going to say that we

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.960
don't need expensive cut
scenes to tell stories.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.180
We've come up with
a few, we've kind of

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.950
touched on this a little bit.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.780
And instead, what
I want to say is,

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.490
let's reduce the
cost of the game,

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.040
but let's keep
interactivity and narrative.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.690
So things a player
does and the story

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.690
that the player experiences
are about similar.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.790
So what tools are we
going to give the player

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.730
to build their story?

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.380
And where we give them the tools
depends on the type of story

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.590
we're giving them.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:12.360
So there's two stories to
games that the player builds.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.230
There's the story
of the world, which

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.630
largely is seen and heard, and
it's interpreted by the player.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.740
And there's the story of
the player, the actions

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.850
that the player does,
and why I say told,

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.880
I kind of mean built as well.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.990
Told is in that the
player is telling it,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.730
not the-- so the world
might be something

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.074
that the game is
telling the player,

00:21:30.074 --> 00:21:31.740
but the story of the
player is something

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.660
that the player is
telling back to the game,

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.839
or back to their friends,
or in their own head.

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:40.130
So story of the world, it's
the world's history, right.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.340
It's the events that happen
in the fictional world

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.880
before the game starts.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.860
You've got a lot of
control over all of this.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.145
As a developer, you're
writing all of this.

00:21:49.145 --> 00:21:50.770
For the player,
they're discovering it.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:51.940
They're discovering
it piecemeal,

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.815
they're discovering it
through the game play.

00:21:53.815 --> 00:21:55.820
So that story,
with a great world,

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.920
that story becomes a puzzle for
the player to want to explore.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.920
It can be as literal as in
Myst, where it literally

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.010
is a puzzle that you were
going around and solving

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.060
a puzzle here and solving
a puzzle there, getting

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.710
little snippets of background
and putting them together

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.250
in your head to come up
with a whole view of what

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.250
the world is.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.750
Or it could be
things like I'm going

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.160
to show you with environmental.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:16.879
Yeah?

00:22:16.879 --> 00:22:19.813
AUDIENCE: Ideally, too, if your
story is becoming a puzzle,

00:22:19.813 --> 00:22:22.835
it would be really,
really cool if it

00:22:22.835 --> 00:22:24.810
was useful to have
solved it, right?

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.610
So maybe as a player, if you
can figure out something cool

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.644
about the world that
can be useful to you

00:22:29.644 --> 00:22:31.810
back in your game again,
that would be really great.

00:22:34.726 --> 00:22:36.600
PROFESSOR: So the tools
are giving the player

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.164
to do that, to do exactly that.

00:22:39.164 --> 00:22:40.580
And these are three
tools that you

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.496
have at your disposal
in your games right now.

00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:44.180
They're really simple
and easy to use.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.420
At least the top two are.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.750
Title, character design, and
your environmental design.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.440
So we're going to go
through about four tiles.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.310
I'm going to give you
the name of the game.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.750
I'm cheating a little bit
because I'm actually giving you

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.070
the cover art for the game.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.069
I'd like to know what the
story is for the game.

00:23:00.069 --> 00:23:03.050
So, Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.730
What is the story of
Zombies Ate My Neighbors?

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.405
It's about zombies.

00:23:11.405 --> 00:23:12.530
What are the zombies doing?

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.410
AUDIENCE: Eating neighbors.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.079
PROFESSOR: They're
eating neighbors.

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:16.120
Where does it take place?

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.670
AUDIENCE: In a neighborhood.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.650
PROFESSOR: In a
neighborhood, all right.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.246
Anything else?

00:23:20.246 --> 00:23:21.621
AUDIENCE: They're
coming for you.

00:23:21.621 --> 00:23:24.122
PROFESSOR: They're
coming for you.

00:23:24.122 --> 00:23:26.000
Damn right.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.510
Yeah?

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.440
In the back?

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.340
AUDIENCE: It appears that
it's in a kind of campy style.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.340
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.742
AUDIENCE: Maybe like '60s-ish?

00:23:34.742 --> 00:23:36.470
PROFESSOR: Mhm.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.360
You get the kind of
distressed woman in the front.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.020
She's being chased by very slow,
they're slow zombies, right?

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.450
These days we have
to kind of specify.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:53.240
Back in the day they
were always slow.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.530
All right, next one.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.125
The Earth Dies Screaming.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.350
What's it about?

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.670
AUDIENCE: Earth dying?

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:01.472
AUDIENCE: Space.

00:24:01.472 --> 00:24:02.430
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.990
Space.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.305
Anything else?

00:24:06.305 --> 00:24:06.805
What's that?

00:24:06.805 --> 00:24:07.820
AUDIENCE: Aliens.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.860
PROFESSOR: War.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.720
Did I hear aliens?

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.990
Something?

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.020
Yeah.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.160
Anyone recognize the title?

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.969
AUDIENCE: Was it a movie?

00:24:17.969 --> 00:24:18.635
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:18.635 --> 00:24:20.468
Do you think the game
is based on the movie?

00:24:20.468 --> 00:24:22.078
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:22.078 --> 00:24:23.650
PROFESSOR: It actually isn't.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:29.301
So the movie's from '55, '57?

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:31.590
I don't even remember if
it's an alien invasion movie.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.590
It's just one of those
things where in the '50s,

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.548
you made a movie and then
somebody came and put

00:24:35.548 --> 00:24:38.860
a title on it based on what
titles were working that day.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.990
But they licensed it
from 20th Century Fox.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.899
But there's these
spaceships, these very '80s

00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:44.690
looking spaceships.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.090
This is actually a
cartridge for the 2600.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.800
Looks awful.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.960
But yeah, The Earth
Dies Screaming.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.460
What happens at the
end of the game?

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.918
AUDIENCE: The earth
dies screaming.

00:24:54.918 --> 00:24:56.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.892
Arcade games, back in the day.

00:24:58.892 --> 00:24:59.600
How did they end?

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.070
They always ended
with you dying.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.945
It was always about
throwing another quarter,

00:25:02.945 --> 00:25:05.190
playing it some more,
getting more time.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.280
That actually came back
over to the consoles,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.960
especially in the 2600 days.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.590
We've moved beyond
that, for the most part.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.810
In some cases, it's actually
brought back in iOS.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.220
But yeah, Earth Dies Screaming.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.090
All right, next
one, this is harder.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:21.000
A Mind Forever Voyaging.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.080
Ooh.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.790
What's going on there?

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.670
AUDIENCE: Discovery.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.634
PROFESSOR: Discovery, yeah.

00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:29.633
AUDIENCE: So we're allowed
to look at the images

00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:30.350
and make something up.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.266
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:25:31.266 --> 00:25:35.017
AUDIENCE: So you're a guy,
you imagine all these things,

00:25:35.017 --> 00:25:37.225
and your brain interfaces
with some kind [INAUDIBLE],

00:25:37.225 --> 00:25:40.170
so you can see that
sort of imaging.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.481
So maybe you're exploring
all of these virtual worlds

00:25:43.481 --> 00:25:44.022
in your head.

00:25:44.022 --> 00:25:44.522
And maybe--

00:25:44.522 --> 00:25:46.065
PROFESSOR: Have you played this?

00:25:46.065 --> 00:25:47.615
AUDIENCE: I just
looked at the image.

00:25:47.615 --> 00:25:49.406
The title image, and
that really helps me--

00:25:49.406 --> 00:25:51.040
PROFESSOR: It does help a lot.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.737
But yeah, that's exactly right.

00:25:52.737 --> 00:25:54.320
Except you're wrong,
you're not a guy.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.996
Right?

00:25:54.996 --> 00:25:55.750
You're not a guy.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.720
You're an AI.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.785
Right, yeah.

00:25:57.785 --> 00:25:59.410
I probably spoiled
it for you, it's OK.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.530
It's an Infocom game, it's
a text adventure from 1988.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.150
So you're exploring, text
adventures were open door,

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:12.470
go right, open
mailbox, die from grue.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:17.030
And in this case, you're going
to all these different worlds,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.110
and it's the mind.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:22.200
So it had to do with the
AI attaining sentience

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.659
and figuring out
what was going on,

00:26:23.659 --> 00:26:26.325
and what was around it, and what
the world was like at the time.

00:26:26.325 --> 00:26:30.210
Really good game, cool,
little bit of tidbit of info

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.210
for these kind of games.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.970
They came with these things
called feelies, so elements,

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.678
like physical elements,
that were shipped

00:26:35.678 --> 00:26:38.530
with the game box that kind of
added a little bit to the game.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.238
Because they didn't
have graphics to show

00:26:40.238 --> 00:26:41.110
you everything.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:46.180
So in this case it was
a file folder, a pen,

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.080
I think it was
related to a company

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.500
that you thought you worked for.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.810
Here's a more recent game.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.604
868-HACK.

00:26:55.604 --> 00:26:56.270
What's it about?

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.472
What is 868-HACK?

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.111
AUDIENCE: A phone number.

00:27:05.111 --> 00:27:07.890
PROFESSOR: Yes,
it's a phone number.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.760
There's no area code, right?

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.490
Normally we'd have
an area code there.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.195
So it's kind of referencing
back to maybe the '80s?

00:27:15.195 --> 00:27:17.080
Are you a hacker?

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.420
Maybe.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.840
Probably.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.962
Anything else we can
get from the title?

00:27:22.962 --> 00:27:24.420
We're going to come
back, I'm going

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.490
to use this example again,
because I love this game.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.330
So titles provide clues towards
setting, character, action.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.130
Even better, while you're
thinking of your title,

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.290
think about what
it's like on Google.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.020
Think about marketing
right now if you're

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.311
making a game that's going
to be marketed to somewhere.

00:27:40.311 --> 00:27:42.680
Can you Google the title
and come up with your game?

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.619
If you can, you win.

00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:46.160
It's very hard for
some of the games,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.890
unless you add a ton
of money into it.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.660
Next up is character design.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.440
Who's that?

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.152
AUDIENCE: Sonic.

00:27:52.152 --> 00:27:53.114
PROFESSOR: Sonic.

00:27:53.114 --> 00:27:53.905
What does Sonic do?

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:54.660
AUDIENCE: Runs.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.720
PROFESSOR: He runs fast.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.515
What's he doing here?

00:27:56.515 --> 00:27:57.256
AUDIENCE: Stopping.

00:27:57.256 --> 00:27:58.050
AUDIENCE: Waiting.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:58.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah, why?

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.401
AUDIENCE: Because
you're not running.

00:28:00.401 --> 00:28:02.150
PROFESSOR: Exactly right.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.180
Wow, I could have
written this out.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.100
Yeah, he's pissed.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.330
He's like, what the hell?

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:06.994
Make me move.

00:28:06.994 --> 00:28:08.660
You're not moving him
on the controller,

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.910
this is his idle animation.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.347
So a ton of expressiveness
in this idle animation.

00:28:12.347 --> 00:28:14.180
It's maybe three or
four frames of animation

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.880
of just him tapping his
feet, looking at you,

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.989
breaking the fourth wall.

00:28:19.989 --> 00:28:22.030
Some really great stuff
you can do with character

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.920
design in that way.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.452
Yeah, like why do
we know he runs?

00:28:25.452 --> 00:28:26.910
If this were like
the first time we

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.850
saw this and this
was Christmas Day,

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.300
back in the time when we didn't
find out about games three

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.360
years before they came out.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.510
You get this spiky-haired
dude with big feet, right?

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.920
He's fast, he runs.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.410
So yeah.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:42.460
Back to 868-HACK.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.170
As I said, I love this game.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.610
Where is the player
on the screen?

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.455
What element of the
screen is the player?

00:28:48.455 --> 00:28:49.880
AUDIENCE: The tile.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.290
PROFESSOR: Yes, which one?

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.130
AUDIENCE: Left.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
the top one, right?

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.580
What are you?

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.940
What is it doing there?

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.940
How do you think it
interacts within the system?

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.620
Yeah?

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.388
AUDIENCE: Walk down
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:05.388 --> 00:29:06.860
PROFESSOR: Basically, yeah.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.770
Do you see, you
see, I kind of said.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.330
There's other smiley
faces there, right?

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:12.586
What do they do?

00:29:12.586 --> 00:29:14.370
AUDIENCE: Chase the [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.916
PROFESSOR: OK, so--

00:29:15.916 --> 00:29:16.832
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so there's the
purple one, the magenta one,

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.500
the purple one, the red one.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.790
Those are bad guys
coming to get you.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.210
There's these little ones in
the bottom left and right.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.395
There's a couple on the top
row that say data siphon.

00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:34.020
That's something that
you leave behind.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.600
So you're leaving behind
a piece of yourself

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.600
in order to claim space.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.120
It's a territory
control game where

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.490
you drop a piece of yourself to
consume the things around it.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.610
You can consume
the programs there

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.960
and you can use
the programs there.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.730
But I really like it for this.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.230
Why do you think I
like it for this?

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.729
When I'm talking
about hackers, when

00:29:52.729 --> 00:29:55.360
I'm talking with a smiley face,
what does that connote to you?

00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.550
What did I hear?

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.341
AUDIENCE: It's fun.

00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:03.120
PROFESSOR: It's fun, yeah.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.895
Yeah, Matt?

00:30:03.895 --> 00:30:05.186
AUDIENCE: You're identity-less.

00:30:05.186 --> 00:30:08.060
PROFESSOR: Your
identity-less, right?

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.449
You're anonymous.

00:30:09.449 --> 00:30:10.490
I just kind of like that.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.820
All right, so moving on.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.340
Character design provides
clues towards your actions

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.510
and your verbs, although
in that last example,

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.830
it was actually not
very good at that part.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.190
But it does give clues
towards your background, who

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.810
you are, what you are, why
you are, and then the feel.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.980
What's the feel of that
game supposed to be.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.605
What's the feel you're
supposed to have

00:30:28.605 --> 00:30:29.813
when you're playing the game?

00:30:29.813 --> 00:30:30.430
Question?

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.160
OK, cool.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.550
Environmental design is that
third thing I talked about.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.030
This is Portal, this is
when you first start Portal.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.840
It's very clean,
it's very spacious,

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.840
except for that little
box that you're stuck in.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.250
You eventually get out.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.810
But something happens
and you see something

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.840
later in the game.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.960
Does anybody remember
where this is?

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.010
Oh, not played it?

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.330
AUDIENCE: I'm like in
the middle of playing it.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.580
PROFESSOR: Which level?

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.940
Like three or four,
or five or six?

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.493
Have you seen a turret yet?

00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:03.650
AUDIENCE: Have I seen a turret?

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:04.529
Oh, no.

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:05.570
PROFESSOR: OK, all right.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.310
Close your eyes, shut your ears.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:12.960
It's 2014, come on.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.940
Yeah, so this is
the cake is a lie.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.942
It's later in the game.

00:31:19.942 --> 00:31:21.400
It's actually in
a part of the game

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.149
where everything still
looks really clean,

00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:26.000
that's as far as
I'm going to go.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.850
Somebody left stuff back there.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.420
This is actually something
that not a lot of players

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.440
saw when it first came out and
then a lot of other players

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.977
told each other
about it later on.

00:31:32.977 --> 00:31:34.476
So it's also a game
event, which I'm

00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:36.610
going to talk about
later when we're talking

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:37.540
about the story of the player.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.914
But this is where level design
and narrative design meet.

00:31:39.914 --> 00:31:42.320
So level is created,
there's a story moment that

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.400
had to be placed somewhere, the
narrative designer placed it

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.524
in a spot that was hidden,
that was hard to get to,

00:31:46.524 --> 00:31:48.190
but still reachable.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.400
And when we talk about
environmental storytelling,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.200
we often talk
about-- there's been

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.320
some articles about
bad graffiti in games,

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.520
and just how trite
this has been used.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.984
We're trying to find new
ways of doing the same thing.

00:32:00.984 --> 00:32:02.900
But it's basically, there
was someone in there

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.000
before you, is what
happened there.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.185
That's as far as
I'm going to go.

00:32:07.185 --> 00:32:08.810
Environment provides
clues towards what

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.351
happened in the
past, but also what's

00:32:10.351 --> 00:32:11.650
going to happen in the future.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:13.275
And it provides clues
towards the feel,

00:32:13.275 --> 00:32:16.250
so again, what's this game
supposed to feel like?

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.994
All right, so moving on.

00:32:17.994 --> 00:32:19.410
We've got the story
of the player.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.160
So there's the embedded
story of the player.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.970
And what I mean by that
is that's the story

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:24.970
of the player that's
pre-established by the game.

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.180
Has everybody played Ocarina
of Time, or heard of it,

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.140
or seen it?

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.510
OK.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:33.580
So you're Link, you start
out not knowing a lot

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.080
about the world,
and slowly the game

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.230
lets you know more about
what happened in the world

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.000
behind you.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.060
You don't get to choose
to have this friend,

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.490
I don't think, right?

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.280
What's her name, Saria?

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.600
The game gave you this friend.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.840
And actually, later on,
the other friends you get,

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.910
the game's going to
give you those, too.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.743
You don't get to choose
to have them or not.

00:32:51.743 --> 00:32:52.910
She gives you this ocarina.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.210
The ocarina is a very
important aspect of the game.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.399
So in this case, it's this
embedded story of here's

00:32:58.399 --> 00:32:59.940
this object that
you're going to use.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.520
It's going to be incredibly
useful for you later

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.600
in the game, to the
point where you're

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.266
going to get really
annoyed about having

00:33:04.266 --> 00:33:06.622
to bring it up all the time
and play the same song all

00:33:06.622 --> 00:33:07.380
the time.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.730
But it's also part of
the character design.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.354
It's giving you what
your capabilities,

00:33:10.354 --> 00:33:11.840
like what are you
capable of doing?

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.500
In this case, you're
capable of playing songs

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.250
on the ocarina that do magical
effects within the game.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.380
There's also emergent, and
this is the cooler thing

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.090
that I want to
spend more time on.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.890
This is the result of the player
interacting with the system.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.690
In this case, it's Sims 3.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.120
And much of the systems
of, at least, Sims 1,

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.876
and I think still in
Sims 3, the entire game

00:33:33.876 --> 00:33:36.015
is basically based on
Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:33:36.015 --> 00:33:38.140
So I'll bring up the slide,
I think I bring that up

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.640
in a later version.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.714
Basically, it's a sandbox game.

00:33:42.714 --> 00:33:44.380
There are things you
can do in the game,

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.020
and the story that's being
told is the events and things

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.380
that happen to the
characters based on changes

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.302
you make in the environment.

00:33:52.302 --> 00:33:54.510
You're not to get the same
story over and over again.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.610
You're going to get new stories.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:57.600
Some big.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.070
Like in this case, the entire
game is that kind of thing.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:03.340
In other games it's more of
a smaller aspect of the game,

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.300
it's an added bonus to the game.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.299
The story of the player
in either of those cases

00:34:08.299 --> 00:34:09.730
is usually told
through three things,

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.170
and these are three things
that you can use in your games

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.310
right now.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.590
Game premise, or the goal of
the game, is your story, right.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.190
Why are you going,
where are you going.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.639
Game events are
things that happen

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.357
within the game, either
predetermined or emergent.

00:34:22.357 --> 00:34:24.190
And then micronarratives,
which I'll explain

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.929
what that is on at the end.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.530
Here is a premise.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:31.750
Again, we're at MIT so we
talk about hacking, right.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:32.748
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

Uplink.

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:50.211
You're an Uplink agent,
a freelance hacker.

Your clients, global
multinationals.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.203
You hack into rival computer
systems, steal research data,

00:34:55.203 --> 00:34:57.698
sabotage other
companies, launder money,

00:34:57.698 --> 00:35:00.692
erase the evidence, even
frame innocent people.

00:35:00.692 --> 00:35:02.688
And all from the comfort
of your own home.

00:35:02.688 --> 00:35:05.183
In Uplink, you are
the hacker elite.

Find more dangerous and
profitable missions,

00:35:07.179 --> 00:35:09.674
change peoples' academic,
and even criminal, records,

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:13.666
and then siphon money from
their bank account into yours.

00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:16.660
And why not construct
the most deadly computer

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:17.658
virus ever designed.

00:35:17.658 --> 00:35:18.656
But watch out.

00:35:18.656 --> 00:35:23.645
When you're online,
you're being traced.

00:35:23.645 --> 00:35:24.145
Uplink.

00:35:24.145 --> 00:35:26.640
The game for the
corrupted heart,

where trust is a weakness.

00:35:29.633 --> 00:35:30.133
PC Gamer--

00:35:30.133 --> 00:35:30.716
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:30.716 --> 00:35:32.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.000
Threw a lot of words at you,
but basically every single thing

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.460
inside of that game is something
you can do in the game.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.626
You can hack another person,
you can create a virus,

00:35:39.626 --> 00:35:41.737
you can download their
personal records,

00:35:41.737 --> 00:35:43.320
you can change their
personal records.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.850
Every single one of those
things mentioned in the premise,

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:47.490
in the trailer,
is a mechanic that

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.450
is usable within the
game in some form.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.550
A lot of it is a user interface.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:56.050
It kind of looks like a
futuristic computer terminal

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.362
or an interface terminal.

00:35:57.362 --> 00:35:59.070
Made by the same
people, if you remember,

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.132
we showed DEFCON earlier in
the semester, same folks.

00:36:02.132 --> 00:36:04.090
They're really good at
that kind of atmosphere,

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.656
building atmosphere.

00:36:05.656 --> 00:36:07.995
AUDIENCE: Futuristic
for the '90s.

00:36:07.995 --> 00:36:09.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
still futuristic.

00:36:12.687 --> 00:36:14.770
So game premise, that's
an easy one to get across.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.520
Basically, it's just,
think about all the things

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.520
that you do in the game.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.715
All those things, when you
put them together one by one,

00:36:20.715 --> 00:36:22.090
that is the story
that the player

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.440
is going to be telling
when they play your game.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.410
Think of it, in that
case, what they're doing

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.480
is they're using
a genre convention

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.896
and they're using some tropes
that you might already know.

00:36:31.896 --> 00:36:34.840
Tropes can be useful,
tropes can be baggage.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.422
Tropes are usually baggage.

00:36:36.422 --> 00:36:38.880
But genre conventions are great,
especially when it's just,

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.504
I want to get this
theme across to you,

00:36:40.504 --> 00:36:42.220
I want to get this
hard punch of you

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.810
know exactly what
you need to do.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.750
I don't need to explain the game
to you because you know what

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.230
a hacker is supposed to do.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.230
That's where those things
are incredibly useful.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.261
Give me my slides.

00:36:53.261 --> 00:36:53.760
Game events.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.640
Has anybody played
Final Fantasy 4?

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.210
Or 2, if you played the
original, or the US version,

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.000
I mean?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.440
So there's a character
called Rydia the Summoner,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.315
that is not what she
looked like in the game.

00:37:04.315 --> 00:37:06.580
That was the illustration
that she looked like.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:11.260
She looked like a very
small green haired person.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.155
She is a summoner,
she has magic powers.

00:37:15.155 --> 00:37:17.530
What kind of magic powers are
common in the Final Fantasy

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.135
series?

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.135
What's the three basics?

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:25.000
AUDIENCE: Fire, ice and thunder.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:25.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.668
Or blue or, yeah,
fire, ice, and thunder.

00:37:27.668 --> 00:37:29.900
Exactly right.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.610
So she's a summoner but she
has other black mage powers.

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.960
Pretty common, most characters
would have those three powers.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.830
Except for her.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.690
She hates fire.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:43.490
You don't have fire for
a good part of the game.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:46.220
There's a moment in the
game, you're at Mount Hobs,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.260
there's an ice mountain,
you need to get through.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.630
You can kind of see ice
in the background there.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.965
You need to get
through the cave,

00:37:54.965 --> 00:37:56.090
and there's a story moment.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.400
One of the characters,
Cecil, on the left

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.830
there says she's afraid of
fire, because her village was

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:01.220
destroyed in a fire.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.750
And you see a snippet of
this early in the game.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.370
You get moments that
she's got this backstory

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:10.049
where traumatic past,
it's preventing her

00:38:10.049 --> 00:38:10.840
from doing a thing.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.900
Again, this is a trope
that's pretty common.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.670
After this point, they're
all like yeah, you can do it,

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.130
you're awesome, you're great.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.610
And then she gets fire,
now all of a sudden you've

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.190
got the fire skill
for this character

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.080
for the rest of the game.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.869
Any time you play the game after
that and you're using fire,

00:38:23.869 --> 00:38:26.410
there's some part of you that
might be remembering this story

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.540
moment and how important
the story moment was.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.456
It's being linked back
into the game mechanics

00:38:30.456 --> 00:38:31.380
really, really well.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.380
But it always happens.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.500
Every time you play the
game, that's embedded.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.310
That's always going to happen.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.970
One more video.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.380
Here is an emergent event.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.370
Has anybody seen this video?

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:43.451
Everyone recognizes
the game though, yeah?

00:38:49.116 --> 00:38:49.782
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:49.782 --> 00:38:51.243
-All right, guys.

00:38:51.243 --> 00:39:00.400
And just for video here, I'm
getting some mushrooms on hand

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.010
to make indefinite fire.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.460
PROFESSOR: So indefinite
fire, that's cool.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:12.830
--[INAUDIBLE] or a
castle. [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.610
PROFESSOR: Here comes the room.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.490
-The bedroom.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.990
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:32.954
So let's go ahead and
just make a fireplace.

00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:38.960
They're already made it,
as you see, is intact here.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.410
That's the swimming pool.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.370
So yeah.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:47.000
Now all you need is
some flint and a log,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.850
and just to chop down
a tree to get a log.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:57.470
Oh yeah, [INAUDIBLE]
and to the fire.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:02.364
And I always, or mostly-- uh oh.

00:40:02.364 --> 00:40:07.554
AUDIENCE: I knew that
was going to happen.

00:40:07.554 --> 00:40:10.039
-Crap.

00:40:10.039 --> 00:40:15.009
PROFESSOR: He gets
some water to try it.

00:40:15.009 --> 00:40:17.494
-Uh oh.

00:40:17.494 --> 00:40:18.985
Sorry.

00:40:18.985 --> 00:40:19.979
Sorry guys.

00:40:19.979 --> 00:40:22.464
This was not supposed to happen.

00:40:28.925 --> 00:40:36.877
And--

00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:39.920
-Yeah.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.512
What the hell just happened.

00:40:42.512 --> 00:40:44.672
AUDIENCE: Fire.

00:40:44.672 --> 00:40:45.963
-You have got to be kidding me.

00:40:48.847 --> 00:40:49.430
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:50.690
PROFESSOR: There is a
system within the game

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.260
that fire burns pretty
much anything it touches,

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.599
that's wood, and it
just travels, right.

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:58.140
You set this little system up,
you use it the way you use it,

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.705
and in this case,
he tried to tell

00:41:00.705 --> 00:41:02.580
a story of building a
fire, and it turned out

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.320
he burned his house down.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.506
You also see this
Minecraft, the Creepers.

00:41:08.506 --> 00:41:10.130
Everybody hears that
hiss of a Creeper,

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.380
especially after
you've built something.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.780
You've got this tension,
this moment of panic.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.155
That's all a
memorable game event

00:41:16.155 --> 00:41:18.363
that you're going to tell
another person after you've

00:41:18.363 --> 00:41:19.240
played the game.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.030
And especially
these days, you're

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:23.750
going to record it onto
YouTube and put it online.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.020
This was, I think,
from 2010, because it's

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.240
an alpha build of Minecraft.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.130
Continuing on the
theme, here's the Sims.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:36.190
Has anybody had this
happen to them in The Sims?

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.690
They're just trying
to have a party,

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:40.064
they're trying to meet their
Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:41.190
right?

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.390
They're trying to love
and belong to each other,

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.870
and build some esteem, and
self-actualize themselves,

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.010
but they forgot about
the safety part of it.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:51.280
So the oven blew up and
their fire happened,

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.790
and they all burned and died.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:59.230
Common trope with The Sims.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.590
Another example I love.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.690
Anybody played Far Cry 2?

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:04.060
Yeah?

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.020
So fire exists in Far Cry 2.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.840
I love fire.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.310
Far Cry 2 takes place in Africa.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:12.521
You're a mercenary, you're
going to find a warlord

00:42:12.521 --> 00:42:14.020
and kill him at the
end of the game.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.490
That's basically what
you're trying to do.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.073
You have different
ways of doing that,

00:42:17.073 --> 00:42:18.876
different means of doing that.

00:42:18.876 --> 00:42:20.500
You are in the
savannah, it's very dry,

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.610
you can burn the
savannah, it's great.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:27.470
And you can use that to get
past machine gun emplacement,

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:29.610
or set a trap for somebody.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:34.080
In game character, not
another PC, but in game.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.560
In an early version of
this, an early test,

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.872
playtesters set fire to the
savannah, and then 10, 15,

00:42:41.872 --> 00:42:44.645
20 minutes later it said
OK, you won the game.

00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:47.310
What happened?

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.080
Fire spread.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.300
The boss was set in
the fire, in dry grass.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.900
The fire spread all the
way through the game,

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.320
the many, many miles,
square miles of gameplay,

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.874
and it killed the boss
and ended the game.

00:43:00.874 --> 00:43:03.290
I really wish they had kept
that in, or a version of that.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:06.750
They ended up reducing the
spread of fire because of that,

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.270
they moved the
character from it.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.730
But that's a game event they
could have capitalized on.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:12.740
That's a piece of
emergent storytelling

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.170
that's going on that people
tell the story to each other.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:19.220
In the developer circles
I heard about this in GDC

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.170
the year after this came out.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.810
That's a great one.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.360
So that's game events.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.160
Next up micronarratives.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.970
These are similar,
but different.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.670
A micronarrative is
basically a little bit

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.870
of storytelling inside of
the game that, again, really,

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:35.520
really small.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.645
So maybe it's an animation.

00:43:36.645 --> 00:43:38.430
In this case, this
is Jet Set Willy.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.040
In Jet Set Willy,
you are a rich guy.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.470
You made all your money in
the previous game by mining,

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.740
and you came home, and you've
invited a bunch of friends

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.060
to your house and you had
this awesome raucous party.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.630
And you trashed the place.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:52.702
Unfortunately, you rent.

00:43:52.702 --> 00:43:54.660
You rent a mansion instead
of buying a mansion.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.701
And you're trying to go
to bed, and your landlady

00:43:56.701 --> 00:43:59.060
is just like no, you
don't get to go to bed,

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.687
you don't get to sleep.

00:44:00.687 --> 00:44:02.270
You've got to clean
all this stuff up.

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:03.820
She doesn't say any
of that, though.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.730
This is all she does.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:10.430
Just, she's standing in front
of the bed, she's going that.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.420
This is for the ZX Spectrum.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:18.375
I think it had
64k of RAM, maybe.

00:44:18.375 --> 00:44:19.250
You can look that up.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:21.350
Maybe it's 8k,
it's really small.

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:25.174
Really bad keys,
really bad keyboard.

00:44:25.174 --> 00:44:26.090
Not a lot of graphics.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.950
That version is actually
a later version,

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:31.450
I couldn't find-- this is the
closest thing we found for what

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:32.930
it originally looked like.

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:35.055
You can really see, there's
character design there,

00:44:35.055 --> 00:44:39.047
but it's also just saying
no, you can't come back here.

00:44:39.047 --> 00:44:46.042
AUDIENCE: 16k at launch,
it did go up to 128.

00:44:46.042 --> 00:44:48.470
PROFESSOR: Now that I've
spewed all this out,

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:49.824
what can you do with all this?

00:44:49.824 --> 00:44:52.240
So I'm actually going to show
an example of a game created

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:58.020
last semester by a team in this
class for the final project.

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.480
They made a game
called Sugar Rush.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.870
What's the game about?

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:02.870
First, what's the title?

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.040
Well, I told the title.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:04.540
Sugar Rush.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.380
What's the game about?

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:14.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah, candy,
candy, candy, candy, candy.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.510
Look at him and all that candy.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:17.890
And it's a kid.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.660
So title, character
design, all working really

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.590
well right there.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.790
Here's the game premise.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.870
One day, strange
leafy beasts spawn

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:28.880
from four mysterious
portals, and they

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.980
plundered the villages,
terrorizing Candyland.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.610
What do you think you're
going to have to do?

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.020
Kill the vegetables.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.400
And they're mean,
because look at them.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.390
So mean.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.630
Now, when we say,
we said don't use

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:47.110
cutscenes, that doesn't mean
we say don't use exposition.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:49.590
A simple screen with a
little bit instructions.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:52.830
Basically, we told them,
have an instruction screen.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:54.580
This was part of their
instruction screen.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.621
They had the screen that
says these are the keys,

00:45:56.621 --> 00:45:58.490
but also, this is what you do.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.950
Really, really useful.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.160
We want something that fulfills
that for a game the way

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.644
it's necessary for your game.

00:46:04.644 --> 00:46:07.060
The difference between a game
that has something like this

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.601
and doesn't have
something like this,

00:46:08.601 --> 00:46:10.214
is basically it's
a level of polish.

00:46:10.214 --> 00:46:12.380
A game that has a little
bit of exposition like this

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.490
feels a little
bit more concrete.

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.880
It just feels like
it's more complete,

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.470
there's more
thought put into it.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.680
It just feels a
little bit richer.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.310
It's still playable without it,
it doesn't need this screen,

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:27.590
but this screen's
really, really helpful.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.720
And the game play itself.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.170
It has mechanics that are
consistent with the design.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:35.810
You are a kid, you
are fighting a tomato.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.630
What do you fight with?

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.640
You have weapons, what are
your weapons made out of?

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.940
Candy.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.990
How do you heal yourself?

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:45.320
You eat candy.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.750
How do you make new weapons?

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.160
You combine and craft candy.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.630
Everything's revolving
around that premise of candy

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.140
is the world.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.010
You are the lone human being
in this world that we see.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:59.660
And so it's not
like Adventure Time,

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.660
you're not harvesting
candy from candy people.

00:47:05.139 --> 00:47:06.680
The weird thing
about it, I think you

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.490
when you kill vegetables,
you take the candy from them.

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:11.472
Maybe they're
stealing your candy?

00:47:11.472 --> 00:47:13.680
Yeah, you are stealing the
candy, it says plundering.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.100
A ha, they thought ahead.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.316
And yeah, the health points.

00:47:18.316 --> 00:47:20.566
What are the health points
called, if you can read it?

00:47:20.566 --> 00:47:21.585
AUDIENCE: Blood sugar.

00:47:21.585 --> 00:47:22.607
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:22.607 --> 00:47:23.440
Really simple stuff.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.356
Really, really simple.

00:47:24.356 --> 00:47:26.500
Just theming it,
thinking about what

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.760
you call things, how you call
things, where you place things,

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.360
what verbs you're using.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.660
All that ties into the game.

00:47:37.935 --> 00:47:39.310
Here's another
student made game,

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:41.010
it was actually made
by a larger team

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:42.260
over the course of the summer.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.660
So they actually had nine
weeks to make the game.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.730
And they had dedicated
artists on this game.

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:49.550
But this is a game
called Gumbeat which

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:51.570
we have our website there.

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:55.260
You are a little girl going
around chewing bubblegum

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.771
in this idyllic land
that, I don't think,

00:47:58.771 --> 00:48:00.270
there's an information
sign up there

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:01.840
that says keep the place clean.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.110
Basically, gum's not allowed.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.670
It's not clean.

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.280
But you go around,
you recruit people.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.040
You blow bubble gum in front of
them, they say pop the bubble,

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.640
you pop it, they're like
sweet, I'm joining you.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.152
And then they trail behind you.

00:48:15.152 --> 00:48:17.110
And you see on the right
there, a little guard.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.990
Metal Gear Solid style, he's
got his own line of sight,

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:23.170
if he sees you, he's going to
chase you down and hit you.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:27.020
Early in the
development, someone--

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:33.160
so if you pop the bubble on
somebody, like on your friend,

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.330
they'll get stuck with gum.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.300
You pop the bubble on the guard,
they'll get stuck with gum

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.020
and they'll not be able to move.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.050
But we found if you put the
bubble gum on the guard,

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:45.570
and you have a guard, basically
a second guard looking

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:51.530
for people, all the AI
was was if gum, attack.

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:56.034
Guard with gum found
the guard, attacked.

00:48:56.034 --> 00:48:57.450
They didn't even
think about this,

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:59.908
this wasn't a feature they were
planning, it just happened.

00:48:59.908 --> 00:49:02.400
And it happened in the space
of gameplay, play testing,

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.250
just like that
fire in Far Cry 2.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.250
Except in this case,
they're like, that's really

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:08.139
freaking awesome.

00:49:08.139 --> 00:49:09.930
We are going to polish
the crap out of that

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.340
and make that a really
interesting feature

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:13.887
in the game.

00:49:13.887 --> 00:49:15.970
We're not going to tell
the player how to do that,

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:17.386
but we are going
to create a level

00:49:17.386 --> 00:49:20.040
design that encourages the
player to experiment with that.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.998
So that's where you get
that kind of game play.

00:49:21.998 --> 00:49:24.730
So play testing is a way to
discover emergent game events.

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:27.271
So that's why we're asking to
play test your game, especially

00:49:27.271 --> 00:49:29.900
people who are not you, is
to see what-- you've created

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.830
this amazing
possibility space, you

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:33.850
can't explore the entire
thing on your own.

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:36.030
They might see something
and not knowing

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:37.799
what the game is
possible to do and what

00:49:37.799 --> 00:49:39.340
you should be doing
in the game, they

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.990
might come up with some cool
things to do in the game.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:45.000
So play testing is key.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.837
Lastly, not a student game, but
another favorite of mine, FTL.

00:49:50.837 --> 00:49:52.920
There is a story to FTL
that's really complicated,

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.460
and I'm not asking you to try
to emulate that sort of thing.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.372
It's really hard.

00:49:57.372 --> 00:49:59.330
It's a lot of detail and
it's a lot of writing.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.070
A lot of thought being put into
this randomized event thing.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.680
But there's a
feature in the game

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.830
that I'm showing here
right now that is only

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.330
used on this screen.

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:11.960
It's probably kind of-- it was
probably a high price for them

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.590
to put the feature in.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.257
Can you-- maybe
you can't read it.

00:50:15.257 --> 00:50:16.840
Actually, you can't
read it that well.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.170
Basically, you can change
the name of the characters.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:20.920
This is something that
strategy games have

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.830
had for a long period of time.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:28.540
I think we remember through
XCOM back in '93, '94.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.220
Earlier?

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.740
No, '94.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:31.970
So you name your characters.

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:33.790
If you name your
characters, you might

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:36.870
be more inclined to make
stories of their game play.

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:40.680
So I've got my ship as the good
ship GameLab with my buddies

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.980
Andrew, Philip, and
Sarah, and we're

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.729
going to be awesome
and take down--

00:50:44.729 --> 00:50:46.020
are you taking down the empire?

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.090
I can never remember.

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:47.780
Empire or rebel?

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.020
Are you a rebel or
are you the empire?

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.103
AUDIENCE: You are a rebel.

00:50:50.103 --> 00:50:52.550
PROFESSOR: We're the rebel, OK.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.392
AUDIENCE: No, actually,
I think you're--

00:50:54.392 --> 00:50:55.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you're the empire.

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:56.840
You're trying to
take down the rebels.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.423
AUDIENCE: You have
to run from rebels.

00:50:58.423 --> 00:51:01.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.745
OK, cool.

00:51:02.745 --> 00:51:04.870
So one thing that sometimes
happens with this game,

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:07.290
though, some players are
going to optimize it.

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:08.790
What did they name
their characters?

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.950
Pilot, Shields, Engines.

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:15.882
Who's dying?

00:51:15.882 --> 00:51:17.090
Looks like the pilot's dying.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:18.380
How do you know?

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.192
It's named Pilot.

00:51:21.192 --> 00:51:22.650
I forget if you
can-- I don't think

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:25.550
you can rename characters
when you bring them back

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:26.770
on your ship.

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:27.770
I should looked that up.

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.910
If anybody plays,
take a look at that.

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.819
But you can get new
characters later on.

00:51:31.819 --> 00:51:34.360
Whether or not you can name them
or not, you might name them,

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.370
you might not name them.

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:39.090
But either way, they've
spent a lot of time and money

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:41.690
putting this feature in, some
players aren't going to use it.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:43.000
So what do you do?

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.480
You blow shit up.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:50.210
The game is basically
about traveling the ship,

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:53.080
things catch on
fire, and hopefully,

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.860
maybe they're not
concerned about Pilot,

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.980
but they are concerned
about their ship.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.972
So give them these cool little
game events to keep them going.

00:51:59.972 --> 00:52:01.930
GUEST SPEAKER: So one of
the interesting things

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:04.744
about this kind of story
is that it's actually--

00:52:04.744 --> 00:52:06.160
for all that you're
talking about,

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.120
it does take time and
money to create it,

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.620
but it's actually
pretty cheap to be

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.610
able to let players
name their characters.

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.114
But it's even
cheaper to do it, FTL

00:52:13.114 --> 00:52:15.030
did at the beginning,
where they automatically

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:16.114
name all their characters.

00:52:16.114 --> 00:52:17.863
When you get a random
human, the character

00:52:17.863 --> 00:52:19.720
isn't named human
number 38, the character

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.721
is named Fred or something.

00:52:21.721 --> 00:52:23.970
And that was actually
originally from the Kickstarter.

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:26.550
Backers got to have their names
in, which is kind of cool.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:28.910
But it's actually worth
doing, because there

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:30.840
are certain kinds of
players will really

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.120
get into those names in a
way that you don't expect.

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.060
I've got two friends who
really get into their games.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.992
One, Marc LeBlanc,
was playing XCOM.

00:52:38.992 --> 00:52:41.200
Some of you have seen the
more recent XCOM, I assume?

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.060
But maybe not the old one?

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.910
So you can name your
characters or whatnot.

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:47.570
And it gives you some
names that you can use.

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:49.460
He had went through
the entire game,

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.410
and this is back
when games were hard,

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:56.710
so 40 to 60 hours of
gameplay, and he had

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.030
a squad of super uber soldiers.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.067
They all had names.

00:53:00.067 --> 00:53:01.900
He didn't quite have
personalities for them,

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.350
but they were kind of
like personalities.

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:07.630
And the second to final
battle, one of his top A

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.837
squad people got a
broken leg or something.

00:53:09.837 --> 00:53:12.170
And he was like, oh, that's
really annoying, because I'm

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.330
going to Mars tomorrow.

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:17.220
Well, all my guys that
are high level are gone,

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.430
but I've got these guy's
really cool equipment.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.810
Like he'd got the laser rifle of
doom and the super uber armor,

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:24.560
and so he went to his
second string squad,

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.145
the guys who were second level.

00:53:26.145 --> 00:53:29.440
He was like you, suit up,
son, you're going to Mars.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.320
Which for him was a story, and
it was all inside his head.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.626
The game didn't make that.

00:53:33.626 --> 00:53:35.000
The game did not
make that story.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.880
The designers could not
have anticipated that story.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.880
But in his head, because
he's the kind of player

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.500
who really tried to personify
his characters a little bit,

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.969
it was actually a really
big thing for him.

00:53:44.969 --> 00:53:46.510
Similarly, another
one of my friends,

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:49.480
who will probably come in for
a lecture later, Laura Baldwin,

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.910
was playing XCOM as well.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.550
Basically the same game.

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:55.949
She, in her head, kept
all the default names.

00:53:55.949 --> 00:53:57.740
The default name is a
randomized first name

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.540
and a randomized last name.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.130
And in her head, when she
saw the same last name,

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:04.256
she assumed that meant the
characters were related.

00:54:04.256 --> 00:54:06.130
Now of course this meant
nothing in the game,

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:07.202
the game didn't care.

00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:08.660
But here are the
two brothers, here

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.050
are the two sisters,
here's the married couple.

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:14.420
And so apparently in
the final, final battle,

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.447
you're going in to
destroy the big bad thing,

00:54:16.447 --> 00:54:18.530
and the big bad thing does
horrible psychic damage

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:20.920
to all of your soldiers
on the map every turn.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.236
And she was losing horribly.

00:54:22.236 --> 00:54:24.610
And the husband and wife team
made it into the final room

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:28.750
with the big brain alien,
and the wife runs in

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:32.330
and discovers the final boss.

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:35.380
And in XCOM, you
had movement points.

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:39.780
So she went in and revealed the
fog of war, here's the bad guy.

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.746
She has not enough movement
points to run away.

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:44.620
And the husband, meanwhile,
is at the doorway

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.260
with a rocket launcher.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.420
And so apparently, Laura,
the way she tells it,

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.620
she spent about 15 minutes
having a conversation

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:55.097
between these two characters.

00:54:55.097 --> 00:54:57.180
As the husband's like,
I've got a rocket launcher,

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.980
get out of the way, honey.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.375
And she's like, I don't
have enough movement points,

00:55:01.375 --> 00:55:03.500
fire the rockets.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.720
I can't.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.120
I'll kill you.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.900
I'm going to die
anway, fire the rocket.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.950
And this goes back and
forth until finally she

00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:14.920
decides all right,
boom, fires the rocket,

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.250
kills the person next to the
big bad guy, and wins the game.

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:20.570
But again, this
is because you had

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:23.130
a player who's very
cooperative, something as simple

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:24.635
as the names actually helped.

00:55:24.635 --> 00:55:27.260
Now, you can't guarantee you're
going to get players like that.

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.756
But those players do exist.

00:55:28.756 --> 00:55:30.630
And if it's easy to give
them the opportunity

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:37.820
to have that awesome experience
that she tells 20 years later,

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:38.510
do it.

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:42.122
It's relatively cheap.

00:55:42.122 --> 00:55:42.840
All right.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.060
That's it for lecture.

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.150
Any questions about
any of this stuff

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:48.605
and how it applies
to your games?

00:55:48.605 --> 00:55:49.980
Anyone have an
idea what they can

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.690
do in their game right now just
thinking about any of this?

00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:57.790
Has anybody thought about
their title, at least?

00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:58.490
Yes, now.

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:04.710
OK.

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:05.310
All right.

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:07.770
So take a couple minutes.

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:11.030
It's 2:03 right now, break.

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:12.920
Work in your teams,
whatever that might be.

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.710
We've got a test coming in at
3:00, so be ready for the test

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:16.664
at 3:00.

00:56:16.664 --> 00:56:18.580
I'll remind you maybe
five minutes beforehand.

00:56:21.485 --> 00:56:22.471
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:36.275 --> 00:56:38.840
PROFESSOR: So everyone,
raise your hand

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.680
if you are ready to
test at a workstation,

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.370
if you are ready to test.

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:44.380
So I can count off.

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.380
Two, three, four.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:49.940
One, two, one, two, kind of.

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:52.010
All right.

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:53.380
You get two more minutes.

00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:56.020
Philip, you want to talk to?

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.424
PHILLIP TAN: May I
speak to Ed's students,

00:56:58.424 --> 00:57:00.090
I don't know if you're
scattered around,

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:02.754
but it would help if
you could meet up here.

00:57:02.754 --> 00:57:03.420
You one of them?

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:07.360
Yeah, you can come here.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:11.030
So the first thing I want to say
is thank you so much for coming

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:14.470
and you may have overheard
what Rick was saying earlier,

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:17.770
this is going to be our first
digital playtest for the games.

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:19.710
There are five games,
some of the teams

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:25.047
have multiple stations,
and there's probably not

00:57:25.047 --> 00:57:27.380
going to be enough computers
for every single one of you

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:28.050
who are here.

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:29.640
So some of you may
be waiting in line,

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.470
but please be patient with
us, and we'll hopefully

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:37.980
get your feedback on at least
one or two games, if not more.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.920
It's good for you
to give us feedback

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.670
while you are playing the game.

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:47.370
So if you are-- and
the students will

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:50.070
get more specific about the
kind of feedback that they need.

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:52.550
But if something's frustrating,
if something's confusing,

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:56.660
if something's
intriguing, or you really

00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:01.410
think something looks cool or
is an interesting decision,

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:03.880
try to verbalize it so
that we can actually

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.870
realize that something's working
or something's not working.

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.400
Don't worry about our
egos at this point.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.870
We absolutely need
the harshest criticism

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:16.040
that you can possibly
give us at this point,

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.960
because it's easy for
us to change things

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.470
at this point of our project.

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:22.270
If we learned about the
same things that bother you

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:24.994
two weeks from now, reversing
all of those changes

00:58:24.994 --> 00:58:25.910
is going to be harder.

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:29.255
So please be harsh now.

00:58:29.255 --> 00:58:34.480
Other than that, if anything
is confusing, do of course

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.530
vocalize it.

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:41.510
But the people who
are making the game

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:43.960
may not tell you
what to do next,

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.830
because they want to see
if you can figure it out.

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:49.920
If you can't figure it out,
that's not a problem with you,

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.840
that's a problem with the game.

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.350
But they need to be able
to see you sort of muddle

00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:58.430
through what's already
there in order to figure out

00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:00.260
how to fix it later.

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.304
So if you do start getting
frustrated, of course,

00:59:02.304 --> 00:59:04.470
you can always say, I'm
done with this game and move

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:06.051
on to another game.

00:59:06.051 --> 00:59:07.592
PROFESSOR: That's
a very valid datum.

00:59:07.592 --> 00:59:09.010
That's a very valid datum.

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:11.040
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah,
that's very valid data.

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.422
It's like, I'm done, no more.

00:59:13.422 --> 00:59:14.380
That's absolutely fine.

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.592
It would be great to
be able to then tell

00:59:16.592 --> 00:59:20.600
the students why you're done.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.537
Maybe it's because
you feel like you've

00:59:23.537 --> 00:59:25.370
seen everything there
is to see into a game,

00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:28.020
and that's very different from,
I have no idea what's going on.

00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.080
That's two different
reasons to leave a game,

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:34.440
and they need to know
what that reason is.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:40.220
Otherwise this, by the way,
it is Creating Video Games.

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.944
It's 6-- what's
the course number?

00:59:42.944 --> 00:59:43.610
PROFESSOR: 6073.

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:48.750
PHILLIP TAN: 6073 or CMS 611.

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:51.940
As a course it is joined
humanities and computer

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:52.600
science.

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.440
And it runs the full
semester, students actually

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.696
work on four projects
for the entire semester.

00:59:57.696 --> 01:00:00.320
But the first three are really,
really short two week projects,

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.364
and this is kind of like
the mega big project.

01:00:04.364 --> 01:00:06.649
PROFESSOR: If you have
questions about the class,

01:00:06.649 --> 01:00:07.106
feel free to grab us.

01:00:07.106 --> 01:00:08.680
We're the instructors, we can
answer those questions for you.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.590
PHILLIP TAN: This is Rick,
I'm Phillip, you all know Ed,

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:15.500
and Sarah and Paulina
are over there.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:19.006
Just look for any one of us
and we'll be happy to help.

01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:21.950
PROFESSOR: So
playtest workstations,

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:25.260
stand up if you are a
computer that someone

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.850
can come to to play your
game, and testers in the back,

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:30.750
stand up if you
are a test station.

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:33.940
And testers please go
find a standing person

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:34.790
and play their game.

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:37.840
AUDIENCE: See what's
currently active on the sign.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.268
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:40.696
And it's going to come up.

01:00:44.028 --> 01:00:48.450
AUDIENCE: So for improvements,
I figured out what to do.

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:51.140
I think the instructions
are clear this time.

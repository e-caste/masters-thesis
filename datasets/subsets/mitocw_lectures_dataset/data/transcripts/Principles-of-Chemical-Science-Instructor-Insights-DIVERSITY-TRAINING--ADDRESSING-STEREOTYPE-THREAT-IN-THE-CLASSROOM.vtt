00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:10.490
CATHY L. DRENNAN: So
welcome everybody.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.450
I hope you're really excited
about this semester coming

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.360
up, and getting
involved with teaching.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.600
So I am Professor Cathy
Drennan, a professor

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.740
here at MIT in the Chemistry
and Biology Department.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.290
And I want to start today--

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.570
so this workshop is about
stereotype, stereotype threat,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.740
wise criticism,
unconscious bias.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.540
And I want to start, because
you're going to be teachers,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.040
with telling you
about my motivation

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.140
for doing this training.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.000
I think she's a chemist.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.880
Why is she standing up
here telling us about this?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.060
So as teachers, it's good
to tell your students

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.720
about your motivation.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.780
So what is my motivation?

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.220
Well, my motivation was-- this
a story from a number of years

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.530
ago, and I was asked to
attend a workshop happening

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.770
at Harvard on increasing
diversity in the sciences.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.260
And so when you went to
register for this workshop

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.210
they gave you a
homework assignment.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.890
I thought that was interesting.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.000
So my homework assignment was to
go to the chemistry department

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.490
and interview all the
undergraduates that

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.000
were members of underrepresented
minority groups.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.670
And I discovered at the time,
this was a number of years ago,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.460
there were two, and
both of these students

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.490
had transferred very recently
to other departments.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.188
So that was not the
best indication,

00:01:35.188 --> 00:01:37.480
but the students were very
interested in talking to me.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.700
And I said, I want to hear
about your experience.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.760
I want to think about what the
department could do better.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.880
Again, this is an
issue from the past.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.580
Things are a lot
better right now.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.010
So I met with these students,
and one in particular

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.230
was just really engaged with me.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.870
They're like, yes, I want
to help you figure out

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.930
what's going on, and talking
about their experience,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.990
and thought a lot about what
could have been different.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.550
And finally, came
up with this thing,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.810
and he said, I never had
a TA that believed in me.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.880
And I just thought--

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.950
I was not expecting
that response.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.660
Because I'd been
working with TAs at that

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.010
point for quite some time.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.260
And the TAs were
really wonderful.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.000
They were engaged and excited.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.610
And I just thought,
somehow the TAs--

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.960
there had been this disconnect.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.950
And I said, well, what
did the TAs say to you?

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.265
What happened?

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.490
And he thought
about it and tried

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.880
to come up with an
example, and then realized,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.000
it wasn't what they said,
it was what they didn't say.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.010
And that just stuck with me.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.870
And I thought, his TAs
probably had no idea

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.640
that he was feeling this way.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.730
Here was this kid sitting
in the classroom thinking,

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.480
no one believes that
I can do chemistry,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.730
and no one else was thinking
that but him, probably.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.200
So I said, we need
to talk about this.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.350
We need to talk
about how we can all

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.720
have classrooms where everyone
can reach their full potential.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.900
So that's what this
training is about today.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.940
We're going to start
this discussion, how

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.940
do we create classrooms
where everyone can reach

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.970
their full potential, where no
one's worried, sitting in there

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.550
really worried,
about what someone

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.530
might be thinking about them.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.900
So again, as a teacher, what
I'd like to do starting out

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.390
is give you the
take home message.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.930
I like to give you
the take-home message,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.280
tell you what I'm
going to tell you,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.720
tell you the thing
I'm going to tell you,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.220
and then tell you
what I taught you.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.400
So there's a little bit of
teacher training mixed in

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.020
with this workshop as well.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.820
All right, so take-home message.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.850
So the take-home message is
that understanding stereotype

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.670
threat and wise criticism
is essential for being

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.950
a good mentor,
supervisor, and teacher,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.310
and helps with being a good
human being, I think, as well.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.240
So that's the message.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.620
And you might think,
OK, I'm buying in,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.120
but I have no idea what you're
talking about with stereotype

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.620
threat.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.130
So let's go there first.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.630
All right.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.040
So let's look at
some definitions.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.070
First, let's look at stereotype.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.390
So stereotype is a prevalent
belief about a specific type

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.010
of individuals or a
way of doing things,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.360
which may or may
not reflect reality.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.960
So most people can
think of stereotypes.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.590
Stereotypes can be
positive or negative.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.510
Most people think of
negative stereotypes,

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.340
but actually they
can be positive.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.830
So an example of a
positive stereotype

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.140
is that MIT students are smart.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.570
I've been here almost 20
years, MIT students are smart.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.440
That's a positive stereotype.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.320
Stereotypes can
be based in truth.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.330
That is pretty true that
MIT students are smart.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.090
What about a
negative stereotype?

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.940
What is an example of
a negative stereotype?

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.000
Yes?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.625
AUDIENCE: So most
people see that jocks

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:02.120
are dumb or not so bright.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.330
So that's an example
of negative stereotype.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.910
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yes, and in
my experience, that's not true.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.680
There are a lot of
very athletic people--

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.140
something that some people
don't know about MIT

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.030
is that most people
participate in sports here.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.030
So yeah, so a negative one.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.490
Again, they can be positive,
they can be negative,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.460
they can be largely
true, or not so true.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.980
I also want to introduce the
idea of unconscious bias,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.230
because people are
talking a lot about this.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.410
And actually, when I
started this training,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.830
no one was talking about this
term, and now it's the term.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.050
So let's talk about that.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.290
So it's defined as
social stereotypes

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.370
about certain groups that
individuals form outside

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.810
of their conscious awareness.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.420
So in other words, they
don't know that they

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.800
hold these stereotypes.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.915
Unconscious bias.

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:51.290
And I think people
like this term

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.667
because it's takes
the pressure off.

00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:56.000
I didn't know I have it,
therefore, I'm not responsible.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.960
It's all good.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.283
But today, we're really
getting in there,

00:05:59.283 --> 00:06:01.700
and I feel like I've been doing
this training for a while,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.580
so I've become acutely
aware of just how

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.590
many stereotypes I have.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.303
So this is not about, oh, if
it were true, freeing ourselves

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:10.970
of these things.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.510
No.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.600
It's about making ourselves
aware that we have them,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.840
and acting in such a way that
we can counter the harm of it.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.340
All right.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.660
So stereotype threat
is the perceived risk

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.150
of confirming a
negative stereotype.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.800
So say, as a female driver
you do something stupid,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.060
and have a whole bunch
of men honking at you.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.560
Right?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.980
You're like, oh, I didn't
want to let the world--

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.010
you feel pressure of doing
everything perfectly,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.990
because you don't want to play
into the negative idea there.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.490
All right.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.300
So that's what
stereotype threat is.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.030
And I think stereotype threat
is still a good term for it,

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.850
because unconscious bias
threat doesn't really work.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.840
OK, so we're back
to stereotypes.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.340
All right.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.210
So what are we going
to talk about today?

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.450
So we're going to talk
more about these terms.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.040
We're going to
talk about the fact

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.580
that stereotype threat can
lead to underperformance.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.263
So I'm going to show you
data to support this idea.

00:07:08.263 --> 00:07:09.680
We're going to
talk about the fact

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.460
that stereotype threat
can lead to the idea

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.510
that you're being
judged unfairly.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.200
Sometimes you might
be judged unfairly,

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.570
and sometimes you're not
being judged unfairly,

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.780
but stereotype threat
can lead to that feeling

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.670
whether or not it's true.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.950
Everyone can be a victim
of stereotype threat,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.810
and everyone has stereotypes.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.590
So it affects all of us.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.200
We all hold stereotypes,
we all can be

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.390
victims of stereotype threat.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.970
This training is really
for everyone in the room.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.430
And I have to say, this
is not just about gender,

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.320
it's not just about race.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.920
It's about anything that
might make us feel different,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.060
anything that might make
us feel under a microscope.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.150
If we're different in any way
from the others around us,

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.140
this can affect everybody.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.600
So it's for everyone.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.478
This is the bad news.

00:08:09.478 --> 00:08:10.520
What about the good news?

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.970
There's always good news.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.030
There's wise criticism.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:20.390
So this has been shown to
alleviate the negative aspects

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.860
of stereotype threat.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.300
So what is it?

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.680
So wise criticism is
criticism where you explicitly

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.267
let somebody know
that they are capable,

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:32.059
or you believe they're
capable, of a higher

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.890
level of achievement.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.820
And there is data to suggest
this goes a long way.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.480
Again, if you can create
this environment of trust,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.490
if the individuals
in your classroom

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.860
feel that you believe in
them, you can criticize them--

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.750
I mean, this is important
in Mentoring Lab.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.450
Criticism is how we learn.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.060
When we don't do well,
we learn from that.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.740
It's all healthy and good.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.680
But we have to make sure that
any criticism is delivered

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.890
in such a way that
the person recognizes

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.960
that we believe in them.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.000
Again, back to the student
who never had a TA--

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.660
we need everyone to know that
we believe that the person is

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.070
able to do the work.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.340
And so, that is one way to
mitigate the negative effects.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.030
All right.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.570
So I don't know if I told
you this ahead of time,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.250
but this is an
interactive training.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.090
So we want everyone
to participate,

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.620
and think about how this has
affected me or someone I know.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.690
So what we're going
to do in a minute

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.510
is you're going to pair share.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.830
Find a group of two or three,
and turn to your neighbor

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.680
and recall a time
when you might have

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.040
felt judged by some
superficial characteristic.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.340
So it could be age,
it could be anything.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.160
So think about that or--

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.030
and maybe and/or,
you can do both--

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.888
you are worried about confirming
a negative stereotype.

00:09:59.888 --> 00:10:00.930
So that's the assignment.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.370
Think about it a little bit.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.140
You'll talk to your neighbor.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.360
I'll give you about
five minutes or so.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.730
And then we'll come
back in a group,

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.330
and hopefully some of
you will feel comfortable

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.060
sharing your experiences
with a larger group,

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.560
and we can talk about it.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.060
All right.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.540
So let's take a few minutes,
find someone, share a story.

00:10:24.246 --> 00:10:29.610
AUDIENCE: So do you guys have
any experiences like that?

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
I guess one of mine

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.610
that I started being really
aware of when I started

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.580
grad school was that I was
really worried about being

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.290
taken seriously as a scientist,
if I had a meaningful hobbies

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.760
outside of work.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.250
AUDIENCE: So I guess for
me, when I came to MIT,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.400
I was really scared by
the fact that there were

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.800
few people that looked like me.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.630
And so, that put like a
lot of pressure on me,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:06.650
and I felt that I had to
carry a whole race on my back.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.650
And also, I can
remember one meeting

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.020
that I had with one
of the professors,

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.450
and she was telling
me that, I know

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.970
that you come from
a small college,

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.060
and that your
classmates are going

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.300
to be from Berkeley and
Harvard, and so it might be

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.480
right for you at the beginning.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.130
And I feel that
really, really impacted

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.820
how I performed in
some of my classes,

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.930
and I wish that I had never
had that conversation.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.553
So, yeah.

00:11:37.553 --> 00:11:39.845
AUDIENCE: Yeah, being from
a smaller school was harder.

00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:41.840
I was also from
a smaller school,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.670
and in classes I was
always thinking--

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.650
Can I perform as
well as other people?

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.040
AUDIENCE: As well.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.890
Mm-hmm.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:51.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.730
AUDIENCE: And then being
told that you might not.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.905
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:57.050
So yeah, so you
question yourself.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.620
Sometimes you feel like you
don't really belong here.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.170
And so, yeah, it can be
hard for some people.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:07.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I had a very
similar experience to yours.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.490
I was directly told that
students from Puerto Rico

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.270
don't really do that well
in first year classes.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:17.160
And so, when I while I was
never doing terribly in class,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.630
I felt like I didn't have to
necessarily do well at all.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.960
So I would actually not try
as hard as I should have too.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.700
Just do well.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.600
AUDIENCE: Because that's what
they were expecting, right?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.955
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:31.955 --> 00:12:33.080
I think the other problem--

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.730
I've heard many people that
have had the same experience.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.110
So it's sort of like--

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I wish
that some of the professors

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.890
would understand that they're
not generally helping you

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.780
when saying these things.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.295
And maybe a training like
this wouldn't help them a lot.

00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:51.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because were
they trying to-- they're

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.690
coming from a place
of trying to help you.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.490
AUDIENCE: I think internally--

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.250
yeah, I think their
intention was to help,

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.650
but I think it's just--

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.255
AUDIENCE: Misguided.

00:13:05.255 --> 00:13:05.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.505
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:07.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.357
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's true.

00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:10.940
AUDIENCE: So a time
that I was worried

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.730
about confirming a negative
stereotype was when I first

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.290
started graduate school.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.770
I was coming from a primarily
undergraduate institution.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.920
I had never been at a
big research university.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.080
And so, I didn't really
know what to expect

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.180
or what I was
getting myself into.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.110
And I guess, when people
first explained to me

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.440
what the expectations were
in terms of how much I should

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.380
work, and what
vacation policies were,

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.810
the first time they told me
I literally laughed out loud.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.210
I didn't think they could
possibly be serious.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.560
And then I realized, whoa,
I might be in over my head.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.580
And once I realized that,
I was like, oh, man.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.080
People are going to think that
I'm not serious about my job,

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.413
and I don't know what I'm doing.

00:13:52.413 --> 00:13:55.370
So I had to pretend
all of a sudden

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.920
that I was all focused on
science, because I didn't want

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.230
people to think that I
wasn't taking it seriously

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.880
because of my background.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no, I feel
the same way coming to MIT.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.190
Especially, coming
in for me, confirming

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.590
the negative stereotype,
also just being

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.560
judged for my physical
attributes as a woman of color.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.380
I feel like there's a lot of
stereotypes, negative, around

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.718
my ethnicity and my race.

00:14:19.718 --> 00:14:21.760
And one of the things that
I heard a lot of times

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.700
it's the idea that,
you speak well,

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.990
or you're articulate
for a black woman.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.640
And this is not only my story.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.740
I've had a number
of my colleagues

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.660
say the same thing to me.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.270
So it's something that's
just constantly being battled

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.340
against a negative stereotype.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.010
And also this idea
that coming in--

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.870
a combination of
my, I like to call

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.450
it an intersectionality
of all my personalities

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.940
and all my identities.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.680
So I'm a woman of color.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.820
I am from the Caribbean.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.645
I went to a small
school, but I'm not only

00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:53.020
just a small
liberal arts school,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.850
I went to a small HBCU, which
is a historically Black college

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.570
and university.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.540
And I feel like all those
combinations also mix.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.100
Get into a classroom,
and being one

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.650
of the only persons
of color makes

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.548
me feel extra pressure
for confirming

00:15:05.548 --> 00:15:07.340
these negative stereotypes
that are thought

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.470
against people of color.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.713
So in the classrooms I
try not to ask questions,

00:15:11.713 --> 00:15:13.130
because I don't
want to out myself

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.467
as not being smart, or not as
much as my other colleagues

00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:19.050
who might have went
to bigger schools,

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.470
and have had targeted classes
on this particular subject,

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.420
for example.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.460
So it's been definitely the idea
of being the "face of the race"

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.100
also, because you don't want to
spoil it for other people who

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.670
come along.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.680
So it's been a
little bit like you

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.800
feel like you have
to not ask questions,

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.050
you're not out yourself.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.990
Anything you say might prove
that negative stereotype,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.930
and it's a lot of
pressure to do.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:44.430
So yeah.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, totally.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.940
AUDIENCE: I can't necessarily
relate to your experience,

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.360
but the flip side of
the coin on that is I

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.867
do have one sliver
of an experience

00:15:53.867 --> 00:15:55.450
where I kind of feel
like I can relate

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.658
to what you're talking about.

00:15:56.658 --> 00:15:59.270
And that's when we're having
conversations about diversity,

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.330
I feel like I don't
want to say something

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.900
that might sound ignorant,
or naive, or uninformed.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.900
Because I feel like if I end
up saying something stupid

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.510
and offending someone, I set
the conversation back a step,

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.020
and then I end up
confirming the stereotype

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.620
that all white men don't care
about improving diversity

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.490
in science.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, well,
that's very understandable.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.970
And I feel like it's
very crippling too,

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.440
because he might have really
good experiences that you want

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.440
to share, and good
contributions that you

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.080
could make in that sense.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.770
And you can't do it because
of that negative stereotype.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.020
You're really confirming that.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.270
So it's definitely
very crippling.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think it is
detrimental to the whole cause,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.515
because it takes
everybody, right?

00:16:39.515 --> 00:16:40.640
AUDIENCE: It does, it does.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.973
AUDIENCE: For all participating.

00:16:41.973 --> 00:16:43.510
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.240
AUDIENCE: OK, so I think--

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.740
let me see.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.115
Thinking about a
time when I felt

00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:50.020
judged about a
negative stereotype.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.540
So I'm pretty short.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.720
I don't know if you noticed when
I walked in, but I think that--

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.785
and I look pretty young.

00:16:56.785 --> 00:16:58.660
My sister's two years
younger, but I'm always

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.720
considered the
younger sister, and I

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.569
think that that's
led me to always

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:08.710
be really afraid of confirming
that women are weak,

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.450
or not able to do
things on their own.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:17.050
So I'm very conscious
of not asking for help

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.190
with certain situations.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.140
If I can't reach things
or things like that,

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.760
I know where all
the step-stools are.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.740
Or I've been known to climb
on shelves in grocery stores

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.150
instead of asking for help.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.360
And it's one of those situations
where I'm very much afraid,

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.030
and I often lead with the
fact that I have a black belt

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.870
in Taekwondo to
kind of help paint

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.230
this picture that I actually
can do things for myself.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.063
So, yeah.

00:17:42.063 --> 00:17:43.480
AUDIENCE: I feel
that, because I'm

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.340
literally the same way,
including the black belt.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:45.840
(LAUGHS)

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.040
AUDIENCE: It's one
thing I lead with.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.017
AUDIENCE: It's
something that kind

00:17:50.017 --> 00:17:52.100
of shocks people, because
they're like, oh, you're

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.918
so little.

00:17:53.918 --> 00:17:54.460
I don't know.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.590
I feel like I'm always
so worried about the fact

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.090
that just because
I'm so little--

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.465
and I've always
been this little,

00:17:59.465 --> 00:18:02.530
it's not like I was the
tallest person in my class--

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.960
that I need to be able to show
that I can take care of myself,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.330
and be independent, because
of this stereotype that women

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.220
can't, and need a
man to make sure

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.160
that things are OK for them.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.090
So, yeah.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.590
That's where I'm at with that.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.750
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:20.500
AUDIENCE: It's OK.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.660
I can't get taller.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, well,
when I was six years old,

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.430
I actually used to race cars.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.830
And I remember
there was a day when

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.290
I should've gotten
second place in a race,

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.020
but because the three
boys in front of me

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.890
crashed right before the end of
the race, they gave me fifth,

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.160
because they were in
second and third and fourth

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.410
before the flag went down.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.850
But then I crossed
the line first,

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.142
so I should have gotten second.

00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:49.930
Anyway, after this
whole situation is over,

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.810
one of the boys came
up to me and was like,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.610
oh, well, you're a girl.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.440
Of course you can't
get second place.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.690
And I was like, excuse me?

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.572
Yes, that was over 20 years ago.

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:02.280
AUDIENCE: And that
was when you were six.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.160
AUDIENCE: That was
when I was six.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.285
AUDIENCE: How old was the--

00:19:04.285 --> 00:19:06.820
AUDIENCE: I think he was seven.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.990
So, yeah.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.890
It's still there.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.290
So, yeah.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:10.901
Good times.

00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:12.343
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:12.343 --> 00:19:13.510
CATHY L. DRENNAN: All right.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.962
Let's come back as a group.

00:19:14.962 --> 00:19:16.420
There was a lot of
good discussion.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.040
I can't wait to hear
what you're going to say.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.780
But I thought I would start
out by sharing a story

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.510
to get us going.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.390
So in the first category, a
time that you were judged.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.510
So I think back to
a time when I was

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.300
graduating from Vassar College.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.290
These are the old days, where if
you announced who got an award,

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.860
they'd post a piece of
paper in the student union.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.800
There was no email thing
to send out to people.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.890
And so, everyone
gathered around the list

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.540
of people who had been
named Phi Beta Kappa.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.230
And I was really excited that I
had been named Phi Beta Kappa.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.638
And so, I'm leaving after
having looked at the list,

00:19:56.638 --> 00:19:58.180
and I saw someone
who I hadn't really

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.630
talked to since freshman year.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.810
He was in my dorm, and it
was one of those things

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.990
like freshman year, where
the entire floor of your dorm

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.820
like goes everywhere together.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.680
You go to the dining
hall together,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.320
you go to parties
together, because there's

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.100
this herd effect.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.040
Anyway, this guy Phillip
had been in my herd,

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.380
but I'd never actually
talked to him.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.400
So he walks up to me and he
looks at me, and he said,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.480
you were on that list.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.990
And I said, yes.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:33.240
And he just looks at
me, and then he said,

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.050
it never occurred to
me that you were smart.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.430
[SOFT LAUGHTER]

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.760
I mean you could just
see the wheels turning

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.700
like, her name is on the list!

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.330
Her name is on that list!

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.070
She's smart?

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.660
And I just thought like, what
did I do that this was such--

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.680
It's like, oh, whatever.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.680
If they saw it, they might
not have ever thought

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.550
about it one way or
another, but clearly, he

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:09.080
had formed an extremely strong
opinion that there was no way

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.990
that I could be smart,
and this was just

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:15.710
messing with his worldview, the
fact my name was on the list.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.930
So what was it about
me that was just

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:22.280
so inconceivable to this
person that I could be smart?

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:29.000
OK, so in the second category,
pretend you're at MIT.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.270
In the Chemistry Department at
the point where I was coming up

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.580
for tenure, there was
one female professor

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.560
who had gotten
tenure, and then they

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.660
had hired two more
in with tenure.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.310
So I was number two.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.570
Case study.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.130
Would she get tenure?

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.780
And I felt like they
were all watching.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.670
Is she going to meetings?

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.160
How many papers
has she published?

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.180
Is she going to make it?

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:50.930
What do you think?

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:51.860
Lay in the bets.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.640
What are the odds?

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.120
I don't know.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.110
There probably were odds.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.235
I don't know what they are.

00:21:55.235 --> 00:21:56.750
I never want to know.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.350
But I just felt like,
man, my not getting tenure

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.170
it's not really
about me anymore.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.410
It's, can women get tenure?

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.610
And it was all riding
on my shoulders.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.430
I was going to
provide the answer,

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.552
and people would make
decisions about their lives,

00:22:12.552 --> 00:22:14.260
I was afraid, based
on whether it worked.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.385
Oh, it didn't work for her.

00:22:15.385 --> 00:22:17.750
I'm not sure I
want to go forward.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.220
That is a lot of
pressure when you

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:24.540
feel like you're carrying other
people besides yourself around.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.160
So that's an example for me.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:26.660
All right.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.780
So you don't have to have
as profound examples,

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.090
but everyone has some
Phillip in their life, right?

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.260
Has somebody like that.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.170
So let's hear.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:39.194
Who wants to share about this?

00:22:39.194 --> 00:22:40.423
Yeah?

00:22:40.423 --> 00:22:42.340
AUDIENCE: So in addition
to being a scientist,

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.730
I'm also a musician, and
when I got to grad school

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.400
I felt really insecure
about having this hobby,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.410
and thought that I might not be
seen as serious of a scientist

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.390
because I like to
play music as well.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.560
And so, I downplayed my hobby,
and didn't join ensembles

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.060
as much.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.310
But even then, when I
started in grad school

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.870
participating in
an ensemble, I was

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.790
really worried I'd
confirm the stereotype

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.880
that just because I
was also a musician,

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.833
I was less serious
of a scientist.

00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:14.000
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yeah,
thanks for bringing that up.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.910
I think that's a
really great example.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.080
So it's just we
have these ideas,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.780
and it's like we have these
square holes and round holes,

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.930
and we're trying to
bat everybody into it.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.970
There's many different
things that people

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.260
can do if they're scientists.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.840
There's many different
hobbies and other interests

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.340
that they can have,
and we shouldn't

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.500
have such a narrow definition.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.865
So someone else?

00:23:39.865 --> 00:23:41.680
I heard lots of
discussion going on.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.730
Yeah?

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.220
AUDIENCE: So in
terms of being judged

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.280
by someone for a superficial
characteristic, as an African--

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.860
Afro-Caribbean I should say--

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.090
woman in the scientific
setting, I feel like one thing

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:59.260
I get a lot is that,
you speak very well.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.840
And usually I'm like, for?

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.550
Why?

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:07.170
But I think it's definitely
I'm clearly a minority,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:12.670
so basically there's
some negative stereotypes

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.070
about whole women of color
should present themselves,

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.380
and I don't fit in
to that stereotype.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:23.230
So every time I do give a talk
or I do express my opinions,

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.090
people say I'm very well-spoken.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.480
And this is not
only my own case.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.900
I've heard a number
of my friends

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.530
say the same things, even
sometimes from their advisors

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.390
and people who have gone
through a lot of students.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.310
So that's one case
where I feel like I've

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:43.868
been judged superficially for
a superficial characteristic.

00:24:43.868 --> 00:24:45.910
Another thing of confirming
a negative stereotype

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.540
also comes back to my ethnicity.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.590
You mentioned feeling like you
carry the weight of persons

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.130
on your back, and
thinking about being,

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.320
again, an African-American
woman, most of the time

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.720
the only one in a room.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.220
Not today.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.345
That's great.

00:25:07.345 --> 00:25:09.720
But most of the time it's
being the only one in the room.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.250
And especially coming
from a small college,

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.650
I also felt coming into my
first chemistry classes,

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.170
there was this pressure
that I put on myself to not

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.047
confirm these negative
stereotypes about people

00:25:20.047 --> 00:25:21.880
of color in terms of
that they're not smart,

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.680
or they're not good
at math or science,

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.310
and I didn't belong there.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:29.170
And it's not because people
around me said anything.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.940
It was definitely
internal that I

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.650
felt like I had to
not answer a question,

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:37.060
or not ask a question because
I didn't want to look as if I

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.940
didn't know something,
or all my classmates

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.560
knew it and I didn't know it.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.170
So it's that weight
of one, not confirming

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.270
that negative stereotype,
and also not spoiling it

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.640
for everybody else
who comes after me

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.867
who is a URM from an HBCU.

00:25:51.867 --> 00:25:52.825
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:25:52.825 --> 00:25:54.370
Those are both really
great examples.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.350
Thank you for sharing those.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.720
I think that really gets
to the heart of what

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.990
we're trying to talk about.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:06.858
Feeling judged, and you
get these compliments--

00:26:06.858 --> 00:26:08.650
and I've gotten this
for some of the talks.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.220
It's like, that was
actually pretty good!

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.970
What was your expectation
ahead of time?

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.610
Or, you spoke well!

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.790
Like, thank you.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:26.410
Yeah, and that
extra pressure to--

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.040
who else is coming
along with us?

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.470
So thank you for sharing those.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.540
That's really great.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.235
Maybe one more.

00:26:32.235 --> 00:26:34.360
Does someone else have
something you want to share?

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.280
Yeah?

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.530
AUDIENCE: When I
participate in conversations

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.140
about improving
diversity in science,

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.070
a lot of times I'll worry that
if I ask an uninformed question

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:49.000
or make a naive suggestion that
I'll set the conversation back

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.250
or offend somebody,
and ultimately

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.880
confirm the stereotype that
white male scientists aren't

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.250
serious about improving
diversity in science.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.290
So then I'll tell
myself, just sit back

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:00.905
and listen to other people.

00:27:00.905 --> 00:27:02.530
And then as soon as
I start doing that,

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.350
I'll start to worry, how
are people perceiving this?

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.020
Do I look sullen and like
I don't care about this?

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.670
And then, again,
I worry that I'm

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.140
confirming a
different stereotype

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.380
about white men in science.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:12.405
[SOFT LAUGHTER]

00:27:12.405 --> 00:27:14.620
So I think ultimately,
it's important for me

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:19.960
to remember that my voice is
overrepresented in science,

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.290
and I should make a concerted
effort to actively listen

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.350
to other people's
perspectives, but also

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.553
recognize that by spending so
much mental energy worrying

00:27:29.553 --> 00:27:31.470
about how other people
might be perceiving me,

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.260
I'm ultimately undermining
my own ability to make

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.710
a positive contribution towards
improving diversity in science.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.585
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Thank
you for sharing that.

00:27:40.585 --> 00:27:43.150
I think that's a
really good point.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:47.830
I've had people, when I've done
this training before, a man say

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.550
that he felt very much under
sort of stereotype threat

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.300
when he was taking a
woman's study course,

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.330
and he was the only
guy in the class.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.940
And that sometimes he
felt like if he spoke up

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.160
and what he said, that
he was going to really

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.710
be judged by it, and it was just
a very uncomfortable situation.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.180
And I really feel like
what we want to do here

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.350
is start the discussion.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.780
Everyone's voice
is so important.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.400
And sometimes it
drives me crazy when

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.160
I'm hearing about women
in science, it's like, OK,

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.540
you, woman, go fix this.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.080
It's like, I can't do this.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.620
I think we all need to
be talking about this

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.850
and doing this together.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.520
These problems are not
problems for women to solve,

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.440
or for people of color to solve.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.210
We want to improve science.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.040
We all need to be part
of this discussion,

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.230
and everyone's voice
is so important.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.500
So we want to have a
situation where everyone feels

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.780
like they can
speak, and everyone

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.060
is going to listen to what
other people have to say.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.800
So very on point.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.010
Thank you very much.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:43.510
All right.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.840
So I think we should
get back, and we

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.480
want to go back because I
have some data to show you.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.710
And this is MIT, and
we're scientists,

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.080
so let's look at some data.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.580
All right.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.450
So there is a book by
Claude Steele called

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.910
Whistling Vivaldi, and
Other Clues as to How

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.070
Stereotypes Affect Us.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.460
Claude Steele is often viewed
as the father of stereotype

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.490
threat, really coming
up with this concept

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.620
and making people aware of it.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.095
And his book has a
lot of data in it.

00:29:14.095 --> 00:29:15.220
A lot of different studies.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.460
He summarizes studies that many
different people have done.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:23.620
So some of the studies are more
social studies, some of them

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.260
are more in the
neuroscience area.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.920
So some studies that
he describes actually

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.880
look at brain waves and
blood flow in the brain.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.970
And so, they will put people
under stereotype threat,

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.910
and there's a variety
of ways you can do it,

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.850
poking at those
negative stereotypes

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:47.350
that we talked about, and
then actually watch blood flow

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.790
or brain activity.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.270
And you can see movement
from the part of the brain

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.370
where it's about
logic and reasoning,

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.320
to, when people are
under stereotype

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.310
threat, the part of the brain
that's about fear, about fight

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.610
or flight.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.360
And so when you're
in the classroom,

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.640
the goal is all the students
their brain is with logic,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.140
right?

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.970
They're processing
the information

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.290
and they're learning.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.940
You don't want people
in your classroom

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.020
where the brain is very
anxious, and worrying about

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.400
whether you belong and
whether you can do it.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.110
So there's an actual biological
reason why stereotype threat

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.508
can lead to underperformance.

00:30:24.508 --> 00:30:26.800
Your brain's not doing what
your brain should be doing.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.970
It should be in the logic
area, not in the fear area.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:35.560
So this is one thing that's
talked about in his book.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.160
So anyway.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.560
So some of the
studies that he did,

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.220
it was groups of
female undergrads.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.800
Stanford quite a good school.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.960
People who get in there,
very smart people.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.030
And so, he looked at the SAT
scores of a group of women,

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.220
and then he divided
them into two groups.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.440
And they should have
equal math abilities

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.820
based on their SAT scores.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.170
So for one group,
he either reminded

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.510
them of their gender before
the exam, and in some case,

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:05.890
didn't say anything at all.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.290
But in the second
group, he told them

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:11.350
that the exam had
no gender bias.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.210
And so, he would
start out saying,

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.000
well, you may have heard
that women often underperform

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.390
on SATs in the math, but
we've been working here,

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.550
and we've created
a math exam that

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.900
has no gender bias,
so everyone can do up

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.510
to their full ability.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.610
There's nothing
holding you back.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.610
And what was really interesting
that this group performed

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.228
very well compared to the other
group that was either reminded

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:38.770
of their gender, or
sometimes nothing

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.330
was said about gender at all.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.700
So when these women
thought that they

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.010
could do as well
as they could do,

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.820
they over-performed or
outperformed the other group.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.290
So there's a number
of these kinds

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.150
of studies done
in different ways

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.540
showing again that
if you feel like you

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.300
can reach your full
performance, you get there.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.790
But if you're reminded
of these issues,

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.483
and that you might be confirming
a negative stereotype,

00:32:06.483 --> 00:32:07.900
or you're worried
about confirming

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.490
a negative stereotype, it
can lead to poor performance.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:11.990
All right.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:16.370
So stereotype threat can
lead to underperformance,

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:21.430
which is a problem in
a classroom, for sure.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.200
The other point that
I brought up before,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.110
and I want to come back
to, is that it can also

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.130
lead to a feeling of
being judged unfairly.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:31.810
And this is one of
my favorite studies,

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.300
and it's back from the 1980s.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.740
So in this study they
said, all right, we

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.770
want to address the
differences-- how people

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:46.570
are treated if they have some
kind of physical disfigurement,

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.873
in particular, a
scar on your face.

00:32:48.873 --> 00:32:50.290
So he said, what
we're going to do

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.230
is we're going to bring in a
makeup artist from Hollywood,

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.410
they're going to put
a scar on your face,

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:59.260
and then we're going to
send you into this room

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.840
and we're going to
watch the interactions.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.210
And we want you to
tell us, are you

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.890
being treated
differently because you

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:07.810
have this scar on your face?

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.390
So the volunteers sat
in front of the mirror.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.000
They had the makeup
artist come and this scar

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.560
was put on their face.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.350
And then right before they
were supposed to go in,

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.920
the makeup artist
came back and said,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.503
we're just going to touch it up,
make sure you're ready to go.

00:33:21.503 --> 00:33:25.720
They removed it entirely,
but the person had no idea.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.660
They thought that the scar
was still on the face.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:34.360
Went into the room, there
was a discussion, came out.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.520
The volunteer said, oh, I was
treated entirely differently

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.582
with this scar on my face.

00:33:40.582 --> 00:33:41.790
And other people had watched.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.560
There was nothing going on.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.060
But they were just sensing--

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.490
they were looking
for signs that they

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.170
were being treated unfairly.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.420
And when you look for
things, sometimes you

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:56.190
can find them or interpret them,
when they don't really exist.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:59.160
So right now, some
people are sitting,

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.580
might have their arms
crossed a little bit.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:06.780
And if I were an insecure
person, I could say,

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.060
that person's sitting
there is thinking

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:13.199
there is nothing this woman has
to tell me that I want to hear.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.219
And they just are
sitting like that.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.600
But then I also know it's
a little cold in this room.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.520
Someone might just
be a little bit cold,

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.800
and that's why they're
sitting like this, right?

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.530
You can interpret
all sorts of things.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:29.489
If you're looking for a sign
that somebody is questioning

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:33.977
you, you might be able to find
it even when it's not there.

00:34:33.977 --> 00:34:35.310
And sometimes it's really there.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.810
Sometimes people are judging.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:37.350
Oh, yeah.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:37.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:39.830
We can have stories later.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.065
But sometimes they're not.

00:34:42.065 --> 00:34:43.690
So I just want to
give you one example.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.540
So this is the other counter--

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.449
a guide to reducing
stereotype threat

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:52.000
and maximizing student
performance, also

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.780
a guide to Cathy's most
embarrassing moments.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:59.680
But there was one time I was
meeting with a professor,

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.740
I was pre-tenure.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.920
Again, I wanted to get tenure.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.420
Very nervous about
this whole thing.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.753
And so, this person in my
field, likely a letter-writer,

00:35:06.753 --> 00:35:07.990
is coming to my office.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:09.220
And I was really excited.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.950
So I was like, I had results
that he was going to like.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.600
I knew he would
like these results.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.940
I printed him out,
like these slides.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.710
I had everything all ready.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.450
I thought through my spiel.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.220
I was psyched.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.490
He he came.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.990
And so he came
in, he's like, I'm

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:24.460
so glad you're here visiting.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.043
This is great.

00:35:25.043 --> 00:35:26.877
I have these new results
I want to show you,

00:35:26.877 --> 00:35:27.730
and I pull this out.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.970
And he goes, you know,
I was sort of wondering,

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.510
how's your experience been here?

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.470
I was like, good, good.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.100
Very good.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.790
Now, we had this result--

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:37.720
and he's like, but I
had some questions.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.190
Do you feel like
you've been treated OK?

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.420
30 minutes went by.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.660
He did not look at a
single result that I had.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.910
And I just thought,
this guy has just

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:52.500
decided that there is no
result that I could possibly

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.310
have that would be interesting
enough to pay attention to.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.220
And so, he's just going to
spend this half hour chatting

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.060
about this and that, and things
about me being a junior faculty

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:09.590
member, whatever, and just
clearly disrespectful of me.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.140
So that was my take.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.710
Find out later he has a son
that's starting as an Assistant

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:15.730
Professor.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:19.510
He wants to give his son advice,
but he hasn't been an Assistant

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.770
Professor for a long time.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:22.060
Things have changed.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.935
So he said, when I go to
talk to Cathy Drennan,

00:36:24.935 --> 00:36:26.560
I'm going to ask her
a lot of questions

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.270
about being an
Assistant Professor,

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:31.810
because she has been so
hugely successful that I

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:34.870
want to take how
she's done things

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.240
and tell my son about it.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.680
So I could not have
been more wrong.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.230
I thought he was
judging me unfairly.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:47.840
Turns out, that was
not the case at all.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.780
And so, because other people--

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.850
I've one male professor explain
to another male professor

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.950
my data without involving
me in the discussion,

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:58.810
because what could I
possibly know about it?

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:01.390
So I've had these
experiences, but then I'm

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:03.770
looking for these
experiences in other places,

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.410
and sometimes they're
not there at all.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.600
Sometimes a person
is being respectful.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.260
So when you feel like you're
under stereotype threat,

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:16.270
you can sometimes take a
situation entirely incorrectly.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.290
Now, he could have
also said, hey, Cathy,

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.770
you've been so successful.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.420
Let me ask you questions.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.210
That could have-- but whatever.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.320
Whatever.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.970
So I think this
is something also

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.620
to think about, that people
are looking to each other like,

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.375
do you trust?

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:33.250
Do you believe in me?

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.020
Do you trust what
I'm going to say?

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.210
We're trying to get
a sense of this.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:40.480
And sometimes we
may get it wrong,

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.760
and sometimes it
may not be there,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.530
but everyone in the
classroom is not the same.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.030
Even if you treat
everyone the same,

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.430
they're not always the
same, because people

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.840
are coming in with baggage.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.510
And I've got baggage,
let me tell you.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:53.620
I got some baggage.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.350
I'll put my baggage up
against your baggage,

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:59.130
but everyone is coming
in with something.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:37:59.820
All right.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.090
So I think you already know
the answer to this one.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.490
Who can be a victim
of stereotype threat?

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.802
ENTIRE AUDIENCE: Everyone!

00:38:06.802 --> 00:38:08.135
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yes, everyone.

00:38:08.135 --> 00:38:09.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.280
In fact, studies show that it's
the strongest students that

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.870
are the most affected.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.660
So if you care about
what people think of you,

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.510
if you care about doing
well, if you're ambitious,

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:24.440
if you want to do important
things in your life,

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.970
you care about these
kinds of things.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:28.880
And if you're at
a place that has

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.880
a good reputation,
like MIT, that

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.830
can lead to imposter syndrome.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.620
So most you've probably
heard of imposter syndrome

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.680
before, but this
idea that somehow

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.230
you were only accepted to MIT--

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.953
your name is like
someone else, and they

00:38:43.953 --> 00:38:45.120
weren't going to accept you.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.140
But then they made this mistake
and then somehow you got in,

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.450
said the person who was
below you in the line when

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:51.860
they were supposed to get in.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.710
And that everyone else here
is brilliant except for you,

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.500
and someday that
people are going

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.320
to figure out that you're
trying to look like a nerd--

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.340
or a horse.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.400
You know, you've got
your horse stockings on

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.260
and your horse cape.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.270
Or your zebra cape
and your zebra

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.650
stockings, but you're
not really a zebra.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.240
And that you're wearing
your nerdiest clothes,

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.210
but you're really
not an MIT nerd.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:21.770
So this is something that so
many people at top universities

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:25.400
are affected by, and
this is really important

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.280
when people are, again,
under stereotype threat.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.920
They're feeling like, man, I'm
the only one who doesn't really

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.480
belong here.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.990
So imposter syndrome.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.490
OK.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.900
Another teaching tip, because
you'll all be teaching.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.360
Before you teach on
something, look up

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.600
what it says on Wikipedia.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.890
Just double check what it says.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:49.220
So what do you
think Wikipedia says

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.360
of the people who are most
affected by imposter syndrome?

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.490
What particular group?

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.090
Any guesses?

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:01.290
Men?

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:02.207
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:02.207 --> 00:40:03.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.090
Graduate students.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.750
Someone has been
googling Wikipedia.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.000
That is, in fact, correct.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.590
So a lot of people
say, oh, it's women.

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:20.740
But the data actually shows that
men and women suffer equally,

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.280
which is not really
my experience.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.680
I think that if this is true,
it's just that women talk about

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.050
it all the time and men don't.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.240
But apparently, the
data shows that it's

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.060
equal among men and women.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.060
And it is commonly
associated with academics

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.720
and widely found among
graduate students.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.120
So again, it's
people who want to do

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.400
important things with her life.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.300
Graduate school.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.340
Anyone who's in
graduate school--

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.800
that's a pretty big deal that
you're in graduate school.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.853
So you really you care
about what people think.

00:40:52.853 --> 00:40:54.270
You care about
whether you belong.

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:56.850
You're thinking, how did I
end up in graduate school,

00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:00.640
how did I end up at MIT,
and do I really belong here?

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.380
So these are natural
things for people to think.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.470
And I will tell you
that a number of faculty

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.990
have reported that yes they
suffer from imposter syndrome.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:15.180
I think anyone who is honest
will say that they do.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.570
So this is a big problem.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:18.080
All right.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.760
So let's do another exercise.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.200
You might have wondered about
the title of Claude Steele's

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.110
book that I mentioned,
Whistling Vivaldi.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.420
Where does that title come from?

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.460
So he explains the title,
which is a good thing,

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.120
because it is an unusual title.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.390
So he said that it
comes from a story

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:42.170
that he heard of this young
African-American man who

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.370
was in the South
Side of Chicago,

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.425
and this man was a musician.

00:41:46.425 --> 00:41:48.050
And he was walking
one night, and there

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:52.610
was an elderly couple walking
on the street right near him.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:56.570
And they saw him
walking near them,

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.623
and he saw them walking faster.

00:41:59.623 --> 00:42:01.790
And they were an elderly
couple, so they were really

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.070
trying to walk fast.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:08.060
And he felt kind of bad
because they were kind of old.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.430
And so, he wanted to
kind of yell out at them,

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.350
you do not need
to worry about me.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.990
I'm not going to do
anything bad to you.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:20.000
But yelling that probably
would be even more terrifying.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.540
So we thought about
it and he said,

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.550
I'm going to start
whistling Vivaldi,

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:28.000
actually whistling
the music of Vivaldi.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.890
And so, he started whistling
the music and the couple

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.280
slowed their pace,
because they thought,

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.740
this is someone who
is classically trained

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.620
or loves classical music.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.510
Not so much associated
with someone who's

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.430
going to steal my handbag.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.140
And so, they relaxed.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:49.150
So in this book, Steele
asserts that we all whistle

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.720
Vivaldi from time to time.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.530
We all try to fit in and
make other people more

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.480
comfortable with us.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:59.350
So this is a little bit of a
harder thing to think about.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:01.840
Have you ever whistled Vivaldi?

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.590
Have you ever tried to fit in?

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.722
And let me just give you
an example that I heard

00:43:06.722 --> 00:43:07.930
to help you think about this.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:11.230
So one student said
that he was actually

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:14.140
from a very religious
family, and he

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.680
was used to praying
before eating a meal.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.030
But in the lunch room of
a science building somehow

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:25.350
that felt weird to
pray before eating.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.840
A lot of people have
this idea that if you're

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.170
very religious
that somehow that's

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:35.200
counter to being a
scientist, because you have

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.850
faith vs. Scientific facts.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:43.960
And he wasn't sure how people
would judge him if they

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.060
knew about his religion.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.490
So even though he
really did want to pray,

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.110
he stopped doing
it because he just

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.733
thought he wouldn't fit in.

00:43:51.733 --> 00:43:53.650
It would make other
people feel uncomfortable.

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:55.600
He wasn't sure how
others would feel,

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.720
and if they would accept him
the same way as a scientist

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.590
if he prayed before a meal.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.620
So that's an example
of whistling Vivaldi.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.970
So think about it for a minute.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:05.525
Find your partner.

00:44:05.525 --> 00:44:07.900
Talk to them about whether
this has ever happened to you,

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.400
and then we'll
come back together

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.630
as a group in a few minutes.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so when I
think about whistling Vivaldi,

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:22.280
for me, the point where
I feel like I'm really

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.850
changing or trying to
conform to an appearance

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.640
is pretty much any
time after 9/11.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.040
When I go through
the airports I'm

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.660
always conscious of what
people might be thinking about

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.600
based on my skin color.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:45.230
And so, when I go through,
every day right before I travel,

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.850
I shave my beard off.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:51.560
I try to be dressed
up a little nicer.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.780
And I even feel myself being
a little extra friendly

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.530
to TSA gate agents,
because I feel

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.290
like there's this negative
stereotype hanging over me.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:06.470
And I feel like even
though it's on my mind,

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.020
and it feels sometimes like it
might be on everybody else's.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:12.765
I feel like maybe my ID's
looked at a little differently,

00:45:12.765 --> 00:45:13.640
and things like that.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.990
So I make sure they can
hear my American accent,

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:20.352
make sure they don't
see any facial hair.

00:45:20.352 --> 00:45:21.060
Things like that.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.920
I try to be extra
nice, extra polite.

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.830
Just feeling a little
more nervous, I think,

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:29.698
is really the cause
of that as well.

00:45:29.698 --> 00:45:31.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
really good example.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.198
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:45:32.198 --> 00:45:34.620
AUDIENCE: Mine would be
in professional settings,

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.080
especially at conferences or
any presentation of some sort,

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.740
I try to cover my tattoos
the best way I can.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.020
And I also have a nose
ring, and so sometimes I

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.400
would wear like
a clear nose ring

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.880
so people only if they're
really up close to me

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.960
can see that I have one.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.050
And that's just to mitigate
any stereotype threats

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.610
that people have.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:58.550
Because you walk
into a room and you

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:02.000
have tattoos visible,
or your piercings,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.410
especially on your
face, and that

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.410
can lead people to think
differently about you

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:07.800
and what you're
capable of doing.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.217
And so, I just
want to lessen that

00:46:09.217 --> 00:46:12.815
and have people look past that.

00:46:12.815 --> 00:46:13.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:13.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.240
AUDIENCE: I think that's
a really good example.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.823
I mean, it's all the
same thing, is we

00:46:16.823 --> 00:46:20.267
feel like our appearances
are telling something,

00:46:20.267 --> 00:46:22.100
and we're really worried
that the message is

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.305
going to be negative there.

00:46:26.438 --> 00:46:26.980
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:30.590
So when have we
whistled Vivaldi?

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:31.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:35.140
I think I especially
do it whenever

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.730
I'm with friends and family.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:43.430
So since English isn't
my native language,

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.790
but I feel like I can
speak it pretty well,

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:49.930
so then whenever I go back
home, my friends and family

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:53.710
don't always speak
English, I actually

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.690
intentionally mispronounce
certain words just

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.420
to keep that
connection with them.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:03.480
AUDIENCE: Since I've been
gone for like a few months,

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.420
and seeing me every
so often, I just

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.485
want them to feel like I'm
still the same me I was.

00:47:10.485 --> 00:47:11.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:12.485
AUDIENCE: And then
when I'm here,

00:47:12.485 --> 00:47:16.430
I always try to pronounce
everything super well,

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.851
so that's not an issue when
someone's talking to me.

00:47:19.851 --> 00:47:20.476
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:20.476 --> 00:47:21.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] similar?

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
so I guess for me,

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.900
one of the big things
about grad school

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:35.350
was that I sometimes felt
pretty isolated as one of very

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.080
few women in our department.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:42.280
And so, over time, I realized I
started dressing more and more

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.760
like a man, to fit
in and to be taken

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.190
more seriously, and
just so that I didn't

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.660
have to feel as different.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:55.930
So, yes, like with that,
I feel like I've always

00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:01.280
wanted to be who I am, and I
don't want to be somebody else.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.620
So I guess, along
those lines, I've

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:08.210
had one conversation
with one of my professors

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:12.940
where she was explaining that
in research, when people were

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.970
giving presentations,
they usually

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:19.320
wore light colors like
gray, and white, or black,

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.180
and that you shouldn't
be too colorful.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.180
One time we were going
into a conference,

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.130
and I was wearing red.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:31.360
I was like really colorful,
and then she was like, wow.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.250
I mean, that's not
what we talked about.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:34.090
I'm like, yeah.

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:35.710
Science can be colorful too.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:38.770
AUDIENCE: That's great. (LAUGHS)

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:40.750
AUDIENCE: I want to be who I am.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:45.400
And the next minute, I saw a
professor, he was so colorful,

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.610
like red and orange
all over the place.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:48.340
I was like, yes.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.600
That's what I'm talking about.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.380
Be who you are.

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:51.680
Be free.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.320
And that's how a
science should be.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:57.133
People should be comfortable
in their skin and who they are.

00:48:57.133 --> 00:48:57.758
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:57.758 --> 00:48:58.383
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:58.383 --> 00:48:59.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.220
AUDIENCE: When I'm meeting
new scientists, especially

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:09.640
younger ones, or people who I
might have to mentor or train,

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.920
if they ever start to open
up about an experience

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.220
where they felt discriminated
against or harassed,

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.350
I can't necessarily
relate to that experience,

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.660
but I do want to convey
that they can trust me,

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.610
and that I'll listen
to them, and I'll

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.955
help them in whatever way.

00:49:23.955 --> 00:49:26.080
Because I can't really
share a personal experience.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.580
A lot of times I'll basically
turned to relevant literature,

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.020
like the book Whistling Vivaldi.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:35.710
And I'll try to communicate,
I'm on your side and I'm safe,

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:39.690
by talking about a subject
that communicates to them

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:41.357
I'm putting effort
into this and I care.

00:49:41.357 --> 00:49:42.982
AUDIENCE: Oh, that's
a really good one.

00:49:42.982 --> 00:49:44.450
It makes a lot of sense for me.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:47.740
It's more just going back
again to my identities.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.135
I have an accent, because
I'm from the Caribbean--

00:49:50.135 --> 00:49:51.760
and I feel like this
is common for lots

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.760
of international students
in the scientific setting--

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.850
I definitely try to put
on a more, quote, unquote,

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.720
American accent, to ensure
that my audience is not

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.080
being distracted by
my accent, but really

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.390
focusing on the science,
and really trying

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:10.280
to be more scientific,
quote, unquote.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.490
And the other thing, in
terms of physical appearance,

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:13.740
I have a lot of hair.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:19.450
It's very contained right
now, but it's really big.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.630
So definitely, in
scientific settings,

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:24.820
I definitely try to pull
it back to look more

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:28.360
what, quote, unquote,
would be [INAUDIBLE] kept.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.850
It's really kind
of weird, but yeah,

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:33.250
so you'll definitely see me
either my hair slicked back

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:36.070
in a scientific setting, versus
when you probably will see me

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:37.420
in lab, or something like that.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.532
So that's definitely the
way I whistle Vivaldi,

00:50:39.532 --> 00:50:40.990
because, again, I
don't want people

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:43.180
to be distracted by
my hair, or thinking

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:44.700
I don't look professional.

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.950
I don't want that to
detract from what I'm saying

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:49.010
and the science that I'm doing.

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.830
So that's definitely
another occasion

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:53.240
when I whistle Vivaldi.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that
makes a lot of sense.

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.140
AUDIENCE: So I guess for
the whistling Vivaldi,

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:03.465
I did have an example
that reminded me of this

00:51:03.465 --> 00:51:04.465
when I was an undergrad.

00:51:04.465 --> 00:51:06.190
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:09.340
AUDIENCE: So I joined
a lab my freshman year,

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:15.500
and I have always been more
traditionally feminine.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:19.600
My, I don't know,
style dressing.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:24.160
And I kind of noticed I was one
of the only women on the floor,

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.160
and I knew I stood out.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.080
And I specifically
remember that there

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.307
was a professor who asked
me what I was doing around

00:51:32.307 --> 00:51:34.890
on the lab floor, and told me I
didn't like the research type.

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:39.720
And that really stuck with
me, and after that, I really

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.510
changed.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:45.480
I had my lab style and then
my everyday Lindsay style.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.320
AUDIENCE: (LAUGHS)

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.820
AUDIENCE: Whenever
I was in the lab,

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:52.260
I would always wear very
baggy clothes, tennis shoes,

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:53.670
my hair tied back.

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:57.572
And I felt like my glasses made
me look more studious, so I

00:51:57.572 --> 00:51:58.780
would always wear my glasses.

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.390
It's just something I
was very conscious of.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:04.015
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:04.015 --> 00:52:07.112
AUDIENCE: I would specifically
dressed in one way

00:52:07.112 --> 00:52:09.570
when I was being a scientist,
and I would dress another way

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:11.652
when I was in my outside life.

00:52:11.652 --> 00:52:13.860
AUDIENCE: It's like not
easy, because in some setting

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.468
you're judged for
being dressed up.

00:52:15.468 --> 00:52:17.760
In other settings you're
judged for being dressed down.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.385
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:19.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
totally get that.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:24.060
Yeah so, in my case, I think
it's more about my race.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:27.210
I personally have a stereotype
that Asian women that

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:31.120
are recently immigrated
are more reserved, quiet,

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.180
and, I don't know, obedient.

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:37.230
And although no one actually
ever negatively judged

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:41.640
me for that, I'm constantly
afraid to confirm

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.200
that negative stereotype.

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.830
So even if I'm not really
that kind of person,

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:49.980
I try to be very vocal and
talkative, especially when I'm

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.620
surrounded by people that I'm
meeting for the first time,

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.900
so I'm giving like an
impression that I want

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.030
to engage in the conversation.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:02.960
Yeah, it was not an easy
thing, but I've been doing it.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.633
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:03.633 --> 00:53:04.800
CATHY L. DRENNAN: All right.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.653
So I'm just going to start out.

00:53:06.653 --> 00:53:08.070
I'm going to give
you one example.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.870
This time it's not
mine, but I think

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:14.070
that it was one of the
ones that someone suggested

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.000
that really resonated with me.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.050
So I want to share it.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:22.940
So this sense of
feeling the need

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:28.190
to suffer for your science,
and that other people

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:30.320
see someone that are
talking about how much they

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.490
suffered for their science.

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:35.730
And instead of just
saying, wait a minute,

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.620
I sleep eight hours a night.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.780
They're like, yeah I gotta
get in on this suffering

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.040
for my science thing.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.440
So an example,
someone was talking

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.560
about how they knew that
this person was going

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.410
on this ski trip
over the weekend,

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:52.440
but before they left lab to
go on the ski trip, instead

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.780
of saying, hey, see all Monday.

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:55.980
I'm going skiing.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.400
They're going out like carrying
these journals and papers.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.440
And they're just
like, oh, I got a lot

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.010
of reading to do this weekend.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:05.190
Does anyone have a cart?

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:07.290
I can barely carry it.

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:11.760
I'm going to be
reading all weekend.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.800
This is a scheme.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.790
What's going on?

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.360
But it's like, if you're
really a scientist,

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.120
if you're a true scientist,
if you're a real scientist,

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.500
you suffer.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.450
You have no hobbies.

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:28.350
You work day and night in
the cold room, in the dark.

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:33.240
I mean, you're just
36-hour experiments.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.750
There's no time to shower.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:36.660
There's no time to sleep.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.900
And instead of just saying
and sending a message

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.940
to maybe new people in
lab, and undergrads,

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.970
and I think this has come up,
especially with women, that

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:48.690
like if you do not give
of yourself completely,

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:50.940
you're not a, quote,
real scientist.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:54.000
And a lot of people who
are thinking about science,

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.330
especially women, think, I'd
really like to have a family,

00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:59.830
and I know I might be doing a
little more of the caregiving.

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.440
So I don't know if
I can do science.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.857
I might have to
do something else.

00:55:02.857 --> 00:55:05.220
Because there's
this notion that you

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:08.370
have to suffer so
deeply for your science.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:09.850
And people buy into this.

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:11.670
They don't want to
be the one saying,

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:13.830
I don't know what's wrong with
you, but I shower every day.

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:14.330
Right?

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:14.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.877
They're just like coming
up with something else

00:55:16.877 --> 00:55:17.710
that they're saying.

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:21.270
It's like, well, yeah, but
my experiment was even worse!

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.420
And I had to walk uphill
both ways to do it, right?

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.420
Everyone gets into this
in the whole lab culture,

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.610
and they're trying
to outdo themselves

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:31.920
with the degree of suffering.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.730
So that's one
example that came up.

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:36.570
And I do think that these kind
of things-- it sounds funny,

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.220
but it's important,
because it sends

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:42.460
a message of what it takes
to be a scientist that is not

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.700
really true.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:47.170
And if we have well-adjusted
human beings doing science,

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:48.250
I'm OK for that.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:51.340
I think that's a good thing to
have well-adjusted human beings

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.240
doing science.

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.400
So we have to think a little bit
about fitting into a culture,

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.360
and what that is, and
what we do to fit in.

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:00.860
All right.

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.880
So that's just one example
that was shared with me

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.930
before, which I
thought was a good one.

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:08.950
But it seems like you guys were
having some lively discussion.

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:11.980
So who would like to
start off by sharing

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.820
what you were talking about?

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.320
Yeah?

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so depending
on who I'm talking with,

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:21.340
I actually tune my accent.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.680
For example, when I'm
back home, I intentionally

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.580
mispronounce certain words so
that I can talk with my friends

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.930
and family.

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:31.510
And then whenever I'm here
in an academic setting,

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:34.630
I try to pronounce
everything correctly.

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:35.420
Yeah.

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:37.630
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yeah,
so the sort of, I'm

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:38.950
still sort of one of you.

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:42.580
I've gone off to
this place of MIT,

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.700
but I'm back having
these conversations.

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:49.250
And then you present a
different side when you're here.

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:55.090
I've heard that a lot, that
sometimes being at a top place,

00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:58.060
people feeling
uncomfortable going home,

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.360
that the family members
just feel like they

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.027
don't want to sound
stupid, so they just

00:57:03.027 --> 00:57:04.610
don't know what to
say to you anymore.

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:05.730
It's like, it's still me.

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:09.070
It's OK. (LAUGHS) That's great.

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:11.110
OK.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:11.830
Anybody else?

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:12.430
Yeah, yeah?

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:15.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
I personally have

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:17.622
a stereotype that Asian women,
especially those who are,

00:57:17.622 --> 00:57:19.080
quote, unquote,
fresh off the boat,

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:22.420
are more reserved and quiet.

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:27.160
And while I'm a person who kind
of confirms that stereotype,

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.520
when I'm with people that I'm
meeting for the first time,

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.300
I try to be a little
more vocal and talkative,

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.260
to give an impression
that I want

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.010
to engage in this conversation.

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:38.620
And sometimes that
makes you feel bad,

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.060
because I'm not true to myself.

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.060
So, yeah.

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:42.610
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:44.240
People may not
believe this about me,

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.460
but I used to be really shy.

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.680
[SOFT LAUGHTER]

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.520
So, yeah.

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.220
So all those years of
imposter syndrome--

00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:52.810
all right.

00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:54.940
I'm going to wear
my not-shy clothes,

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.800
and talk like a not-shy person.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.690
But yeah, I had to really
struggle with that,

00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:01.180
and I think it's very hard.

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.100
When you are worried
about that stereotype,

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.370
it's pushing yourself out.

00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:06.820
Being a little more--

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:10.360
so that's it that's a
really, really nice example.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.910
Anyone else?

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:12.550
Yeah?

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:14.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I
have several tattoos,

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.030
and I also have a nose piercing.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:18.050
And when I'm in
professional settings,

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:21.580
especially at conferences, I
try to cover up my tattoos,

00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:24.190
and sometimes they even
put in a different nose

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.800
ring that's clear so
you really can't see it

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.180
unless you're close up.

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:31.480
And I try to do that
in order to not confirm

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.060
a negative stereotype of
people who decide to put art

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:37.300
on their body or
have extra piercings,

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.840
and to appear more professional,
and that I understand

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.305
and know what I'm talking about.

00:58:42.305 --> 00:58:44.680
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yeah, that's
also a really-- everyone's

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.680
got really great examples.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.190
That has kind of come up in
[INAUDIBLE] really thinking

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:51.940
about how you're dressed
and other things.

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:56.020
And one time I had
videotapes to use

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.360
in freshman chemistry, of
scientists talking about how

00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.645
they were using chemistry.

00:58:59.645 --> 00:59:01.270
And I got all this
feedback because one

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:04.330
of the people in the video
had piercings and tattoos.

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:07.690
And they're like, but that's
not a scientist, right?

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:09.610
But then he talked
so articulately,

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:11.260
and it was mind-blowing.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.210
But we do have
these ideas of what

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:15.130
scientists should look like.

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:17.020
I partly blame Hollywood.

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.800
Polyester pants, and the lab
coat, and pocket protectors.

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.410
And it turns out scientists
look like everyone else.

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:26.470
But then we worry,
and sometimes try

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:31.030
to fit in, and whistle a
little Vivaldi to hide maybe

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.990
some parts of that.

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:33.340
And so, yeah.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.350
Really, really good
examples everyone.

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:35.980
OK.

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:37.780
Let's move on.

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:39.760
Who has stereotypes?

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.112
ENTIRE AUDIENCE: Everyone!

00:59:41.112 --> 00:59:42.070
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:43.000
Sorry.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.790
Sorry for the bad news.

00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:47.440
But let me show you some data
in case you're not convinced.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:47.940
All right.

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.200
So there's a whole
bunch of studies,

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.030
and I'm just going to
tell you about a few

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:56.410
of them that get at
this fact that we all

00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:57.670
do have stereotypes.

00:59:57.670 --> 01:00:00.490
Because we all live in a
culture, we're all part of it.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:03.160
We are, in fact, not in
the cold room for 36 hours.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.250
We come out to socialize with
other people at some point,

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.730
and so we develop stereotypes.

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:11.230
All right.

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:13.450
So there are these a
bunch of different studies

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:17.200
where they show groups,
multiple different CVs.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.510
And they have one
CV that's clearly

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:22.930
a man's name, another CV
that's clearly a woman's name,

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:25.330
and then they ask this
group, pick the best

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.830
candidate for something.

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:29.060
And the data show
that if the see

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.720
these are designed to
be very, very similar--

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.180
similar kinds of
schools, similar numbers

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.550
of publications,
similar awards--

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:40.270
that people will pick the
CV with the man's name

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:41.710
on as being better.

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:44.800
And importantly,
women do this too.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.980
So this idea of, let's put
a woman on every committee

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:52.120
so that we make sure that this
committee is doing the best,

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.610
picking the best
candidate, whatever, women

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:56.370
do the exact same thing as men.

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.570
They also pick
the male candidate

01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:01.240
when the CVs are very similar.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:06.310
So a lot of these studies were
done in the English profession,

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:10.180
but Joe Handelsman and a bunch
of others in this publication,

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:16.030
in PNAS in 2012, redid
did this CV study,

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:18.130
but it was only for scientists.

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:22.270
So people would say,
scientists are logical, right?

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:24.160
We can't have stereotypes.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.570
We're about facts.

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:26.350
We're about data.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:29.860
We are so logical
we can't possibly

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.330
really have stereotypes.

01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:33.550
And so, clear
convincing evidence

01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:35.380
that that is, in fact, not true.

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.660
Scientists are just like
all other human beings,

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.600
as it turns out.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.730
They're people.

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.800
Anyhow, so this study.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.580
Loved this study.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.540
Jealous of this study.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.860
Why did I not do this study?

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.410
Anyhow.

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:52.010
So what they did is they
took this resume, CV, said it

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:54.140
was for a lab manager position.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.840
They had the name John on
it or the name Jennifer,

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.460
and they sent it to
different people,

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.820
and then saw what people
thought collectively about John,

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:05.120
and what people thought
collectively about Jennifer.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.170
Exactly the same
CV, so they should

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:11.960
have thought the same
things about both of them,

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.170
because it was the same.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:20.690
But then they compared for
the male name versus female

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:23.390
who's applying for this
lab manager position,

01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:27.010
they thought that the
man was more competent,

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.920
that the man was more
hireable, and was

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.470
going to be easier
to mentor, and also

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:34.480
should get pay to lot more.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.230
Now, again, let me emphasize,
these are identical documents,

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:40.120
except one has the
name John on it,

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.440
and one had the
name Jennifer on it.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:46.300
And they looked at how men
viewed this and how women did.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.330
It was male faculty,
women faculty, again,

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:50.980
for a lab manager position.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.780
Women thought the same thing.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.330
Women thought that the CV
with the name John on it

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:58.990
was a lot more impressive than
the CV with the name Jennifer.

01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:03.580
So scientists, the
ivory tower, is just

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.525
locked-in people with
the same prejudices

01:03:06.525 --> 01:03:07.650
that you find other places.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.460
The same stereotypes.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.350
All right.

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:10.850
OK.

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:15.010
So we need some good news.

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:16.690
I think it's time for good news.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:18.820
I've convinced you
that you can all

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:23.740
be victims of stereotype threat,
that you all have stereotypes.

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:27.040
Probably, you're all worried
about imposter syndrome.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.733
If you didn't have it
before, I'm sure you do now.

01:03:30.733 --> 01:03:31.900
But you know that I have it.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.970
Maybe that means like--

01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:36.230
anyway.

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:38.230
Good news.

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:40.270
Wise criticism.

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:42.960
So this can be used to mitigate
the effects of stereotype

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:43.590
threat.

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:46.950
And again, it's criticism
that's delivered in such a way

01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:50.970
that students feel like
they're capable of a high level

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:54.390
of achievement, that
students are less defensive

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:56.500
and feel less threatened.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:03.510
And so, here, again, it's not
about whether there's criticism

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:08.310
or not, it's really about how
that criticism is delivered.

01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:10.710
So I'll just give
you a brief example

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:12.150
what I think about here.

01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:15.080
When I started as
Assistant Professor,

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.520
it was the first time I was
writing a paper from my lab

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.570
that my advisor's not
deciding it's OK or not.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:22.740
This is for me.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.900
So I gave it to one of
my senior colleagues

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.630
to critique before
I sent it out.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:33.360
It came back covered in red pen.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.810
[INAUDIBLE] And I was just
thinking, what was I thinking?

01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:38.980
I can't be a professor.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.540
This is the most
ridiculous thing.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:44.570
How did I ever think that
I could possibly do this?

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.080
But then I got a little
perspective on it.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.790
I realized that this
professor had taken time

01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:56.560
to not only read the paper
through and make comments,

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.430
but there were notes about
reading the background

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.310
literature on the paper.

01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:08.050
This wasn't their field, so
they had read all the references

01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:11.140
and thought about how I could
have improved the paper.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.450
Who has time to do that?

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:15.460
The only person who
has time to do that

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:19.660
is someone who is completely
and totally dedicated

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.160
to my success.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.160
So it was criticism.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.420
It was criticism.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.260
There was criticism!

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.360
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.900
But it was criticism that
was delivered because they

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.360
believed I could
do this, and wanted

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:38.290
to help me, put their money
where their mouth was,

01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:41.380
spend time helping
me be successful.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.860
So next time you get back
a draft covered with red,

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.090
don't think of it as
harsh, I can't do it,

01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:52.490
blood of a massacre of
the paper spewing out.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.490
You think about it as love.

01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:57.160
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.450
Criticism takes time.

01:05:58.450 --> 01:05:59.920
It's love!

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.410
Red love pouring out
all over the paper.

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:07.600
Criticism is
important, but the way

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.210
it's delivered-- if you
feel it's delivered in a way

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:13.270
that the person really
believes in you,

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:16.990
then it can really
motivate you to do better.

01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:19.810
So criticism is good,
but how you deliver

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.260
it makes a huge difference.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:21.760
All right.

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.150
So Mary O'Reilly who is a
graduate student here at MIT,

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:27.550
did all these really
cool little cartoons.

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:30.900
Little call out to Mary, now.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.467
You're a student now, but
think about what you can do.

01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:35.800
You don't have to sacrifice
completely for your science.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.200
You can do art on the side.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.410
So Mary had a hobby and
it's put to good use.

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:44.220
So which response
would you rather hear

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.780
if you did poorly on a test?

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.340
And I don't know if
you can see this.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:51.000
This is a C-, which is not a
good score for someone who is

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.090
a high achiever.

01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:56.910
Undeserved praise
can be super harmful.

01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:59.290
"This is a good score for you.

01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:02.010
You should be pleased."

01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:03.840
What is this person
telling this person

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.805
by giving them that praise?

01:07:08.933 --> 01:07:10.100
That's the best they can do.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.460
You should be happy with a C-.

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:12.960
No.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.163
No one should be
happy with a C-.

01:07:16.163 --> 01:07:18.080
Of course, if it's pass,
no record, and you're

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.270
just shooting for that
pass-- but, no, no, no.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:21.680
No one should be
happy with that.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:21.920
All right.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.462
So you have to be
careful about that.

01:07:23.462 --> 01:07:26.390
The worst thing you can do is
send the message to someone

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:29.275
that they messed up, but that's
all that it can be expected

01:07:29.275 --> 01:07:32.180
of you is to mess up.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.170
Bad criticism.

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:34.790
We may have all received that.

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:38.480
Yeah, you'll have to try
harder if you want to pass.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.630
No feedback can also
be harmful, because you

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:44.180
might have this idea that
you don't belong here.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:47.480
And if no one's countering that
and telling you you do belong,

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.720
then you're just taking
that message away.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.010
And wise criticism can be,
again, the most powerful thing.

01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:57.710
Saying, hey, I know
you were doing really

01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:58.790
well in recitation.

01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:00.440
I'm not sure what
happened on the exam,

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.930
but let's sit together
and try to figure out.

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:04.790
You did this part really well.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:07.370
You just need to figure out how
to demonstrate your knowledge

01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:09.540
on this other part of the exam.

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.980
So just a brief story on this.

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.110
Some of my friends who
are professors, parents

01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:15.933
call them up.

01:08:15.933 --> 01:08:17.600
Do you know how much
tuition I'm paying?

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.410
Why did my kid not get an A?

01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:21.439
I have never gotten
that phone call here,

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:24.810
partly because everybody knows
that MIT is a tough place,

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:27.380
and so, they don't send
their kid with the idea

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:31.550
that the money in tuition is
guaranteeing any kind of grade.

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:34.100
But I did get a phone
call from a parent once.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.109
And they called
me and they said,

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:38.010
I just had to share
with you this story,

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:40.100
it's about my daughter
who's in your class.

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.460
They said, first
exam comes in MIT,

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.319
and she doesn't do that well.

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:50.850
And she calls me, and she's
crying, and she's crying a lot.

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:52.680
And she said, dad,
I really studied.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.460
I'm telling you,
I really studied.

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.810
I thought I knew this material,
but this was my grade.

01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:01.069
And I don't know what happened,
I really thought I knew it.

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:03.300
And she's like, can
you come and get me?

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.330
He's like, the first exam.

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:07.740
It's still September, right?

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:09.410
And so, he doesn't
know what to do,

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:14.380
and he says, well, I'm going
to come get you immediately.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:18.330
Let's just see how you
feel in a little bit.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:20.300
So then he gets a call
back a few hours later.

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.700
And you say, Dad!

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.370
Dad!

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:22.970
Dad!

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:25.399
My TA emailed me!

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:28.790
They said, I know you
know the material better

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.470
than your grade on the test.

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:31.670
I told you, dad!

01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:34.279
I told you that I knew
the material better.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:35.840
And the TA knew I knew!

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.520
I knew I knew the
material better!

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.050
He said, you can
come in and talk

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.772
about test-taking strategies.

01:09:40.772 --> 01:09:43.189
And so, the dad said, so I
don't need to come and get you?

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:44.590
She's like, no, I'm good.

01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:45.500
Right?

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:52.520
So a little bit of the
message that that TA sent,

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.350
saying, I know that
you know this better.

01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:56.480
Let's get together and
figure out what we can do.

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.030
It was everything
to this one person.

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.860
So wise criticism, very helpful.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.210
He still said, yeah, that
wasn't a good performance, but I

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:07.480
you can do better.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.550
OK.

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:12.467
So I just want to emphasize that
no feedback is not a solution.

01:10:12.467 --> 01:10:14.550
Sometimes having these
conversations of criticism,

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:16.210
ugh.

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:18.810
So the easiest route
is say nothing.

01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:20.390
But that is not a good route.

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.680
And let me just try to
convince you of that.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.120
In doing so, we have some
more cool Mary cartoons.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.550
And we're just going to leave
the classroom for a minute.

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:31.710
In this scenario,
we have a professor

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:35.100
coming in, yelling
at this male student,

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.080
and saying nothing to
this female student who

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.700
is sitting right next to him.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.642
So the professor comes
in, said, you should

01:10:40.642 --> 01:10:41.850
have had this done yesterday!

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:43.620
I'm giving a talk
next week in Texas,

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.292
and I need to have
these PowerPoint slides!

01:10:46.292 --> 01:10:48.000
Why haven't you finished
this experiment?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.200
I have to get going!

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.950
And then he leaves the lab.

01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:54.280
And so, in the little blurb
here from the female students

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.410
thoughts he can't
hear, she said,

01:10:56.410 --> 01:11:00.070
I wish she cared as
much about my project.

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:02.550
It's just not fair.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.830
And then the man is
thinking, he never

01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:07.020
yells at the girls like
that, and her project

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.760
isn't going any
better than mine.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.620
It's just not fair.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.970
So the woman is upset about
not getting yelled at,

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:17.070
which sort of seems
counterintuitive at first,

01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:20.430
until you realize
that the one graduate

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:22.020
student's getting
yelled at because he

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.110
wants his data for a talk.

01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:27.600
So he's never asking the
female student for her data

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.440
for a talk.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.960
He's never really talking to
her at all about her research.

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.320
It's not going well, and
he doesn't even care.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.560
She is apparently so
insignificant to him.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.560
She's too insignificant, her
research is so unimportant,

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.552
he doesn't even have
time to yell at her.

01:11:42.552 --> 01:11:44.010
He's not interest
in yelling at her

01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:46.343
because he's not going to use
her research for anything.

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:50.130
He has no expectations that she
would ever deliver something

01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:52.050
that would be talk worthy.

01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:54.000
That's at least
what's in her mind.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.250
Meanwhile, the male professor's
very proud of himself

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.260
for never yelling at the girls.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.930
And the male students are really
angry that the girls don't

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:03.630
get yelled at, not
realizing that he's

01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:04.840
paying some attention.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.090
He actually cares if
they're getting results.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:12.480
So this is a lose-lose
situation for everybody.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.040
So along these lines I was
called on to, at one point,

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.590
interview all of the
female graduate students

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.840
in the chemistry department,
and all the male students

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.640
in the chemistry
department, to figure out

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.265
how they figured out
whether they would

01:12:25.265 --> 01:12:27.180
apply for academic positions.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:31.620
And I was given this task
because the department was

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.950
very low on the list of the
number of female graduate

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.250
students who were applying
for faculty positions.

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:40.470
So they wanted to figure out
why the women weren't applying.

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:44.320
And who better to figure
that out than me, a woman.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:44.820
All right.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.070
So I actually was
kind of curious

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:48.510
to see what people would say.

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:51.540
So again, this is not
statistically significant.

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.910
I've collected some
data over the years that

01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:55.585
is statistically significant.

01:12:55.585 --> 01:12:57.210
This was just
conversations that I had,

01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:59.070
but I just wanted to
share this with you.

01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:00.930
So I asked both
men and women, how

01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:03.940
do you know if you're good
enough to be a professor?

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:07.380
And both said, I don't know.

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.110
It was the same.

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:09.420
It was the same answer.

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.990
They both said, I don't know.

01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:13.080
And it's like, well,
what do you do with that?

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.590
And the women said, well, I wait
for the professor to tell me

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:17.670
that I'm good enough.

01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:20.750
And if they don't tell
me, I assume I'm not.

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:24.680
The men said, well,
I go ahead and apply,

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.590
and if I'm not good
enough, the professor

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:29.250
is likely to tell me
that at some point.

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:33.140
So meanwhile, the
professor is saying nothing

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.660
to either group about
whether they're good enough.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:38.480
The women are taking that
as a message they're not.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.020
The men are saying,
I'm just going

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.920
to go ahead and try
until someone stops me.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.370
So no feedback, you
might be sending

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:47.900
messages you don't intend.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:51.350
I don't think these
professors were intending

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:53.330
to send message to
the female students

01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:54.710
that they weren't good enough.

01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:57.650
They just were busy doing
stuff and didn't say anything

01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:58.490
to anyone.

01:13:58.490 --> 01:14:02.060
So it's a reminder to
give feedback to people.

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.800
Because if there's
no feedback, you

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.760
don't know what the individual
is taking away from that.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.250
In the absence of
it, own insecurities

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:12.570
will often come into play.

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:13.190
All right.

01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:18.213
So other things that one can
do is change the narrative.

01:14:18.213 --> 01:14:19.880
Because, remember,
as I was just saying,

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.030
people have their own
insecurities going.

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:25.460
And so, sometimes
you want to let

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:29.690
them know that perhaps other
people have had insecurities

01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:35.280
as well, and that it's OK,
and that failing sometimes

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.850
is not only OK, it's
part of the process.

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:41.750
So for high achievers, it's
important to reassure them

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:45.630
that everyone has had difficulty
at some point in their career.

01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:47.270
So this serves as a
counter narrative,

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:50.150
this story they're telling
themselves, that somehow you

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:52.310
have to be perfect
all the time to really

01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:53.940
be successful in science.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:57.650
You don't have to be, but we
need to share those stories.

01:14:57.650 --> 01:15:00.860
The CV, it's a
list of successes.

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:01.780
It's a list of papers.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.170
It's a list of awards.

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:08.310
It doesn't say on there, this is
what I've done with my career.

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:09.020
No.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.820
What you've done
with your career,

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:14.390
between every success
are a ton of failures.

01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:17.240
But we don't list the
things that don't work,

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.118
we just list the
things that do work.

01:15:19.118 --> 01:15:21.410
Our publications are full of
the experiments that work,

01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:23.300
not the experiments
that didn't work.

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.220
So it's really easy
for people to look

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.930
at someone who's
successful and think,

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:28.340
they've never had to struggle.

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.360
It's been super easy for them.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.700
They've never failed.

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.510
And that is just not the case.

01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:36.080
So if we share those
stories with the students,

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.710
it can help them realize that
maybe this bad grade isn't

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:40.950
the end of the world.

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:41.910
It's all OK.

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:44.920
It's part of the process.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.420
All right.

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:50.860
So this is the last exercise.

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:55.330
So recall a moment where a
mentor shared a story with you

01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:58.690
about a time when he or she
struggled with a concept

01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:01.390
or felt inadequate,
but then reached

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.520
a high level of
achievement, or you

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.230
could recall your own story.

01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:07.060
So something that
someone shared with you

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.510
that made a difference, or
perhaps something that you

01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:13.180
could tell your students
this semester if they're

01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.910
all of a sudden going, how
did I get into this place?

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:17.920
I'm not sure that I belong here.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.080
What could you
share with them that

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.480
would help them move forward?

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:23.980
All right.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:25.510
Find your partners.

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.706
Think about a time.

01:16:27.706 --> 01:16:31.490
AUDIENCE: I think
for a time when--

01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:33.410
at least a story that
was a counter-narrative

01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:37.480
for me was thinking about
my own struggles in my PhD

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.727
where there was a long
string of failures

01:16:41.727 --> 01:16:43.310
where it felt like
nothing was working

01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:45.480
and I wasn't really
getting anywhere.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.840
And it was really hard
to see the finish line,

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.030
and it got me really down.

01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:57.110
It felt very difficult. I wasn't
as happy as I could have been.

01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:59.630
And I think what really
helped me break out

01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:01.910
of that was hearing
from my own advisor

01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:06.230
that she had had a pretty
long and arduous PhD as well.

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:09.120
There was a lot of struggle.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.570
And that those failures came
in the exact same way, where

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:15.870
they're stacking on
top of each other.

01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:20.120
And it just feels like there
is no end really in sight,

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.580
and maybe that you're not
even good enough for this.

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:27.980
But seeing how far she made
it, and how much she succeeded

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:31.190
after that really, really
reassured me, and makes me

01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:34.730
feel better about
the whole thing.

01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:37.430
It makes you realize
everything's going to be OK.

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:39.240
This is not atypical.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.870
It doesn't say something
about me, personally.

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:48.110
Really what's
reassuring is that it

01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:49.652
feels like everything
is really going

01:17:49.652 --> 01:17:51.720
to work out at the end of it.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:55.700
And that changed my entire
attitude really about my PhD.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:59.410
I feel tremendously better
about everything since then.

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:01.052
AUDIENCE: That's very inspiring.

01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:01.760
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for me, I felt
it a lot during undergrad,

01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:07.850
and I still feel it
somewhat in grad school,

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:12.830
but one experience was
even having an opportunity

01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:15.710
to participate in a
summer program at MIT.

01:18:15.710 --> 01:18:18.530
So I went to a
community college,

01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:21.590
and my parents couldn't
afford to send me

01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:23.367
to a top-tier university.

01:18:23.367 --> 01:18:25.450
We didn't have money saved
up for me to go to one,

01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:29.210
and so the advice was to
go to community college

01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:33.320
first, establish your GPA,
get some scholarships,

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.480
and then transfer to
a four-year institute.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.640
And while I was at
that community college,

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.840
I didn't feel like I would have
any major opportunities to go

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.250
and do research, especially
at an institute like MIT.

01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:49.370
And I came across the
application for the MIT summer

01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:52.520
research program
through another program

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.770
that I was involved in
at my community college.

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:56.637
And I was like, OK,
I'll just apply to it.

01:18:56.637 --> 01:18:58.220
They'll probably not
accept me or even

01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.137
consider my application,
but I'll still do it.

01:19:00.137 --> 01:19:01.130
And I did it.

01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:01.923
I applied.

01:19:01.923 --> 01:19:03.590
And I ended up getting
into the program.

01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:07.310
And that one opportunity really
opened a lot of doors for me,

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:09.320
and now I'm able to be
a graduate student here.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:13.430
So, yeah, that was a moment
where I really felt insecure,

01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:16.510
and the whole imposter
syndrome really affected me.

01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:18.655
But I'm happy that I
took that opportunity.

01:19:18.655 --> 01:19:19.350
Mm-hmm.

01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:22.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
a really awesome story.

01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:25.150
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:28.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
when I started college,

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:32.000
I got a really, really bad
grade on one of my tests.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.408
I think it was actually my
second semester of college.

01:19:34.408 --> 01:19:34.950
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:35.610
AUDIENCE: I called my dad.

01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:37.250
And it was the first
bad test I've ever

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.220
had in my entire life.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.120
I was so upset.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:42.320
I called my dad and I said,
dad, dad, I'm so sorry!

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.320
I'm failing!

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.920
And I had a full-ride
scholarship,

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.645
so I thought I was going to lose
my scholarship because of one

01:19:48.645 --> 01:19:49.145
bad test.

01:19:49.145 --> 01:19:49.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
understand that.

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.772
AUDIENCE: And my dad
said, no, no, it's OK.

01:19:51.772 --> 01:19:53.000
It's totally fine.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.560
When I was in college--

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.850
the same exact college--

01:19:57.850 --> 01:20:02.630
I failed miserably my first
test in this math class.

01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:05.240
And I just worked
really hard and studied,

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.730
and tried to talk
to people, and made

01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:09.570
sure that I knew exactly
what I was doing.

01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:12.830
And by the end of the
semester, my teacher was like,

01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:14.870
don't even come in for
the final because you're

01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:15.980
going to break the curve.

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:17.690
So you can do it.

01:20:17.690 --> 01:20:20.280
One bad test is
not the end of you.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:23.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's cool.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:23.997
I wish my--

01:20:23.997 --> 01:20:25.080
AUDIENCE: It really helps.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I can imagine
that would really help.

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:27.380
Yeah.

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:32.718
So I guess, growing up, I
didn't have female scientists--

01:20:32.718 --> 01:20:33.260
I don't know.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.773
The media doesn't really portray
female scientists, slash,

01:20:35.773 --> 01:20:38.190
I didn't know anyone that had
a PhD or anything like that.

01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:40.067
So when I got to college,
I knew I was always

01:20:40.067 --> 01:20:41.900
interested in science,
but I didn't actually

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:42.840
know what that meant.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.800
And so, I was
really lucky enough

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.410
to have a wonderful
mentor in undergrad.

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:52.490
And she, was the department
head of chemistry,

01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:53.700
so that was really awesome.

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:56.510
But we got really close,
and she would tell me

01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:58.760
about her journey
as a scientist,

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:02.510
and how she started out
becoming a lecturer,

01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:06.440
and raising a family, and
being a woman in science,

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.990
and what that meant for
people's perception,

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:10.880
and how she felt like
she never really got

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.890
the respect that she deserved.

01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:15.140
And she would always make
sure that we referred to her

01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:18.770
as doctor, because it
was the fact that she

01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:22.430
had worked so hard for it, and
had not been taken seriously.

01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:25.070
So she shared a
lot of like how she

01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:26.630
didn't feel like
she got the respect

01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:30.110
or deserved to almost be
in this position of power.

01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:32.860
But she was an extremely
successful scientist,

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:36.110
and did wonderful things, and
was department head of our

01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.910
at our school.

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:39.550
And just really
showed me that even

01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:42.220
if you don't feel
like you can do it,

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:44.090
or you're not
getting the respect,

01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:47.090
you can still be
really successful.

01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:52.990
And having those conversations
and just hearing her story,

01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:55.480
made me feel like,
OK, I can do this,

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.320
and allowed me to address
like my insecurities.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:03.760
And her support where she felt
like I could go to grad school,

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.280
was a main reason why I felt
like I could actually do it.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.370
Because she talked about,
it wasn't in her plans,

01:22:09.370 --> 01:22:11.050
but she still like
went through it.

01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:13.790
And, like, look,
I'm a Professor now,

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:17.020
even though I don't necessarily
feel like I should have been,

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.820
or could have at times.

01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:21.410
And so, that was
really awesome to hear

01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:24.340
and really made me feel like
grad school was an option

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:27.460
before I even got here.

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:30.100
And before, I didn't even
think about grad school.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:31.100
AUDIENCE: That's great.

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:34.090
I'm so glad that she was
able to bring you here.

01:22:34.090 --> 01:22:35.320
AUDIENCE: She's wonderful.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.450
AUDIENCE: I think a good
example, in my case is my mom.

01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:44.605
So obviously, her experience
is 30 years ago and in Korea,

01:22:44.605 --> 01:22:47.170
so it might be not that
reflective of how things are

01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:48.590
done in the States right now.

01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:53.200
But basically, it was a lot
harder for her, as a woman,

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.110
to get a job than her
male counterparts,

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:59.050
because people were
worried that she might quit

01:22:59.050 --> 01:23:01.030
when she gets married,
when she gets pregnant,

01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:02.350
when she has a baby.

01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:06.520
And even after she
got a baby and she

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.710
has continued working
in her workplace,

01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:11.440
she was continuously
judged by other people.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.510
Because when she
worked hard, people

01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:17.590
were blaming her for not putting
in that much of a dedication

01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:18.940
to her home.

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.940
But if she was not
working hard enough,

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.400
people were like, why are you
like not working hard enough?

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.560
And you should not pay
too much of attention

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.950
to your kids and your family.

01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:28.950
AUDIENCE: You can't win.

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:29.825
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

01:23:29.825 --> 01:23:34.840
So she had to put in a
lot more time and effort

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.440
into both her household
and in her workplace

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.110
to fight with the
negative stereotype,

01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:42.410
and not to get blame.

01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:45.940
So yeah, her story
really touched me,

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:48.910
and just keeping me aware that
those kinds of stereotypes

01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:50.440
are going out there, yeah.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:54.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think the one
mentor that's really stuck out

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.682
or has had a big impact on
me, especially in grad school,

01:23:57.682 --> 01:23:58.515
has been my advisor.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:06.160
Especially when I came
to MIT, I definitely

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:09.180
had a stereotype of what an
MIT grad student should be.

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.870
And it was like,
they should only

01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:12.255
be focused on their academics.

01:24:12.255 --> 01:24:12.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.670
AUDIENCE: And I had a
lot of personal things

01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:17.710
I was struggling
with that I thought

01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:21.550
I had to leave behind me when I
would come into the workplace.

01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:25.030
And it almost became this
really overbearing burden

01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:28.690
of, I had to keep this
personal side of me a secret

01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:32.260
and I could only have this
academic side of me in public.

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:36.910
So having a mentor who is very
open about her own struggles,

01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:40.300
and who's willing to share
more about her personal life,

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.210
made me feel more comfortable
bringing my full self

01:24:43.210 --> 01:24:45.370
to the table when I am in lab.

01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:47.920
So that's definitely
had a big impact on me.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:51.790
I feel that the
media is gradually

01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:54.580
changing from showing the
typical nerdy scientist

01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:56.357
into showing that,
hey, scientists also

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:57.190
have personal lives.

01:24:57.190 --> 01:24:57.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.630
That they are people.

01:24:58.630 --> 01:24:58.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:59.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:00.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
really like that.

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.695
So yeah.

01:25:01.695 --> 01:25:02.320
AUDIENCE: Cool.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.440
AUDIENCE: Cool, cool.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.023
CATHY L. DRENNAN:
So I'll just briefly

01:25:05.023 --> 01:25:06.910
tell you one story
for me, which,

01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:09.460
if you don't feel comfortable
sharing with your students,

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:11.200
you can share my stories.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:11.920
That's fine.

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.360
I have a long list.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.740
So one thing that you can tell
people which sometimes helps

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:20.740
is that professor
Drennan is dyslexic.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:24.520
So I was diagnosed
in first grade.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:28.050
I was a very smart
and articulate kid,

01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:30.820
and I liked talking to adults.

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:33.123
And so, they assumed
I was sort of smart,

01:25:33.123 --> 01:25:34.540
but then I couldn't
learn to read.

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:38.200
So I was in the upper group, and
then the somewhat lower group,

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.400
and lower group, and the lowest
group, and the remedial group.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.070
And it took me to sixth grade
until I learned how to read--

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:46.540
second time through sixth grade.

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:49.100
I had to do that twice.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.570
And so, I was told I would
never be able to graduate

01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:53.492
from high school.

01:25:53.492 --> 01:25:55.450
And so, when I graduated
from high school, then

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:56.170
I went to college.

01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:57.337
And then I was like, ha, ha!

01:25:57.337 --> 01:25:57.940
Look at me!

01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:59.770
And then I went to grad
school and then I kept going.

01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:00.353
It's like, oh!

01:26:00.353 --> 01:26:01.570
Faculty position at MIT!

01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.220
Let's go!

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:08.643
And I just needed to prove
that I could do these things,

01:26:08.643 --> 01:26:09.310
but it was hard.

01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:16.390
And there are many really
embarrassing dyslexic mistakes

01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:18.460
that I have made
over the years too.

01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.960
And when I first
started here, I was

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.140
very nervous about anybody
knowing that I was dyslexic,

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:25.310
and I have gotten beyond that.

01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:28.500
So I've now been
videotaped by a whole bunch

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.750
of the dyslexic
associations, and done

01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:33.340
all sorts of different things
where I share my stories.

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.660
So if you don't want to share a
story about something from you,

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:39.360
you can share my stories,
even if they're my students.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.530
I am cool with everybody
knowing that I am dyslexic.

01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:48.210
And if you're my TA, and
I write words that are not

01:26:48.210 --> 01:26:50.340
words on the board, or
switch numbers around,

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:52.530
just say, "Professor
Drennan, other way,"

01:26:52.530 --> 01:26:53.560
or something like that.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.460
That's cool.

01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.500
So feel free to
share these stories.

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.920
And I think it's so important
that students know there's

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.750
more than one path to success.

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:02.320
And that not
everyone is the same,

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.237
and people may struggle
with different things.

01:27:04.237 --> 01:27:07.290
They may have different
insecurities, but it's all OK.

01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:11.310
And those struggles
often make us who we are,

01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:14.100
and that science doesn't work
perfectly the first time.

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:17.340
We have to get in there and
just keep working at it.

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:19.230
And the struggles we
face in our own life

01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:22.290
is often just a really
good motivating factor

01:27:22.290 --> 01:27:25.080
for doing some really
great research.

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:25.580
All right.

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:29.750
So again, you're very
welcome to share my stories.

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:32.910
I have extra ones, if
you want to hear times

01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:35.420
that I felt insecure.

01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.050
But I heard a lot of
discussion, so maybe people

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:42.590
feel like they are willing to
share a story with us right

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.485
now?

01:27:44.485 --> 01:27:45.500
Yeah?

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.780
AUDIENCE: Going off what we
were discussing about how

01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:50.660
in science, so much of what
we hear, or what's told to us,

01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:53.390
is all successes.

01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:57.080
And also knowing that a lot of
those failures, at least for me

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.905
personally, they kind
of come in waves.

01:27:58.905 --> 01:28:00.530
There's not just one
failure at a time.

01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:01.070
It's a lot.

01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.730
[SOFT LAUGHTER]

01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:06.980
And it really wore on me at the
time, but what I think really

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:11.150
helped me was my own mentor
telling me that she struggled

01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:12.050
through her PhD.

01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:13.490
It took a long time.

01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:15.200
It was a slog.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.210
It just reminded me
that it's not always

01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:19.280
a straight line to
get to the finish.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.470
And more importantly, it's
that things will get better.

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:25.760
It'll all work out.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.030
Everything's going to be OK.

01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:31.522
And I think that really helped
me continuing on to my PhD.

01:28:31.522 --> 01:28:32.480
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yeah.

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.830
Yeah, that's wonderful.

01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:34.370
Yeah.

01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:37.380
And I often think of the waves.

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:40.800
And it's like things are
going really, really well,

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.790
and then it slows down, and
then things are not working.

01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:47.030
And if the amplitude was up
and down and this, it's like,

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.810
I'll be OK.

01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:50.985
But often it's up and then down,
and then down, and then down,

01:28:50.985 --> 01:28:53.060
and then down, and then down.

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:55.275
And you're like, in other
people their amplitudes are

01:28:55.275 --> 01:28:56.150
different in the lab.

01:28:56.150 --> 01:28:58.025
And it's like, that
person has stuff working.

01:28:58.025 --> 01:28:59.540
This person has stuff working.

01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:01.700
What is wrong?

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.613
But the thing is
that over time, it's

01:29:03.613 --> 01:29:05.780
like when it's down like
this, then when it goes up,

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:08.420
it stays up longer also.

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:10.790
So it's like getting
you there again.

01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:14.972
So yeah, that's why these
stories can be pretty powerful.

01:29:14.972 --> 01:29:16.680
Anybody else have one
they want to share?

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.180
Yeah?

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:20.630
AUDIENCE: I think why
it's been difficult for me

01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:22.700
during grad school,
especially in the beginning,

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:26.550
was that I was dealing with
some personal struggles

01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:28.700
from before grad
school and during.

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.280
And I kind of felt
like I had this burden

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.430
of keeping it a secret, because
I didn't want to come off

01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:35.930
as overly emotional.

01:29:35.930 --> 01:29:39.320
Or that because I was dealing
with these personal struggles,

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.350
that I wasn't taking
my sciences seriously.

01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:44.510
So having a mentor
that opened up

01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:47.150
about how she had also
had personal struggles

01:29:47.150 --> 01:29:49.880
and how she still was
able to be successful,

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:53.330
was really meaningful
to me, to feel

01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:56.122
like I could be both a
person and a scientist.

01:29:56.122 --> 01:29:57.330
CATHY L. DRENNAN: Yeah, yeah.

01:29:57.330 --> 01:29:58.580
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:00.330
It is one package, right?

01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:01.680
Yeah.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.210
We're all a package
of these things.

01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:04.590
So yeah, that's wonderful.

01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:08.460
And I think that sometimes
it just looks to people

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:10.830
as if everything
is going so well,

01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:13.170
and they just don't see
the inside struggles.

01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:14.880
And you don't really
know, necessarily,

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:15.960
what else is going on.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:19.140
And so, when you're comfortable
sharing these things,

01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:20.348
it can be so powerful.

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:22.890
And I feel like sometimes when
people are getting through it,

01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:25.590
it's like, now you have to
be a professor because you've

01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:28.330
got to share these
stories with other people.

01:30:28.330 --> 01:30:30.882
And that figuring out how to
deal with the struggle, I mean,

01:30:30.882 --> 01:30:31.840
that's what it's about.

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:34.470
It's not about doing everything
perfectly the first time.

01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:36.630
It's how to deal with
failure, get yourself

01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:38.735
up, get through those times.

01:30:38.735 --> 01:30:40.860
And that's what gives you
the strength to really go

01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:42.820
after doing hard stuff.

01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:43.320
All right.

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:47.990
Are there any other ones?

01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.580
OK.

01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:49.080
All right.

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.740
Let's move on.

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.450
The bad news.

01:30:52.450 --> 01:30:53.473
We all have stereotypes.

01:30:53.473 --> 01:30:55.390
I think all of you are
sitting there thinking,

01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:59.130
man, let me just count all the
different stereotypes I have.

01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:00.130
We all have stereotypes.

01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:01.970
We all have unconscious bias.

01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:05.020
Now, maybe some of you will
be like, oh, wait a minute.

01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.490
Why did I react that way?

01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:07.390
Oh, man!

01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:10.360
There's another
stereotype I have.

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:14.410
We all can be victims of
stereotype threats or imposter

01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:15.400
syndrome.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:17.650
Stereotype threat can
be pretty harmful.

01:31:17.650 --> 01:31:20.110
It can lead to
underperformance and a feeling

01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:21.820
of being judged unfairly.

01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:23.410
But there's good news.

01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:25.750
You create an environment
of trust in your classroom

01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:28.540
or in your lab,
give wise criticism,

01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:32.410
and that can really mediate the
negative effects of stereotype.

01:31:32.410 --> 01:31:34.690
If you're part of a
team doing something,

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:37.720
if someone believes that someone
else believes in them-- they're

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.452
not sure they can do it,
but my team believes in me,

01:31:40.452 --> 01:31:42.160
therefore, I can't do
it, because my team

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.080
is pretty smart.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.520
These are all ways--

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:49.220
and we have to help everyone
reach their full potential.

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.490
The students you'll be
working with this semester

01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:54.160
are crazy, smart,
and cool people.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.410
And some of them
may be insecure,

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:59.450
and you can really help them
get to their full potential.

01:31:59.450 --> 01:32:03.410
And it's an amazing opportunity
to teach smart people.

01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:05.260
So I hope you have
a wonderful time,

01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:08.770
and I hope that those horses
that are dressed like zebras

01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:10.960
in your classroom are
feeling very zebra-ish

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.210
by the end of the semester.

01:32:13.210 --> 01:32:14.960
So thank you very much
for your attention.

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.240
I loved the stories
you're shared today,

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:20.080
and have a wonderful semester.

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.830

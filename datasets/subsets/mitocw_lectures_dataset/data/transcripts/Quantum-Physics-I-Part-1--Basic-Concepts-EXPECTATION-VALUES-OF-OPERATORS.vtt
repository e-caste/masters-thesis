00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:08.340
PROFESSOR: Expectation
values of operators.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.150
So this is, in a sense,
one of our first steps

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.290
that we're going to take towards
the interpretation of quantum

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.280
mechanics.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.250
We've had already that the
wave function tells you

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.540
about probabilities.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.010
But that's not quite enough to
have the full interpretation

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.110
of what we're doing.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.910
So let's think of operators
and expectation values

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.410
that we can motivate.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:54.440
So for example, if you
have a random variable q,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.935
that can take values--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.810
so this could be a coin that
can take values heads and tails.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.510
It could be a pair of dice
that takes many values--

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:29.580
can take values in the set q1
up to qn with probabilities

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:44.360
p1 up to pn, then in
statistics, or 8044,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.750
you would say that this
variable, this random variable

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.450
has an expectation value.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.470
And the expectation value--

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:03.590
denoted by this angular symbols
over here, left and right--

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.880
it's given by the sum
over i, i equal 1 to n,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.907
of the possible values
the random variable can

00:02:13.907 --> 00:02:16.720
take times the probabilities.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.080
It's a definition
that makes sense.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.350
And it's thought to be,
this expectation value is,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.340
the expected value,
or average value,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.570
that you would obtain if you
did the experiment of tossing

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.150
the random variable many times.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.820
For each value of
the random variable,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.610
you multiply by the probability.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.130
And that's the number
you expect to get.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.960
So in a quantum system,
we follow this analogy

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.100
very closely.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.250
So what do we have
in a quantum system?

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:09.260
In the quantum system you
have that psi star of x and t.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:29.220
The x is the probability
that the particle

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.290
is in x, x plus dx.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.900
So that's the probability
that the particle

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.820
is going to be found
between x and x plus dx.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.584
The position of this particle
is like a random variable.

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:50.500
You never know where you
are going to find it.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.910
But he has different
probabilities to find it.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.630
So we could now define in
complete analogy to here,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.400
the expectation value of
the position operator,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.570
or the expectation value of
the position, expectation

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.959
value of x hat, or the
position, and say, well, I'm

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.019
going to do exactly
what I have here.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.930
I will sum the products of the
position times the probability

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.980
for the position.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.200
So I have to do
it as an integral.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.650
And in this integral,
I have to multiply

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:44.920
the position times the
probability for the position.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.480
So the probability that the disc
takes a value of x, basically

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.640
all that is in the interval
dx about x is this quantity.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.860
And that's the position
that you get when

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.030
you estimate this probability.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.790
So you must sum the values
of the random variable

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.430
times its probability.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.190
And that is taken in quantum
mechanics to be a definition.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.140
We can define the expectation
value of x by this quantity.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.570
And what does it
mean experimentally?

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.810
It means that in quantum
mechanics, if you

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.170
have a system represented
by a wave function,

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.640
you should build many
copies of the system, 100

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.530
copies of the system.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.520
In all of these copies,
you measure the position.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.890
And you make a
table of the values

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.750
that you measure the position.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.820
And you measure them at the
same time in the 100 copies.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.950
There's an experimentalist
on each one,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.470
and it measures
the position of x.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.800
You construct the
table, take the average,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.070
and that's what this quantity
should be telling you.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.450
So this quantity, as you
can see, may depend on time.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.110
But it does give you
the interpretation

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.900
of expected value
coinciding with a system,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.100
now the quantum mechanical
system, for which the position

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.760
is not anymore a quantity
that is well defined

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.260
and it's always the same.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.020
It's a random variable,
and each measurement

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.810
can give you a different
value of the position.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.150
Quantum mechanically, this
is the expected value.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.400
And the interpretation
is, again if you

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.170
measure many times, that is
the value, the average value,

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.360
you will observe.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.210
But now we can do the
same thing to understand

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.470
expectation values.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.620
We can do it with the momentum.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.670
And this is a little
more non-trivial.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:34.410
So we have also, just like we
said here, that psi star psi

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.890
dx is the probability that
the particle is in there,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:46.460
you also have that
phi of p squared.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:08:04.390
dp is the probability to find
the particle with momentum

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:12.470
in the range p p plus dp.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:26.650
So how do we define the
expected value of the momentum?

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.960
The expected value
of the momentum

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:37.350
would be given by, again, the
sum of the random variable,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.190
which is the momentum,
times the probability

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.495
that you get that value.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.000
So this is it.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.290
It's very analogous
to this expression.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.975
But it's now with momentum.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.630
Well, this is a
pretty nice thing.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:13.330
But we can learn more about it
by pushing the analogy more.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.860
And you could say,
look, this is perfect.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.450
But it's all done
in momentum space.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.340
What would happen
if you would try

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.820
to do this in position space?

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.670
That is, you know how 5p
is related to psi of x.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.050
So write everything
in terms of x.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.850
I would like to see this
formula in terms of x.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.980
It would be a very
good thing to have.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.470
So let's try to do that.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:52.030
So we have to do a little bit
of work here with integrals.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.790
So it's not so bad.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:10:04.120
p phi star of p phi of p dp.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.270
And for this one,
you have to write it

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.400
as an integral
over some position.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.030
So let me call it
over position x prime.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.845
This you will write this an
integral over some position x.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.020
And then we're going to try
to rewrite the whole thing

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:32.470
in terms of coordinate space.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.920
So what do we have here?

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.063
We have integral pdp.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:46.180
And the first phi star would
be the integral over dx prime.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.300
We said there is the
square root 2 pi h

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.990
bar that we can't forget.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:11:04.710
5p, it would have an e to
the ip x prime over h bar,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:11.580
and a psi star of x prime.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.780
So I did conjugate
this phi star of p.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.670
I may have it here.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.680
Yes, it's here.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:28.750
I conjugated it and did
the integral over x prime.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:37.300
And now we have another one,
integral vx over 2 pi h bar e

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:44.800
to the minus ipx over h
bar, and you have psi of x.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.940
Now there's a lot
of integrals there,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:58.890
and let's try to
get them simplified.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:26.280
So we're going to try to
do first the p integral.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.660
So let's try to clean up
everything in such a way

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.590
that we have only p done first.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:41.915
So we'll have a 1 over 2 pi h
bar from the two square roots.

00:12:41.915 --> 00:12:46.460
And I'll have the two
integrals dx prime psi

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:53.840
of x prime star the x psi of x.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:02.420
So again, as we
said, these integrals

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.800
we just wrote them out.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.300
They cannot be done.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:11.670
So our only hope is to simplify
first the pdp integral.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:20.120
So here we would have
integral of dp times p times

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.690
e to the ipx prime over h bar.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:30.344
And e to the minus
ipx over h bar.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.210
Now we need a little
bit of-- probably

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:51.120
if you were doing this, it
would not be obvious what to do,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.720
unless you have some
intuition of what the momentum

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.630
operator used to be.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:05.100
The momentum operator
used to be dvx, basically.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.930
Now this integral would
be a delta function

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.890
if the p was not here.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.080
But here is the p.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.350
So what I should try to
do is get rid of that p

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.900
in order to understand
what we have.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:26.430
So here we'll do integral dp.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:31.382
And look, output here
minus h bar over idvx.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.260
And leave everything
here to the right,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:45.713
e to the ipx prime over h bar
p to the minus ipx over h bar.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.630
I claim this is the same.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:55.070
Because this
operator, h over iddx,

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.930
well, it doesn't act on x prime.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.930
But it acts here.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.760
And when it does, it will
produce just the factor of p

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.750
that you have.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.410
Because the minus i and
the minus i will cancel.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.110
The h bar will cancel.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.240
And the ddh will
just bring down a p.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:20.420
So this is the way to have
this work out quite nicely.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:29.510
Now this thing is
inside the integral.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.810
But it could as well be
outside the integral.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.500
It has nothing to do with dp.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.670
So I'll rewrite this again.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:50.170
I'll write it as dx prime psi
of x prime star integral dx

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.130
psi of x.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:16:01.780
And I'll put this here,
minus h bar over iddx,

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.900
in front of the integral.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.670
The 1 over 2 pi h bar here.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:17.218
Integral dp e to the ipx
prime minus x over h bar.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.890
So I simply did a
couple of things.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:27.920
I moved that 1 over
2 pi h to the right.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.210
And then I said this derivative
could be outside the integral.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.140
Because it's an integral over p.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.405
It doesn't interfere with x
derivative, so I took it out.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.240
Now the final two steps,
we're almost there.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.790
The first step is to say,
with this it's a ddx.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.070
And yes, this is a
function of x and x prime.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.190
But I don't want to
take that derivative.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.950
Because I'm going to
complicate things.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:07.190
In fact, this is already
looking like a delta function.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.190
There's a dp dp.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.730
And the h bars that
actually would cancel.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.630
So this is a perfectly
nice delta function.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.589
You can change variables.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:25.310
Do p equal u times h bar and
see that actually the h bar

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.869
doesn't matter.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:31.030
And this is just delta
of x prime minus x.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.340
And in here, you could
act on the delta function.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.180
But you could say, no, let
me do integration by parts

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.390
and act on this one.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.670
When you do
integration by parts,

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.560
you have to worry about
the term at the boundary.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.070
But if your wave functions
vanish sufficiently fast

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.530
at infinity, there's no problem.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.350
So let's assume
we're in that case.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.980
We will integrate by parts and
then do the delta function.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.320
So what do we have here?

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:26.203
I have integral dx prime psi
star of x prime integral dx.

00:18:26.203 --> 00:18:29.940
And now I have, because
of the sign of integration

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:37.420
by parts, h over iddx of psi.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:42.470
And then we have the delta
function of x minus x prime.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.880
It's probably better
still to write

00:18:52.880 --> 00:19:02.540
the integral like this, dx
h bar over iddx of psi times

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:11.890
integral dx prime psi star of x
prime delta of x minus x prime.

00:19:16.096 --> 00:19:20.720
And we're almost
done, so that's good.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:26.700
We're almost done.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.480
We can do the
integral over x prime.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.270
And it will elevate
that wave function at x.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:43.850
So at the end of the
day, what have we found?

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.950
We found that p, the
expectation value of p,

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:58.210
equal integral of p phi of
p squared dp is equal to--

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.670
we do this integral.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:05.630
So we have integral dx,
I'll write it two times,

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:15.275
h over i d psi dx of x and
t and psi star of x and t.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.550
I'm not sure I
carried that times.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.500
I didn't put the time anywhere.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.860
So maybe I shouldn't
put it here yet.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.780
This is what we did.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.160
And might as well write
it in the standard order,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.060
where the complex conjugate
function appears first.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.375
This is what we found.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.280
So this is actually very neat.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.810
Let me put the time back
everywhere you could put time.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.210
Because this is a
time dependent thing.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:09.480
So p, expectation value
is p phi of p and t

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:21.960
squared dp is equal to
integral dx psi star of x.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.430
And now we have, if
you wish, p hat psi

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:31.230
of x, where p hat
is what we used

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.450
to call the momentum operator.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.000
So look what has happened.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.430
We started with this
expression for the expectation

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.630
value of the momentum
justified by the probabilistic

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.710
interpretation of phi.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.670
And we were led to
this expression, which

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.620
is very similar to this one.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:10.440
You see, you have the psi
star, the psi, and the x there.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.050
But here, the momentum
appeared at this position,

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:21.020
acting on the wave function
psi, not on psi star.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.360
And that's the way,
in quantum mechanics,

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:30.270
people define expectation
values of operators in general.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:45.040
So in general,
for an operator q,

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.680
we'll define the
expectation value of q

00:22:50.680 --> 00:23:05.440
to be integral dx psi
star of x and t q acting

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.250
on the psi of x and t.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:22.280
So you will always do this
of putting the operator

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.550
to act on the second part
of the wave function,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.190
on the second appearance
of the wave function.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.020
Not on the psi star,
but on the psi.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:41.950
We can do other examples of
this and our final theorem.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.380
This is, of course,
time dependent.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:58.190
So let me do one example and
our final time dependence

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.565
analysis of this quantity.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:27.450
So for example, if you would
think of the kinetic operator

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:30.110
example.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:42.030
Kinetic operator t is p squared
over 2m is a kinetic operator.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.900
How would you compute
its expectation value?

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:55.015
Expectation value of the
kinetic operator is what?

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:04.400
Well, I could do the
position space calculation,

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:11.170
in which I think of the kinetic
operator as an operator that

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:15.830
acts in position space where
the momentum is h bar over iddx.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:23.950
So then I would have integral
dx psi star of x and t.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:31.070
And then I would have minus
h squared over 2m d second dx

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:35.090
squared of psi of x and t.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.330
So here I did exactly
what I was supposed

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.790
to do given this formula.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.890
But you could do another
thing if you wished.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:57.020
You could say, look, I can
work in momentum space.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:02.360
This is a momentums operator p.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.860
Just like I defined the
expectation value of p,

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.070
I could have the expectation
value of p squared.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.820
So the other
possibility is that you

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:26.160
have t is equal to the
integral dp of p squared

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.460
over 2m times phi of p squared.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.230
This is the operator.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.140
And this is the probability.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.820
Or you could write it
more elegantly perhaps.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:53.900
dp phi star of p t
squared over 2m phi of p.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.030
These are just
integrals of numbers.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.710
All these are numbers already.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.440
So in momentum
space, it's easier

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.310
to find the expectation value
of the kinetic operator.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.420
In coordinate space,
you have to do this.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:22.950
You might even say, look,
this thing looks positive.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.090
Because it's p squared
of the number squared.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:33.000
In the center here,
it looks negative.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.920
But that's an illusion.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.020
The second derivative can
be partially integrated.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.970
One of the two
derivatives can be

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.380
integrated to act on this one.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.700
So if you do partial
integration by parts,

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:58.030
you would have integral
dx h squared over 2m.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:06.820
And then you would have d
psi dx squared by integration

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.420
by parts.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.970
And that's clearly
positive as well.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.770
So it's similar to this.

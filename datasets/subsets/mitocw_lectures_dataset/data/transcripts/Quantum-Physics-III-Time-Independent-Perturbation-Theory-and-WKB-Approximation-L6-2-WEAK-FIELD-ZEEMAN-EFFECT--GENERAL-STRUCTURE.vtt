WEBVTT

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.465
PROFESSOR: So case A--
weak Zeeman effect.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.540
So what are our states here?

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.130
We discovered that and we know
those are the coupled basis

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.450
states.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.230
And the states of H0
tilde eigenstates--

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.570
they are approximate
eigenstates--

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.540
are the states n, l, j, mj.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.740
And the energies were
energies dependent on n and j.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:15.180
So the 1S 1/2, 2S 1/2,
2P 1/2, and 2P 3/2.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.930
Roughly, to remind
you of what happened,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.530
the original states
were shifted,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.450
and we used the j
quantum number in here.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.940
And those are our multiplets.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.230
Those are our multiplets.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.760
And we have a lot of
degeneracy as usual.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.980
So this is degeneracy
here and degeneracy here

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.020
because a multiplet
P 3/2 is j equal 3/2.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.770
And that's four states.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.550
Here you have two
states, and here you

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.690
have two states as well.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.180
So quite a bit of states
that are degenerate.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.830
So in principle, when we
do the Zeeman splitting,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.480
we may have to consider the
full matrix n, l, j, mj, delta H

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:32.380
Zeeman, nl prime j m prime j.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.540
So what are our degeneracies?

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:44.830
Our degeneracies are when
you have a given value of j.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.830
So a degenerate subspace
can have different l's--

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.700
for example, here--
but the same j,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.460
and therefore different mj's.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:06.470
Or within a given j multiplet,
it might have different mj's.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.610
So this is the scope
of the degeneracy.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.350
And in principle, we may have to
diagonalize a matrix like that

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.480
by looking at the
degenerate spaces.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.640
If you're doing
the level two, you

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.480
would have to discuss
these four states here.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.510
You would have to discuss
this other four states.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.480
Happily, we don't
have to do that much

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.010
because, as usual, delta H
Zeeman is proportional to l z

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.890
plus 2Sz.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.355
And this commutes with l
squared with delta H Zeeman.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.120
l squared commutes
with any l operator.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.700
It certainly commutes
with any S operator.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.350
They don't even
talk to each other.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.980
And therefore, l
squared commutes

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.590
with l Zeeman, which
means that when

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.720
l is different from l prime,
this matrix element has

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.570
to vanish.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.700
This is our remark from
perturbation theory long,

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.310
long ago.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.420
You have another
operator for which

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.200
the states have different
eigenvalues, commutes

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.740
with your perturbation.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.870
The matrix element
of the perturbation

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.720
must vanish between
those states.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.530
So we don't have
eigenstates like that.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.760
And when l is equal
to l prime already--

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.150
so we focus on l
equals to l prime--

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.060
we only need to worry
within multiplets.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:53.800
So you have n, l, j, mj, delta H
Zeeman now, and l, j, mj prime.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.840
It's an issue of mj prime now.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.970
But Zeeman thing
commutes with Jz.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.035
Jz commutes with delta H Zeeman.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.760
Jz is Lz plus Sz,
and z components

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.710
in angular momentum--
two identical components

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.190
always commute, of course.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.800
So Jz commutes with
delta H Zeeman.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.710
So this thing will vanish
unless m is equal to m prime.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.870
And that's great
because you're back

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.610
to nondegenerate
perturbation theory.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.760
The whole matrix,
this Zeeman thing

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.500
could have turned out to
be complicated matrices.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.000
No.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.980
It's perfectly
diagonal in this basis.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.460
There's nothing to
worry about here,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.060
except that it's still not easy
to compute, as we will see.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.970
So what do we need to compute?

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.590
We'll have the first
order corrections

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:13.930
due to Zeeman on the n,
l, j, mj basis is equal--

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.950
well, the Zeeman Hamiltonian
had an e over 2mc.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.140
So let's put it there.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.050
e.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.580
Let's put the B close to the e.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.260
2mc.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:40.450
And now we have to do n l
j mj Lz plus 2Sz n l j mj.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.360
Perfectly diagonal.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.490
And that's nondegenerate
perturbation theory.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.770
It's going to give us
all the energies we want.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.560
All the splittings we want.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.490
So basically what's going to
happen, as you can see here,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.860
is that the things down mix.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.760
Everything is there.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.400
Honestly, these two
levels are going to split.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.560
These two levels
are going to split.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.440
These four levels
are going to split.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.770
Everything is going
to split here.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.290
The remarkable thing
of this formula,

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.730
and it's going to keep us busy
for about 10, 15 more minutes,

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:27.870
is that this thing, this matrix
element, is proportional to mj.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.100
So the states split proportional
to the m quantum number.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.470
The state with the m equal 3/2
will split three times as much

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.770
as the state with m equal 1/2.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.140
And that's not obvious here.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.880
It's a remarkable
result. It's part

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.670
of what's called the
Wigner-Eckart theorem,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.460
something that you study in
graduate quantum mechanics.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.150
But we're going to see a bit
of it, the beginning of it,

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.370
in this computation.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.920
And it's a fairly
remarkable result.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.150
So the remarkable result here--

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:15.270
remarkable-- is
that E [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.905
are proportional to mj.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.240
And that defines
a linear splitting

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.850
because it's linearly
proportional to the magnitude

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.960
of the magnetic field and
divides the states nicely.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.990
So we want to understand
this matrix element.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.150
And there's a little
thing we can do.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:46.950
Notice that Lz plus 2Sz
is equal to Jz plus Sz.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.020
You can take one of the
Sz's and complete Jz,

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.260
and you're left with that.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:13.050
So the matrix element n l j m
Lz plus 2Sz n l j mj is equal--

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.740
if you have a Jz, that gives
you just something proportional

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:34.720
to Hmj plus n l
j mj Sz n l j mj.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.460
So OK.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.320
A little bit of
the mystery maybe

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.220
seems to you at least
consistent here.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.380
I said this matrix element turns
out to be proportional to mj.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.480
And certainly,
this piece, having

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:57.810
to do with the J component
here, is proportional to mj.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:04.770
The mystery that remains
is why this matrix element

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.210
would be proportional to mj.

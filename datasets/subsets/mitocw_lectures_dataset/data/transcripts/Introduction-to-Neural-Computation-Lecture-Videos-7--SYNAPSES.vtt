WEBVTT

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.480
MICHALE FEE: OK, so let's
go ahead and get started.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:27.410
OK, so in the last
lecture, we talked

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.340
about how the inputs to neurons
actually come into a cell

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.820
mostly on the dendrite, which
is this extended arborization

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.170
of cylinders of
cell membrane that

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.070
give a very large
surface area that

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.270
allow many, many synapses to
contact onto a neuron, many

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.030
more than would be possible
if all of those synapses

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.860
were trying to connect to
this neuron on its soma.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.350
Today, we are going to follow up
on that general picture of how

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.730
neurons receive inputs.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.240
And today, we're going to focus
on the question of how synapses

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.800
work.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.070
So we're going to
start by looking

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.710
at a simple model of synapses.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.900
And we're going to
end by understanding

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.690
how synapses on different
parts of the neuron

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.060
can actually do quite
different things.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.160
So here's our list of
learning objectives for today.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.600
So we're going to learn how to
add a synapse to an equivalent

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.720
circuit model.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.440
And we're going to
describe a simple model

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.490
of how that actually generates
voltage changes in a neuron

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.270
and what those synaptic
inputs actually do.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.590
We're going to describe
mathematical process called

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.700
convolution.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.180
That's going to allow us
to extend the idea of how

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.030
a neuron responds
to a single input

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.320
spike from a presynaptic
neuron to how a neuron responds

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.250
to multiple spikes coming
from a presynaptic neuron.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.480
So we're going to introduce
this idea of convolution,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.430
which I'm sure many of
you have heard of before.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.660
But it's going to play an
increasingly important role

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.260
in the class.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.210
And so we're going
to introduce it here.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.340
We're going to talk about the
idea of synaptic saturation,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.710
which is the idea that a single
synaptic input can generate

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.870
a small response in a neuron.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.370
You would think that as you
generate more and more synaptic

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.630
inputs to a neuron
that the response

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.160
of the postsynaptic neuron
might just keep increasing.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.200
But, in fact, the response
of a neuron to its inputs

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.970
saturates at some level.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.920
And that process of
saturation actually

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.770
has very important
consequences for how neurons

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.080
respond to their inputs.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.130
And then finally, we're
going to end with a fun story

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.060
about the different functions
of somatic and dendritic

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.660
inhibition.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.880
And we're going to tell
that story in the context

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.930
of a crayfish behavior.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.390
All right, so let's start
with chemical synapses.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.340
There are also electrical
synapses, which

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.590
we're not going to talk about.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.010
And that's basically where
two neurons can actually

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.390
contact each other.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.887
There are actually proteins
that form little holes

00:03:15.887 --> 00:03:16.720
between the neurons.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.390
And so they're just directly
electrically connected

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.260
with each other.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.840
That's called an electrical
synapse, or a gap junction.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.548
We're not going to
talk about that today.

00:03:24.548 --> 00:03:26.690
We're going to focus
on chemical synapses.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.220
So this is the structure of
a typical excitatory synapse

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.700
from a presynaptic neuron.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.910
This is the axon of
a presynaptic neuron

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.760
onto the dendrites of
a postsynaptic neuron.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.600
Postsynaptic dendrites have
often these specializations

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.880
called spines, which
are just little

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.560
mushroom like protrusions of the
cell membrane of the dendrite

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.870
onto which presynaptic
neurons can form of synapse.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.930
So this is called the
presynaptic component

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.650
or terminal.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.630
That's the
postsynaptic component

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.790
or postsynaptic terminal.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.130
On the presynaptic
side, there are

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.760
very small synaptic vesicles,
about 30 to 40 nanometers

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.790
in diameter, that
sort of form a cloud

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.580
or a cluster on the just
on the inside surface

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.860
of this synaptic junction.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.910
The synapses are typically
about a half a micron across.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.880
And the synaptic
cleft is very small.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.400
It's about 20 nanometers.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.530
So this is not quite to scale.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.520
This should be maybe a
little bit closer here.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.450
All right, notice that
that is very small.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.340
That synapse is really tiny.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.220
It's about the wavelength.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.360
Its size is equal to 1
wavelength of green light.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.120
So it's a tiny structure.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.800
There's a lot going on inside
that little thing, though.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.390
And here's we're going to walk
through the sequence of events

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.450
that just describes how
a presynaptic action

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.400
potential leads
to depolarization

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.720
and in a postsynaptic neuron.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.860
So we have an action potential
that propagates down.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.070
That's a pulse of
depolarizing voltage.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.890
When it reaches the
synaptic terminal,

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.920
that pulse of
depolarizing voltage

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.380
is about plus 50 millivolts.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.120
That activates voltage gated
calcium channels that turn on,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.540
just the same way that we've
described voltage activated

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.620
sodium channels and
potassium channels.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.020
That allows calcium ions to flow
into the presynaptic terminal.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.090
That calcium flows in and binds
to presynaptic proteins that

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.970
dock these vesicles
onto the membrane facing

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.380
the synaptic cleft.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.500
That causes those vesicles
to fuse with the membrane.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.840
They open up and release
their neurotransmitters.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.920
So all of those vesicles are
filled with neurotransmitter.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.970
The vesicles are coated
with actual pumps that

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.930
take neurotransmitter
from inside of the cell

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.280
and pump it into the vesicles.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.060
So then calcium flows in.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.520
Vesicle fuses, releases
neurotransmitter

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.050
into the cleft.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.468
Neurotransmitter then
diffuses in the cleft.

00:06:16.468 --> 00:06:18.010
You could actually
calculate how long

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.430
it takes to get from one side
to the other now, I think.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.460
It's not very long.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.750
Ligand gated ion
channels, they're

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.270
basically like the
kinds of ion channels

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.830
we've already been discussing.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.850
But instead of being
gated by voltage,

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.140
they're gated by the binding of
a neurotransmitter to a binding

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.180
site on the outside
of the protein.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.980
That produces a
conformational change

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.010
that opens the pour
to the flow of ions.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:54.290
Now, you have neurotransmitter
binds to these, opens the pour.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.970
You have now positive ions
that flow into the cell,

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.720
because the cell
is hyperpolarized.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.490
So it has a low voltage.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.410
Positive ions flow
into the cell.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.420
That corresponds to an increase
in the synaptic conductance.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.660
What is that flow of ions,
positive ions, into the cell

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.481
do?

00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:18.950
It depolarizes the cell.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.230
You have synaptic current
flowing in that then--

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.640
I forget to put it on there--

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.240
depolarizes the cell.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.310
Any questions about that?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.520
OK, let's talk a little
bit about the sort of some

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.550
of the interesting numbers, like
how many synapses there are,

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.000
how many cells, how many
dendrites in a little piece

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.980
of neural tissue.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.140
It's pretty staggering actually.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.120
So the synopses are small.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.920
But what's really amazing is
that in a cubic millimeter

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.900
of cortical tissue, there
are a billion synapses.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.690
And if you think
about what that means,

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:08.700
there is a synapse on a grid,
on a lattice, every 1.1 microns.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:15.480
So they're sort of some
fraction of a micron big.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.020
And there's one of
them every micron.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.925
Most of your brain is
filled with synapses.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:33.570
There are 4.1 kilometers of axon
in that same cubic millimeter

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.640
and 500 meters of dendrite.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:46.560
A typical cortical cell
receives about 10,000 synapses.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.350
Each cell has about 4
millimeters of dendrite

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.550
and 4 centimeters of axon.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.850
And there are about 10 to the
5 neurons per cubic millimeter

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.850
in the mouse cortex.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.050
And in your entire
brain, there are about 10

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.050
of the 8 neurons, which is
the same roughly as the number

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.750
of stars in our galaxy.

00:09:10.468 --> 00:09:12.260
And we're going to
figure out how it works.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.870
OK, so let's come back to this.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.830
So let's start by adding
a synapse to an equivalent

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.950
circuit model and understanding
how that model works.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.910
So let's start with an
ionotropic receptor.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.220
So ionotropic receptors are
neurotransmitter receptors

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.150
that also form an ion channel.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.640
There are other kinds of
neurotransmitter receptors

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.500
where a neurotransmitter binds.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.570
And that sends a
chemical signal that

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.280
opens up a different
kind of ion channel.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.700
Those are called metabotropic
neurotransmitter receptors.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.670
We're going to focus today
on ionotropic receptors.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.340
So a neurotransmitter binds.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.210
That binding opens a gate.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.020
And that allows a
current to flow.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.470
So these guys,
Magleby and Stevens,

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.690
did an experiment to understand
how that conductance--

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.440
so when that ion channel opens,
it turns on a conductance.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.260
And you can directly
measure that conductance

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.450
by doing a voltage
clamp experiment.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.270
So here's the
experiment they did.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.550
They took a muscle
fiber from a frog.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.100
They set up a
voltage clamp on it,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.960
so an electrode to
measure the voltage,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.060
and another electrode
to inject current.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.030
You hold the voltage
at different levels.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.770
And then what they did was
they stimulated electrically

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.630
the motor axon, the
axon of the motor neuron

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.150
that innervates the muscle.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.690
So that then activates
this neuromuscular junction

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.300
that opens
acetylcholine receptors

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.850
and produces a current
as a function of time

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.220
after the synapse is activated.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.000
Any questions about the setup?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.800
We're simply holding the
cell at different voltages,

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.350
activating the synapse, and
measuring how much current

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.070
flows through the synapse.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.570
Yes.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.951
AUDIENCE: So with the
current flows through the ion

00:11:14.951 --> 00:11:16.890
channels in the muscle fibers?

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.270
MICHALE FEE: The current is
flowing through these ion

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.863
channels here in the synapse.

00:11:23.863 --> 00:11:25.280
Now, remember,
there are all sorts

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.400
of sodium channels and potassium
channels and all those things.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.305
But do those do anything?

00:11:32.305 --> 00:11:34.420
AUDIENCE: Not really.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.810
MICHALE FEE: We're just
holding the voltage-- that's

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.570
why the voltage is so
important, because if you were

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.950
to do this experiment without
a voltage, you would stimulate

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.220
and the muscle would contract.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.110
And it would rip the electrodes
out of the muscle fiber.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.520
So when you voltage clamp
it, it holds the cell

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.950
at a constant potential,
so that the cell

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:57.720
can't spike when the current
flows in through the synapse.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.944
Yes.

00:11:58.944 --> 00:12:03.312
AUDIENCE: On the graph,
would the shock [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:04.520
MICHALE FEE: Yes, the shock--

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.790
AUDIENCE: The difference is
like in positive and negative--

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.940
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, I'm
going to explain this.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.910
I'm just setting
it up right now.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.480
OK, any questions
about the setup?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.650
Good questions.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.930
One step ahead of me.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.717
All right, so now, let's look
at what actually happens.

00:12:21.717 --> 00:12:23.550
So what you can see is
that the current that

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.940
goes through these ion
channels is different

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.210
depending on the voltage
that you hold the cell at.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.800
So if you hold the cell
at a negative potential--

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.620
so here you can see, the voltage
it is like minus 120 here.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.800
And what happens
is after you shock,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.200
you see this large,
inward current.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.800
Remember, inward current,
negative current corresponds

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.230
to positive ions going into
the cell, inward current.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:59.470
So after you activate
the motor axon,

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.690
you get a large
inward current that

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.670
lasts a couple milliseconds.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.950
That corresponds
to current going

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.620
into the cell that would
depolarize the cell

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.560
and activate it, right?

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.650
But as you raise
the voltage, you

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.620
can see that the
current gets smaller.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.320
And at some point, the
current actually goes to zero.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.710
And it goes to zero
when you are holding

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.450
the membrane potential
close to zero.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.420
And as you hold the membrane
potential more positive,

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.630
you can see that the current
actually goes the other way.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.270
So what we can do is we can
now plot that peak current

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.680
as a function of the
holding potential.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.740
So we're measuring
current through an ion

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.570
channel at different voltages.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.750
So what are we
going to plot next?

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.660
Just like we did for
the sodium channel,

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.625
for the potassium channel,
we're going to-- what

00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:00.500
are we going to plot?

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.645
What kind of plot?

00:14:01.645 --> 00:14:02.907
AUDIENCE: I-V.

00:14:02.907 --> 00:14:03.990
MICHALE FEE: An I-V curve.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.380
Excellent.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.040
Let's do that.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.470
You can see it's
actually linear.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.800
So the current is negative when
you hold the cell negative.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.860
The current's positive when
you hold the cell above zero.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.630
And it crosses at zero.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:24.070
What do we call that place
where it crosses zero?

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.820
What does that tell us?

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.432
When this ion channel is open--

00:14:29.432 --> 00:14:30.670
AUDIENCE: Reversal potential.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.087
MICHALE FEE: So
reversal potential

00:14:32.087 --> 00:14:34.180
or the equilibrium
potential, that's right.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.480
That's kind of weird, right?

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.840
An equilibrium
potential that's zero.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.600
What kind of channel has an
equilibrium potential at zero?

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.130
Remember, sodium was very
negative, like minus 80--

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.858
sorry, potassium
was very negative.

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:55.870
MICHALE FEE: Excellent.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.407
It's something that passes
both potassium and sodium.

00:14:59.407 --> 00:15:00.115
It's like a hole.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.770
So this ion channel is
basically like opening

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.510
a hole that passes positive
ions in both directions.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.140
Potassium goes out,
sodium comes in.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.200
Yes.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.955
AUDIENCE: But that is only
like [INAUDIBLE] before the--

00:15:19.955 --> 00:15:21.580
MICHALE FEE: Notice
that we're plotting

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.280
that the current as
a function of all

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.030
voltages, and it
crosses at zero.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.360
There's zero current at zero
voltage, which happens when you

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.550
have just a non-selective pore.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.070
OK, what does that look like?

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:45.480
An I-V curve that looks
like that, what is that?

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.920
There's a name for that.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:54.610
You use it when you
build a circuit.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.756
You might have some transistors
and some capacitors and some--

00:15:58.756 --> 00:16:00.940
how about some resistors?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.440
It's just a resistor.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.600
That's what the I-V curve
of a resistor looks like.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.310
And if we were to
put it in series

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.685
with a battery, what would
the voltage of the battery be?

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:14.750
Zero.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.790
Remember, if we put it
in series with a battery,

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.200
it produces an offset.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.070
So it's just our same equation--

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.810
the current is just a
conductance times a voltage.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.890
It's just Ohm's law.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.840
That's 1 over resistance.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.730
And it's V minus e synaptic.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.950
And e synaptic is just 0.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:42.080
So that's called the
driving potential.

00:16:44.592 --> 00:16:45.550
That's the conductance.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.220
Can anyone take a guess at
what the conductance looks

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.720
like as a function of time?

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.920
Somebody just hold
your hand up, and--

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.230
I see two answers
that are very close.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.895
Lena.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:03.230
AUDIENCE: Would it be like that?

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.079
MICHALE FEE: Start over here.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:04.940
Like go this way.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.890
What would the conductance
do as a function of time

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.690
to make the current
look like this?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.180
What would it be here?

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.740
What would the
conductance be here?

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.560
Remember, the voltage is
being held at some value.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.720
The current is zero.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.525
So the conductance must be?

00:17:29.525 --> 00:17:30.150
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.840
MICHALE FEE: Zero.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.680
And how about here?

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.448
It should be some
big conductance.

00:17:36.448 --> 00:17:37.490
And then what about here?

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.390
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.140
MICHALE FEE: Zero.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.130
So what is that-- excellent,
it just looks like that.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.420
The conductance just turns
on and then turns off.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.670
Anybody want to take a
guess at why that might be?

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.430
Shock.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.800
What happens here?

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.760
Why does this turn on?

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.110
Because neurotransmitter
binds to the receptor,

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.340
opens the channel.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.480
And then what happens?

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.310
The neurotransmitter falls off.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:16.950
And the neurotransmitter
receptor closes.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:17.610
That's it.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.980
We're going to do a little
bit of mathematical modeling

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.480
of that.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.610
But it's going to
be pretty simple.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.390
All right?

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.910
OK.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.110
So there is our
equivalent circuit.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:31.920
This thing right here
equals conductance times

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.290
of driving potential
electrically is just that.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.370
You remember that, right?

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:43.050
That's the same way we modeled
the current of the sodium

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.443
channel or the
potassium channel.

00:18:46.443 --> 00:18:50.488
AUDIENCE: So the
graphical [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:50.488 --> 00:18:55.150
because it's linear, why
would that [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.837
MICHALE FEE: The
conductance constant?

00:18:56.837 --> 00:18:57.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.087
MICHALE FEE: OK.

00:18:58.087 --> 00:18:59.620
Because look at the current.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.900
So, remember, these
different voltages

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.050
here just correspond
to these voltages.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.640
Here V minus E sin.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.050
So E sin is what?

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.750
The synaptic reversal
potential is just zero, right?

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.370
So for each one of
these experiments,

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.160
this driving potential
is just constant.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.170
It's just given by this holding
potential in the voltage kind

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.320
of experiment.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.870
So in order to
turn something that

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.070
looks like this into something
that looks like this,

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.680
you have to multiply it by
something that looks like that.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.553
Does that makes sense?

00:19:32.553 --> 00:19:33.970
For each one of
those experiments,

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.490
this term is constant.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.870
And so to get a current
that looks like this,

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.460
the conductance has
to look like that.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.590
Does that makes sense?

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.630
AUDIENCE: guess she's
asking the upper--

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.380
MICHALE FEE: Oh, sorry, did
I misunderstand the question?

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.153
Ask it again.

00:19:54.153 --> 00:19:54.820
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.910
I was talking about that one.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:56.120
MICHALE FEE: Oh.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.028
AUDIENCE: But explanation
did make sense.

00:19:58.028 --> 00:19:59.070
MICHALE FEE: Did it help?

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.830
But it was the
wrong explanation.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.530
OK, so ask your question again.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.250
AUDIENCE: Yes, so I
was trying to relate it

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.500
to what we were doing earlier
with a [? coefficient ?]

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.167
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:08.917
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:12.540
AUDIENCE: And it had an I-V
curve that looked something

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.240
like that curve--

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.580
MICHALE FEE: Oh, it like had
some funny shape like this.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it looked
like [INAUDIBLE] at zero.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.870
And then it was like--

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.770
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, so remember,
this is as a function of time.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.620
And this is exactly what the
sodium conductance looked

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.290
like as a function of time.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.310
It turns on.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.700
And then it turns off.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.690
For the sodium conductance,
this turning on

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.850
happened with a voltage step.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.790
And the turning off happened
because of the inactivation

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.772
gate.

00:20:42.772 --> 00:20:43.980
In this case, it's different.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.820
What's turning this thing on
is a neurotransmitter binding

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.250
that turns it off.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.347
And what turns it off
is not inactivation.

00:20:51.347 --> 00:20:53.430
It's the fact that the
neurotransmitter falls off.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.350
But it has the same
time dependence.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.440
It's just different mechanisms.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.618
And then for this, was there
a question still about this?

00:21:08.618 --> 00:21:09.160
AUDIENCE: No.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.451
[INAUDIBLE] using
that with the--

00:21:11.451 --> 00:21:13.360
MICHALE FEE: Oh, with
the tie-- it was, OK--

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.670
and you understand why this
doesn't look like this, right?

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:15.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.422
MICHALE FEE: The
reason that happened

00:21:17.422 --> 00:21:21.280
is because it looked
like this for most of it,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.410
but it went back down to 0 here
as a function of voltage y.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.240
Because of the
voltage dependence

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.130
shuts the [AUDIO OUT]
off down here,

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.357
this doesn't have
voltage dependent.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.810
It's cool how all this
stuff ties together, right?

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.790
It's sort of the same stuff we
learned for the Hodgkin Huxley,

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.180
just applies to this case here.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.850
All right, so
there's the circuit.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.600
Here's the model that
we described before.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:57.600
There's a simple soma with
a capacitance and some leak

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.560
conductance.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.310
And now that is
how we would model

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:08.823
attaching a synapse, any kind
of a synapse, onto a soma.

00:22:08.823 --> 00:22:10.740
And if we wanted the
some to be able to spike,

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.130
we would add some potassium,
some voltage dependent

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:18.530
potassium and some
voltage dependent sodium.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.900
All right, any questions?

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.420
Yeah.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.845
AUDIENCE: I probably should
have asked this a long time ago

00:22:21.845 --> 00:22:23.270
and not [INAUDIBLE] circuit.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.550
Do you know whether to have
the big line of the battery--

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.870
MICHALE FEE: Oh, yeah, so that's
not a dumb question at all.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:35.860
The answer is don't
worry about it.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.450
Like there's a convention that
the big one is the plus side.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.390
And I'm not even 100% sure
I've been perfectly consistent

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.530
in all my slides.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.660
The long line is supposed
to be the positive side

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.285
of the battery.

00:22:47.285 --> 00:22:48.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.820
MICHALE FEE: Just don't worry.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.153
Just make one big and one small.

00:22:51.153 --> 00:22:54.160
And don't-- just make
it a battery symbol.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.070
And I don't care if
it's the right way.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.570
OK.

00:23:00.327 --> 00:23:00.827
OK?

00:23:05.433 --> 00:23:07.600
You don't want to make it
too much like a capacitor,

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.267
because if they're
the same length, then

00:23:09.267 --> 00:23:11.490
it looks like a capacitor.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.690
And if you're worried just draw
an arrow and write battery.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:18.330
OK?

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.440
All right, good.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.010
OK, so now, let's step back from
our voltage clamp of experiment

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.180
and attach this synapse
to a real neuron,

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.980
like this thing, the
one that can't spike.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.780
It's just a leaky soma
that's hyperpolarized.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.900
And now, what's the voltage
in the cell going to do

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.590
when we activate that synapse.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.420
What is the voltage here?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.430
We're turning on
this conductance.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.320
What that's means is
we're making distance

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.720
get really small.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.210
So what is the voltage
inside the cell going to do?

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.433
It's going to
approach something.

00:23:56.433 --> 00:23:57.600
What's it going to approach?

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.980
We have this circuit.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.410
We have a battery
and a resistor.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.500
Let's make that resistor
really, really big.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.140
That connects the battery
between the outside and inside

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.070
of our neuron.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.060
And now we make the resistor
really small all of a sudden.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.988
What's going to happen
to the voltage in here?

00:24:22.988 --> 00:24:25.820
AUDIENCE: What is G I?

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.820
MICHALE FEE: Sorry, just
some other conductance.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.980
And let's just imagine that
it's like potassium conductance

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.110
that's kind of holding
the cell hyperpolarized.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.020
But I don't want you to
focus on this right now.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.670
What I want you to
focus on is what

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.430
would happen here when I
turn on that synapse, when

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.530
I make the resistor
really small,

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.140
when I make the
conductance really big.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.175
What's going to happen to
the voltage inside the cell?

00:24:52.175 --> 00:24:53.550
It's going to
approach something.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.730
It's going to be dragged
toward something.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.950
It's going to be dragged toward
the voltage of that battery.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.536
We're hooking that battery up
to the inside of our neuron.

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:06.950
Does that makes sense?

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.060
OK, so that's what I'm
going to show you now.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.678
So if we have an
excitatory synapse--

00:25:11.678 --> 00:25:13.220
so what I'm going
to show you is what

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.680
happens when we activate
a glutamatergic excitatory

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.900
synapse on a cell.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.572
We're going to record
the voltage in the cell.

00:25:24.572 --> 00:25:26.280
And we're going to
activate that synapse.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.660
And what you see is
that this is what

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.060
you would see, for example,
for the muscle fiber.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.650
You activate the
synapse, and you see

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.090
that the voltage of the cell--

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.840
if the cell is hyperpolarized,
the voltage of the cell

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.580
goes up.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.170
If you hold the cell
at a higher voltage,

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.860
the voltage also goes up,
but a little bit less.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.050
If you hold the
cell at zero, you

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.550
can see you activate
that synapse,

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.550
but the cell is already at
the potential of the battery.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.540
And so there's no current
and no change in the voltage.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.458
If you hold the cell
at a positive voltage,

00:26:01.458 --> 00:26:03.250
and you activate the
synapse, again, you're

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.790
connecting the cell to a
battery that has 0 volts.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.250
And so the voltage goes down.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.350
So here's what I
want to convey here,

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.870
that when you activate a
synapse, it forces the cell,

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.440
forces the voltage in
the cell, to approach

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.370
the voltage of the reversal
potential of the synapse,

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.190
the voltage of that battery.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.900
Is that clear?

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.679
Yes.

00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:35.990
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.570
MICHALE FEE: It increases
the conductance.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.830
Current flows into this cell.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.460
And it flows into the
cell in a direction

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.610
so that the voltage of
approaches the equilibrium

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:47.830
potential.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:48.952
Yes.

00:26:48.952 --> 00:26:51.758
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:51.758 --> 00:26:52.800
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.258
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:54.258 --> 00:26:56.110
MICHALE FEE: Ah, yes, good.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.990
In fact, that's a
great way to phrase it,

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.790
because that kind
of experiment here

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.340
where we're measuring the
voltage inside the cell

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.740
is called current
clamp experiment.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.680
So there's voltage
clamp, where you

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:13.250
force the voltage to be
constant by varying the current.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.420
Here, we're holding the current
constant, clamping the current,

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.215
and measuring the voltage.

00:27:19.215 --> 00:27:23.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.900
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, let's
just go back to the setup

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.030
here, this experiment here.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.763
You don't you don't
set it up like this.

00:27:29.763 --> 00:27:31.930
You set it up like we had
on the first day of class,

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.260
where you just have a
current source connected here

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:41.620
and a volt meter attached
to this electrode.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.850
I didn't use that word.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.382
But that was the very
first experiment we did.

00:27:45.382 --> 00:27:47.710
I think on the
second day of class,

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:51.010
we had a cell with a
electrode to inject current,

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.450
electrode to measure voltage.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.010
That was a current
clamp experiment,

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:57.360
because we're holding the
current at some constant value.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.020
OK?

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.420
Here, we're holding the
voltage at some constant value

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.040
and measuring current.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:09.640
All right, so the
idea is really simple,

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.620
when you have a
synapse, the synapse

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.180
has a reversal potential.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.040
When you activate
the synapse, the cell

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.740
is dragged toward the
reversal potential.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.960
Here, the reversal
potential was zero.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.940
So when I activate the
synapse, the voltage

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.060
goes toward the
reversal potential.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:24.788
Notice-- yes.

00:28:24.788 --> 00:28:26.496
AUDIENCE: Oh, just a
very basic question.

00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:32.809
So is [INAUDIBLE] the top
half is like the synaptic face

00:28:32.809 --> 00:28:35.345
of the circuit and the
bottom half is like--

00:28:35.345 --> 00:28:37.720
MICHALE FEE: Are you talking
about like here versus here?

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.780
Yeah, so I've put that pink
box around the synapse.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.650
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.870
MICHALE FEE: That's
the circuit that

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.480
corresponds to having a
synapse attached to the cell.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:54.698
And this is the circuit that
we developed several weeks ago.

00:28:54.698 --> 00:28:55.240
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.120
But it's acting like
the presynaptic--

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.520
like a cell or--

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.590
MICHALE FEE: Oh, no,
the presynaptic cell

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.240
is not part of this picture.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:09.010
The presynaptic cell is kind of
like spritzing neurotransmitter

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:15.820
onto this thing, which
increases the conductance, which

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.590
is the same as reducing
the size of a resistor.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.490
Does that makes sense?

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.455
Yes.

00:29:23.455 --> 00:29:25.580
AUDIENCE: So is the reversal
potential always going

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.890
to be zero or like just like
in this specific example?

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:29.060
MICHALE FEE: Great question.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.210
So the reversal potential is
different for different kinds

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.500
of synapses.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.010
You can see that this
synapse, this kind of synapse

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.820
here, if I'm hyperpolarized, it
pushes the voltage of the cell

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.940
up.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.080
What kind of synapse
do you think that is?

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.410
An excitatory synapse.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.210
But notice something
really cool.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.160
An excitatory synapse
doesn't always

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.590
push the voltage of the cell up.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.330
If the cell is
sitting up here, it

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.330
can push the voltage
of the cell down.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.390
OK?

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.140
Yes.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.200
AUDIENCE: Why doesn't
it just stay up?

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.040
MICHALE FEE: Why?

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:03.550
Great.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.360
So great question.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.130
You can probably
answer that already.

00:30:10.585 --> 00:30:12.570
AUDIENCE: Well, it's some--

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:15.080
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:15.760
Yeah.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.420
I'm hearing a bunch
of good answers.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.590
So what happens is we're
stimulating the synapse here,

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.195
releases neurotransmitter.

00:30:23.195 --> 00:30:25.100
The conductance goes up.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.630
Current flows in,
depolarizes the cell,

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.990
neurotransmitter unbinds.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.280
Current stops.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.220
And this thing brings
the cell back down

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:39.030
to its starting point,
this other thing.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.210
Yeah, this thing is
kind of holding the cell

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.970
at some hyperpolarized
potential.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.230
AUDIENCE: So even though
they've lost a current.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.340
MICHALE FEE: The current is
turning on and then turning

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.620
off.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.660
Remember, the current--
here it is right here--

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.750
the current is turning on
as the conductance turns on.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.610
And then when the
conductance goes to zero,

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:00.073
the current goes to zero.

00:31:00.073 --> 00:31:03.860
AUDIENCE: Oh, I thought it
was a big current clamp.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.770
MICHALE FEE: No.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.170
The experiment we're doing
is injecting constant current

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.920
into the cell.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:16.260
And that's how we hold the cell
at these different sort of kind

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.250
of average voltages.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.370
OK, maybe I should say-- yes.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:31.940
AUDIENCE: So I just [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.500
MICHALE FEE: Makes it do this?

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.302
AUDIENCE: Well, I don't
understand how that changes.

00:31:36.302 --> 00:31:39.630
I just always want
positive ions to flow in.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:40.880
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.550
So positive ions
flowing into the cell

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.880
raise the voltage in this.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.205
AUDIENCE: But I don't
understand if the inside

00:31:51.205 --> 00:31:55.040
of cell is already positive,
why adding more positive--

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.060
MICHALE FEE: Oh.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.210
OK, great question.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.418
You're talking about up here.

00:31:58.418 --> 00:32:01.340
OK, so let me just back up and
explain one thing that maybe I

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.600
didn't explain very well.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.990
In this experiment,
we're injecting current

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.840
through our current
electrode to just hold

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.000
the cell at different voltages
while we stimulate the synapse.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.500
Does that makes sense?

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.090
Down here, let's say, we're
not injecting any current.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.840
And then we inject a
little bit of current

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.700
to kind of hold
the cell up here.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.700
And we activate the synapse
and measure changes from there.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.871
Does that make sense?

00:32:27.871 --> 00:32:29.835
AUDIENCE: So when
it's a current clamp,

00:32:29.835 --> 00:32:31.310
it just leaves the
input the same?

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.185
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

00:32:32.185 --> 00:32:33.980
You're just turning
a knob and saying

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.270
I'm going to put in 1 nanoamp.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.760
And that's just going to kind
of hold the cell up here.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.800
And then I activate
the synapse and ask

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.380
how does the voltage change.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.785
OK?

00:32:43.785 --> 00:32:44.285
Oh.

00:32:44.285 --> 00:32:45.767
AUDIENCE: That's
not my question.

00:32:45.767 --> 00:32:46.600
MICHALE FEE: I know.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.150
AUDIENCE: My question--

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.950
MICHALE FEE: But I
realized-- your question

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.270
is why does this go down?

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.645
AUDIENCE: Like I
thought that's--

00:32:51.645 --> 00:32:52.490
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.600
Exactly.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.290
Exactly.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:55.880
Isn't that cool?

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.210
Excitatory synapses are
not always inject-- so

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.290
what happens up here?

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.150
You're holding the cell up here.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.530
And now you activate
the synapse.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.730
And the voltage
actually goes down.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.570
And the answer is
that if you're holding

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.360
this cell up here positive,
more positive than here,

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.850
when you turn on
that conductance,

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.663
the current goes the other way.

00:33:16.663 --> 00:33:18.330
AUDIENCE: Passed the
reversal potential.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.260
MICHALE FEE: So you've passed
the reversal potential.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.310
You're holding the cell up here.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:27.930
And so [AUDIO OUT]
turn on the synapse,

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.300
the current flows
the other direction.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.830
You have a positive
current, which

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:36.110
is positive ions
flowing out, which

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:38.210
lowers the voltage of the cell.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:41.090
So the way to
think about this is

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:45.755
that when you have a synapse,
you turn the synapse on,

00:33:45.755 --> 00:33:48.140
it doesn't matter
where the voltage is,

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:52.300
it's always driving it toward
the reversal potential.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.570
And if you start above
the reversal potential,

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.180
the voltage will go down.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.230
If you start below the
reversal potential,

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.490
the voltage will go up.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.854
It's like not what you
learned in 901, right?

00:34:05.854 --> 00:34:06.830
AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:07.760
MICHALE FEE: This is--

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.920
yeah.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.100
But this is how it really works.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:12.600
OK?

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.250
Excitatory synapses,
the reason you

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:22.628
think of excitatory synapses as
always pushing the voltage up

00:34:22.628 --> 00:34:24.170
is because most of
the time, the cell

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.337
is sitting [AUDIO OUT] here.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.449
But this is going to become much
more important and obvious when

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.340
we're talking about
inhibitory synapses.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.290
So let's talk about
inhibitory segments.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.820
So here's a model with the
synaptic reversal at zero.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.670
All excitatory synapses have
their reversal potential

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.010
around zero.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:51.739
The neuromuscular junction,
the glutamatergic synapse,

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.110
they're all basically
non-specific

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:58.080
pores that have a reversal
potential of zero.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.160
Inhibitory synapses
are different.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.700
So excitatory-- the
reason we call it

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.390
an excitatory synapse is
because that reversal potential

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:12.720
is above the threshold
for the neuron to spike.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.090
And so when you
activate the synapse,

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.310
you're pushing the
voltage of the cell

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:21.970
always toward a voltage that's
above the spiking threshold.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.290
That's why it's called
an excitatory synapse.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.540
And those are called excitatory
postsynaptic potentials,

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.070
or EPSP.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.930
That little bump is an EPSP.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.200
All right, now, inhibitory
synapses look really different.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.120
And now the effect that I'm
talking about is important.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.550
With an inhibitory synapse,
the reversal potential

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.710
is around minus 75.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:53.600
Remember, most inhibitory
synapses are chloride channels.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.910
And chloride, do you
remember on the lecture

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:59.370
about the equilibrium
potentials?

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.730
The reversal potential
for chloride channels

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.890
is around minus 75.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:10.890
And that's why the synaptic
reversal potential is minus 75.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.100
And now, you can see that
if you hold the cell--

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.530
so here's where a
cell normally sits.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.230
You activate the synapse.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.580
The voltage goes down.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.080
All right.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.410
And why does it go down?

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.710
Because it's pulled
toward the equilibrium

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:31.630
potential for the chloride
channel, chloride ion.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.940
Now, notice that--

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.680
OK, so as the cell is
more and more depolarized,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.020
you can see that
it's more strongly

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.950
pulled toward [AUDIO OUT]
the voltage change is bigger.

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:46.900
If you hold the
cell at minus 75,

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:51.460
there's no voltage change
at all from activating

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.190
an inhibitory synapse.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:58.940
And if you hyperpolarize
the cell even more,

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.530
you can see that
when you activate

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.740
an inhibitory synapse
the voltage of the cell

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:07.170
actually goes up.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.660
So inhibitory
synapses don't always

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.160
make the potential
of the cell go down.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.300
In fact, sometimes they
can make this cell go up.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.630
In fact, what's really cool
is in juvenile animals,

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:21.030
the chloride reversal
potential, there's

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.900
more chloride inside of a cell
than there is in an adult.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.150
And so the reversal potential
of the chloride channels

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.220
is actually up here.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.160
And chloride inhibitory
synapses can actually

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.150
make neurons spike.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.065
You can see where
this thing sits.

00:37:38.065 --> 00:37:42.076
It just depends on the
concentration of chloride ions.

00:37:42.076 --> 00:37:45.020
Most of the time
inhibitory synapses

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.450
have a reversal potential
that's minus 75.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:51.200
And we call that inhibitory
because the reversal potential

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.170
of the synapse is less
than the spiking threshold.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:01.640
AUDIENCE: What [INAUDIBLE]
reversal potential?

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.000
MICHALE FEE: Just the--

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.010
OK, you know the answer
to that question.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:05.510
You tell me.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.425
So what are the two things--

00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:14.050
yeah, go ahead.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.390
AUDIENCE: The type of ion.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.140
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.580
The type of iron.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.420
And one more thing.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.110
There were two things we need
to have a battery in a neuron.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.430
What are they?

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.225
Anybody know?

00:38:29.225 --> 00:38:30.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.375
MICHALE FEE: And?

00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:35.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:40.920
MICHALE FEE: Ion
selective permeability.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.020
So the reversal
potential depends

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.950
on what ion that
channel is selective for

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.980
and the concentrations
of that ion

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.300
inside and outside the cell.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.810
So for an inhibitory
synapse, there are two types.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.170
There are chloride
reversal potentials,

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.210
the chloride channels that have
a reverse potential minus 75.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.740
And there are also
potassium channels

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.750
that serve an
inhibitory function that

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.280
can be activated by synapses.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.148
And they have a reversal
potential more like minus 80.

00:39:15.148 --> 00:39:20.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
develop [INAUDIBLE] it's

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.930
not chloride channel
is not changing.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.710
So what the ion channel--

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.128
MICHALE FEE: It's
the ion concen--

00:39:25.128 --> 00:39:26.170
AUDIENCE: Change so the--

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.396
MICHALE FEE: The concentration
that's different.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.890
OK?

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.780
Cool.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.550
You see this kind of
stuff all the time.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:41.100
Inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.260
are often upward going.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.760
Somebody will be super
impressed with you

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.820
if you look at a trace
like this and you say,

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.180
is that an EPSP or an IPSP?

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.420
Because you don't know
it just by looking at it.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.040
Most people would
assume it's an EPSP.

00:40:04.544 --> 00:40:05.470
Yeah.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:08.830
AUDIENCE: Was [INAUDIBLE]
to cause like a spike?

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.570
MICHALE FEE: Well,
so what do you think?

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.170
It's inhibitory if the
reversal potential [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.650
in the threshold.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:25.120
So no matter how strong
that inhibitory synapse is,

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.840
can it ever cause a spike
if the reversal potential

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.413
is less than the threshold?

00:40:33.362 --> 00:40:34.320
All right, let's go on.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.410
Any questions about this.

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:36.760
It's so fundamental.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.370
Yeah.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:45.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
potential [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.460
MICHALE FEE: So it's normally
around minus 60 minus

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.215
[AUDIO OUT] minus 75.

00:40:52.215 --> 00:40:52.715
OK?

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.810
OK, let's go on.

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:02.170
All right, let me just
talk a little bit more

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.760
about this conductance.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:09.700
So if you do a single
channel patch experiment,

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.110
you can take an electrode.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.260
Remember, I showed
you what it looks

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.780
like if you take an
electrode and you stick it

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.990
on a single sodium channel or
a single potassium channel.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.650
Well, you can do the same thing.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:27.190
You can stick it on a
neurotransmitter receptor.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:30.580
You can flow neurotransmitter
over the receptor.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.520
And what you see is that when
you put the neurotransmitter

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.970
on, just like sodium
and potassium channels,

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:46.740
it flickers between an open
state and a closed state.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.080
So it has two states--

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.420
open state and closed state.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:54.320
You can do the same
kind of modeling of it

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.880
as where the kinetic rate
equation with two states.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.607
You can write down
the probability

00:42:00.607 --> 00:42:02.690
that the channel is in the
open and closed states.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.700
That's going to be
a function of what?

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.790
Like neurotransmitter
concentration and time, right?

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.580
And you can write down the
total synaptic conductance

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:18.020
as the conductance of a
single open neurotransmitter

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.810
receptor times the number
of neurotransmitter

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:24.230
receptors times the probability
that any of them is open,

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:27.781
any one of them is open.

00:42:27.781 --> 00:42:30.420
And so now, let's think
about this probability

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:34.630
as a function of time.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.970
So we can model the
neurotransmitter receptors

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.920
and write down the
probability that it's open.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.000
The probability that's closed,
then has to be 1 minus p.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.210
Alpha and beta are
rate constants.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:52.230
1 over time, they have
units of 1 over time.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:54.890
And what controls the rate
at which the channels open?

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:58.290
Good.

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:00.480
So alpha will depend
on the concentration

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.470
of neurotransmitter.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:05.310
That controls the rate at
which closed channels open.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:10.050
And how about open to closed?

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:13.020
It's not the concentration
of the neurotransmitter.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.942
It'll be something else.

00:43:14.942 --> 00:43:16.295
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:16.295 --> 00:43:17.170
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:19.630
So there will be
basically some rate

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.600
constant for a
neurotransmitter unwinding.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.743
OK?

00:43:23.743 --> 00:43:24.910
All right, so let's do that.

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:26.540
So here's that model.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.730
This is a simplified version
of the Magleby-Stevens model.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:31.880
And it looks like this.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:35.040
There's a close
and an open state.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:40.690
The open state corresponds to
the closed neurotransmitter

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:44.140
receptor R binding to
a neurotransmitter,

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.460
an unbound
neurotransmitter molecule,

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.030
forming a complex,
bound receptor complex.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:51.850
There's usually another step--

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.670
the way this is usually modeled
in the Magleby-Stevens model

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.280
is that the bound
receptor complex is closed

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.523
and then it opens in
another transition.

00:43:59.523 --> 00:44:01.940
But we're just going to keep
it simple and do it this way.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.230
So we have a closed state
unbound neurotransmitter

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:09.040
receptor binds to an unbound
neurotransmitter's receptor

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:12.670
molecule and forms our
bound receptor complex

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:14.050
that is then open.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.550
So that's P. And
that's 1 minus P.

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.650
And we can just write down
the rate equation just

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.410
the same way that we
did for analyze the time

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:26.070
dependence of the sodium channel
or the potassium channel.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.420
Isn't that amazing?

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.520
All that stuff we learned
for Hodgkin-Huxley,

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:34.635
just you can use all
the same machinery here.

00:44:34.635 --> 00:44:36.960
OK?

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.790
OK, so that's a simple model.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:43.460
And you can take a
simplification of it.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.190
We're going to assume that
the binding is very fast,

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.980
that the alpha is very fast.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.150
So that when you put a pulse of
neurotransmitter concentration

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:56.313
onto the synapse, the
probability of being open,

00:44:56.313 --> 00:44:58.230
we're going to assume
that this is super fast.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.610
So that the rate at which
you go from unbound to bound

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.620
is very high.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.590
And now, the
neurotransmitter goes away.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:10.650
And you can see zero
concentration here.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.650
Let's say you bind, the
probability of being open

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.580
gets big.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.980
And then the
neurotransmitter goes away.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.630
You can see that
this first term goes

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.020
to 0, because the
neurotransmitter

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.150
concentration is zero.

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:28.990
You can see that dP/dt
is just minus beta P.

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.910
And that's just an
exponential decay.

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:35.320
So the model is bind
neurotransmitter

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.350
opens the
neurotransmitter receptor.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:39.680
Neurotransmitter goes away.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.460
And then there's an
exponential decay probability

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.860
that you're in the open state.

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:44.360
Yes.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.018
AUDIENCE: So like
in a real synapse,

00:45:46.018 --> 00:45:48.258
the neurotransmitter
wouldn't like go away, right?

00:45:48.258 --> 00:45:49.300
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.100
Oh, yeah, the
neurotransmitter goes away.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.440
I forgot to say that.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.220
It's a super important point.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.850
There's one more step
that I forgot to include.

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:00.040
Habib is nodding at me
like, yeah you forgot that.

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.410
What happens is the
neurotransmitter

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.540
goes into the cleft.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:12.450
And it gets taken up
by neurotransmitter--

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:13.830
what they called again, Habib?

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:14.690
AUDIENCE: Reuptake.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:15.607
MICHALE FEE: Reuptake.

00:46:15.607 --> 00:46:17.820
Thank you.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:22.870
That neurotransmitter
gets bound by receptors

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:25.960
on glia and the
presynaptic terminal

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:30.960
and gets pumped out
of the synaptic cleft.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.460
So that's what makes this go
away, in addition to diffusion.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:36.130
OK.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:39.214
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
like the time dependence

00:46:39.214 --> 00:46:40.520
of the concentration--

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.870
MICHALE FEE: So this is--

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:42.980
in the full model you do.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.480
And, in fact, what
this really looks

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.290
like is this kind of turns on
more slowly and then goes away

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:49.580
with an exponential.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.150
But I'm just kind of walking you
through this super simplified

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.230
model.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:57.455
That's my mental model
for how synapse works.

00:46:57.455 --> 00:46:57.955
OK?

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:02.370
People who actually
work on synapses

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.040
would probably laugh
at me, but that's

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.800
kind of how I think of it.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.909
OK?

00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:09.409
Lena.

00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:10.951
AUDIENCE: Is that
N the binding site?

00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:13.875
MICHALE FEE: Oh, yeah, the
N, the N is really cool.

00:47:13.875 --> 00:47:15.000
What do you think it means?

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.370
AUDIENCE: Binding sites?

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:18.760
MICHALE FEE: Yes, it's the
number of binding sites.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:24.290
So you can see that if
the receptor requires

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:30.440
two neurotransmitter molecules
to bind before it opens, then

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.220
you have a
concentration squared.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.310
And that has really important
consequences on the way

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.400
it works, because
what it does is

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.500
it makes the receptor
very sensitive

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:47.340
to high concentrations
of neurotransmitter.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.900
So they don't respond
to the little leakage

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.290
of some residual
neurotransmitter left around

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:57.980
that the reuptake systems
haven't dealt with yet.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.530
But when a vessel
releases, then you

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:04.260
have a neurotransmitter at
a very high concentration.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.490
And this thing makes it
only sensitive to the peak

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:10.506
of the neurotransmitter
concentration.

00:48:10.506 --> 00:48:11.200
OK.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:11.791
Yes.

00:48:11.791 --> 00:48:15.639
AUDIENCE: With the
probably [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:15.639 --> 00:48:20.880
number of [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.630
MICHALE FEE: Here.

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:24.670
In this phase,
does this N matter?

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:25.730
Is that your question?

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:26.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:27.988
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, well,
so you know the answer

00:48:27.988 --> 00:48:28.970
to that question.

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:33.730
Here, you're asking if
here this N matters?

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.406
What's that concentration here?

00:48:36.406 --> 00:48:37.340
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's 0.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.005
MICHALE FEE: So
what's 0 to the N?

00:48:40.005 --> 00:48:41.805
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:41.805 --> 00:48:42.430
MICHALE FEE: 0.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.300
OK, next, so we just
did all of that.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.600
I better speed up.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.140
Let's talk about convolution.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.610
So this is what happens
when a single action

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:01.450
potential comes down the axon.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:04.520
The presynaptic terminal
releases neurotransmitter.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:10.970
Boom, you get a pulse of
probability of the receptor

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:12.680
being open.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.000
That, you recall, is
just proportional--

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.950
yikes, where'd it go.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:27.540
That probability is you just
multiply it by some constants

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:28.890
to get the conductance.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:38.282
So that is what the
conductance looks like.

00:49:38.282 --> 00:49:40.060
OK?

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:45.180
All right, now, so
there's our input spike.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:47.700
Our input neuron, our
presynaptic neuron

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.960
generates a spike.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.450
And that produces
a response, which

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:55.470
is a conductance that
looks like a pulse

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.850
and an exponential decay.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:59.660
OK?

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.140
Now, what do you
think would happen

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.510
if [AUDIO OUT] a bunch
of spikes like this?

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.470
Good.

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:10.700
Just does it each time.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:11.200
OK?

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.450
And we're ignoring fancy effects
like paired pulse depression

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:18.770
or facilitation or
things like that.

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:19.540
OK?

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.090
There are all kinds
of interesting things

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:25.150
that synapses can do
where there's one pulse

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:27.070
and then there's some
residual calcium left

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:28.390
in the presynaptic terminal.

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:30.550
And that makes the
next pulse produce

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:31.900
an even bigger response.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:36.310
Or sometimes one pulse will
use up all the vesicles

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:36.963
that are bound.

00:50:36.963 --> 00:50:38.380
And so the next
pulse will come in

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.797
and there won't
be enough vesicles

00:50:39.797 --> 00:50:41.110
and this will be smaller.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:43.960
We're just going to ignore
all of those complications

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.480
right now.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.240
And we're just going
to think about how

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.530
to model a postsynaptic response
given a presynaptic input.

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:54.750
And we're going to use
what's called a linear model.

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.180
We're going to use convolution.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:01.410
And we're going to call this
single event right here,

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:04.110
we're going to call that
the impulse response.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.480
The input is an impulse.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.270
And the response is
the impulse response.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:15.400
And this is also
called a linear kernel.

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:22.000
The response to
multiple inputs can

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.430
be modeled as a convolution.

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:25.690
It looks a little messy.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:30.340
But I'm going to explain how to
just visualize it very simply.

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.690
All right?

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.670
So here's how you
think about it.

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:39.340
Notice that the
response of the system

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.970
is just this
operation where we're

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:46.150
multiplying the kernel
times the stimulus

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.430
and integrating over time.

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:51.150
OK?

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:52.890
So what we're going to do is--

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:56.120
the way to think about this
is to take the kernel K,

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.876
flip it [AUDIO OUT]
wards and plot it there.

00:51:59.876 --> 00:52:02.191
OK?

00:52:02.191 --> 00:52:04.830
Now notice that
what this thing does

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:09.870
is it says I'm
going to integrate

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.780
the product of the
kernel and the stimulus--

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.740
notice I'm integrating over tau.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.390
But this [AUDIO OUT] tau
and that has a minus tau.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:24.360
So what I'm doing is I'm
multiplying at a particular--

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.490
and notice that it's
shifted by time t.

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:28.020
OK?

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.520
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.980
to put the kernel at time t.

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.380
And I'm going to
integrate the product

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.860
of the kernel and the stimulus.

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:39.863
So what do I get if I
multiply this times this?

00:52:39.863 --> 00:52:40.750
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:41.610
MICHALE FEE: 0.

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:45.700
And so at that time,
I write down a zero.

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:46.280
OK?

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.750
Now, I'm going to change t.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:53.030
And I'm going to shift this
over and multiply them together.

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.910
What do I get?

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:56.660
Good.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.740
Another 0.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.910
Now let's shift it again.

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:00.470
I'm just increasing t here.

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:01.655
I'm not integrating over t.

00:53:01.655 --> 00:53:03.440
I'm integrating over tau.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.580
So I just shift
this a little bit.

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:06.080
Good.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.420
And now when I multiply them
together, what do I get?

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:14.180
MICHALE FEE: Like
that [AUDIO OUT] good.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:20.920
I just get the area under
that curve, and integrate.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.450
And I get a point here.

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:27.670
Now, let's shift it again.

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:28.170
Good.

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:29.690
Now, multiply them together.

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:32.030
What do I get?

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:35.880
Slightly smaller integral.

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.774
And I plot that there.

00:53:38.774 --> 00:53:39.740
OK?

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.150
Shift it again.

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:42.260
Integrate.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:43.410
Plot another point.

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:44.360
Shift it again.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.350
Integrate.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:51.020
And if I keep shifting,
the product is 0

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.090
and the integral is 0.

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:56.980
OK, so you can see that
I can take this kernel,

00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:00.440
convolve it with a
stimulus that's an impulse.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.720
And I get the kernel.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.282
I get the impulse response.

00:54:05.282 --> 00:54:07.220
Does that makes sense?

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:14.040
So you can see what I'm
doing here is from time I'm

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:18.900
taking the stimulus at time t.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:24.350
And as I integrate over tau,
I'm going backwards here,

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:25.720
and I'm going forwards here.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.855
So starting from here,
I'm integrating like this.

00:54:27.855 --> 00:54:31.910
I'm multiplying these like this.

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:33.120
And then integrating.

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:33.620
OK?

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:38.098
And that's why you flip it over.

00:54:38.098 --> 00:54:39.970
OK?

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:43.420
So it's very easy to
picture what it does.

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:46.580
So when somebody shows
you a linear kernel

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.510
and asks you to convolve
it with a stimulus,

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.530
the first thing you do is you
just mentally flip it backwards

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:53.210
and slide it over
this [AUDIO OUT]

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:57.818
and integrate the product
at each different position.

00:54:57.818 --> 00:55:00.800
OK?

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.710
Now, you can see that when
you do that, when you convolve

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:05.870
that kernel with
a pulse, you just

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:09.060
recover the impulse response.

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:09.560
OK?

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:14.570
So now, let's convolve linear
[AUDIO OUT] I'm plotting it

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:15.920
flipped backwards now--

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.890
with a single pulse.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:21.260
So Daniel made these
little demos for us.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:29.020
And the resulting
conductance is here.

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.460
OK?

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:34.150
Now, that was really
obvious and easy, right?

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:38.560
We didn't need to have a Matlab
program simulate that for us,

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.830
right?

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.420
But what about this?

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.800
Here, we have a spike train.

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:49.430
There's the postsynaptic
response from one spike.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:51.490
Now, to get the
postsynaptic response

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:54.310
from a bunch of spikes, we
can just convolve the kernel

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:55.285
with this spike train.

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:56.410
And let's see what happens.

00:56:00.282 --> 00:56:01.250
Boom.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:04.070
Response from the first spike.

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:04.820
Boom.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.320
Boom.

00:56:08.188 --> 00:56:11.512
Boom, boom, boom.

00:56:11.512 --> 00:56:12.012
OK?

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:18.400
And that is actually
really, really close to

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:23.270
what it looks like when a train
of pulses comes into a neuron.

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:24.280
OK?

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.270
What happens is the
first spike produces

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:30.560
a conductance response.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.950
When you have two
spikes close together,

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:35.780
the conductance
from the first spike

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:39.770
has not decayed yet when
the second spike hits.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:42.320
And so that comes
in and adds to it.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.610
And it adds linearly.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:50.530
So if this is halfway down,
you add a full impulse response

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:51.380
on top of it.

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.320
And now the previous
one and the current one

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.610
are decaying back to zero.

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:57.010
And you can add as many of
those on top of each other

00:56:57.010 --> 00:56:57.510
as you want.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:10.360
And it turns out this is
super easy to do in Matlab.

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.500
You're going to
learn how to do this.

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.998
This idea is so fundamental.

00:57:15.998 --> 00:57:17.540
This idea of
convolution, we're going

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.310
to use to describe
receptive fields.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:20.840
We're going to
use it to describe

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.780
filtering when we start
getting to processing data.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.792
It's incredibly useful
and very powerful.

00:57:26.792 --> 00:57:28.070
OK?

00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:28.940
Yes.

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:35.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:37.870
MICHALE FEE: This
linear kernel reflects

00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:41.230
that response, the
conductance response,

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:47.100
of the postsynaptic
neuron to a single spike,

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:49.502
single presynaptic spike.

00:57:49.502 --> 00:57:53.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:54.930
MICHALE FEE: Because
if you have a bunch

00:57:54.930 --> 00:58:00.780
of single spikes
like this, the answer

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:03.580
is really obvious, right?

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:07.000
It's just one of those, one
of those little exponentials

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.640
for every spike that comes in.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:16.880
But it's less obvious when
you have a complex spike

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.730
train like this.

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:22.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
on top of that.

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:28.922
So it's just [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:28.922 --> 00:58:30.630
MICHALE FEE: Yeah,
the linear convolution

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:32.490
tells you how the
postsynaptic neuron

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:36.180
is going to respond to a
train of action potentials

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:41.340
that are overlapped, where
the response has not gone away

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.242
to the first spike by the
time the second spike arrives.

00:58:44.242 --> 00:58:49.440
AUDIENCE: So because the kernel
can have like different shapes.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.990
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, the kernel
can have different shapes.

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:54.990
I've just chosen a
particularly simple one,

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:58.470
because actually an
exponentially decaying kernel

00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:01.920
turns out to be
really important.

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.806
It's actually a low pass filter.

00:59:04.806 --> 00:59:11.202
AUDIENCE: So be it's
a linear [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:11.202 --> 00:59:13.670
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:18.000
The convolution, if you use the
convolution, the thing you're

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.120
using as the kernel is
always a linear kernel,

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.910
because the convolution
is a linear function,

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:30.180
you call the thing that you
convolving a linear kernel.

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.628
It's just terminology.

00:59:32.628 --> 00:59:34.200
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.870
MICHALE FEE: Just focus on
what it does and how it works,

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:38.790
rather than the names.

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:41.950
Just call it impulse
response if that's easier.

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:44.190
OK?

00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:46.755
All right, let's push on.

00:59:46.755 --> 00:59:48.880
I want to introduce an idea
of synaptic saturation.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.780
And I'm getting really
worried about the crayfish.

00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:00.490
OK, synaptic saturation.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.660
OK, so remember, we
introduced the idea

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.020
of a two-compartment model.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:08.110
So last time we talked
about a model in which

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:11.155
you have a soma and a dendrite.

01:00:11.155 --> 01:00:14.290
And you simplify the dendrites
just by writing it down

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:17.600
as another little
piece of membrane

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.620
or another little cellular
compartment that's connected

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.330
to the soma through a resistor.

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:26.290
And now, you can write a model
for the dendritic compartment

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.660
that looks just like a
capacitor and a conductance

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.510
with a reversal potential.

01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:35.940
And you have the
same kind of model--

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:40.560
capacitor, conductance,
reversal potential, battery--

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.347
for the soma.

01:00:41.347 --> 01:00:42.930
And, of course, those
two compartments

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:45.180
are connected to each
[AUDIO OUT] resistor that

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:49.860
represents the axial resistance
of the piece of dendrite

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.330
that's really connecting.

01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:52.130
OK?

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:55.215
So that's called a
two-compartment model.

01:00:55.215 --> 01:00:56.820
And what we're
going to do is just

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:01.020
think briefly about
how to think about what

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:06.250
this looks like when you add
a synapse to the dendrite.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:06.890
OK?

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:09.200
And what we're going
to study is how

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.910
the voltage in the
dendrite changes

01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:13.130
as a function of the
amount of excitatory

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:14.240
conductance that you add.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:23.620
So we're going to start by--

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.973
we're doing steady state.

01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:27.890
So we don't need to worry
about our capacitor.

01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:32.330
So we can actually just
unsolder them and take them out

01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:33.710
of our circuit.

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:36.200
And we're going to study
the voltage response

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.430
in the dendrite.

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.540
So we're going to also
throw away our soma

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.510
and just ask, how does
the dendrite respond

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:49.400
to this synaptic input as
a function of the amount

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.260
of excitatory conductance?

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.250
And what I'm going to show you
is just that the voltage change

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:58.750
in the dendrite with zero
inductance, of course,

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:02.560
it's sitting there at the
potassium reversal potential,

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.930
or e leak.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:07.780
And as you add
conductance, it corresponds

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:10.780
to making that
conductance, bigger

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.790
making that resistor smaller.

01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:17.470
You're basically
attaching the battery

01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:18.940
to the inside of the cell.

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.530
And you can see
that what happens

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:23.200
is as you add more
and more conductance,

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.020
as you put more and
more neurotransmitter

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:30.220
onto that receptor, or have
more and more neurotransmitter

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:36.460
receptors, the voltage response
goes up and then saturates.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:39.550
And it's really obvious
why that happens, right?

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:41.800
Once this resistor
gets small enough,

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.210
meaning you've added
enough conductance,

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:50.210
the inside of the cell is
connected to the battery.

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:55.085
And the voltage inside the
cell just can't go any higher.

01:02:55.085 --> 01:02:58.580
It is forced to E
synaptics, the reversal

01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.630
potential of the synapse.

01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:00.810
And it can't go any higher.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:04.370
And that's why no matter how
much excitatory conductance you

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:08.920
add, the voltage inside the
dendrite cannot go above E

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.045
synapse.

01:03:10.045 --> 01:03:12.950
And that's called
synaptic saturation.

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:16.220
And I was going to show
you the derivation of this.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.450
It's just very simple.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:20.390
You just write down
Kirchhoff's current law,

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:25.550
substitute the equation for
synaptic current, leak current,

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:30.770
solve for voltage as a
function of G synapse.

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:35.030
And you can write down an
approximation for the case of G

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:37.460
synapse much
smaller than G leak.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.900
And what you find
is it's linear.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.230
And so there's a
linear part [AUDIO OUT]

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:44.840
voltage change at
small conductances.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.720
And you can write
down an approximation

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.200
at high synaptic conductance.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.060
And you show that
it approaches--

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.090
the voltage
approaches E synapse.

01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:54.055
OK, so I'm not going
to go through the math.

01:03:54.055 --> 01:03:54.680
But it's there.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.540
You don't have to be able
to derive it yourself.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.920
But what I want
you to understand

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.300
is that for small
synaptic conductance,

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.390
the voltage responds linearly.

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:08.900
But for high synaptic
conductance, it saturates.

01:04:11.684 --> 01:04:13.540
OK?

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:16.390
All right, and now,
I want to tell you

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:20.490
a story about inhibition.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:26.900
And the basic story is that
we can add inhibition to--

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.190
so in real neurons in the
brain, inhibition sometimes

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:32.840
connects to dendrites.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:37.180
And sometimes inhibitory
synapses connect to somata.

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:39.740
And they're actually different
kinds of inhibitory neurons

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:43.730
that preferentially connect
onto dendrites and others that

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:46.440
preferentially connect
onto the somata.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.070
And it turns out there's
a really interesting story

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:54.380
about how that inhibition has
a different effect whether it's

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:58.438
connected to the dendrite or
connected to the soma, right?

01:04:58.438 --> 01:04:59.730
So you see what I've done here.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:03.650
I've got a dendrite that
has an excitatory synapse.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.090
That's here.

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:09.090
And it has an
inhibitory synapse.

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:11.160
Or-- so we can
analyze this case--

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.220
or we consider the case where
the excitatory synapse is still

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.370
on the dendrite, but
the inhibitory synapse

01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:19.710
comes onto the soma.

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:21.530
And it turns out
those two things

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:24.500
do something very interesting.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:29.950
And this was first
shown in the crayfish.

01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:32.030
The crayfish is a really
cool model system,

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:36.530
because it has very
stereotyped behaviors.

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.200
And one of its interesting
stereotyped behaviors

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.100
is its escape reflexes.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.920
It has three different
kinds of escape reflexes

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.920
that involve different what
are called command neurons that

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.650
get sensory input and
drive motor output.

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:56.260
And one of these
particular neurons

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.440
is where this effect about
inhibition was first shown.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.460
It's called the LG.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.840
LG neurons, MG neurons that
drive two different kinds

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.960
of escape reflexes.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:12.820
So here are the two different
kinds of escape reflexes.

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:18.190
The medial giant neuron
drives the MG escape,

01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:21.850
which is if you touch
the crayfish on its nose,

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.370
it flicks its tail
and goes backwards.

01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:30.250
The LG escape is when you
touch the crayfish on its tail,

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:33.750
and it flicks its tail in a
way that makes it go forward.

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:34.350
OK?

01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:40.510
So let's look at what
those behaviors look like.

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:43.360
We're going to post this video.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.940
This is from a Journal
of Visual Experiments.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:54.930
And there's a nice-- it's
actually really nice--

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:57.330
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:00.730
- The recordings of neural
and muscular field potentials,

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:03.150
electronic recordings from
a pair of bath electrodes

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:06.135
are synchronized with high speed
video recordings and display--

01:07:06.135 --> 01:07:08.010
MICHALE FEE: So this
video shows you actually

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:10.200
how to set up a
tank with electrodes

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.040
so you can record the
signals from these neurons

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.050
in a crayfish while
it's behaving.

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:17.400
So you should watch the video.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:17.983

01:07:17.983 --> 01:07:20.130
MICHALE FEE: But I'm
going to show you--

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:23.910
I'm going to show you what--

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:25.830
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:28.360
- Here is a look at a series
of single, high speed video

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.370
frames and corresponding
electric field

01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:32.495
recordings for an escape
tail flip in response to--

01:07:32.495 --> 01:07:33.787
MICHALE FEE: Can you hear that?

01:07:33.787 --> 01:07:35.980
- A stimulus delivered
to the head or tail

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.940
of a juvenile crayfish.

01:07:43.234 --> 01:07:44.230
[END PLAYBACK]

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:46.840
MICHALE FEE: So that
was the MG response.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.360
And he puts two
electrodes into the tank.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.460
And you can actually
measure signals

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.748
in the tank from
that neuron firing.

01:07:53.748 --> 01:07:54.415
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:07:54.415 --> 01:07:57.850
- The giant neuron and the
phasic deflection that follows

01:07:57.850 --> 01:08:01.000
enables non-ambiguous
identification of the tail flip

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.250
as mediated by giant
neuron activity.

01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:11.070
The backward movement
shown in the video traces

01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:15.400
determines the identity of
the activated neural circuit.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.420
Here is a tail flip
mediated by the--

01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.500
MICHALE FEE: So here, you
touch him on the tail--

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.710
- Tactile stimulus was
applied to the tail.

01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:23.890
Upward and forward motion--

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:25.260
MICHALE FEE: You can see it
a different movement that

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.130
makes him--

- Synchronized electronic trace,
displaying the giant spike

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:31.770
and the large phasic
initial deflection

01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:34.335
determines the identity of
the activated neural circuit.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.140
This video demonstrates the--

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:48.580
MICHALE FEE: Here's a
different escape reflex

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:53.165
that doesn't involve either
of those two neurons.

01:08:53.165 --> 01:08:54.540
Here he spends a
little more time

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:57.370
thinking before he
figures out what to do.

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:04.617
- A giant spike and
consists of much--

01:09:04.617 --> 01:09:05.870
[END PLAYBACK]

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:06.660
MICHALE FEE: OK.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.890
All right, so let me just--

01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:11.760
I probably won't get very far in
explaining the inhibition part,

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.040
but you can at least
understand a little bit more

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.430
about this behavior.

01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:20.460
So what's really cool
is that inhibition

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:24.149
is used to regulate
these two behaviors.

01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:25.950
So the idea is that--

01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:27.930
so first let me just
say that kind of that

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:33.120
LG neuron, that
lateral giant neuron,

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.010
is known as a command neuron.

01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:37.979
And that is because if you
activate that neuron, if you

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:41.815
just depolarize that one neuron,
it activates that entire escape

01:09:41.815 --> 01:09:42.315
reflex.

01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:48.859
And if you hyperpolarize
that neuron,

01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:50.870
inhibit that neuron,
you completely

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:54.800
suppress the escape reflex.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.660
And now, what's
really interesting

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.900
is that that neuron has
inhibitory inputs that

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:04.430
control the probability that the
animal will elicit this escape

01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:06.470
reflex.

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:10.143
And that kind of
modulation of that behavior

01:10:10.143 --> 01:10:11.060
is really interesting.

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.860
And it has some interesting
subtleties to it.

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.400
So first of all, if
the animal is touched

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.560
on the nose and elicits--

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.130
touched on the nose and elicits
an MG response, the tail flips

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:27.680
and the animal goes
backwards, right?

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.890
But now, if it goes backwards
and it bumps into something

01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:33.440
on his backside, when
it's going backwards,

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.110
you don't want to
have that immediately

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:39.130
trigger an LG escape, and
he bumps into something.

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:40.970
He's like boom,
boom, boom, right?

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.270
That would be terrible.

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:50.000
So what happens is that when the
MG neuron fires and initiates

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.110
that backwards movement,
it sends a signal that

01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:57.610
inhibits the LG response.

01:10:57.610 --> 01:11:00.370
OK?

01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:03.650
OK, other cool things, when
the animal is restrained,

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:06.230
when you pick the animal
up, if he doesn't get away

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:11.360
from you with his first escape
attempt and you hold him,

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.860
you can touch him
on the nose and it

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.140
won't elicit an escape reflex.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:18.590
So when the animal is held,
the response probability

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:19.460
goes way down.

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:22.370
Maybe he's like
holding off until he

01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:25.940
feels like your grip loosen a
little bit and then he'll try.

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:26.450
OK?

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:29.090
So there's no point in
wasting escape attempts.

01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:31.340
They're very
energetically expensive,

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:36.470
wasting escape attempts when
you're being restrained.

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:38.090
Another interesting
modulation is

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:41.105
that the LG escape
response is suppressed

01:11:41.105 --> 01:11:42.230
while the animal is eating.

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:43.590
This is threshold.

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:46.280
This is how much you
have to poke in the nose

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.220
or in the tail for
him to escape when

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.380
he's just wandering around.

01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:54.450
But then while he's
eating, he's getting food.

01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:57.530
And so the threshold for
eliciting that escape reflex

01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:58.380
goes up.

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.730
He's like, sorry, I'm eating.

01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:03.230
Leave me alone.

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:05.450
OK?

01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:08.000
It's not just being
hungry, right?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.060
Because if he's hungry
and searching for food,

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:15.020
there's no increased threshold.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.820
So it's really
because he's eating.

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:18.200
He's found a food source.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.550
He doesn't want to leave it.

01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:21.140
So there's a higher--

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.120
he won't leave until
there's like more danger.

01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:31.070
So all this different kinds
of modulation and inhibition

01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:34.280
of the behavior is controlled
by inhibitory [AUDIO OUT]

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.760
projecting onto this LG neuron.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.970
So there are two kinds
of escape modulation.

01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:43.750
One is absolute.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:47.440
When the animal is engaged
in an escape reflex,

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.710
it is impossible to activate--
when the animal is engaged

01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:54.520
in an MG escape, it's impossible
to activate the LG escape.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.610
No matter how much he
gets poked in the tail,

01:12:57.610 --> 01:13:00.160
he will not initiate an LG.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.250
So this kind of
modulation is absolute.

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:07.330
There's this other
kind of modulation,

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:10.390
where the likelihood of
escape is just reduced,

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:13.360
but the animal is still
able to initiate escape

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.440
if the danger is high enough,
if the stimulus is high enough.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.345
And that's really the
crux of the difference

01:13:19.345 --> 01:13:23.620
is that some kinds of
suppression of a behavior

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.370
are absolute.

01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.080
No matter how strong
the stimulus is,

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.670
you don't want to allow
that neuron to spike.

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.610
In the other case
is I'm just going

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:33.760
to turn down the
probability that I generate

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.750
[AUDIO OUT] because I'm eating.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:38.860
But if it's looks dangerous
enough I'm still going to go.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:42.970
But I'm just going to modulate,
gently, the probability.

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:46.390
And it turns out that's
the crux of the difference.

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:49.140
So it turns out the LG neuron
has two sites on it where

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.450
you get sources of inhibition.

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:53.820
There are a bunch
of inhibitory inputs

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:57.750
on the proximal dendrite
near the spike initiation

01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:59.550
zone, which is right here.

01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:01.920
And that's recurrent
inhibition, because it's coming

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.920
from the other escape neuron.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.280
So it's recurrent
within the motor system.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.100
And the other inhibitory
synapses come out here

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.400
on the dendrite.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.760
And they're [AUDIO OUT]
higher brain areas.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:21.960
And it's called tonic inhibition
for historical reasons.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.870
Now, previous hypothesis
was that those inputs here

01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:27.420
allowed inhibition to
control different branches

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.050
of the input.

01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:30.590
But it turns out the
answer is very simple.

01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:32.580
So let me just summarize this.

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:35.700
So you have one [AUDIO OUT]
input, inhibitory input,

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:39.090
that's coming from the
other escape neuron

01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:41.820
that lands right there on
the part of this neuron

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.790
the initiates spikes.

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:50.250
The other input that suppresses
the response during feeding

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:55.320
is coming far out on the
dendrite at the same location

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.110
where those excitatory
inputs, the sensory inputs,

01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:01.080
are coming in.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.800
So that's what the
circuit looks like.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.390
So the input that
absolutely suppresses

01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:10.510
the response of this neuron
is coming right on the soma,

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:12.400
right where the
spike is generated.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.320
And the ones that
tonic [AUDIO OUT]

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.800
sort of adjust the
probability of spiking

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:21.610
are coming out here where
the excitatory inputs are.

01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:25.570
And so they developed the
simple equivalent circuit model

01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:27.880
where they have a
dendrite out here.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.480
Out here on the dendrite,
you have an excitatory input.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.920
And you can have recurrent
input on the soma.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.500
And there's another model.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.170
So in one of these
models, they're

01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:41.210
modeling the
proximal inhibition.

01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:45.020
In the other model, they put
the inhibitory synapse out here

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.880
on the dendrite.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.280
And they ask, how are those two
different sources of inhibition

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:50.780
different?

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.060
What do they do
differently to the neuron?

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:55.010
And they just did this model.

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:57.048
They analyzed it
mathematically, exactly

01:15:57.048 --> 01:15:58.340
like the way I just showed you.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.930
That very simple
calculation works.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.820
You just use
Kirchhoff's current law.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.950
And you write down
the voltage response

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.530
to the excitatory
synapse as a function

01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:09.800
of the strength of these two
different kinds of inhibition.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.360
And here's what you find.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.960
The proximal inhibition
suppresses the response

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.500
to the excitatory input
by the same fraction

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.800
no matter how strong
the excitation is.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.930
So if you put in
strong inhibition,

01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:30.670
you can always cause
that excitatory input

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.460
to be suppressed to zero.

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:38.500
So inhibitory input
approximately at the soma

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:42.220
can suppress the response of a
neuron to an excitatory input,

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.730
no matter how strong
the excitatory input is.

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:49.720
On the other hand,
inhibition out

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.900
on the dendrite for any
given amount of inhibition,

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.470
there's always an
excitation that's

01:16:56.470 --> 01:17:01.360
strong enough to allow the
response to get through.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.550
So this shows the
amount of suppression

01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:05.630
as a function of
excitatory input.

01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:09.670
And you can see that no matter
how strong the inhibition,

01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:12.130
there's always an amount
of excitation that

01:17:12.130 --> 01:17:14.720
will overcome the inhibition.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.480
And you can also
do that analysis

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.940
in a much more
complicated model.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.980
And you get exactly
the same results.

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:22.900
But what's really
cool is that you

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.150
can understand this
just from this very

01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:29.300
simple two-compartment model.

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.600
And I wish I had a
little bit more time

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.360
to go through those models
and explain why that works.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.350
But basically, proximal
inhibition is absolute.

01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:40.600
You can always make
the inhibition win.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.700
Distal inhibition kind of
gently varies the effect

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.280
of the excitatory input.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:52.540
All right, so that's what we
covered-- synapses, a model,

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.940
convolution,
synaptic saturation,

01:17:54.940 --> 01:18:00.330
and the different functions of
distal and proximal inhibition.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.590
PROFESSOR: So, good afternoon.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.500
Today we want to wrap
up our discussion

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.400
on two-photon processes.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.400
And just to repeat my motivation
that in almost all cases

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.390
when you address atoms,
you do two photon courses

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.650
because a photon is scattered.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.920
You may think it's
absorbed and emitted,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.240
but in reality, it is a
two photon process and not

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.840
two single photon processes.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.620
So therefore, you should
really pay attention.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.860
If you have any doubts about
some subtleties about how

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.700
is light absorbed and
emitted, the correct answer

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.640
is always obtained from
the two-photon picture.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.780
Now, I'm using
pre-written slides

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.560
because we treat two-photon
absorption in perturbation

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.450
theory.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.490
And it is exactly the
same perturbation theory

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.330
we've used before.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.730
It's just-- there's
one difference.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.560
Namely, we have two optical
fields at frequency omega 1

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.380
and omega 2.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.810
So for the case of two-photon
absorption-- that means

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.200
both photons are used or
stacked up to go up in energy.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.730
We derived this result, and
this was the end of lecture

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.720
last week.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.380
And what we obtained
in perturbation theory

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.070
for the excited
state, it's exactly

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.400
the same structure
you have seen before.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.210
But the only difference
is we have now four terms

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.540
because we have combinations
of omega 1 and omega 2,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.580
or we can take two photons
out of the same laser beam.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.340
Just sort of a question,
just to sort of

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.250
indicate to you
how many terms you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.870
would expect when you do
the most basic light atom

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.310
interaction.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.860
Just one photon, a plus a dega.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.660
How many terms do you get if
you write down the Hamiltonian?

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.190
No approximation without.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.230
How many do you get?

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:43.530
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.310
PROFESSOR: Four.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.720
You have a plus dega for the
electric field, sigma plus plus

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.510
sigma minus for the atom.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.500
And then you have
four combinations,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.450
two are co-rotating, two
are counter-rotating.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.100
OK.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.990
What we are doing here is
second order perturbation theory

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.330
with two optical fields.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.380
If you would not do any
rotating wave approximation,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.610
how many terms would we get?

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:21.445
AUDIENCE: Eight.

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:22.295
PROFESSOR: Eight?

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:24.420
I think it's
multiplicative because we

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.544
have four processes
involving one-- oops.

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.490
Now I'm getting confused.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.390
I wanted to say 16, 4 times 4.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.590
But now I would say in
the first step, which

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.930
is to the intermediate level,
we have four at frequency one,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.750
four at frequency,
which makes eight.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.480
But then I think in the second
step you get eight more.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.570
So if we don't make an
approximation, we get 64 terms.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.756
But they're just
all combinations,

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:59.020
all combinations of frequencies.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.130
Anyway, therefore, I
hope you appreciate

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.320
that I did the rotating
wave approximation.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.970
I said I'm only interested
in the near-resonant terms.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.940
And then when we say we want to
go up in energy in two steps.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.090
We absorb two photos.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.870
We don't have any
emission of photons.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.620
These are all the
counter-rotating terms.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.999
You have only the
absorption of photons,

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.499
and then we have
four possibilities.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.620
Yes, I mean, you
have a term where

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.910
two photons are emitted
from the ground state.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.804
This is sort of now
doubly counter-rotatable.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:32.720
We're not going there.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.750
It's not adding
anything new to it.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.290
You know what
counter-rotating terms mean.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.360
In this chapter on
two photons, I'm

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.090
completely focused on
the resonant terms.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.800
But since four terms
is still too many,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.390
I want to just tell you what
is special about two photons.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.620
I focus now on a
situation, and that's

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.220
the most common situation in
the laboratory, where there

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.880
is a near-resonant
intermediate state

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.640
and that is sort of now
filtering out one of the terms.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.890
If this intermediate state
is resonant with omega 1,

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.260
then we only want
to consider now

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.810
the process where the first
step to the intermediate step

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.850
is driven by the field
e1 and the second step

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.720
to the final state b is
driven by the field e2.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.340
So therefore, we
have only one term,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.290
which dominates
out of those four,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.150
or dominates out
of those 64, which

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.390
we would have gotten
without any approximation.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.510
It's one term-- the
near-resonant term--

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.127
which dominates.

00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:40.710
So that's what we
want to discuss now.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.550
So this is the term
we want to consider.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.070
And it's the same we've
always done in lowest order

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.940
perturbation, second
order perturbation theory,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.120
in two steps.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.260
It's now in two steps.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.390
But if you're asking, what is
the transition probability?

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.680
The transition
probability, we have

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.220
to get the probability to
be in the excited state.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.580
And then we have
the usual situation

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.920
that this term can be written
as the sine squared divided

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.020
by this, and it turns into
a delta function times t.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.130
And when we divide the
probability, the amplitude

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.590
squared by t, we get a rate.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.280
And this is Fermi's Golden Rule.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.140
It is exactly the same you have
seen probably more than 100

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.640
times.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.490
So therefore, we have
now a transition rate,

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.960
which is Fermi's Golden Rule.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.620
This is the delta function.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.360
I called it the
function f because I

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.770
want to discuss the
spectral profile a minute.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.840
But then-- and this
is the only difference

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.430
to Fermi's Golden Rule
with a signal photon--

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.900
the relevant matrix element
is, because we have two steps,

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.310
is the product of two matrix
elements squared for step one

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.780
and for step two.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.080
And because we have
an intermediate step,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.510
we have to divide by
the energy mismatch

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.300
by the detuning in the
intermediate state.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.180
But remember, in the
one photon picture,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.260
Fermi's Golden Rule
is the matrix elements

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.890
squared times the
spectral function.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.170
So in this matrix element
squared in frequency units,

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.800
neglecting factors of 2,
was the Rabi frequency.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.970
So therefore, very
naturally, we want

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.010
to define this as a
two-photon Rabi frequency

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.690
whereas each matrix element
here divided by h bar

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.670
was the single photon
Rabi frequency.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.070
So therefore, what we obtained
for the two photon processes,

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.120
we have a two-photon
Rabi frequency,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.670
which is the product of
the single photon Rabi

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:10.480
frequency for each step,
divided by the energy detuning

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.655
from the immediate state.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:33.409
So therefore, our
result looks almost

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.030
indistinguishable from the
result built on single photons.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.240
We've just cleverly
defined our quantities.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.169
The rate to go from a
to b is Rabi frequency

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.550
squared, but it is the
two photon Rabi frequency.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.790
And the delta
function is the delta

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.430
function for the resonance-- the
energy difference between state

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.800
a and b-- but now not
just minus omega 1.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.780
It is minus the sum of
omega 1 plus omega 2

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.290
because we have stacked up the
two photons in the two photon

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:01.790
process.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.440
So let me just write that down.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:22.990
It looks like the
one photon excitation

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:32.190
but with suitably
defined Rabi frequencies.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.230
So in other words, if
you were interested just

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.340
in the physics of two
levels-- Rabi oscillation,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.900
you name it-- you can just
say the same thing happens.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.920
The only difference is that
instead of having a coupling

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.820
directly by a matrix
element, we are now

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.910
coupled by this two
photon Rabi frequency.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.940
And all your equation,
you know, everything--

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.000
you can consider line
shape, spontaneous emission,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.110
saturation-- all the
phenomena we have discussed

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.440
for single photon are analogous.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.100
You just have to use the density
of state calculated for the two

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.230
photons and you have to use
the two photon Rabi frequency.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.300
OK.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.990
So I started out by telling you
about two photon processes, two

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.140
photon absorption.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:35.050
But what is maybe even
more important in the way

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:41.480
how it is used in experiments
are Raman processes.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.090
So let me just show what I mean.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.220
If you have a
state a and b, this

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.380
can be two different vibrational
states of a molecule.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.130
It can be two hyperfine
states of an atom.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.660
Or if you think about
a break process,

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.900
it could be the
same internal state

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.270
of the atom-- the same
hyperfine state-- but with two

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.240
different momenta.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.050
Then it is a Raman process
only in the external degree

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.610
of freedom, in the
motion away function.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.490
The only change is you
change the momentum.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:22.060
We need our intermediate
state, which is often

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.340
an electronically excited state.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.040
We are detuned.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.710
And now we have one photon going
up and one photon going down.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:42.110
Historically, people distinguish
between the situation

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:49.550
where the final state is
lower or higher in energy.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.070
One is called the
Stokes process.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.620
The other one is
called anti-Stokes.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.530
But as long as you use
laser beams to stimulate it,

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.760
you don't even care which state
is higher or lower in energy.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.970
But if you work in molecules
with a thermal ensemble,

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.000
then you have certain
states thermally populated

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.080
and others not.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.850
And then it makes a
difference whether you

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.160
start from the ground state
a or from an excited state b.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:30.690
OK.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:37.030
So actually, everything
for the Raman process

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:42.330
is completely analogous-- is
completely covered, actually--

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.920
by what I wrote down for
you in perturbation theory.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.710
It's just if you had kept
all the 64 states-- to go up

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.810
with one photon and down with
one photon one was one of them,

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.280
but we discarded
it because we were

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.520
only interested in going up.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.740
So in other words,
what was previously

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.410
one of the
counter-rotating terms,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.460
where omega had a plus sign and
omega two had a minus sign, now

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.660
it becomes a resonant
term because we

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.740
have arranged our two
levels a and b in such a way

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.420
that the near-resonant
process is that one.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.550
So in other words,
I mention it to you

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.060
and it's just getting too
messy to write it down,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.090
when we have e to the i omega
t and e to the minus i omega t,

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.790
I mentioned once to you is
the sign plus or minus means

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.340
whether we absorb a photon
or whether we emit a photon.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.680
If you use a fully quantized
picture with a and a degas,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.640
the a for the
quantized description

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.900
becomes an e to the i omega t.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.880
In the semi-classical
description of the

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.270
a dega has a minus sign.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.740
So therefore, if you look
at all the combinations

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:57.090
between plus i omega t, minus i
omega t, for this Raman process

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:02.240
we want to select e to the minus
omega i and e to the plus omega

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.170
too.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.595
And that means we are
focusing on this process.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.460
Therefore, everything
for the Raman process

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.290
is analogous to the
two-photon absorption process.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.420
The only thing we
have to do is we

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.260
have to change the sign
on the second frequency

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.110
because the second photon is
emitted in a stimulated way

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.310
and not absorbed.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.610
And therefore, our
detuning is the detuning

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.630
from the Raman resonance.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:47.970
And therefore, OK, back
to Fermi's Golden Rule--

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.400
the rate in Fermi's Golden
Rule is the matrix element

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.100
squared times the
spectral density indicated

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.630
by the delta function.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.130
The delta function is
now at the frequency,

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:07.280
which is given by the
two-photon detuning.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.210
And the two-photon
Rabi frequency

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.180
is exactly the same what we
had for two-photon absorption,

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.330
the product of single-photon
Rabi frequencies

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.640
divided by the detuning.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.680
Any questions?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.233
Yes.

00:15:25.233 --> 00:15:26.108
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:40.755 --> 00:15:42.380
PROFESSOR: Well, we
are usually talking

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.290
about-- in an atomic system--
about very narrow resonances.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.620
And we are working
hard on our lasers

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.340
to be close to one resonance.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.740
And it would be an amazing
coincidence if accidentally it

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.050
would be in resonance
with another one.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.120
But I would say, if you
had a situation-- let's

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.730
say in a molecule, which
is a high density of state,

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.710
the Raman process would
be a rotation or vibration

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.630
of Raman process involving
the ground state.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.860
And if you're unlucky and don't
choose your lasers wisely,

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.940
the two laser photons
could get you high up

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.140
into an electronically
excited state.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.450
And this may have some
detrimental effect,

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.330
depending what you want to do.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.660
But in general, I would say if
you have more than one process,

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.240
there is no interesting
interference term.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.670
You just get two
different rates.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.190
One is the two-photon Raman
rate and the other one

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.120
is the two-photon
absorption rate.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.703
And you just have
both simultaneously.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.380
They're not leading to
the same final state.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.210
If something leads to
the same final state--

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.060
this is more subtle because you
kind of cram the interference

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.900
effects.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.434
But we'll discuss some of those
things in our next chapter

00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:51.975
on coherence.

00:16:55.542 --> 00:16:56.375
Any other questions?

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.390
OK.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:13.910
I want to now take it one level
higher, where we talk still

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.400
about two-photon
processes but we

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.660
are allowing one of the photons
to be spontaneously emitted.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.579
Again, we don't have
to learn new things.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:29.200
We just have to map it to
knowledge we already have.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:35.810
And let me sort of do
it in the following way.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.760
I just want to sort of give
you a clear understanding what

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.740
this expression for
the two-photon rate is.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.170
If we assume laser
one and laser two

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.706
are near-resonants with
a transition a to k and k

00:17:48.706 --> 00:17:53.940
to b, respectively,
we can sort of

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.790
look at the two-photon
process in the following way.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.480
We can say the photon
omega 2 cannot be absorbed

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.240
by the initial state.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.710
It can only be absorbed
by the initial state

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:15.040
because omega 1 mixes in with a
certain probability, the state

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.869
k into the ground state.

00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:18.410
So if you would
first forget about it

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.510
and you just do
perturbation theory,

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.050
then you would say in
perturbation theory

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.250
with the field one,
the state a has now

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.300
a probability,
given by this term,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.290
that the state a has
now an admixture.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.860
And now, if we have sort of--
we have dressed up our state

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:41.780
a with admixing for
the near-resonant field

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.500
some probability
of state k into it.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.670
And this stressed state now has
sort of a stepping stone here.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.870
And from this stepping
stone, it can now

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.180
absorb the photon omega 2.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.540
So that's how we
should think about it.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:00.030
I'm treating this dressing
up of the initial state

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.360
just a perturbation theory.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.490
And that's why everything
was in one formula

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.720
when I applied
perturbation theory.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.210
But as we especially cover
in the second semester

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.370
of the course, you can also
say if omega 1 is very, very

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.370
strong, you can exactly
diagonalize the Hilbert

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.860
space of states k and a.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.730
And this is called the
crest atom picture.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.790
But again, what happens is
you mix those two states.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.120
And it is the admixture now
in a non-perturbative way

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.320
of state k, which is sort
of the stepping stone.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.500
And from this
stepping stone on, you

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.450
can absorb a photon omega 2.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.210
So we could actually--
let me just redraw this--

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:14.410
that we want to go
to the final state b.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:21.110
But in this kind of
picture I just suggested,

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.510
I start with a dress state a.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:28.060
But what is relevant is
only kind of this admixture.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:35.880
And from this admixture,
we can absorb omega 2.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.930
The real state k
is somewhere else.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:46.310
And so it looks like, actually,
now a two-level system,

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.120
where we go from
the dashed line--

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.090
called the virtual state--
to the final state b.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.960
And let me just point out
what this virtual state is.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.880
Well, you know already
everything about it

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.260
because everything which
can be known about it

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.120
is what we have
derived in our formula.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.650
I'm just interpreting
the perturbation theory

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.040
I've written down to you.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.224
And if I now call
it a virtual state,

00:21:17.224 --> 00:21:18.640
there is nothing
more you can ever

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.190
know about this state than
what was in this formula.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:27.320
But it's maybe helpful
to summarize it.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.410
Because we have a resonant
with frequency omega 2

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:37.070
in this situation, it is clear
that the energy of this state

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.540
is where the dashed line is.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.270
It's not the energy
of the real state k.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.180
The stepping stone is created
with the first photon.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.200
And the dashed line
is the energy level

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.554
of the virtual state.

00:21:51.554 --> 00:21:52.470
What is its character?

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.070
Spatial bay function and such?

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.690
Well, it is exactly the
intermediate state k.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.870
And what is the population?

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.710
If you had a
two-level system, we

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:13.460
sort of start with 100%
amplitude in state 1.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:18.910
But here, our
population is diminished

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.560
by the probability at which
we have it admixed the state.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.960
So in other words,
if I really wanted

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.960
and I want to use
this concept, I

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.600
could make a
simplified description

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.010
of two-photon process.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.870
I would just say the
two-photon process is just

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.970
a similar photon
process starting

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.179
from the virtual state,
and the virtual state

00:22:39.179 --> 00:22:40.470
is created by the first photon.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.720
Well, you would say,
well, why do you do that?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.530
I think the picture
I've just drawn

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:59.880
for you is sort of
helpful when we discuss

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:05.030
now two-photon emission--
spontaneous emission.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.090
With two lasers,
it's sort of simple.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.830
But with two-photon emission,
we have the situation

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.730
that we start in
an excited state b.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:19.140
We have one laser,
omega 1, and that's it.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.600
But we will find out that,
eventually, the system

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.850
populates the ground state.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.990
And one possible
process-- and that's

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.160
the one we are focusing
on is-- that it was first

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.710
emitting a photon
in a stimulated way,

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.740
but the second photon,
since we're not

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.970
offering any extra
stimulation, had

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.890
to be emitted spontaneously.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:42.920
Now, you say, well,
how do I calculate it?

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.020
I can write out long equations.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.290
But with the concept
I've given to you,

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.520
it should be clear that what
we actually have is here,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.310
we have nothing-- let's
just look at the first part

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.800
as a dressed atom,
an atom in state

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.060
b with some
admixture of state k.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:04.720
And this admixutre can now decay
by a single-photon process.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.990
So in other words, you don't
need to re-derive anything.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:12.220
You can just sort of use
analogy to write down

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.900
what is the spontaneous emission
rate out of the state k.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.590
So what you would
write down now is

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:28.970
the rate for this
two-photon emission-- one

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.770
photon stimulated, the
second photon spontaneous--

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:36.980
is simply the Einstein
a coefficient,

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.720
or the spontaneous emission rate
out of this intermediate state

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.910
gamma ka.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:47.410
But then we have to multiply
with the probability

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.560
that this state is
present in the state

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.480
b because b-- that's
what we assumed

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.710
has no direct matrix
element to emit to state a.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.890
And now you should
sort of be amazed

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.370
about the beauty of
concepts you have learned.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.800
We are talking about
something which

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.950
maybe before this lecture--
wow, one photon stimulated,

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.170
one photon spontaneous.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.690
That must be complicated.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:17.590
But it's just that,
except for one thing.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.730
And this is the
following-- remember,

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.410
you should always remember
how we derived the formula

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.550
for spontaneous emission.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.460
The physics of
spontaneous emission

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.840
is that you can put one photon
in each of the empty modes

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.850
and you have to
sum overall modes.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.680
And what was important
was the density

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.850
of modes at the frequency.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.320
And now the frequency is omega.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.530
So when we calculated
the spontaneous rate--

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:47.770
emission rate-- the decay
of the excited state k,

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:52.570
we had an omega cubed dependence
at the resonance frequency--

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:57.010
at the resonant frequency
for the transition ka.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.510
But now we are
interested in the density

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.030
of states at frequency omega.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.720
Well, you'll remember,
two factors of omega

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.640
are from the density of states.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.440
One came from translating
for momentum matrix

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.310
element to-- no, one
was-- yes, it was set.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.840
But one was pretty much the
single-photon Rabi frequency.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:24.590
And this is also at the
frequency of the photon.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.560
So you just have to correct
for the omega cubed factor.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.560
And this is our result now
for two-photon emission.

00:26:42.795 --> 00:26:43.295
OK.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:27:00.780
This may be even more relevant
at least in the research which

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.820
is done in my group and
in other groups at MIT,

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.150
are again Raman processes.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.165
We often have Raman
processes-- you know,

00:27:11.165 --> 00:27:14.470
you need a reason why
you want a two-photon.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.280
If you can't reach the upper
state with a single photon like

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.032
people in [INAUDIBLE]-- they
may just use two photons.

00:27:21.032 --> 00:27:22.490
But this is more
limit because they

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.210
don't have the laser,
which can bridge the gap.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:28.140
In situations where you
work with alkali atoms,

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.040
we are often very happy with--
we have one resonant line

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.790
and we can do all the laser
cooling, everything we want.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:38.330
But often, we don't like that
the line width of the excited

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.180
state is very large.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.242
And therefore, certain
precision work,

00:27:43.242 --> 00:27:45.450
where we want to be very
accurate in what we're doing

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:51.860
with the atoms, cannot be
done on the d1 or d2 line.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.630
And therefore, we often
use a two-level system,

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.270
which consists of
two hyperfine states

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.120
because then there
is no broadening

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.150
to do spontaneous emission.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.620
So one motivation why we again
and again and again consider

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.730
two-photon processes
in our laboratory

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:14.410
is because it gives us excess
to very narrow resonances.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.220
But I think you
get the gist now,

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.590
and it will become
even clearer later on,

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.220
that often when you do a
transition between two ground

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.060
state levels, a
lot of the physics

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.190
is the same as of
a single photon.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.440
You just replace your
single photon Rabi frequency

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.920
by two-photon Rabi
frequency, and suddenly you

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.630
can do everything
you ever wanted

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.240
to do with a single photon.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.350
But now with the benefit of
having a very narrow resonance.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:46.090
So anyway, therefore, I think
the most important aspect

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:51.750
of two-photon processes
99% of the research

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.180
people in our field are
involved is actually

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.640
in the form of Raman processes.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.760
So therefore, but for
pedagogical reasons,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.870
I just like to start out
with two-photon process--

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.070
one photon stimulated,
one photon spontaneous.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:10.270
But now let's just fold it over,
and we have the lambda type

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.280
transition.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:17.775
The first photon is absorbed
and the second photon

00:29:17.775 --> 00:29:21.060
is spontaneously emitted.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.022
I think as you
realize when you go

00:29:23.022 --> 00:29:26.360
from the two-photon
absorption to Raman process,

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.820
there's nothing you
have to re-learn.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.640
You just have to be careful with
the signs of omega 1 and omega

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.540
2.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:51.000
So if I would ask you now
what is the rate-- what

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.130
is the rate of the
spontaneous Raman process,

00:29:55.130 --> 00:30:02.690
well, it is the probability to
be in the intermediate state.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:08.220
And this probability
is just re-writing

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.060
in a different way what
we have used, is the Rabi

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:16.000
frequency of the first
step squared, divided

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.270
by the detuning squared.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:22.010
So this is the probability
to be in the excited state.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.490
Now, the spontaneous
emission occurs

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:29.660
with Einstein's a
coefficient connecting

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.020
the intermediate state
to the ground state.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.370
And then, of course,
as we just learned,

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:40.240
we have to correct the
spectral density and such,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.100
or we have to use
for the calculation

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.905
of the density of modes.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.516
The correct omega
factors-- we have

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:54.760
to calculate it at the
frequency of the emitted photon.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.540
This is actually
also-- this kind

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.360
of spontaneous
Raman process-- has

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.450
been very important
historically.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.990
Before the advent of
lasers, all you had

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:15.210
is light bulbs, strong light
bulbs, maybe mercury lamp

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:18.860
which put a lot of light
into the mercury light,

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.310
and at least it was
somewhat spectrally narrow.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.870
But still very, very broad.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:27.000
And you couldn't really
resonantly, you know,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.610
stack up two light bulbs and
have enough spectral power

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.170
to excite to a certain state.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.340
But look here-- you could
still, with a strong light bulb,

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.920
create an admixture
of the excited state.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.110
This virtual line
was terribly broad

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.930
because of the width of the
light bulb-- spectral width--

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:50.910
but then this spontaneous photon
was just compensating for it.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:55.030
So in other words, it should
be obvious-- this process only

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.810
depends on the power
for the first step.

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.680
And it doesn't really
matter if the power

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.560
is delivered by a
laser or a light bulb.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.210
The rate for this
process is the same.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.010
And this actually
was the discovery

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.340
by Raman, which was rewarded
with the Nobel Prize,

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.800
for suddenly observing
when you excited molecules

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.720
with a very strong
light bulb, you suddenly

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.660
saw very different frequencies
of photons coming out.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.040
And this was a
landmark discovery.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.360
OK, what is next?

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.600
I've already written it out.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:50.680
So that's also important for a
lot of research within the CUA.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.820
When we simply want to change
the momentum state of an atom,

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.750
we have two lasers.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.700
We go up and down.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:04.130
We are not changing
the internal state.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.180
But it is still a Raman
process because state a and b

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.990
differ by the photon recoil.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.810
So we're not going
back to the same state.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.770
We are going back to the
same internal state a,

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:18.840
but it may have 2h [INAUDIBLE],
two-photon recoil different.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.060
And therefore, as long
as, in quantum physics,

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.510
one quantum number is different,
it is a different state.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.070
And therefore, if you
just think about it

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.620
Rayleigh scattering resonance
fluorescence, that you go up

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.390
and you go down
to the next state.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.110
You may think you have
your favorite atom,

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.280
and you go up on a
cycling transition.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.945
Well, when the atom goes
up and then emits a photon

00:33:46.945 --> 00:33:50.560
on a cycling transition,
there is recoil involved.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.220
So actually what you're doing
is on the cycling transition,

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.540
you cycle it through many, many
spontaneous Raman processes.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.220
So this is the
correct description

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.160
of resonant fluorescence
and Rayleigh scattering.

00:34:09.927 --> 00:34:10.510
Any questions?

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:19.870
Good.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:29.989
I've just mentioned that when
we do Reyleigh scattering,

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:33.560
we have to consider that
the photons have momentum,

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.219
and this takes us
to another state.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.230
Let's now be a little
bit more careful

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:43.010
and consider what is
the role of the momentum

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.719
in the transition-- in
the two-photon process.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.060
And in particular,
I want to come back

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.290
to this Fermi's
Golden Rule formula

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:57.800
and include in this spectral
profile, which in the simplest

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.690
case is always the Lorentzian.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.880
But I want to include
now Doppler shifts.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.960
So in other words,
what I want to do now

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.370
is I want to talk about
recoil and Doppler shifts

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.950
in a two-photon
process and see how

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.740
it will affect the line shape.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:25.880
All we have to do is--
or maybe let me back up.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.890
You should maybe consider
what I've discussed so far,

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:32.190
is the situation of an
atom which has no motion.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:36.020
We could just fully focus on
the internal degree of freedom.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.545
And just to remind
you, we have discussed

00:35:38.545 --> 00:35:43.230
two ways how you can eliminate
motion out of the picture.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:46.920
One is assume the atom
has infinite mass.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.550
That's one possibility.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:52.210
The second one is assume
the atom is tightly

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:57.900
localized in an ion trap,
deep in the [INAUDIBLE],

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.570
that it is localized to
less than the wavelength.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:09.460
And actually, the two ways of
how you can eliminate recoil

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.040
in Doppler shift are
actually the same.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.910
When I said, give the
atom an infinite mass,

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.390
well, you give the
atom an infinite mass

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.880
by tightly connecting
it to the laboratory.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.470
And this is what tight
confinement in an ion or atom

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.020
trap does.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:28.220
Because then the recoil is
absorbed no longer by the atom,

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.730
but by your
experimental structure,

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.020
or by your whole laboratory,
or even by the building,

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.560
if you want.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:40.260
But now, we are kind of going
beyond this restriction.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.510
We are now saying, OK, now
we allow the atom to move.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.040
And we can deal with that by
simply saying when the atom has

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:55.030
a velocity v, we can transform--
we can just use the Galilean

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:58.600
transformation and say OK,
the physics is the same.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.790
However, the atom,
due to its velocity,

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.040
sees a slightly
different frequency.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.250
So therefore, we
have our Lorentzian.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:10.020
But now, we calculate
our Lorentzian

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.720
by using the frequencies
perceived by the atom.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.160
The different
signs-- plus minus--

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.960
are, of course,
distinguishing whether we

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.110
have two-photon absorption
or Raman process.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:39.850
And the frequency shift, going
into the frame of the atom,

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:45.275
gives us Doppler ts k1v and k2v.

00:37:45.275 --> 00:37:47.900
And now you'll see that there is
something which is potentially

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.420
interesting, and I
want to discuss that.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:56.740
If k1 and k2 end up
here with a minus sign,

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.170
it may eliminate Doppler
shifts, maybe even completely.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:02.940
So this is something new.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.830
If you have a single
photon, you always

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.920
transfer momentum to the atom.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.560
But if you have two photons,
the two momenta can cancel.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.870
And this is actually
a powerful method

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:18.820
to avoid Doppler
broadening in spectroscopy.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.660
So let me elaborate on that.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.760
The message you get
from this formula--

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.640
it's actually much
easier to say it in words

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.290
than to write it
mathematically because it's all

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.190
hidden in the plus minus sign.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:48.130
But the gist is that two-photon
absorption or Raman processes--

00:38:48.130 --> 00:39:00.260
so any kind of
two-photon process--

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:06.490
they are like
single-photon transitions.

00:39:15.538 --> 00:39:17.390
And we've already
discussed it, that we

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:21.320
said we have Fermi's Golden
Rule like for single photon.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.500
It's just we have to use
the suitable definition

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.140
of the two-photon
Rabi frequency.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.390
And we had also seen that
we can treat, actually,

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.370
the two photons at one.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.140
But the frequencies,
sort of, of this photon--

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.300
if you want to regard
the two-photon process

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.880
as a super photon, the
frequency of the super photon

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.200
is now either the
sum or the difference

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.480
off the two
frequencies, depending

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.490
whether we look at two-photon
absorption or Raman process.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:55.470
But what we see now from
the Doppler shift formula,

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.360
that we can apply the
same also to the momentum.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.560
It is as if we had a
super photon, which

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:08.130
drives one transition, but the
momentum of this super photon

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:12.760
is now the sum or the
difference of the two

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.250
momenta of the photon.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.910
And if you wonder, how
do you sum them up?

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:23.980
What really matters is what is
after the two photons have been

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.750
exchanged, what is
the total momentum

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.470
transferred to the atom.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:32.660
So what appears here--
k1 plus minus k2--

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:44.740
is the total momentum
transfer to the atom.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.730
And you see that if you
have two-photon absorption,

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:52.140
if the two laser beams
are counter-propagating,

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.630
the total momentum
transfer is zero.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:57.660
But if you have a Raman process
where you absorb one photon

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.020
and then emit it,
the momentum transfer

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:04.480
is zero, assuming similar
frequencies, when the two Raman

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.360
beams are parallel.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:11.326
So in other words, the situation
without momentum transfer--

00:41:11.326 --> 00:41:13.200
and you will see in a
moment, or I've already

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.570
said this is a situation
where you are Doppler

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:18.880
free-- for two-photon
absorption the geometry is

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.480
counter-propagating.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.800
For Raman processes,
it is co-propagating.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.440
Then you have no or minimal
momentum transfer to the atom.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:31.660
OK.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.080
So this total
momentum transfer is

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:47.340
minimized for k1 equals minus
k2 for two-photon absorption,

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:55.890
or for k1 equals k2
co-propagating laser beams

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:58.970
in the case of
the Raman process.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.329
Oops.

00:42:00.329 --> 00:42:01.245
Now you have it twice.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.070
Let me just focus, because
there is very special interest

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:12.560
in that, for precision
spectroscopy of hydrogen.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:20.540
Let me assume we have just
one laser, which produces--

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.030
but we want to dive a
two-photon process with it.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:26.010
In this situation,
omega 1 equals omega 2.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.550
The momentum transfers
are the same.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.890
And if we arrange
for the two photons

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.530
to be absorbed from
opposite directions,

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:38.260
we reach the situation where the
Doppler shift is really zero.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:46.820
So this is the way where we
do Doppler free spectroscopy.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.790
And two-photon
spectroscopy is one

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:59.840
of the handful of methods
of practical importance

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.310
for eliminating the first
order Doppler shift.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:11.780
So if you take an atom-- and
let me just quote Dan Kleppner

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.570
research, where this
is the hydrogen atom--

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:21.440
and you have two laser beams
from opposite direction.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.120
How will the spectrum look like?

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:30.220
Well, we have the feature,
which I just emphasized,

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.500
that the two photons-- one
is absorbed from the left

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.850
and from the right,
and therefore you

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.370
get a very, very sharp line.

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:38.980
Really sharp.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.170
I will talk about
it in a second.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.650
But you cannot, of course,
suppress the process where you

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.420
absorb two photons from the left
or two photons from the right.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.960
And therefore, you have
sort of a broad pedestal.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:59.190
So the pedestal is where you
take one photon-- both photons

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:03.180
from the same side, whereas the
Doppler free peak is where you

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.745
have photons from
counter-propagating directions.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:23.500
Since hydrogen is of
methological importance,

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.120
measurements of-- fundamental
measurements of-- the Lamb

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.060
shift, comparisons
with QED calculations,

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.500
measurement of the
Rydberg constant-- these

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.160
are all done by
hydrogen spectroscopy.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.270
So therefore, it
is very important

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:43.610
to have precision method which
suppresses the Doppler effect.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:48.960
However, let me point out
that once you have completely

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.480
eliminated the first
order Doppler broadening,

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:58.150
you are then limited by the
second order Doppler effect.

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:01.110
And as I pointed out,
there is no geometry-- no

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.950
arrangements of
beams, no tricks you

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.520
can play-- because
one contribution

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.290
to the second order
Doppler effect

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:13.030
simply comes from time dilation,
that in the frame of the atom,

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:16.380
relativistically speaking,
the clock ticks differently.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.550
And therefore, the
spectral line is different.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:31.570
So this is what we had discussed
already for the second order

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:35.530
Doppler effect, and this is
not suppressed by two-photon.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:40.490
If you now estimate what is
the relative line width-- so

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.300
what is the delta, the
line broadening you

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.780
to the second order
Doppler effect, in relation

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.398
to the transition frequency?

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.940
So just give me a second.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.510
Yeah.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.620
Then this omega cancels
and we have an expression

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.120
which is sort of interesting.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.320
It is mv squared.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.730
It's the energy--
the thermal energy--

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:16.590
but since we have normalized
it to the transition frequency,

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.180
it becomes now
the thermal energy

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:24.170
relative to the rest
mass of the atom.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:26.680
You would think, well,
this must be really tiny.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.560
Well, it is tiny.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.760
If you take room temperature, it
is 2 times 10 to the minus 11.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.860
But people are now
looking for precision

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:39.200
in optical clocks, which is in
the 10 to the minus 15 range.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:44.040
So you really have to be
able to know the temperature,

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.880
know the kinetic energy
distribution of the atom,

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.790
and be able to correct for it.

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.432
Or ultimately, if you
can't correct for it,

00:46:51.432 --> 00:46:53.890
you would not be able to correct
for it at room temperature

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:57.100
because you can't know for
certain that the velocity

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.260
distribution of the
atoms in your laser beam

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.120
is exactly at room temperature.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.220
You really have to go
to low temperature,

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.190
go to cryogenic temperatures.

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:11.620
And in the famous experiments
in Munich and [INAUDIBLE] group,

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.800
the typical situation is
for the 1s to 2s transition,

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.240
they observed residual
line broadenings

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.910
on the order of a
few hundred Hertz.

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:29.790
This is not limited at all
by the natural lifetime

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:31.520
of the 2s transition.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.450
As you calculate in your
last homework assignment,

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:38.140
the lifetime of the
2s state is actually

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.030
due to two-photon emission.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.030
Amazing.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:43.860
Two photons in series.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.740
This is the way how
the 2s state decays.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.630
And you will, actually, with
this rather simple description,

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:53.310
get a fairly accurate
estimate for the lifetime,

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:55.080
which is a fraction of a second.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.830
And [INAUDIBLE] group uses
a cryogenic experiment.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:05.310
They cool the hydrogen by
collisions with liquid helium,

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.910
cooled vaults, to maybe a Kelvin
or so, three hundred times

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:10.230
below room temperature.

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:12.790
And this has been important
to reach this precision.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:16.060
And still, I think, even
at Kelvin temperature,

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:25.470
the second order Doppler shift
is one of the important--

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.350
is one of the
important systematics.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:47.590
OK.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:51.840
This is what I wanted to discuss
with you about two photons.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.105
Any questions?

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.590
Yes.

00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:59.000
AUDIENCE: Just--
very lightly-- I

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.835
would have thought [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:13.230
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:17.080
It really depends what you want.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.610
If you simply want an
atomic clock, all you want

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:24.750
is a very, very, very
stable reference point.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:27.840
And people use for
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.930
and strontium, or
the people who do

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:33.370
ion traps use the aluminum ion.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:37.100
All they want is
a spectral line,

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:41.330
which is sufficiently sharp,
sufficiently narrow, and also

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:46.280
insensitive to magnetic
fields and electric fields.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.210
And so they select all over
from the whole periodic table

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.870
what they want.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:54.430
But people who want to measure
fundamental constants--

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:58.320
the Rydberg constant--
want to compare lame shift

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.690
with first principle
QED calculations,

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:05.410
sort of test the precision
of quantum electrodynamics,

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.570
verify that quantum
electrodynamics is

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:10.110
a complete description of
atom photon interaction,

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:12.880
they can only deal
with simple systems

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.300
where all the
calculations are possible.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.450
This is the case for hydrogen.

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:21.475
And, actually, with some advance
in the numeric calculation

00:50:21.475 --> 00:50:24.540
of wave functions
and all that, it

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:26.890
may also be possible
to do it with helium.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.640
I know in the literature
people have often

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.230
suggested helium have
pushed the precision

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:34.960
of two-electron calculations
further and further.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.077
I think so far it
hasn't kind of-- helium

00:50:38.077 --> 00:50:39.160
has not replaced hydrogen.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.670
It's still hydrogen.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:43.600
But this sort of tells
you what the choices

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.520
if you want to test
fundamental physics

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.680
or determine
fundamental constants.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.720
In all atoms other than
helium and hydrogen,

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.914
you would be limited by the
infeasibility of many electron

00:50:57.914 --> 00:50:58.455
calculations.

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:07.222
Yes?

00:51:07.222 --> 00:51:11.801
AUDIENCE: Going back to the
two-photon Raman process where

00:51:11.801 --> 00:51:13.970
you had the second
spontaneous emission,

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.430
I just want to clarify.

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:19.770
So in the past, all this time
when you were talking about

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:24.674
off-resonant single photon
scattering, was this actually,

00:51:24.674 --> 00:51:28.212
really, the more descriptive
picture or was there actually

00:51:28.212 --> 00:51:29.128
a different physical--

00:51:29.128 --> 00:51:35.540
PROFESSOR: No, this is
off resonance scattering.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:40.870
And if you ask me, when do
you have a situation where you

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:43.690
first absorb the photon and
then emit it, I would say,

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:45.000
I would like to know that.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.170
I don't think there
is a situation where

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.380
this is possible.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.380
You always-- you should always
use a two-photon picture.

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:54.100
Or the only situation, if you
press a little bit harder,

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.400
where I think you can
think in first absorption

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.800
and then emission,
is if you have a gas

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.700
with lots and lots
of collisions,

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.540
the first photon may
not be fully resonant.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.710
But then you have a
collision and the collision

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.110
stabilised, provides
the missing energy

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:09.930
or takes away the extra energy.

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:12.560
And then with something which is
much more complicated than you

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.555
ever wanted, you have
now truly an atom

00:52:15.555 --> 00:52:18.200
in an excited state,
which has completely

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.430
lost its memory from
how it was excited.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:25.210
And yes, for this atom,
it will now simply

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:27.210
spontaneously emit a photon.

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.030
But in all other
situations where

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:33.470
you don't have any loss
of coherence or something

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:36.550
in between, you're never
really going to the real state.

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.200
You're always going
to virtual state.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.530
It's all two-photon.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:42.340
And, I mean, we discussed that.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.760
Remember the clicker question
where most of the class

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.740
was confused when
I said we go up--

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.530
if we're exciting the atom?

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.510
But now we are asking,
what is the spectrum

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:55.360
of the emitted photon?

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:58.070
It is a delta function
at the drive field,

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.190
and we discussed it at length.

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:04.880
If you allow in your head any
picture of first absorption

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:09.720
then emission, that's where all
the wrong answers come from.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.640
This is really the
picture behind it.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.650
This is what happens.

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:16.390
Photon in, photon out--
should be described together,

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:19.050
unless you have-- and I'm
just repeating myself--

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.020
something in between,
which is sort

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.814
of some form of
de-coherence which

00:53:22.814 --> 00:53:23.980
decouples the two processes.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.190
OK.

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:45.590
But that's a wonderful opening
to our next chapter, namely

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:47.780
coherence.

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:52.810
To what extent-- we just
discussed one aspect of it

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.200
and we come back to this
in this chapter-- to

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.640
what extent is the
photon which is scattered

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.160
coherent with the
incoming photon?

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:10.210
So I want to feature,
in this last big chapter

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:17.000
of this course, coherence in all
its different manifestations.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.540
I think this is rather unusual.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.120
I don't know of any
textbook or any other course

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.270
where this is done.

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:25.940
But this is similar in spirit to
what we did on line broadening.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.580
I felt I could create
spatial connections

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.790
by discussing all possibly line
shifts and line broadenings

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:32.870
together.

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:37.070
And now I hope you will also
see certain common traits

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:41.050
if I discuss together all
the different manifestations

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:43.410
of coherence.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:57.830
So what we want to
discuss is-- we start out

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:02.010
by talking about coherence
in a single atom.

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:09.450
We can have coherence
between two levels.

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:15.760
Usually, I try to
stop at the simplest

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.520
possible manifestation.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.000
But when we talk
about coherence,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.700
I cannot stop at two levels
because there are many new

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:27.770
qualitative features which come
into play when we have three

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:30.520
levels-- like lasing
without inversion,

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.600
like electromagnetically-induced
transparencies,

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.090
for those of you who
have heard about it.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:37.190
On the other hand,
I can reassure you,

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:40.100
I don't think there's anything
fundamental to be learned

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.060
by going to four,
five, and six levels,

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.990
so we will stop at three levels.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:53.140
We can have-- so this
is a single atom.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:58.980
But we can also have coherence
between different atoms.

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:14.590
And phenomena we want to
discuss is superradiance,

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:20.480
which is very, very much related
to the phenomenon of phase

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.350
matching.

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:23.360
Everybody who frequency
doubles a laser

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.047
knows about phase matching
and phase matching conditions.

00:56:26.047 --> 00:56:28.130
You have to rotate the
crystal or heat the crustal

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:31.220
to the temperature where
the whole crystal--

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:35.160
all the atoms in the
crystal act coherently.

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:38.590
But it's very related
to superradiance.

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:41.990
There is a third aspect of
coherence between atoms which

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:44.880
I will not discuss
this semester,

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:48.419
and this is the situation
of Bose-Einstein condensates

00:56:48.419 --> 00:56:49.710
and macroscopic wave functions.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.510
This is covered together
with quantum gases

00:56:55.510 --> 00:57:06.240
in-- this is discussed in
the context of quantum gases

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.570
in the second part
of the course.

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:14.870
So having these very different
manifestations of coherence,

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:18.300
I want to try now to give you
a definition of coherence.

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.860
But it's a bit
difficult because I

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:24.890
want to cover with my
definition all the cases I know.

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:32.120
But with those examples in
mind, for me coherence--

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.960
we have the phenomenon
of coherence.

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:41.610
Coherence exists if there
is a well-defined phase.

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:55.850
Well, if we have a phase--
a well-defined phase--

00:57:55.850 --> 00:58:01.530
it's always a phase between
quantum mechanical amplitudes.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:09.490
So we need two or
more amplitudes.

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.070
So coherence exists if there
is a well-defined phase

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:21.170
between two or more
amplitudes, but we can only

00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:25.980
observe it if those
amplitudes interfere.

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:29.790
And it can be two amplitudes
describing two different atoms,

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:32.720
or it can be two
amplitudes of two

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.210
states within the same atom.

00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:37.110
But I will point
out to you-- what

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:39.010
is really relevant is
an indistinguishable

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:42.590
ability that those two
amplitudes are involved

00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:46.730
in two branches of a process
which has the same final state.

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:48.960
And like in Feynman's
double-slit experiment,

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.237
you don't know which
intermediate state was taken.

00:58:52.237 --> 00:58:54.070
And that's where coherence
manifests itself.

00:58:57.570 --> 00:59:01.770
So that means when we
observe an interference, that

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:06.170
means we obesrve-- and
this is how we read out

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:17.170
of a coherence-- one
observes a physical quantity,

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:20.030
the population in a
certain quantum state,

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:25.710
total electric field
emitted, but this quantity

00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:38.210
is usually proportional to the
square of the total amplitude.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.921
And that means we get
an interference term.

00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:52.915
So coherence is important.

00:59:57.130 --> 01:00:02.120
Let me provide one
additional motivation

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.410
that coherence is an
important technique

01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:08.300
and important tool
for measurements.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:27.960
In a way, it's subtle but
trivial at the same time.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:33.820
Whenever we do spectroscopy,
we are actually

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:39.710
interested in doing a
measurement of energy.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.500
We want to measure
energy levels.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:47.630
And those energy
levels can tell us

01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:54.540
something about magnetic
fields through Zeeman shifts.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.100
If you're addressing
energy levels

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:02.270
in the gravitational field
for atom interferometry,

01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:07.080
the energy levels reflect
gravitational fields.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.570
Or if we are not
interested in-- if we

01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:14.520
try to eliminate or shield
the atoms from magnetic fields

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.210
and we just want to
get the most precision

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:20.380
in a reproducible
energy level, this

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.940
is the situational
of atomic clocks.

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.194
So pretty much when we
use atomic spectroscopy

01:01:26.194 --> 01:01:28.360
for any application, we are
interested in the energy

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.680
levels.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.970
But this is very
deeply connected

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:46.520
to coherence and the phase
because the relative phase

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:54.300
between two states
is nothing else

01:01:54.300 --> 01:02:03.320
than the time integral
over the energy difference

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.810
between two levels.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.360
So the phase evolved
between the two levels

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.510
is the difference frequency
times time or time

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:14.500
integrated dt.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:18.760
So therefore, when we are
talking about coherence,

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:23.560
how can we maintain longer
coherence between energy levels

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.940
or how can we create coherence
in three level systems?

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:32.520
This is actually intricately
related to the fact

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.671
that we can obtain more precise
information about the energy

01:02:35.671 --> 01:02:36.170
levels.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:48.350
Anyway, this is a very general
introduction to coherence.

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:54.980
Before I talk about
manifestations of coherence,

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:58.790
I have two clicker questions
because the first form

01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:01.160
of coherence I
want to discuss is

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.400
the coherence of--
the coherence involved

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.340
in exciting atoms and
the atom emitting light.

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:11.230
It's related to the spontaneous
emission and scattering

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:12.700
problem.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:20.900
So just to sort of figure
out what you know already,

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:26.620
let me ask you something
about the nature

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:27.750
of spontaneous emission.

01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:46.500
The first choice is
spontaneous emission,

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:55.200
is nothing else than a
unitary transformation--

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:07.560
unitary transformation or
unitary time evolution--

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:13.710
of the wave function
of the total system.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:24.340
And option B is
spontaneous emission

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:29.400
introduces-- well, maybe
through a master equations

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:39.270
or optical Bloch equation--
introduces a random phase

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:47.797
into the time evolution of
the quantum mechanical system.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.150
So what is the picture you
have on spontaneous emission?

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.405
OK.

01:05:18.405 --> 01:05:18.905
Stop.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.480
OK.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.900
So at least half of you
better pay attention now.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:42.420
So the answer is whenever
you have a system

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.510
and it couples to the
electromagnetic field--

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:49.320
you just put a system in an
excited state and you wait.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:54.080
The 100% unique and correct
answer is the system

01:05:54.080 --> 01:06:02.160
involves with the
following operator,

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:15.820
and this is the operator we
have discussed many times.

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:19.780
This is the operator
which completely describes

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:24.340
the interaction of an atom
with the electromagnetic field.

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:29.740
And since the whole
system is completely

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:34.800
described by this
Hamiltonian, the whole system

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.164
undergoes a unitary
time evolution.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.350
So if you talk about the
total system consisting

01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:47.880
of the photons in all
electromagnetic-- in all

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.420
relevant modes-- and
the atomic system,

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.840
this total
quantomechanical system

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.850
has a unitary time evolution
with this operator.

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:57.900
And to the best
what our knowledge,

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:00.150
this is a complete
description which

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:02.508
covers all aspects
of the system.

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:10.930
OK.

01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:19.070
But, and this is now
the next question,

01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:23.750
there is a certain randomness
in spontaneous emission

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.450
when we go to the
laboratory and look

01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:28.500
at the spontaneously
emitted photons.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.080
And this is actually
what I want to work out

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.540
with you in--
maybe even today, I

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:36.370
think ten minutes
may be enough-- what

01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:40.930
is really the information--
the phase information-- which

01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:43.890
we have in a photon, which has
been spontaneously emitted.

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:53.430
I know how to phrase--
the randomness

01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:54.670
of spontaneous emission.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.030
Well, let me write it down.

01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:07.660
First a very big disclaimer.

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:10.920
This question does not
contradict the first one.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.290
The fact that we have a unitary
evolution with this operator

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:19.090
is 100% or 110% true.

01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:23.510
But this operator
will actually lead

01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:26.120
to final states of the
photon field, which

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.170
may not have a specific phase.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.830
So if you say there is
some intuition that there

01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:35.180
is something going on with
the phase, you may be correct.

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:39.460
But everything which is
going on with the phase

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:43.029
is the result of a
unitary time evolution.

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:46.450
The system itself is
described by an operator,

01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:50.350
by a Schrodinger equation
for the total system.

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:54.680
But the question I have for
you now is if you detect,

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.279
let's say, the photon emitted
in spontaneous emission,

01:08:58.279 --> 01:09:00.580
the randomness of
spontaneous emission,

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:06.760
the-- let me call
it loss of phase,

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.970
or at least the diminishment
of the read out.

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:13.470
There may be situations where
we have a laser beam which has

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:15.500
a well-defined phase,
photons are scattered,

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.920
and we just cannot retrieve
the phase of the laser beam

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.290
by looking at the photons.

01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:21.270
So this is what I mean here.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:24.550
Also, the photons can't come
out of a unitary time evolution.

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:27.670
My question now is, is the
randomness or this loss

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:41.430
of phase of spontaneously
emitted photons--

01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:43.109
and now we should,
I want to know

01:09:43.109 --> 01:09:48.969
your best guess--
what is it due to?

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.740
Is it only due to
the-- does it only

01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.950
occur, is it only due
to the measurement

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:02.000
process of the photon?

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:22.730
Or is it due to
performing sort of

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:26.920
a partial trace ever-reaching
over certain states?

01:10:33.707 --> 01:10:35.290
So if you're interested
in the photon,

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:37.890
maybe tracing out the
states of the atom.

01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:43.810
Or ever-reaching over modes
of the electromagnetic field.

01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:48.133
And question C is both
is actually possible.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:57.210
So if you look at
spontaneously emitted photons

01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:59.540
and they're not perfectly
phased coherent--

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:03.140
they're not reproducing
the phase of the laser who

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:08.460
has created them-- what
is the reason for that?

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:11.010
Is it always the
fundamental reason

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:13.430
or is there no
fundamental reason?

01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:19.700
It's only a kind of reason of
ignoring information, taking

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:20.580
a partial trace?

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.340
OK.

01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.951
That's pretty good.

01:11:39.951 --> 01:11:40.450
Yes.

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:52.040
What I want to emphasize is
that A is very, very important,

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.500
and I want to discuss it now.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.490
But B is always the case.

01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:58.720
If you ignore the position
where the atom has scattered

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.810
the light-- if
atoms scatter light

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:03.600
and they are wavelengths
apart, then you

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.420
have maybe optical path
length differences.

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.860
The photon from the
laser hits an atom here.

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.300
It goes to your detector.

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.750
But from another
atom, the photon

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:16.610
has accumulated a different
spatial phase into the IKR.

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:19.730
And, of course, what you get
here is the random phase.

01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:21.620
This is why quite
often when we scatter

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.480
light for many,
many atoms, we're

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.340
not even asking for the phase.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:28.680
We say, one atom scatters
light-- really scatters light

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.610
at a certain intensity, i1.

01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:33.320
And n atoms-- well, we
get n times the light.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.800
You immediately perform
an incoherence sum

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.280
because you sort of
know deep in your heart

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.710
that there won't be
any interference.

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:42.645
So it's always
possible, of course,

01:12:42.645 --> 01:12:46.220
to lose the phase
by not controlling

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:50.070
every aspect of your experiment.

01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:51.780
So B is always possible.

01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:00.450
But for so many reasons that
I don't want to discuss it,

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:03.920
but the measurement
process is very relevant.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:07.810
And so, therefore, I would
have answered C here.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:15.000
But let's now discuss the
most fundamental situation.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.800
And the most
fundamental situation

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.105
is we take our favorite
atom with infinite mass--

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:23.490
no Doppler shift,
we just put it.

01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:26.370
And we put it in a
cavity that it can only

01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:29.690
interact with a single mode
of the electromagnetic field.

01:13:29.690 --> 01:13:31.610
So this is a
fundamental situation.

01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:33.660
And a lot of the
general situations,

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:37.130
you get by just summing
up over many modes,

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:39.980
summing up over many
positions of the atom,

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:42.130
introducing Doppler
effects and all that.

01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:43.740
It just messes things up.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:47.360
And this is more in
the spirit of answer B,

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.170
that you perform partial trace
and average over many states.

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:52.940
But let's now
pinpoint what I think

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.870
is intellectually the
most important one,

01:13:55.870 --> 01:14:00.310
the pure situation
where an atom is just

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:03.150
talking to a single mode.

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:22.650
So let us assume that we have an
atom which starts in the ground

01:14:22.650 --> 01:14:26.488
state, but now we
excite the atom.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:37.170
And we excite it
by a short pulse.

01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:38.850
And this can be
a pulse which has

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:41.860
a pulse aimed
between zero and pi.

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:45.860
And depending what
the pulse angle is,

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:50.660
it will admix-- we
have the ground state

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:55.210
and it will admix something
of the excited state.

01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:59.990
And in case of a pi pulse, we
have 100% in the excited state.

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:07.180
So our atomic wave
function is this.

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.470
The excited state--
let's just assume

01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:10.990
the photons are in resonance.

01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:14.500
We know how to deal with
off resonant lasers.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:19.370
So therefore, the
phase evolution

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:22.500
is e to the i omega naught t.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.150
But now, and this is
what coherence is about,

01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:28.910
there is a very specific phase.

01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:34.370
And this phase phi
comes from the laser.

01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:38.320
If you excite the
atom with a laser beam

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.860
but it has a phase shift,
then the atomic wave function

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:48.080
is phase shifted because
every amplitude you admixed

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.520
into the ground state in
form of an excited state

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.190
was driven by the operator--
the dipole operator,

01:15:53.190 --> 01:15:55.500
e-- and e, the
electric field, has

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.120
the phase of the laser beam.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.230
Sure, there may be-- and kind
of all other trivial factors

01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:03.280
I've set to one here.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.730
But there is the phase of
the laser, which directly

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:11.850
is imprinted into the
phase of the wave function.

01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:12.350
OK.

01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:14.920
So this is what the
atom does-- what

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.310
the laser beam does to the atom.

01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:18.770
So we have now an atom
which is partially excited.

01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:21.420
And it carries is an imprint
of the phase of the laser.

01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:29.910
And now after the
laser pulse is over,

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:33.390
the photonic part of the
wave function is a vacuum.

01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:35.690
We have no photon in our cavity.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:44.040
And now we wait and we
allow spontaneous emission.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.320
And spontaneous
emission is nothing else

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.600
than the time evolution
with the operator I just

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.874
discussed with you.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:01.580
So after spontaneous
emission, well, one

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:04.800
is we know for sure the
atom is in the ground state.

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:22.820
Let me write down the result.

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.130
If we apply the
operator which couples

01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:31.330
to the electromagnetic
field, and we

01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:33.880
assume only
co-rotating terms here.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.070
Let's just neglect
counter-rotating terms,

01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:39.750
which can be-- which in
near-resonants are irrelevant.

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:43.230
What happens is we are now
propagating this wave function.

01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:47.610
And the ground state-- with
the ground state of the photon,

01:17:47.610 --> 01:17:49.670
does nothing.

01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:53.400
However, the excited
state with zero photon,

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.140
we discussed that excited
state with zero photon

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.800
will actually do
Rabi oscillation.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.290
Ground state with one
photon, excited state

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:01.500
with zero photons.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.470
And so we have now our
knowledge from the vacuum Rabi

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:08.050
oscillation that this part of
the wave function does nothing.

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:10.290
This part of the wave
function undergoes

01:18:10.290 --> 01:18:14.500
single photon vacuum
Rabi oscillations.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:18.860
And if we start out with the
superposition of ground zero

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.140
and excited zero, well, this
is a superposition principle

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:23.730
of quantum mechanics.

01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:27.480
We can just propagate this part,
and we can propagate that part.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.360
So what I suggest is when we,
really at the fundamental level

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.370
now, discuss
spontaneous emission,

01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:39.000
we allow this
part-- excited atom,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.500
empty cavity-- to undergo half
a vacuum Rabi oscillation.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.450
And then the excited state
is in the ground state

01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:52.710
and the photon state
has one photon.

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:55.100
It's a completely
coherent Rabi oscillation.

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.150
I just allow half
a cycle to evolve.

01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:05.320
And the result of that is, well,
nothing happened to this part.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.700
And the Rabi
oscillations have now

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.260
taken us to the
one photon state.

01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:25.390
And it has just
swapped excited zero

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:26.730
to ground state one photon.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:40.720
So let me write down something
which is really remarkable,

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:48.450
and then we discuss on
Monday-- next Monday--

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.130
we discuss how we would
really measure the phase.

01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:55.090
But just look at the two
expressions I've underlined.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:59.920
And this tells us
that the quantum state

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.650
of the atom as a two-level
system-- ground excited

01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:04.510
state with all the
phase factors--

01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:08.930
has been now exactly
matched on the quantum

01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:11.070
state of the cavity.

01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:13.140
So if you regard ground
and excited state

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:16.450
as a two-level system, every
quantum mechanical subtlety

01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:21.230
of the atomic system
has now disappeared.

01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:22.520
It's in the ground state.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:26.160
But everything
which was coherent,

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.070
which was a phase which was
interesting about the atomic

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:32.220
system, has been transferred
to the photon field.

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.101
Yes?

01:20:33.101 --> 01:20:35.887
AUDIENCE: Do you want to
have an alpha e there also?

01:20:35.887 --> 01:20:36.970
PROFESSOR: Oh yes, please.

01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:38.290
Thank you.

01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:41.035
When I said everything,
I meant everything.

01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:46.270
Yes.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.260
Yes.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:52.760
OK.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.530
So let me write that
down and then we

01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:56.275
have-- so this is what I meant.

01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:02.870
This is the most fundamental
aspect of spontaneous emission,

01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:11.020
that the quantum
state of the atom

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:15.140
has been perfectly matched.

01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:22.079
Perfectly mapped onto
the photon field.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:35.770
And the one thing we have
to discuss on Wednesday

01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:37.820
is the whole of the phase phi.

01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:46.520
Phi-- we started out by phi
being the phase of the laser.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.290
And if the laser is
in a coherent state,

01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:50.700
I will talk about on Wednesday,
in a homodyne measurement

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.100
we can measure phi to
any accuracy you want.

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:55.140
We can determine the
phase of the laser

01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.160
in a homodyne or
heterodyne experiment.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:02.220
This phase phi has been
now perfectly imprinted

01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:04.640
into a two-level
system for the atom.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.790
And now it appears mapped
into a two-level system

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.810
for the photons--
the two-level system

01:22:10.810 --> 01:22:13.990
between zero photons
and one photons.

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:16.830
But if we are now
doing a measurement

01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:19.910
either on the atomic system
or on the photonic system,

01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:26.500
we are limited in the accuracy
at which we can retrieve phi.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.730
And this is what we want
to discuss on Wednesday.

01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:32.735
And this is what I referred
to as the fundamental limit

01:22:32.735 --> 01:22:35.430
of spontaneous emission
because we have not

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:37.010
lost any coherence here.

01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:39.790
It's just if the phase
is only imprinted

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:42.810
in one particle--
one particle quantum

01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:45.320
physics sets us a limitation.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:50.141
Oh well, we can read
out the phase phi.

01:22:50.141 --> 01:22:50.640
OK.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.710
Any question?

01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:55.860
To be continued on Monday.

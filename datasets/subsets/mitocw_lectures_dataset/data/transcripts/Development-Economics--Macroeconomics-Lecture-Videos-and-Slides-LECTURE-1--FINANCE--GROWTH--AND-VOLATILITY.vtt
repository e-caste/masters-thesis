ROBERT TOWNSEND: The
logistics for the class.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.770
Unfortunately, we seem
to have run out a bit.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.870
So if you could share the
syllabus that you have.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.230
I'm actually not going
to go over it in detail.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.500
I do want to give you sort
of the big picture of what

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.040
we're doing.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.050
First of all, I'm
glad you're here.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.110
And I do want class
participation.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.400
There will be three problem
sets and a research proposal.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.060
The problem sets are
meant to be practice

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.520
for you just to make sure you're
working through the material.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.580
Some of you take field
exams, for example.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.020
So these problem sets are
meant to be practices for that,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.190
as well.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.860
It's really meant to help you.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.390
One of the problem sets is going
to focus on actually getting

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.930
your hands dirty with
the data, so to speak,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.580
and Whit's going
to help with that

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.370
and give you access to
the Townsend tie data.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.380
And we'll have a specific
project geared around that.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.160
It's really a research
class so, I would like you

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.680
to write a research proposal.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.180
Not exactly a paper--

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.110
it can be short.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.130
But the idea is
that hopefully as we

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.590
go through these
lectures, you will--

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.390
and I will try to
help this process--

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.120
you'll have ideas
about things you

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.670
would like to work
on, things where

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.940
you think the literature
is falling short.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.510
And you should begin to
sort of think about that.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.020
It's all too easy
in these courses

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.890
to think that taking a course
means memorizing the lecture

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.970
notes or learning
how to manipulate

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.860
as in a certain model,
and not thinking broadly

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.830
about next steps.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.260
You don't see faculty doing
the research, actually.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.730
I'm going to try to share with
you how literatures develop,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.930
compare and contrast different
styles, different attack

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.838
strategies.

00:02:41.838 --> 00:02:43.380
In fact, the lectures
are going to be

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.480
a blend between
overview material

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.213
and the usual detailed
analysis of specific papers.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.880
Because that's a big
part of the course,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.500
I want you to get
some experience

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.860
at trying to think about
things that way, as well.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.160
The syllabus does say
something about a midterm,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.480
which is basically the final
for my half of the course.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.180
This is joint with Abhijit.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.860
But my first gift to you is
that we're going to waive that.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.670
So there will be no final exam.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.440
And instead, the
emphasis is going

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.210
to be on the problem sets,
and the research proposal,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.680
and class participation.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.410
Before I forget to say,
the recitation section

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.020
is scheduled Thursdays.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.850
I had originally
thought it was Fridays.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.170
So we put To Be Determined in
all those recitation sections.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.990
And in fact, by this Thursday
noon-- just after this class,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.230
essentially--

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.620
you would have already had
your first recitation section.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.080
But it's just too
early, so we're not

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.540
going to meet on Thursday.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.600
But we will start in
earnest the following week.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.960
And if you start
looking at the syllabus,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.090
you will see that
there's a section

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.480
at the beginning on data, which
I've kind of already mentioned.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.170
There's a section at the
beginning on computation,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.329
and also on the GIS.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.040
So if you want to think about
those as tools or skills,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.870
we're going to have
some TA sessions going

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.690
over sort of some of the
computational aspects,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.840
for example, after the
lecture on Thursday.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.770
Though it will be obvious how
a computational recitation

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.930
section fits in.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.710
Now I recognize I don't
want to overdo this,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.850
but the more I've talked
to many of you, the more--

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.100
including yesterday,
actually, in some sense,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.440
and advising of second years--

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.050
the more I realized
that students like

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.710
you want to get trained
in computational skills

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.730
and methods, and so on.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.910
So we can have some
extra sessions.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.320
I'm in the busy--

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.640
in the process of setting up
extra computational sections

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.550
on how to solve
certain problems.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.235
We'll probably make up for the
lost TA session on Thursday.

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:19.860
And Whit, in fact,
is going to send out

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.700
an email to each of
you to try to work

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.280
on scheduling a backup time.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.740
So if we have some
extra sessions,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.040
we'll try to have as few
conflicts as possible

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.110
so you can come.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.560
So I guess the only thing I want
to say about the syllabus that

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.350
won't be obvious
from the lecture is

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.670
today is the introductory
class, and there's all

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.100
this supplementary material.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.580
And then on Thursday,
we'll start with Lecture 2.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.530
You'll get a dose of these sort
of micro-founded macro models.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.550
We're going to go
on to another sort

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.720
of new wave of those models
featuring limited commitment

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:20.460
and collateral constraints on
the growth TSP type issues.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:28.380
And then another section
focuses on basically versions

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.890
where there's costly state
verification, or moral hazard,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.850
or adverse selection.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.530
So you can compare and
contrast the implications

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.130
of having these different
financial underpinnings.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.160
Which you know is
complementary classes in macro

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.150
are also getting at
those same issues.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.680
Then we'll have sort of the
intermediate class on microdata

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.370
and building all the way
from household accounts

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.890
to national income
accounts, and then

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.130
move to actually using the
microdata for various tests

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.660
so that these models, full
insurance, in various ways,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.880
then with these
obstacles to trade

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.970
and so on throughout the class.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.020
So that's kind of the big
picture of the syllabus.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.490
Each lecture is pretty--

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.715
a lot of fun.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.340
And there's a lot of
material in there.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.170
The lecture notes are
meant, as I've said,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.040
to tie the material
together both in general,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.828
and in its specifics.

00:07:38.828 --> 00:07:40.370
Today is a little
bit of an exception

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.820
because it's just an
introductory lecture.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.330
I will try to have
all the slides posted.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.610
I'm not sure we managed
to get this thing posted,

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.700
but I'll do that.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.060
I'll try to get that
done right after class.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.190
Normally the slides will be
posted in advance of the class.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.930
So if you feel more comfortable
looking at material,

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.427
might facilitate asking
questions during class,

00:08:02.427 --> 00:08:03.260
which would be good.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.957
AUDIENCE: These
slides are posted.

00:08:04.957 --> 00:08:06.040
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Oh, good.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.720
Excellent.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.090
And most of the readings
are linked, not entirely

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.720
all of them.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:20.120
So it should be easy to
explore your special topic.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.640
Are there questions about
the logistics of the class?

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.190
And I'll hang around
a bit afterwards

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.150
to answer any specific
questions you might have.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:36.679
So finance, growth,
and volatility--

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.809
theory, data, and the
formulation of policy.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:44.550
You know, the course is
organized around these topics.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.791
There's so many ways
to think about this.

00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:55.365
Finance, financial access is a
very huge issue in development.

00:08:55.365 --> 00:08:57.470
You may be more used
to thinking about it

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.380
from a micro perspective.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.100
But we not only do the
micro, we do the macro.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.850
The idea is that somehow
finance helps people

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.140
with financial services.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.460
It may be alleviating
poverty, and in the context

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.200
of these general
equilibrium models,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.010
it has additional effects.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.210
So many countries
around the world,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.850
not just the World Bank
and other aid agencies,

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:31.920
are pushing, promoting,
advocating, financial access.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.790
There's new Gallup surveys
measuring this stuff

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.210
to try to get at inequalities
across countries,

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:46.700
to sort of push a
little bit the agenda.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.080
So that's finance and growth.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.290
I'm going to say
more in a second.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.230
Finance and volatility
sort of should

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:02.540
bring to mind the recent US
and worldwide financial crisis.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.230
And it pushes you seemingly in
exactly the opposite direction,

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.870
which is maybe the
housing market in the US.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.140
Maybe there was a
little too much effort

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.090
for middle or even lower
income households to own homes,

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:27.430
and that's led to certain
government agency financing

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.480
arrangements.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:36.720
And in any event, it clearly
was a financial crisis.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.590
And most of the regulations
deal with seemingly trying

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.460
to push us back toward more
restricted intermediation,

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.490
as if financial
access, and credit,

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.750
and financial
liberalization might,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.990
if not be a bad thing,
maybe go too far.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.510
Well, we're going to try
to be writing down models

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.680
that think about not only
each of those separately,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.375
but to some extent,
having it on the same page

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:10.625
to try to get at that tension.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.310
And actually growth is in
there with finance and growth.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.210
Growth and volatility is
another quote bilateral

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.770
pairing if you wish.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.540
There's some idea that
finance causes growth,

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.730
but growth does not
come without volatility,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.200
leaving the question
I just raised

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.260
about finance and volatility.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.990
So let me sort of
give you a sense

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.510
of each of these sub-pieces.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.610
Finance and growth,
well, here's the story,

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:51.420
and I think it's pretty well
accepted by these three papers,

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.900
for example, that
are very much cited,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:01.490
King and Levine, Rajan and
Zingales, and Ross Levine.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.090
You can read the
abstract, but basically,

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.560
let's pick out a
few things here.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.020
Finance and Growth,
Schumpeter Might be Right.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.690
Cross country evidence that
financial systems promote

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:20.710
growth, that the levels
of financial development

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.250
are strongly associated
with per capita GDP growth,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.910
and capital accumulations and
improvements in efficiency

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.230
like TFP.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.070
But furthermore, there seems
to be causality in the data,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:40.060
that predetermined level
of financial deepening

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.540
or development are associated
with subsequent higher

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.130
rates of all these good things.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.540
Rajan and Zingales come
at it in a related way.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.460
They're basically saying
that industrial sectors that

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.920
are more in need
of external finance

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.560
due to the nature
of the business

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.310
develop disproportionately
faster starting

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.900
from a lower level in countries
where the financial systems are

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.470
liberalized or more liberal
than in other countries.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.050
And they're worried about
causality and so forth.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:26.620
And Levine's review, Finance
and Growth, Theory and Evidence,

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.900
the summary in the abstract
with qualifications

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.030
to follow from him.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.000
Countries with better
functioning banks grow faster,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.590
but however, it
doesn't seem to matter

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:43.560
whether it's bank-led finance
or stocks or equity markets.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:50.520
He tries to cover the
literature on simultaneity bias,

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.240
and so on.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.940
So Levine also points
out the importance

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.750
of this question
and the importance,

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.360
therefore, to research.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.910
And I must say,
in these slides I

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.900
tried to indicate where there
were quotes, but at some point

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.700
you may find it
hard to tell what

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.960
was the author's statement,
which is quite clear here,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.990
versus my summary.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.840
But I wanted to see--

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.820
I didn't want you have
to take my word for it.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.370
I actually wanted you to
see what these guys are

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:32.450
saying in their papers.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.460
"Research that clarifies
our understanding

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.250
of the role of finance
and economic growth

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.370
have policy
implications and shape

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.470
policy-oriented research."

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.500
This is going to influence
the priority that policymakers

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.390
and advisors attach to reforming
the financial service sector.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.720
And so when this
empirical work shows

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.300
there is the connection between
finance and long-run growth,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.840
that basically advertises
the urgent need

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.530
for research on the political,
legal, regulatory, or policy

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.670
determinants of
financial development.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.790
Note he is not saying
that it's a done deal.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.230
And he has been one of
the lead contributors

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.230
to this empirical work.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.460
But he's saying, in
fact, there is much more

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.710
to do on the research side.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.860
Specific policy implications
are not immediate.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:34.910
It's not obvious how to go
from the general idea of policy

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:40.100
to the way that financial
systems actually work,

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.000
and in particular, the
way they are modeled

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.980
at the theoretical level.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.690
So you'll see this over and over
again in these lectures, which

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.380
is this--

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.100
and I try to bring
out both sides--

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:58.640
which is empirical work seems
to mesmerize, if not reassure

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.900
theoretical work with almost
no mention to the data

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.440
and often this gap in between.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.340
I'm going to try
to bridge the gap,

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.470
show you how the literature
is trying to bridge the gap.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.370
But it's kind of reassuring
and refreshing to see

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:22.730
Levine being so candid in this
rather famous review article.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.270
He says, "What do financial
intermediaries really do?"

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.910
Well, you can think about
producing information,

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:33.040
about investment possibilities,
or monitoring investments,

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.020
maybe corporate
governance is better

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.130
if they're somebody looking
at them, facilitate trading.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.960
Facilitate diversification
is important

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:51.300
when there's risk for sure and
the management of that risk.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.840
Financial systems at
a theoretical level

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.140
mobilize and pool savings and
generally ease the exchange

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.070
of goods and services.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.130
So changes in these functions
that are brought about

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:10.470
by, say, policy
changes could influence

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.240
savings and investment,
and therefore,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.109
have influence on
economic growth.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.680
Now, then you start to think
about what is he really

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.500
saying or not saying?

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.380
One thing that sort of
caught my attention--

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.130
and I was predisposed
to look for it--

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:33.310
is this distinction about
levels versus growth rates.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.960
So is his vision one
of steadily improving

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.460
financial intermediation on one
or several of these dimensions,

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.940
pushing levels of income
up, so that an expanding

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.190
improved financial
sector over time

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.860
is causing growth in
the sense that you

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.800
have ever-increasing levels?

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:59.740
Or is he saying that
a once-and-for-all fix

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.070
to the financial system, making
it go from a lower or higher

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:08.110
level, and no changes after
that have an implication

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:13.830
for sustained growth as
in quote, steady state?

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.830
Not clear from what he said.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.385
And we'll see models that take
both these tacts actually.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.670
There are other sort of
caveats when you think

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.630
about theoretical modeling.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.480
Are we talking about
technological improvement

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.890
in the sense of TFP?

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.710
Is that really what
improved intermediation

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.030
is supposed to be giving us?

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.170
But again, we should
maybe think also

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.400
about transitions or even
potentially poverty traps

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.240
if systems get stuck.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.100
Another caveat,
savings rates are not

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.855
monotone with
increases in return.

00:18:59.855 --> 00:19:01.480
I mean, for one thing,
in price theory,

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.410
just think about income
and substitution effects.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.780
One cuts against the other one.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:13.010
Or what about the
relationships between savings

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.810
and improved allocation of risk?

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.150
If you improve the
allocation of risk bearing,

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.240
then you don't need to
save as a buffer stock.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.460
So savings may actually
go down and not up

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.320
as a consequence
of improving one

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.585
piece of the financial system.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.980
And then he makes his
pitch for thinking about--

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.670
don't think broadly about
savings or especially credit

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:43.390
as an input.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.700
Think about actually
how the financial system

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.342
is put together.

00:19:47.342 --> 00:19:49.300
And we'll come back to
that, especially when we

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.250
get to the measurement part.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.580
Does finance cause
reduced inequality?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.080
He said in this review,
not necessarily.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.040
And he reviews
empirical evidence.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.070
There are theoretical models
that claim this to be true,

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:16.120
that the relationship is, say,
favorable to reduce poverty,

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.357
reduce inequality, and so on.

00:20:18.357 --> 00:20:20.440
But certainly, in some of
the theoretical models--

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.290
in some of them that
we're going to cover--

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.960
improved financial
systems, at least early on,

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.330
cause increases in inequality,
not decreases in inequality.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.130
Something along
the lines of what

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.915
Kuznets had in mind, actually.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.340
And then he just goes
through some empirical work

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.140
and doesn't come back.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.500
Not to belittle it, but
he does not come back

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.675
to this underlying tension.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:55.910
Volatility and growth.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.240
Let's see.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.000
Before we start thinking that
all the volatility we see

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.500
has something to do with finance
or unstable financial systems,

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.440
maybe we should try to
document better those sources.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:21.330
So this paper in the
QJE is a decomposition

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.150
of the sources of inequality,
looking in particular

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.500
at low income countries.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.650
Take it as a fact--

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.940
I'll show you a graph
momentarily from them--

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.960
that there is more volatility
in growth rates among low income

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.210
countries.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.910
And why is that happening?

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.870
Could be that poor countries
somehow or other end up

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.740
specialized in volatile sectors.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.990
Or it could be a
version of that,

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.400
they just have a lot more
quote, specialization.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.785
They're not terribly
diversified over a multitude

00:22:00.785 --> 00:22:01.660
of different sectors.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.220
Could be that poor
countries experience

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.640
more frequent or more
severe aggregate shocks

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.520
sort of from a macro
policy perspective.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.720
And it's even possible that
poor countries experienced macro

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.170
fluctuations that are somehow
correlated with the shocks

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:22.040
in which they're--

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.930
the sectors in which
they're specialized.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.890
So here's the picture.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:40.460
This is levels of per
capita GDP and the variance.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.730
Standard deviation
calculation, this morning,

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.340
sort of thinking
about this lecture,

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.100
I spooked myself a bit worrying
that it should have been

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.560
growth rates and not levels.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.370
But actually when
they do the analysis,

00:22:54.370 --> 00:23:00.250
they do a composition in
the growth of value added.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.820
Again, I can't do justice
to this paper other

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.040
than give you an overview.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:12.600
But what they're saying is that
the growth of GDP per worker

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.500
in country J, this object
here, is a weighted average

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.650
of the growth of GDP
in the various sectors

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.310
in which country
J is specialized.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:28.800
And these AJs are the
weights or the proportions.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.510
And then they write down a quite
plausible statistical model

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.200
that the growth of value
added GDP per worker

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:43.200
in sector J of country S has a
country S component, a sector J

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.580
component, and some residual.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.890
So that's kind of
the basic model.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:53.160
And what they do then is
a very clever, basically,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.890
variance co-variance
decomposition

00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:01.140
quantifying and answering
the questions that were

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.890
raised on the previous slide.

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:11.408
The answer is 60% of this
volatility is country specific.

00:24:11.408 --> 00:24:13.450
So I don't know how you
want to think about that.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.780
It's not even 50-50.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.260
More than half of it is somehow
a country specific phenomenon.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.690
On the other hand, there's a
very non-trivial residual 40%--

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:29.460
almost 50, say-- which
is due to the following,

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.960
namely diversification
is limited

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.400
in low income countries.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.150
And low income countries do
tend to specialize in sectors

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.370
that are relatively volatile.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.880
That sets aside
the issue of why,

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.380
and whether there are any
possible remedies, and so on.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.170
A Model in which
Volatility is Inevitable.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.660
This is one of Daron's
models with Zilibotti.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.830
It's a great paper.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:09.270
And the idea is simple,
but very clever,

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.090
which is basically there is
a fixed cost to opening up

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.190
a new sector.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.140
And at any moment
in time, of course,

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.000
you have a limited
amount of resources.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.500
So you've got to choose--

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.640
you can't literally
afford to do everything.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.320
You can only do a
subset of things.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.020
So you're naturally vulnerable
to shocks in technologies

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.120
that can't cover your--

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.970
that are not able
to cover your risk.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.000
Now within that there
are some policy issues

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.690
we might come back
to at some point.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.450
But for a while,
clearly, these countries

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.060
are going to just be more
volatile, because they're

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.450
less able to diversify.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.190
Then it gets a little more--

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.380
what should I say--

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.600
provocative.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.350
Which is, maybe
volatility is actually

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.510
not something you'd
like to get rid of

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.040
and eventually can
afford to do it.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.990
Maybe it's actually a necessary
ingredient for growth.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:22.260
In other words, if we come back
to the big motivation, the idea

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:26.970
that finance causes
growth, OK, let's do it.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.850
And finance and macro
stability, well, maybe you're

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.590
going to have the
downside of that,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.840
that there has to be some
instability if you're

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.640
going to get the growth.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.650
If you think this is
entirely provocative,

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.260
just think about
the mean variance

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.500
idea of holding assets.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.440
You don't get a
higher mean for free.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.050
Higher means come
with more risk.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.670
So we should maybe
take this seriously,

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.770
as did these authors.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:58.940
I think this is in the QJE.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.080
And they document
that countries that

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.810
have had occasional
financial crises

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.440
do grow faster on average.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:21.760
How did they measure
that basically risk idea?

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.680
Well, they don't want to take
a simple variance measure,

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.680
because that's like small
or big, left or right tail.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.430
It doesn't matter.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.847
They're trying to
get at a crisis.

00:27:31.847 --> 00:27:34.450
So their ideas look at
the growth of credit,

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:39.400
or actually quite negative
growth, when you have a bust.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.230
First, the boom, maybe
inching along, maybe a trend.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.150
Who knows how fast?

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:47.710
But occasionally, wham, you
get one of these episodes where

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.200
the bottom falls out.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.100
And I can't help but
say, it's a bit odd

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.780
that since the US had a
recent financial crisis,

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.090
everyone's kind of tearing
up all the old work

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:02.050
and starting over as if we
need a whole new agenda.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.980
Whereas, countries
throughout the world

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.970
for, Rogoff would
say, hundreds of years

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.460
have been experiencing
financial crises.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.160
So certainly we
should pay attention.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.750
Not to say something's
good or bad,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:17.440
but there's lots of
historical experience.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:23.550
So they look at the
skewness of credit growth.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.620
I always get the sign wrong,
but positive basically

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.570
puts the mass in the left tail.

00:28:32.027 --> 00:28:33.860
And they actually have
a little model, which

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.600
I'll come back to in a second.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.580
So here are some pictures.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:48.450
India versus Thailand, real
credit growth and GDP growth.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:59.420
So the dotted line is Thailand,
which way back to 1980,

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.000
was expanding its
financial system

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.600
as measured by real credit.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.050
And then this is the
famous, if not infamous,

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:14.570
infamous financial crisis
that started in July 2, 1997,

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.090
when the Bank of Thailand
realized it couldn't continue

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.940
to hold the exchange
rate because they

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:25.490
had forward commitments they
seem to have forgot about.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.800
And that spread, as you
know, to many, not all,

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.810
but many of the Asian countries,
not even nearby countries.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:38.540
I mean, Korea is not near,
but they too suffered.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.380
However, if you look
at the-- and India

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.850
did not have this crisis.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.430
And India has been
bragging a lot lately

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:50.390
how clever they were to be
conservative that they did not

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:55.520
suffer from the US
financial episode

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.670
the way some other
countries have had.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.040
But if you look at the big
picture, here at least,

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.360
up through 02, you can see
Thailand has kind of this

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.710
V-shaped drop, and then
it's right back on.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.380
My measurements show
that the growth rate was

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.070
only 4% after as opposed
to 5% or 6% before,

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.470
so maybe there was
a structural shift.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:23.270
But this little drop doesn't
affect the overall level,

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.480
India's level remains lower.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.310
So during this period,
country of Thailand

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.560
was one of the fastest growing
countries in the world.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.520
You hear a lot about
China now and, rightly so,

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.250
India actually, also.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.770
But this is a big--

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.600
and I didn't realize that these
guys had focused on Thailand.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.180
We have a lot more to say
about Thailand in the class,

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.750
but obviously we're not alone
in thinking about Thailand

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:54.380
relative to other countries.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.320
Now whether I agree with them
about the financial crisis is--

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.880
or that dip is-- another story.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.410
Now how does their model work?

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.990
Actually, the paper
uses this as motivation

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.480
and then goes on
to try to work out

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.500
how you would find
countries experiencing

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.950
these periodic financial crises.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.250
So the idea is it's a
credit constraint model.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.860
So there are
borrowing constraints

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.360
like collateral constraints.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:32.360
And if they were locked in
place without any leniency,

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:39.330
you'd have high return
businesses starved for credit.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.960
But what happens is people
begin to anticipate that

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.440
actually they can be more
generous in their lending

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.880
because of the moral--

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.180
so-called moral hazard problem,
which is the government's going

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.460
to bail them out--

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.890
so bail out the private sector.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.830
So this is sort of a
political economy story.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:08.640
There's kind of like a political
economy-driven boom-bust cycle.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:17.520
Now, again, I don't
have the equations here,

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.310
but the paper's online and you
can read through their model.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.290
So they're saying
crises are costly.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.220
They're associated
with bankruptcies

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.800
and a dead-weight loss.

00:32:37.052 --> 00:32:38.760
And it's true that
when a crisis happens,

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.730
you get this depressing
effect on new credit,

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.810
and on investment,
and hampering growth,

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.270
which is a big
conversation in the US,

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.930
and actually, to some
extent in Europe.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.560
And they're saying if
their model is right--

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.610
or they believe they're right--
that this sort of effect

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:07.120
is going to be larger in
countries where the contract

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:12.350
enforceability issues are
more severe like borrowing

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.280
constraints.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.610
On the other hand,
not too severe,

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.980
otherwise they won't get
this leverage effect.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.870
So then we come to
the trilogy which

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.490
is finance and volatility.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.740
We did finance and growth,
growth and volatility,

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.070
now finance and volatility.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:36.790
And I don't have too much
more to say about this other

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:40.600
than to offer the reminder
that that Acemoglu

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.440
paper and the
Ranciere et al paper

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.010
suggest that volatility might
diminish over time as countries

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.720
have higher and higher
level of output.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.060
But as I said at the
beginning, in fact,

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.810
not all these sort of--

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.250
it must be more than a
bunch-- it must be more

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:06.330
than the transitivity.

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:10.050
If A is associated with B, and
B is associated with C, than A

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.060
should be associated
with C. And in the data,

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.929
it doesn't go that way.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:17.159
So clearly there's something
being left out here.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:22.290
This paper, which I became
aware of more recently--

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:36.080
and they seem to find that, in
fact, deeper financial systems

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.270
are associated with
lower volatility.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.590
But I checked this
again this morning,

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.150
they also have in
the regression,

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:51.080
the levels of income and
the growth rates of income.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.540
So in other words,
they have to control

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.219
for the other parts
of the trilogy,

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:59.670
basically, and then
eek out this effect.

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:03.260
Countries that are poor are
often dependent on trade.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:07.850
There are problems when
exchange rates move.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.860
There are issues about
devaluations, and so on.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:15.940
So they kind of have to
control for all of that.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.380
And then offer the
suggestion that finance

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.480
might be a good thing.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.780
But believe me,
countries don't know.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.630
The IMF really
doesn't know either,

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:33.190
and they're very interested
in the state of the literature

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.040
and in further research
to try to find out.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.590
Because they have
client countries

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.480
who want to know what to do.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.870
They go to the IMF, for
example, to get advice.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:55.070
So then we come to this
sort of policy discussion

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.050
that's going on today.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:03.840
And to be candid, it
seems to basically

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.900
depart from this
literature, from both

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:11.550
the theoretical and the
empirical literature.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:15.330
Levine writes a new
paper now called

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:20.710
Regulating Finance and
Regulators to Promote Growth.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.020
It's like, well, we
got to fix the problem.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.630
We know the financial crisis
was caused by bad regulation,

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:31.870
so let's jump in and
regulate somehow or provide

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.160
the right incentives.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:47.390
So how important is it that the
operation of-- how important

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:49.250
is the operation of
the financial system

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.200
for an economic growth?

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.760
And which financial regulatory
reforms will improve

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.320
financial sector operations?

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.730
He's sort of assuming, in
some sense, an the answer

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:06.800
that the other literature is,
and his own review was sort of

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.280
much more equivocal about.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:25.880
This is another example,
this Thorsten Beck's work,

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:31.810
which is highly regarded,
I think, in policy circles.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:35.420
And the idea is to come up
with a financial possibilities

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.530
frontier.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.320
And again, this is
driven by the idea

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.690
that we're going
to give countries

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.940
specific recommendations.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.570
They want to know where
they stand relative

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:52.290
to other countries, and what, if
anything, they should be doing.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:53.090
So here's the idea.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:03.160
This is the, say, the financial
possibilities frontier.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.500
This country is in on it.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.980
So somehow they
should move up there.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:16.020
This country B actually
has a higher level

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.630
of financial depth than A.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.680
But rather than rest
on their levels,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.170
the idea is that if we knew
what this frontier was,

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.880
it would tell us
they're actually further

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.400
below the frontier than A was.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:35.070
They have more ground to go
to get up to that frontier.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:45.840
And then this will get your
eye here beyond the frontier.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.820
So the idea is that
some countries are just

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.040
basically too deep, and
they should pull back.

00:38:56.342 --> 00:38:57.300
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.437
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:38:58.437 --> 00:39:00.270
AUDIENCE: In this paper,
what sort of things

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.640
go on the x-axis?

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.150
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
so this is basically

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.660
a huge sort of cross-country
regression with tons

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.600
of x-variables.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.650
The next slide has--

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:17.810
gives you some sense.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:21.080
There are variables in there
to try to control somehow

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.560
for institutions.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:30.290
There are surveys of how easy
it is to conduct business

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.540
in these countries.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.670
There are other
things associated

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.020
with structural problems.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.595
There is even policy
stuff, although honestly, I

00:39:39.595 --> 00:39:40.220
don't remember.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:44.120
We can look it up and
see, sort of categorize

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.260
all the x-variables.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:58.180
Now, I'm somewhat sympathetic
to looking at data.

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:06.263
So we don't want to say this
is completely uninformative.

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.160
And I am sympathetic
with the idea

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.970
that knowing what has happened
to different countries

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.240
at different points in
times might kind of give us

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.290
pause, like leading indicators.

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.920
There's a whole group.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:30.780
Actually, I was talking to
Ken Singleton the other day,

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.450
and I don't think this
work is quite public yet,

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:39.860
but there the idea is he's in
finance and a very good person.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.170
And he's trying to
measure the risk premium

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.910
based on observed asset prices.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:51.110
And they seem to be showing that
when the risk premium is low,

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.670
that's when you
run into trouble.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:56.300
Now that might sound like
counterintuitive at first,

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:00.260
but the point is, if the markets
are saying, or understating,

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.770
the amount of risk, then you
can imagine the financial system

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.840
is just pumping too much money
into otherwise risky things.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.880
And that's when countries
run into trouble eventually.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.530
So it's good to have early
warnings, that's good.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:17.920
But that seems to me
the challenge here

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.800
is to get beneath the frontier.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:28.480
In fact, I find the whole
jargon a bit misleading,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.880
because there is a utility
possibilities frontier which

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.175
is like the bread and butter of
general equilibrium economics.

00:41:34.175 --> 00:41:37.705
One point is you can't
get beyond the frontier.

00:41:37.705 --> 00:41:38.830
Anyway, there's a question.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.620
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was going
to ask, in what sense

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.990
does he talk about frontier?

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:45.850
Because it sort of
looks from his graph

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:47.920
as if he was saying this
is the optimal level

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.420
of financial deepening for you.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.990
That's not what
a frontier means.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:53.888
So then he's talking
about pareto optimality.

00:41:53.888 --> 00:41:55.180
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No, that's me.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.780
So this is one instance
where my thoughts kind of

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:03.130
merged into his, so
I'm the one worried

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.270
about pareto optimality.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:08.980
AUDIENCE: So are there issues
with aggregation at that point,

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:12.325
if you're worrying about
utility possibilities

00:42:12.325 --> 00:42:17.440
frontiers and pareto
optimality and stuff?

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.250
ROBERT TOWNSEND: To construct a
utility possibilities frontier,

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.460
we need to specify the model.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.080
We're going to have to layout
preferences, endowments,

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:26.812
and technology.

00:42:26.812 --> 00:42:28.270
We're going to have
to take a stand

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:35.530
on possible imperfections in
the credit and financial system.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:39.400
And just say that
sometimes it will turn out

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:45.430
that despite limited commitment
or some information problems,

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.250
it's a well-defined notion,
and markets should allow

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.170
you to end up on the frontier.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:56.080
But there are other things like
pecuniary externalities, where

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.840
if there is no remedy,
then you could end up

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.610
off the frontier due
to an externality.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.570
So something close
to the same language

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:09.340
works, but if I'm
understanding you correctly,

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:13.760
they're not representative
consumer models, typically.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.180
They have all the
heterogeneity in them,

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.550
and there are issues
about whether there

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:22.390
is a pseudo representative
consumer that somehow

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:24.250
approximates the behavior.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:27.520
So those are key
issues in these models.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.703
And most of them don't
aggregate up that way.

00:43:32.703 --> 00:43:34.120
But on the other
hand, we can look

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.340
at the welfare implications.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:47.470
And finally,
there's this paper--

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.040
an IMF working paper--

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.660
on how to deal
with credit booms.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:57.760
And this seems to be a summary
of the current consensus.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.730
I hesitate to call it that.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:04.900
That credit booms, buttress,
investment and consumption,

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.880
they can contribute
to long run deepening,

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.930
but they often end up in costly
balance sheet disallocations,

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:17.880
and dislocations, and more
often than acceptable,

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.240
in devastating financial
crises whose cost greatly

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.360
exceeds the benefit
associated with boom.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:33.340
So this is the view somehow
that is pretty typical.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:37.120
And so you end up
with this sort of goal

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.660
to keep an eye on
financial liberalizations

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.090
to limit credit
expansion somehow,

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.280
although they don't
quite know how.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.000
And the menu of things
that they're looking at

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.920
is very Basile like.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.850
They're basically ad hoc
international best practice

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:56.500
statements.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.670
As if it were obvious how to
regulate the financial system.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:05.650
Those regulations are not coming
from fundamental considerations

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.830
of how credit markets
work, and how they interact

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.571
with the macro economy.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:21.110
So is there another way,
an alternative approach?

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.360
I guess it's
self-evident from what

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.640
I've been saying in this
introduction is to understand

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.820
something I'm going to refer
to short-handedly as Applied

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:36.920
General Equilibrium Development
Economics to understand

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.300
the unit of analysis at
which this can be applied,

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:46.490
and to clarify what that is
relative to other general

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.652
equilibrium models
in the literature.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.600
So this may be a familiar,
if shocking, picture,

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.060
so to speak, in the context.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.556
If you haven't seen
it before, this

00:46:00.556 --> 00:46:06.250
is a picture of a
village in India.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:11.730
We can enumerate the
household by their wealth,

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:16.060
order them by their wealth,
and look at these years

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:19.690
where panel data were gathered
in these so-called ICRISAT

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:20.680
villages.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.720
This is [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.250
And here you can see the
ups and downs of income.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.740
Idiosyncratic
aggregate risk, there's

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.200
not a lot of co-movement here.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.660
The peaks are covering
up the valleys behind it.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.680
Households are not having up
and ups and downs together.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.330
There's plenty of
risk in the system.

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:47.620
And this is how the
consumption picture turns out.

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.290
I often refer to this
in a shorthand way

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:53.370
as the Rocky Mountains
versus Kansas.

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.010
And Kansas is pretty boring.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:59.800
It's very flat.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.860
But what it shows you very
dramatically is that somehow,

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.510
some way, in these
village economies,

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:11.360
they have figured out a way
to smooth a lot of the risk.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.970
In fact, they come very close--

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:16.300
not totally there--
but very close

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.790
to achieving the
optimal allocation

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:25.090
of risk-bearing that
Arrow-Debreu and so on

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:28.990
have been talking about.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:35.520
Now don't dismiss this
as OK, OK, we're back.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.127
And thank God it's development.

00:47:37.127 --> 00:47:38.085
We're back in villages.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:44.940
The point is that you
can use this framework

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.510
and the data are available to
do this not just at the village

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:52.170
level, collections of villages,
regions in the country,

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:53.370
or even across countries.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.590
And every single one of
those things is done,

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:57.520
and there's a huge literature.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:01.380
So we know quite a bit about
the allocation of risk-bearing,

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:06.090
and in fact, where systems fail.

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:11.575
Here's another look
at sort of an economy.

00:48:11.575 --> 00:48:15.210
This turns out to
be another village.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.370
And it's about the
diversification issue.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.470
So if you could do all this
great ex post smoothing

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:26.010
somehow, you should
just specialize

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:29.880
in what you're good at,
and your asset holdings

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:33.570
might appear pretty specialized.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:37.170
And maybe the bulk
of your consumption

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.660
is determined ex post by
borrowing, and lending,

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.910
and gift-giving, and
whatever else they're doing.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:44.730
But no, not in medieval England.

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:49.040
They divided up their land
in an extraordinary way.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:54.990
A typical farmer would have
60 or 70 plots fragmented

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:56.970
throughout the village.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:02.700
This is also true in Bolivia,
up in Altiplano and so on,

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.350
running down
different elevations.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:12.010
So the point here is not
all economies are alike,

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.750
not even all villages are alike.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:16.660
And looking at
data in this case,

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.940
partly through this
institution, you

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.320
can see that the ex post
allocation of risk-bearing

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.410
must evidently be more limited.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:29.470
In this case, it took a
private information model

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:30.925
to try to explain that outcome.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:40.000
Again, to reassure you that
this is not just macro,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.393
it's macro development,
macro devo, devoted to macro,

00:49:45.393 --> 00:49:47.560
or I don't know, you can
turn that any way you want.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:54.190
Someone made a joke
once, if in the slides

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.540
you don't have a picture
of a villager or something,

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.530
then you're not really
a development economist.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:02.000
I actually took this picture.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.810
But so you got land,
labor, and capital.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.286
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.490
OK.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:14.050
So I love villages.

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:17.290
And the reason is, you really
don't have to make things up.

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:21.040
You can actually measure things
and get an approximate sense

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:27.700
of what the preference, the
endowments, and technology are.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.970
Preferences are a bit trickier.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:35.540
So that's the way the language
we use as general equilibrium

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.120
theorists--

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.070
preferences,
endowments, technology,

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.095
as I said in answer to
the earlier question.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.180
And then you can do
this kind of adding up.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:50.470
So this is like taking these
villages, the Thai villages,

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:55.060
and adding up all the
households in the village

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.248
with the financial accounts.

00:50:56.248 --> 00:50:57.790
We'll get to that
in a minute, that's

00:50:57.790 --> 00:50:59.920
the measurement part, the
midpoint of the course.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:07.030
And you can see in one region
near Bangkok, village output--

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.680
GDP, except it's not national--

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.600
is going down.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.500
In the other regions,
it's kind of going up.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.260
This is a second
panel, so to speak,

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.910
is where their savings is
put into real or financial

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:19.455
investments.

00:51:19.455 --> 00:51:21.080
And here you have
the balance payments.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.950
So it shouldn't be
too much of a stretch

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:28.740
to realize that if you
have the measurement,

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.680
you can indeed zoom
in and zoom out.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.870
You can go from households
out to the whole country,

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:36.660
and intermediate
steps in between,

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.230
and use these standard tools.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:40.710
In this case, we've
ended up with the tools

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:43.425
that international
economists use,

00:51:43.425 --> 00:51:45.300
I'm using them internally
within the country.

00:51:48.645 --> 00:51:50.520
But at least if the
measurement is in common,

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.080
we are allowed to do that.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.870
I'll just pause briefly
to talk about the data.

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.360
I've already
mentioned we have it,

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.240
and you should feel
free to use it.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.530
It's quite extensive.

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:05.123
It's 15 years worth of data.

00:52:05.123 --> 00:52:06.165
And some of it's monthly.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.940
It's both rural and urban.

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:16.730
Yeah, I'm in city
neighborhoods and spread out

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.650
throughout the kingdom.

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:25.340
This is zooming in and
zooming out, literally.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:30.170
So here you can see almost
like an aerial photo

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:34.010
with the village locations
where we collect data.

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:41.390
All the way over here you
can see zooming way out,

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:44.480
where it is basically.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:49.640
It's somewhat near Bangkok,
this particular sample site,

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.980
and this is sort of
the intermediate level.

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:57.410
Here we're plotting at
the level of provinces

00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:03.770
the wealth level, which is in
common with those two diagrams.

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.470
Well, we have this
extensive GIS system.

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:11.120
I've made a campaign of putting
all available secondary data

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.740
that I could get a hold of
over the years, a lot of it's

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.480
available through
Dataverse, Harvard MIT.

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:23.150
And we are in the
process of putting this

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:26.540
onto this common
GIS platform where

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:31.640
you can look at bank locations,
and factory locations, and road

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.500
networks, and compute
travel time, and so on.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.670
So one of the--

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:44.060
if you're interested, I can
have my GIS person maybe

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:49.790
have a special session and
show you a little bit about how

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:53.660
to use this system and
the kind of work that's

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:56.120
possible to do with it.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:56.820
It's coming.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.000
There isn't that much
work in economics

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.310
that has explicit general
equilibrium spatial modeling,

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:03.080
but it's coming.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:09.410
So it's a wide open and
interesting research topic.

00:54:12.042 --> 00:54:14.000
So what is this general
equilibrium development

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:14.500
approach?

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:18.680
Well, it's not just
individual maximization.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.630
It's not just
partial equilibrium.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:22.430
It's general equilibrium.

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:27.620
So things like the economy-wide
interest rate and wage rates

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:32.150
are very much on our minds.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.670
From a development
perspective, it's not just

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:38.900
the impact of some savings
account or improved credit

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:45.210
product on individuals, it's
about efficiency of the system.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.050
In other words, it's not
just on the credit side,

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.542
it's kind of on
the lending side.

00:54:50.542 --> 00:54:52.250
The money for lending
comes from savings.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:54.950
You have to think
about intermediation

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:58.760
and the flow of funds,
and judge efficiency

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:03.920
using this pareto criterion.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:09.980
It's not a foregone conclusion
what the best fitting market

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:11.660
or contract structure is.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:14.030
That's something that
comes out of the analysis.

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:17.630
That's why it's so good
to have the micro data,

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:20.320
because you can actually test.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.640
You could have village--

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.150
one village doing quite
well and a whole region

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.850
in another part of the
country doing terribly.

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.650
But we don't have
to guess or assume,

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:38.020
because we'll in the
course acquire some tools

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.460
for doing that analysis.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:45.130
So clearly it's not the ever
varying Washington consensus,

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:48.040
which is for liberalization
and now for regulation.

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:50.860
Look at Europe, just going
back and forth not knowing

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:51.490
what to do.

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:52.670
The debt's too high.

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.040
We need to restrain it.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:54.680
Oh, my God!

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:55.555
We need the stimulus.

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:01.885
So we think through those
things at the same time

00:56:01.885 --> 00:56:02.635
with these models.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:12.180
And I don't mean to be
saying it's all about the US,

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:12.780
obviously.

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.700
It's about India.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:15.160
It's about the Philippines.

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.520
It's Kenya where they are
allowing cell phones as

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.630
opposed to Thailand where
they're effectively ruling it

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:22.710
out.

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:25.920
So those are the debates
that are happening

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.620
in developing countries.

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.620
You've got some stuff on the
website if you want to see.

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:33.540
I will be tracking
Thailand a lot,

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.850
but I've also been
writing a book on Mexico.

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:39.840
And you'll see me
throw in some slides.

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:43.200
I think the danger here is
you see too much Thailand,

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.630
and then you begin to think
it's all about Thailand.

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:48.510
Well, A, I'm not the only
one worrying about Thailand.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:53.760
But B, seeing other countries
and seeing the same analysis

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.580
done in two different
countries really brings

00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:57.540
this stuff to light.

00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:00.420
So that's why
Mexico is sometimes

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:01.440
paired in these slides.

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:07.230
So the goal here
is to explain, yes,

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:09.540
to understand what's
out there, but it's also

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:16.530
normative to try to come
up with policies that

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:18.780
allow more inclusive
financial systems

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.520
if the data indicate that.

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:24.360
But also to think about
the overall efficiency,

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:28.500
and to think about market
design and optimal regulation.

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.870
There is some logic in
all of this, basically.

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:37.140
You assume something
or several things,

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.330
you go out there and test.

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:40.260
It may fit.

00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.150
If it does fit,
you've understood

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:45.180
the financial contracts
and the imperfection.

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.340
If it's full information
for risk sharing,

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.230
then we have this
wonderful standard

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:52.335
and it's clear, at least at
the village level in India,

00:57:52.335 --> 00:57:56.100
you shouldn't be intervening
with particular households.

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.840
On the other hand,
if you reject,

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:03.000
maybe it's due to a moral
hazard problem, the problem

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.040
that people don't repay
and they walk away

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.930
from their investments.

00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:08.570
The data can help indicate that.

00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:11.870
Now then the question is,
is it still constrained?

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:13.860
Maybe it's second best optimal.

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:19.960
Maybe this first best
standard is an illusion.

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.450
But maybe when it's
second best, things

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:26.290
like allowing more goods to
play the role as collateral,

00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:30.370
like changing the legal
system, those kinds of reforms

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:33.550
might be indicated.

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:44.480
Now there is a lot of general
equilibrium literature

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:48.350
to sort of contrast with this
general equilibrium development

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.360
point of view.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.880
This goes way back
to the foundations

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.290
of general equilibrium.

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:58.820
Herb Scarf, and his
students, Chauvin and Wally,

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:01.760
that's called Applied
General Equilibrium

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.010
and does not allow uncertainty.

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:06.230
This type of modeling
is still used,

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:08.160
although it's in
kind of pockets.

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:11.210
It's used within the World Bank.

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:15.090
All our climate guys over
here at MIT use this stuff.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:18.740
That's the basic conceptual
framework, the CGE model,

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:23.060
that lies behind these
conclusions about how

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:26.870
climate change is going
to influence the economy.

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:31.670
So it is quite widely used.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:34.190
And there's some
great review articles.

00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:36.470
And it does have
some key strengths.

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:49.590
Computable General
Equilibrium has this strength

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:53.520
of drawing on the national
income and product accounts

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.330
and input-output matrices.

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.520
That's basically the successor
to the Supply General

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.630
Equilibrium.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.570
And then we have the more
macro-like, if I could say

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:08.460
so, Dynamic Stochastic
General Equilibrium models.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:12.750
So you associate this with
Prescott, for example,

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:15.070
and real business cycles.

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.130
So it's great on dynamics.

01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:20.470
It's great in being
very clear about shocks.

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:22.830
However, we anticipated
this, it largely

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:27.390
assumes a
representative consumer.

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:31.440
As if you had complete markets
that allow this kind of Gorman

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.540
aggregation with
certain preferences.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.240
So in that world,
you're not going

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.400
to have redistributive
wealth effects.

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:46.320
And it is kind of
interesting in sort

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.630
of a history of
thought point of view,

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.570
that despite the early
battles in macro,

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:58.380
this DSGE stuff basically
took over, and largely

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.130
without modeling the
financial sector.

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:06.290
And so I think that's why people
felt rather flat-footed when

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:08.750
the financial crisis came along.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:23.580
So there is stuff, sort of
dynamic general equilibrium

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:29.526
models that started with
Bernanke and Gertler.

01:01:29.526 --> 01:01:31.680
I keep looking at Alp
over there because I

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.240
know that we feature that
just now in the macro lecture.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:43.400
It is kind of built
on micro underpinnings

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.570
and a certain view of a
costly state verification

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.790
as an underlying imperfection.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:52.820
It does feature a lot
the role of credit

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.470
and a financial accelerator.

01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:00.130
But largely, with
some exceptions

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:07.520
I'll say momentarily, this
stuff is an aggregate of model.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.610
And it's quite
elaborate as a model.

01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:11.930
You have the Central Bank.

01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:13.700
You have households,
entrepreneurs,

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.160
but entrepreneurs are somehow
different from retailers.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.010
And retailers are somehow
different from capital goods

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:20.690
producers.

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:25.970
And certainly in early versions
of Christiano and Eichenbaum,

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:31.280
and so on, they actually
only look at the aggregates

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.540
generated by that model.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:37.590
They never they never assign
these sectors to data.

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:38.550
It's not tested.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:42.730
It's not part of the way
they're doing business.

01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:45.300
So maybe they don't need to if
they get the aggregates right,

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:50.160
but this is a picture of India.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.720
This stuff is used
by central banks.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.090
If you want to
see one in Brazil,

01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:58.625
it's called samba or something.

01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:00.000
I'm not sure if
that's the music.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.260
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.860
They have one.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:06.900
It's on the reading list.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:10.710
But I must say, in a bit
more optimistic vein,

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:14.520
things are starting
to come together.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.320
Hsieh and Klenow wrote
papers on India and China

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.270
on the distribution
of firm size.

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:23.528
And now it's almost
becoming standard

01:03:23.528 --> 01:03:25.320
that if you write down
one of these models,

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.560
you have to look at the
implication for firm size.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.380
Or some key parameter
in the model

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.760
is going to be calibrated
against the distribution

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.720
of firm sizes in
the US, for example.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.760
Just like Rajan and
Zingales kind of

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.850
started that research path.

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:47.790
So the latest Larry paper
definitely uses that,

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.310
and uses other
financial variables,

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:53.430
starting to look at
bankruptcy, and so on.

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.710
So one can be
somewhat optimistic

01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:59.250
that these seemingly
similar, in the sense

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:02.070
of general equilibrium,
but obviously diverse

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:07.620
attacks on how the financial
system work, or isn't

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.070
even necessarily model.

01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:11.190
They're kind of coming together.

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:15.390
And I think the place where
it arguably has come together

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:22.290
the fastest, and where we really
quite understand quite a lot is

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:25.590
in development economics.

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:32.220
And it features the measurement
at the household level

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.570
using corporate accounts.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:37.630
This is again the midpoint
of the series of lectures.

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:41.070
So we can get at TFP,
productivity change, wealth,

01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:43.980
rates of return,
treating households

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.740
just like the firms are
treated in corporate financial

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.220
accounts, income statement,
balance sheet, statement

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.090
of cash flow.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.810
Occupation choice is a key
ingredient in these models,

01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:00.660
because typically in
developing countries,

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.630
you see households
making transitions.

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:05.040
They used to be in agriculture.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:11.010
They set up a firm, maybe
become wage earners.

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:15.960
So that's a big part of
almost all of the models.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.510
There's tests of these
micro underpinnings.

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:21.240
I listed a few papers here.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:26.470
There's some warning that
underpinnings do matter,

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:28.450
that things are rare.

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:30.900
It's rarer that one
kind of underpinning

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:35.220
is a stand-in for
the other ones,

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:38.910
or at least it does not
always work out that way,

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:41.760
and the Matsuyama paper
is a pretty good reminder.

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:48.660
Well, actually he more says
things aren't monotonic.

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.810
And Boyd and Smith
and Gertler and Rogoff

01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:55.110
have examples of how
these underpinnings really

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:59.885
matter to the macro or
regional phenomenon.

01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:08.050
So part of-- part of the
agenda here is measurement,

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:11.080
and it's not just measurement
at the household level.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:17.380
It moves from the national
income accounts and balance

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.660
sheets, and so on, to
differences of balance sheets,

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:24.080
so it's essentially
the flow of funds.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.640
So if there's one thing that
seems obvious, but actually

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.490
remains challenging,
is that if you

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:33.350
wanted to model the financial
system in a country,

01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:35.440
you should look at the
flow of funds data.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.230
Because that really tells
you, at least at the level

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:42.160
of aggregation that is
presented in the public data,

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.920
what financial instruments
are actually used,

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:51.280
who's taking the debtor-lender
position in those instruments.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.210
You can certainly see
very well with flow

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:56.950
of funds, the
movement in and out

01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:59.620
of the formal financial system.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.530
Because that's where the
measurement is the best,

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:05.740
actually, because banks
have to report stuff.

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.690
They try desperately
to hide a lot,

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:13.420
but at least flow of funds in
and out of the banking system

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:19.240
is available even for
low income countries.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.640
Turns out the IMF
is loaded with data.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.460
People at the fund
haven't been using it.

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.460
But now it's sort
of an awakening

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.040
that there's a lot of
things that could be

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.110
done with flow of funds data.

01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:33.650
And I'm in touch
with those guys,

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:38.770
so potentially if
you're interested

01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:43.780
in a particular country, get you
the latest flow of funds data.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.850
You have to keep
an eye on things,

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:48.370
though, in the sense
of the informal sector

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:52.150
is typically not measured,
but in these countries

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:57.410
can be really key, especially
in low income countries.

01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:58.910
And unfortunately,
you don't usually

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:02.140
get the geography,
although we've

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.600
had some projects we've
encouraged with Mexico

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.140
and are kind of
working with Brazil

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.690
to get the geography in there.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.720
We'll come back to this
flow of funds diagram,

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.300
but it basically makes the
point that you can talk about--

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:38.290
Here is actually a village
again with the transactions

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:44.920
of the village with a
not-for-profit corporation,

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.859
financial corporations,
non-financial corporations,

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:50.270
and government, and so on.

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:54.200
So just to belabor
the point again,

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.970
the way that you measure
in principle is common.

01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:01.210
And then you can zoom
in and out depending

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:07.060
on what you think might be
key, and take a look at orders

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.380
of magnitudes of things.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.399
You may not realize it,
but I'm basically following

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:14.600
the order of the syllabus.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.590
So after we get through
the measurement part,

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:19.490
including flow of funds,
we'll talk specifically

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:26.300
about micro level tests
of insurance, of credit.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.250
This is too
complicated for today,

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:31.490
but we'll get into these
obstacles to trade,

01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:34.700
and how to test whether
it's a moral hazard problem

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.090
or adverse selection problem.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:41.569
Test incomplete markets
against information

01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:44.720
constrained markets.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.189
This is a lot of material,
and I'll be mindful of that.

01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:51.770
I'll at least try to give
you some examples of how

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:57.170
this analysis is
being conducted.

01:09:57.170 --> 01:10:01.910
And we end up back with Applied
General Equilibrium Development

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:06.890
Economics, which is going to be
you know what we're going to do

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:09.980
in class starting on Thursday.

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.060
We're going to start with--

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.360
we've already got the reduced--

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.740
the patient choice models.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:26.330
There are several Banerjee
Newman, [INAUDIBLE],,

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:30.210
Lloyd-Ellis and Dan
Bernhardt, Aghion and Bolton.

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:49.424
The key parameters of the
financial underpinning.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.910
We'll for the second
lecture of the class,

01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:13.540
we will be sort of having all
the ingredients, the micro,

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:16.690
the estimation,
and the simulation.

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:20.590
This is another sort of
genre in the literature.

01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:23.080
This is financial--
this one takes

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.280
the expansion of the
financial system as exogenous.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.700
This one tries to
make it endogenous.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.550
Key contributors
are, say for example,

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:36.970
Greenwood and Jovanovic,
[INAUDIBLE] and Smith.

01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:41.020
Entirely theoretical models
basically in the style

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:45.830
of Ross Levine, taking a stand
on how intermediation works,

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:48.440
showing, for example, that
inequality might go up

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.590
before it goes down,
but not taken seriously

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:56.510
enough in the sense of going to
the data, which is what we'll

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:58.190
talk about next time.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:05.420
I said quite a bit during
the lecture about policy

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.580
and assessing policy.

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.940
So Thailand, for
example, as you saw,

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:15.320
had financial deepening
going on, and at times,

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.890
rather substantial
financial deepening.

01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:22.670
Once we have these models
and we've kind of estimated

01:12:22.670 --> 01:12:24.500
or calibrated the
key parameter, we

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.090
can do these
welfare experiments.

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:32.270
We can actually say, who
benefited, and for that matter,

01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:37.660
who lost from the expansion
of the financial system?

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:41.800
The beneficiaries are like
these poor credit constrained

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.580
households that don't have
access to the financial system.

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:47.920
But over time, as
they exogenously

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.580
are allowed to
enter that system,

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:55.030
they have huge increases in
their welfare and well-being.

01:12:57.610 --> 01:13:00.070
Why does somebody lose?

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:05.410
Well, that growth of enterprise
means increased employment.

01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:08.360
It's pressure on wages.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.050
In the model and in Thailand,
the real wage eventually

01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:13.090
shoots up rather dramatically.

01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:15.550
That increases the
cost of doing business

01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:22.160
and the profits of
entrepreneurs can drop.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.330
So this is the wonderful part.

01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:29.220
Now, I don't mean to say
this model is wonderful.

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.010
It has a lot of
limitations, which I will

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:32.870
share with you on Thursday.

01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:35.990
But what's wonderful about
it is that you can actually

01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:40.490
go through these distributive
welfare gains and losses

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:43.250
types of calculations.

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:48.210
This one with endogenous
financial deepening

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:50.610
comes back to my comment
on the slide which

01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:54.570
had India versus Thailand,
and I said something obscure

01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:58.320
about I had another view of
what happened in Thailand.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:04.110
Well, part of that growth
was preceded by a real flat.

01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:07.560
GDP went basically flat-lined.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.700
And what was going on?

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:14.820
Well, they had certain interest
rate restrictions on deposit

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.740
rates and lending rates.

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:19.250
There was an oil shock.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:23.170
Prices were going up,
and money was flowing out

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:25.920
of the financial system.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.080
The banks ran into trouble.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.840
The government essentially
took them over,

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:34.450
and the economy goes flat-line.

01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:36.770
You should worry about this.

01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:40.720
It's not necessarily the
case that quote, regulation,

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.250
or in this case,
national-- almost close

01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:47.200
to nationalization
of the banking system

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:52.550
is necessarily the way to deal
with the financial crisis.

01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:54.430
Now how on earth are
we able to model this?

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:56.330
It's really quite simple.

01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:59.680
We just create a wedge
in the original Greenwood

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.585
and Jovanovic model,
which is the spread

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:04.210
between the borrowing
and lending rate.

01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:06.160
And we say when the more the--

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.340
sorry, this sounds
very market-oriented--

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:13.210
the more the government
does, the more resources

01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:17.500
gets squandered, and
that inefficiency wedge

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.920
kind of increases over and above
the cost of intermediation.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.570
And at the calibrated
parameters,

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:27.190
that's actually enough for the
model simulation to go flat.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.860
But likewise, then we can
liberalize the system, which

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.140
Thailand did, and back out.

01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:50.120
And then we'll go way
beyond these two the lecture

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.920
next Tuesday.

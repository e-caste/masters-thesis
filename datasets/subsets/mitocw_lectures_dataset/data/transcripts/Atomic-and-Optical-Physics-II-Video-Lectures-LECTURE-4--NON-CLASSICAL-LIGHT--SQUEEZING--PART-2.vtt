00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.290
PROFESSOR: Well, we
are in the middle

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.850
of something really interesting.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.200
We are talking about squeezing.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.200
We are talking about
non classical light.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.540
And today, I sort of
want to wrap it up.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.060
And I think it will really
be an exciting class.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.780
But before I continue
with the material,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.800
I want to address a question,
which actually came up

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.410
in discussions with
several of the students.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.340
And this is, I realize
that some people said, OK.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.890
Everything makes sense.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.510
But what are we plotting?

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.600
What is really squeezed?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.170
Are we squeezing in
the spatial domain?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.780
Are we squeezing in
the temporal domain?

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.840
So the plots look wonderful,
with these ellipses

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.960
and the circles.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.870
But, what is it really
we are doing here?

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.140
So let me address that.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:37.760
First of all, we are talking
about a single harmonic

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.100
oscillator.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.140
We showed that the
[INAUDIBLE] equations

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.890
can be reduced to a bunch of
harmonic oscillator equations.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.630
One for each mode.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.400
And now we are
talking, today and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.400
in the previous few classes,
about one single mode,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.710
about one harmonic oscillator.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.760
And the harmonic oscillator
has canonically variables

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.040
of momentum and position.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.479
But this is just to make
a connection for you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.919
with something you have learned.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.000
What we are talking about is
a single harmonic oscillator,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.010
which is one single mode of
the electromagnetic field.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.650
So maybe let me draw
a cartoon for that.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.880
So let's assume
we have a cavity.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.950
We have an electromagnetic wave.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.700
There is propagation,
where it's e to the ikz.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.300
There is transverse confinement.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.580
Maybe there is a
Gaussian e to the minus

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.350
x squared plus y squared over
sum [INAUDIBLE] parameter.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.430
All of that is simply
the spatial mode.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.980
And we just take that for
given because we're not

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.260
solving the spatial
differential equation.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.400
All we are doing is we are
looking at this one mode.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.720
And the two degrees
of freedom is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.230
that this mode can have a
certain number of photons.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.520
It's the amplitude.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.850
And the second one is you
can see the temporal phase.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.930
It can be a cosine omega t.
it can be a sine omega t.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.040
It can be a superposition.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.080
But whatever we are talking
about is in this mode.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.730
There is nothing happening
in the spatial domain.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.230
They're just asking, what is
the oscillation in this mode?

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.070
The whole mode does
what it should.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.100
It has a prefect, of
which is the amplitude.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.440
And it has a temporal effect
of which we factor out.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.710
And this is what we
are talking about.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.500
Let me be a little
bit more specific

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.780
and say, that when we
are plotting things,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.240
we are plotting the Q
representation, the phase space

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.220
representation of the
statistical operator,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.640
which is simply describing
this single mode

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.740
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.870
And by performing the
diagram matrix elements,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.580
we obtain the Q distribution.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.320
In that case, we
have the vacuum.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.620
We have a displaced vacuum,
which is in coherent state.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.700
And our x's are, from
the very definition,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.990
in the complex plane
with a real part

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.391
of the imaginary part of alpha.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.210
However, we can also
define [? the  Veetner ?]

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.060
distribution, which is another
phase based distribution.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.930
It's almost the same
as the Q distribution.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.770
It's just this little
bit smeared out

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.750
by h bar because of
some commutators.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.660
But nothing you
have to worry about.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:14.560
In that case, the
projection of the W function

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.520
on the vertical
axis, on the y-axis,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.925
is the momentum wave
function squared.

00:05:29.735 --> 00:05:36.425
On the x-axis, it is the
spatial wave function

00:05:36.425 --> 00:05:38.020
squared of the
harmonic oscillator.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.590
So therefore, we
may sometimes think,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.440
when we have a distribution
here, we project it.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.490
And we see what is the
momentum distribution.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.510
Or what is the
spatial distribution

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.430
of the mechanical
harmonic oscillator.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.170
Which is analogous,
which is equivalent,

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.340
to the one mode of the
electromagnetic field

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.080
we are using.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.520
I know it may help
you to some extent

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:17.470
to think about the P and Q.
But it may also be misleading

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.540
because it gives you the
impression something is moving

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.240
with a momentum
P, in real space.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.480
Let me therefore
emphasize what are

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.640
the normalized forms of P and Q.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.750
If I do the symmetric and
anti-symmetric combination

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:48.400
of the annihilation
and creation operator,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.730
I over squared root 2.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.230
I call those a1 and a2.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:11.740
And they are nothing
else than Q and P

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:20.560
normalized by the characteristic
momentum of spatial coordinates

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.560
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.460
So what is important
here is that a1 and a2--

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.840
forget about P,Q now.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.280
They are equivalent.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.250
But for the
electromagnetic field,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:41.670
a1 and a2 have a very
direct interpretation.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:47.180
They are called the two
quadrature operators.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.160
And what I mean by
that becomes clear

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.430
when I use the
Heisenberg representation

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.610
for the electric field.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.530
And I'm here using
the formula which

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:12.780
is given in the book of
Weissbluth, in page 175.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.516
Some pages copied
from this book have

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:17.160
been posted on the website.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.470
So we have our
normalization factor,

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:30.950
which is related to the electric
field of a single photon.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.402
We have the polarization factor.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.309
But now we have an
expression which

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:50.710
involves the quadrature
operators, a1 and a2.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.990
Just to be specific, we
are not in a cavity here.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:04.090
Therefore, we have propagating
waves cosine (kr) sine (kr).

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.600
But you can also immediately
use a similar expression

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.970
for the case of a cavity.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.040
Let us specify that r equals 0.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.670
And then we realize what the
two quadrature operators are.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:33.290
a2 is the operator which
creates and annihilates

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.560
an electromagnetic
field, so to speak,

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.670
photons, which have
an electric field.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.970
Which oscillates
as cosine omega t.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:52.756
And a1 is the quadrature
operator for the sine omega t

00:09:52.756 --> 00:09:53.255
component.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.590
So therefore, if you simply
analyze the electric field,

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.830
what is cosine omega 2 is
related to the a2 quadrature

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:06.740
operator.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.270
The sine omega 2 oscillation
is related to the a1 quadrature

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:11.770
operator.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.850
So life would be
easier, but more boring,

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:23.330
if you could create a
pure cosine, or pure sine

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.640
oscillation of the
electromagnetic field.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.210
But you can't because a1
and a2 do not commute.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.730
And there is an
uncertainty relation

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:39.750
that delta a1 times delta a2
is larger or equal to 1/2.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:45.189
And we have the equal sign
for coherent states alpha.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.250
So therefore, if we look
at the electric field,

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.810
you know, everything
moves around

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.390
periodically in r because
it's a traveling wave and t

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.270
because it's an
oscillating wave.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:08.490
So let's not confuse things
with simply peak r equals 0.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.730
We've already done that.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.500
But now let's peak t equals 0.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.980
That t equals 0.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.370
The sine omega t is 0.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:24.360
And therefore, the distribution
for a2, the expectation value,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.330
and the variance for the
quadrature operator, a2,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.360
can be simply read off by
looking at the electric field.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:48.530
So, in other words,
at t equals 0,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.010
the electric field,
which is obtained

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:56.800
by projecting our quasi
probabilities on the y-axis,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.110
gives the expectation
value for a1

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:11.205
and the variant,
delta a1 squared.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.190
Somebody says 2.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.811
That t equals 0.

00:12:20.811 --> 00:12:21.310
Yes.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.030
Yes.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.740
And now, if you want to see what
the other quadrature component

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.780
is, well.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.790
We just wait a quarter period
until the sine, which was 0,

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.740
is maximum.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.650
And the cosine omega t is 0.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:53.360
So therefore, it's
pi over 2 omega,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.465
using the projection on
the y-axis, gives us a1.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.725
And delta a1 squared.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.780
Or, alternatively, we
don't need to wait.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.910
We can do t equals 0.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.685
And we can project
onto the x-axis.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.100
Let me just throw few
things into this diagram.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.750
If you had a classical
motion, which

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:59.220
would simply be cosine omega t.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:11.280
Then that would mean, if
you had a motion which

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:21.100
where only cosine
omega t-- yes, it

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.590
would be a point on the y-axis.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.310
However, classically
we can never

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.180
have something which
is just cosine omega t.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.800
The point has to
blurred into a circle.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.400
This is the coherent state.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.940
So this coherent state has
now-- let me just call it 1,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.870
for the sake of the
argument-- the point

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.980
would be the
classical oscillator.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.810
It is just cosine omega t.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.390
Everything is deterministic.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.310
No uncertainty.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:54.110
No nothing.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.450
Of course, it means that
the time of evolution,

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.920
it goes in a circle.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.170
But this is what everything
does in an harmonic oscillator

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:07.540
when time evolves into the
e to the i omega t factor.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.260
So let's not get
confused with it.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.405
Let's just look at t equals 0.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.400
And we input [INAUDIBLE]
if r equals 0,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.790
the classical
oscillator is one point.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.520
But now, we have a spread here.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.790
This says that trying
to mechanically

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.050
the amplitude of the
cosine omega t term

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.236
is not entirely false.

00:15:31.236 --> 00:15:32.360
It's not [INAUDIBLE] sharp.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.010
There are fluctuations.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.760
And in addition, we have
ellipse in this direction,

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.900
which we project
onto the x-axis.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.490
And this tells us what the
distribution in our ensemble,

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.110
in our kind of
mechanical ensemble,

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.500
is for the amplitudes of
the sine omega t motion.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.910
So the best we can do
is try to mechanically--

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.350
if you want to have something,
which is really just cosine

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.280
omega t.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.500
We have to squeeze it, that the
cosine omega t amplitude is now

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.430
extremely sharp.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:14.410
But the sine omega t
amplitude in the ensemble

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.360
is completely smeared out.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.960
So this is what
we're talking about.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.740
Now, what I think has
confused some of you

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.990
is what I thought was
a wonderful example.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.310
The classical
squeezing experiment.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.340
I mean, these are visuals which
will be in your head forever,

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.630
when you saw Professor
Pritchard with a circle pendulum

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.790
he's just pulling.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.340
And then the circle
squeezes into an ellipse.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.820
And it seems that something
here is squeezed in real space.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.830
But this is actually wrong.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.040
But how you should have
looked at the experiment,

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.590
and I made a comment
about it, but maybe not

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.090
emphatically enough.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.830
You should have really thought
about a single pendulum.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.579
And this single pendulum, if
it has an [INAUDIBLE] phase,

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:09.400
is in a superposition of sine
omega t and cosine omega t.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.599
And if you pull on the string,
if you shorten and lengthen

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:17.180
the pendulum, it's
sine 2 omega t.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.079
You will amplify the prefactor
in front of sine omega t.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.020
And you will exponentially
de-amplify the factor

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.440
in front of cosine omega t.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.420
So therefore, what will happen
if this pendulum oscillates--

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:37.080
and let me say with a phase,
well, sine omega t plus delta,

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.650
if delta is 90 degrees.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:39.940
Cosine if delta is 0.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.930
It's sine.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:45.580
And let's say this pendulum
oscillates at 45 degrees.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.100
Sine omega t plus 45 degrees.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.170
If you now parametrically
derive it with squeezing action,

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.504
it would now mean
that you, let's

00:17:58.504 --> 00:17:59.795
just make it a sine convention.

00:17:59.795 --> 00:18:01.470
You de-amplify the cosine.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.850
You amplify the sine.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.320
And after a while, instead of
oscillating with sine omega

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.130
t plus 45 degrees,
it will oscillate

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.676
with an amplified
amplitude at sine omega t.

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:13.800
This is what you have done.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:20.430
And this is a
mechanical analogy.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:26.070
There is, of course,
no squeezing in any way

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.010
because in a
classical pendulum, we

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.590
start with one definite value.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.250
If you prepare the system well.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.840
And then, we just
change the motion.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.910
We amplify.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.430
We pick out a phase and
that's what we are doing.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.580
Now the true ways how classical
squeezing can come in.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:53.320
One it is if the motion of
the pendulum is-- maybe there

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.640
is an uncertainty.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.230
Maybe Professor Pritchard did
experiments with an ion trap.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.770
And actually, 20 years
ago, he published

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.770
a [INAUDIBLE] [? letter ?]
on classic squeezing.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.330
And you think, how
can you publish

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.330
[INAUDIBLE] [? letter ?]
on classical squeezing?

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.000
Well, he had developed the
world's most accurate ion trap,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.540
measuring atomic masses with
10 and 11 digit positions.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.340
And what was actually
one limiting factor

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:25.080
was for Kelvin, the
thermal distribution

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.420
of harmonic oscillator modes.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:33.870
And so, he didn't have
just one clean amplitude.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.540
The sine omega t
amplitudes had a spread

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.670
because of the thermal
distribution he started from.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.490
And so what he then did is,
by simply classical squeezing

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.640
by doing classically
with the ion trap

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.330
exactly what he did with the
pendulum, derive sine 2 omega

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:59.410
t, he could now take this
classic distribution.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.080
This is a classic distribution.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.820
In one axis, it's a
distribution of amplitudes

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.230
of the cosine motion.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.500
And here it's the
classic distribution

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.610
of the amplitudes
of the sine motion.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.710
And he was squeezing
it into this direction.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.950
So he had a narrower
definition of the coefficient

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.150
for the cosine omega t motion.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.330
And as I will tell
you today, you

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.420
can now do a
homodyne measurement,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.940
which is reducing the noise.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.130
So essentially, he prepared,
quote unquote "Effectively

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:37.460
a [? code ?] ensemble by
squeezing the uncertainty

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.870
in the cosine prefactor."

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.640
Or at the expense of
increasing the prefactor,

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.420
the uncertainty, the variance,
in prefactor of the sine omega

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:44.950
t motion.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:53.100
Finally, you all saw
something visually.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:58.420
You saw how a circular motion
became a linear motion.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.060
So what was going on here?

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.230
Well, I mentioned to you that
the circular pendulum actually

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.080
has two modes.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.690
These are two modes of
the harmonic oscillator.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.180
And I'm not talking
about two modes

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.305
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:21:11.305 --> 00:21:13.670
Everything we're discussing
here is about one mode

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.750
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.320
The circular motion
of the pendulum

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.710
was just a nice
visualization trick

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.030
that, if the pendulum
moves in a circle,

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.480
you have a degenerate
harmonic oscillator.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.230
One is excited
with sine omega t.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.540
The other one is excited
with cosine omega t.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.720
And instead of doing
two experiments,

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.110
if you would start
with sine omega t,

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.560
and you parametrically
drive it, you amplified it.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.710
If you start with
cosine omega t,

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.560
you could bring the
pendulum to a stop.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.200
But instead of doing
two experiments,

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.090
Professor Pritchard
just did one.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.990
And he showed that the sine
omega t motions became larger.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.580
And the orthogonal cosine
omega t motion shrank.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.180
And therefore, you saw that
the circular motion, which

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.440
was a superposition
of sine and cosine,

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:11.709
became [? pure ?] sine motion.

00:22:11.709 --> 00:22:13.250
But the fact that
there was something

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.410
we could see in
the spatial domain

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:20.300
was simply due to the fact that
we had two experiments in one.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.850
Two versions of the same
harmonic oscillator,

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.670
one in x and one in y.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.710
And then, when we
did the experiment,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:31.300
we saw something visually
in the spatial domain.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.820
So that's why we saw squeezing
in the spatial domain.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.830
But you should really
think about it.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.490
What the whole
action is, is it's

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:46.420
an interplay of de-amplifying
prefactors of cosine amplifying

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.110
prefactors of sine.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.110
And if the prefactor
has a distribution,

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.900
by de-amplifying
it, you also shrink

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.652
the reach of the distribution.

00:22:56.652 --> 00:22:58.110
And this is what
we call squeezing.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:01.644
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:01.644 --> 00:23:02.727
AUDIENCE: Stupid question.

00:23:02.727 --> 00:23:05.840
So the operators, a1
and a2 here, right?

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:12.989
You use those instead of a and
a dagger because you use cosine

00:23:12.989 --> 00:23:14.905
and sine rather than
[? e  to the i omega t ?]

00:23:14.905 --> 00:23:16.330
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.610
Because they should
contain [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.470
PROFESSOR: Let me go
back to the definition.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:30.110
They are actually exactly
they correspond exactly

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.874
to position and momentum of the
mechanical harmonic oscillator.

00:23:34.874 --> 00:23:35.415
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:36.305
That makes sense.

00:23:36.305 --> 00:23:38.085
Another thing is,
technically speaking,

00:23:38.085 --> 00:23:40.440
we could call the
[? Basco ?] electric field

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:47.000
e cos kr minus omega
t as maximum squeezed

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
if we only had the
cos components?

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:05.205
PROFESSOR: Well,
not if I use it--

00:24:05.205 --> 00:24:07.010
it depends how I
define squeezing.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:14.320
So you would now
give a definition

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:24.050
of squeezing which says
that the variance in a1

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:30.510
is now unequal to
the variance in a2.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.080
So the classical
oscillator is the point.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.400
It has 0 variance in a1.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.630
0 variance in a2.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.220
But as I said, you can
actually apply all the way

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.670
to a classical
oscillator if you add

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.960
technical noise
or thermal noise.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.740
Then your system is prepared,
not with a sharp value,

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.510
but with a distribution
which is simply

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.920
may be [? false ?] distribution,
due to the preparation.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:00.600
So recall, it's
squeezing when the noise

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.770
in the amplitude
of the sine motion

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.990
is not equal to the noise in the
amplitude of the cosine motion.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.180
Some people say, if it's
a little bit narrower,

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:18.220
they apply squeezing
to the situation

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:27.700
that we are uncertainty limited.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.830
And then we squeeze.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:38.180
But of course, you can always
reduce the noise in your system

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.060
by just preparing the system.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.210
By cooling the system.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:49.170
By selecting the system for
measurements, until you reach

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.710
the quantum limit.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.750
So you can get a smaller
delta a1, a smaller delta a2,

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.330
without squeezing, just
better preparation.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.800
Or by selecting your ensemble.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:05.180
So squeezing in a narrower
sense only makes sense

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.150
when you hit the limit of what
quantum mechanics allows you.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:13.010
And now you want to distribute
the variance unequally

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:19.120
between a1 and a2
because then you

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.960
can get something in
delta a1 or delta a2.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.830
Which is better then
1 over square root 2.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:30.002
And this is now really
quantum mechanically squeezed.

00:26:30.002 --> 00:26:31.210
But they're both definitions.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.730
Classical squeezing exists.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:37.534
It's just not as common as
quantum mechanical squeezing.

00:26:37.534 --> 00:26:38.200
Other questions?

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.710
Yes?

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.670
AUDIENCE: I remember
that you said

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.875
that in the classical
squeezing, you

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:48.170
are attenuating one amplitude.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:51.230
And you were amplifying
the other amplitude.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.050
So, in this picture
then, shouldn't we

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.370
have the ellipse come down
from the circle on the y-axis?

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.500
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] not
just changing delta a,

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.742
but also changing b [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:05.742 --> 00:27:07.575
PROFESSOR: Let me just
get a sketch up here.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.960
So this is a2.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.680
This is a1.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.340
a2 is for the cosine omega t.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.360
And a1 for the sine omega t.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.740
So just to be specific.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.320
So you want to prepare an
harmonic oscillator, which

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.500
is just sine omega t.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.990
This is a point here.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:35.990
If we are now parametrically--
so this has a value at t

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.610
equals 0.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:43.050
Our a1 is not.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.920
So if you are now squeezing your
classical harmonic oscillator,

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:54.900
you would have a situation
where a1 of t is s

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:01.310
naught times e to the plus
or minus t, depending on

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.610
whether you do the parametric
[? drive ?] at sine 2 omega

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.110
t or cosine 2 omega t.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.590
So therefore, what
would happen is

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:16.580
this point will be amplified.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.800
That would mean it would
just move out on the x-axis.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.550
So this would be
for the plus sign.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:29.320
Or, for the other case, you
would damp the motion to 0.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.579
And this is a minus sign here.

00:28:32.579 --> 00:28:33.120
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.130
And you were also
saying the variance--

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.080
PROFESSOR: A point
does not have variance.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.300
PROFESSOR: So if you
want to build a variance,

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.500
you need, let's
say, three points.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.900
One is the average value.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.180
One is the left outlier.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.870
One is the right outlier.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.130
And what happens is now,
as you amplify the motion,

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:57.040
you would also amplify,
magnify the distance

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.830
between the points.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.040
And if you de-amplify
it with a minus sign,

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.660
the distance between
the points would

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.700
shrink because all the
three points converged to 0.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.280
So pretty much what
I just told you

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.190
for the three point ensemble.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:16.480
You can now use it and construct
any initial condition you want.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.200
And see what happens
due to squeezing.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.941
Other questions?

00:29:26.941 --> 00:29:27.440
Good.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:46.387
So the question now is,
how to measure squeezing.

00:29:46.387 --> 00:29:47.845
How to take advantage
of squeezing.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:06.490
So the situation we are
facing is the following.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:16.360
Let's assume we have done
a nice squeezing job.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.190
And that means that
we have a sharp value.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.270
We have created a
narrow distribution

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.910
of the cosign omega
2 coefficients.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.790
So the cosine omega 2
motion is rather sharp.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:36.240
But we also know that
the electric field itself

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.340
is sharp at this moment.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:52.970
But since this ellipse
rotates, the electric field

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:57.290
will have enormous uncertainty
a [INAUDIBLE] period later.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:02.430
So if we want to take
advantage that we have squeezed

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.520
the electromagnetic
field, they are now

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.140
a couple of ideas
which we can use.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.250
One is we could just
measure the electric fields

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.430
stroboscopically.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.310
We would just make
a setup, where

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.000
we look at this system
in a [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.070
measurement process.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.760
Only, we only measure
the electric field

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.052
when the ellipse is like
this or is like this.

00:31:24.052 --> 00:31:26.510
And therefore, we have a sharp
value of the electric field.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.150
But instead of doing a
stroboscopic measurement,

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.940
we can do something else.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:52.520
Remember, we have a
distribution of cosine omega t

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.390
and sine omega t.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:02.090
And we have a distribution
of co efficiency and s.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:06.600
And we know we are interested
in the cosine omega t.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.250
So how to pick that
out has actually

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:13.930
been solved in
early [? radius ?].

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:15.560
You do a homodyne detection.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:21.290
In other words, you take
a reference oscillator,

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.460
which is strong.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:31.020
B of t is b naught times
cosine omega naught plus delta.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:40.700
And if you if you
multiply the two signals,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.705
your signal you are
interested in, or at least

00:32:42.705 --> 00:32:44.560
you're interested
in one comportment,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.650
you multiply it with
your local oscillator.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.630
And then you
[? indicate ?] over time.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:06.460
Then, of course, when you
peak the phase delta to be 0,

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.840
cosine omega t times
cosine omega [? dt ?]

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.620
gives cosine squared omega t.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.740
It averages to 1/2.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.790
So you would times average
where cosine omega t

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.260
times sine omega
t averages to 0.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.050
So for delta equals
0, you project out

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:24.990
the cosine component.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.540
And for delta equal
to 90 degrees,

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.530
you peak out the sine component.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:37.240
So therefore, you can
have a measurement,

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.110
it's a phase
sensitive measurement,

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.725
by multiplying your signal with
the local oscillator, where

00:33:43.725 --> 00:33:47.860
you're only sensitive to the
component you have squeezed.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.320
And therefore, your
measurement uncertainty

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.397
has now been reduced by
the squeezing factor.

00:34:01.163 --> 00:34:03.598
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] only
that should be the [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.310
PROFESSOR: Yes,
actually, homodyne

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.520
means we use the same frequency.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:18.030
Heterodyning would mean we
use two different frequencies.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.400
But I'm not talking about that.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.820
So we have to use exactly
the same frequency here.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.285
AUDIENCE: So instead, this
[INAUDIBLE] oscillation

00:34:27.285 --> 00:34:30.243
also needs a laser
to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:30.243 --> 00:34:32.219
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:35.989
So, to address your question,
Angie, what usually happens

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:40.330
is you start with one
laser in those experiments.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.514
You frequence the
top of the laser.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.850
If you wanted to
do some squeezing,

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:53.130
you remember that we need a
parametric oscillator, where

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.240
one energetic photon
gives us two photons.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.920
So what you do is you start
with a laser, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.970
A 1064 nanometer.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.260
You frequency double
it to green laser.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.580
The green laser pumps your
parametric oscillator.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.300
And then you get,
for down conversion,

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.470
you can squeeze light at 1064.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.150
But this is because you
first stopper the laser.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.350
And then you break the
photon into new pieces.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.460
It has exactly the same
frequency as your laser

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.490
you started with.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.980
And this laser is in the local
oscillator, or the reference

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.360
clock, for your
whole experiment.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.380
So everything in your
experiment, the double laser,

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.910
the parametrically
down converted beams.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:43.230
Everything is related to the
single laser you started with.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.950
And everything is
phase coherent.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.044
So that's how, usually,
the experiment is done.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.770
Before I tell you what we're
doing quantum mechanically,

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.660
let me just also
get another question

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.040
out of the system, which I've
been asked several times.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.010
People ask me,
well, the problem is

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.890
that the ellipse
rotates like this.

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:08.680
Isn't there a way--
now I need my hand--

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.450
that we can have an
ellipse rotating like this?

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:13.950
And that would be great.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.980
But this is sort of unnatural
because the harmonic oscillator

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:18.970
does that.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:23.240
So if you wanted to do that,
you need an operator which

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.990
is really, at every cycle of
the electromagnetic field,

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.300
is when the light want
to sort of do this.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.080
No.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.380
Always push it back.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.810
And this is impractical.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.200
You need, really, an oscillator
which would completely

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.080
change the quadrature components
of your harmonic oscillator

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.730
in every single cycle of
the electromagnetic field.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:46.570
But sort of what homodyne
detection is, instead

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:50.860
of now forcing the light to
stay aligned to sort of do

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.050
this, which is
very unnatural, we

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.700
allow the light
to freely evolve.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.560
But we have now an observer,
our local oscillator,

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.180
which is rotating
synchronously with the ellipse.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.610
So we have a local oscillator
which is cosine omega t.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.920
It does, so to speak, exactly
what the ellipse is doing.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.070
So in that sense,
the local oscillator

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.960
allows us, now, to
observe the ellipse always

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.957
from its narrow side.

00:37:17.957 --> 00:37:20.040
Because the local oscillator
is [? cooperating ?].

00:37:22.504 --> 00:37:24.670
But the mathematics is
pretty much the [? Fourier ?]

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.170
transform.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:30.262
The mathematics is a
[? Fourier ?] transform.

00:37:30.262 --> 00:37:32.470
The physics is the physics
of a [INAUDIBLE] detector.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:48.750
OK, now the only question
remaining is, how do we mix?

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:53.850
How do we get a
product of our signal

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:57.290
and the strong local oscillator?

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.430
In an old radio, it's
done by an element.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.100
Maybe a diode, which
is a nonlinear circuit.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.360
If you drive a nonlinear
element with two input sources,

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.290
you get something which
involves the product of the two.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:20.980
OK, so the principal
of homodyne detection

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:28.120
is now that we want to mix
light at the beam splitter.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.080
So the device which
does all that for us

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:38.720
is, after using so many
words, I would say it's

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.320
disgustingly simple.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.070
It's really a half [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.960
We talked about
beam splitters a lot

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.780
here because beam
splitters perform

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.340
wonderful unitary
transformations.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.480
And we'll exploit them
for many purposes.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:03.640
For the purpose of
this lecture, I simply

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:08.540
assume that we have a
50-50 beam splitter.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:13.420
So, what I'm telling you
now about the beam splitter

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.260
will be generalized.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:19.970
Either later today, or in
the lecture on Wednesday.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:26.100
So a beam splitter has two
input ports and output ports.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.790
We have light impinging
on the beam splitter.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:34.920
We call those modes a and b.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:46.070
And after the beam splitter,
we have two output modes.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:50.820
And let me call them a0 and b0.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:57.030
And what we measure is the
output of the beam splitter.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.840
So we have two photo detectors.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.080
And we measure the output.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.790
OK.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:22.070
The output modes, a
naught and b naught,

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:33.070
are simply obtained by
taking the input modes

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:35.020
and propagating them.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.480
We have two modes, a, b.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.160
You can say, what
goes vertically is a.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.055
Vertical is a.

00:40:42.055 --> 00:40:42.930
We call it a naught.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:43.710
Here, it's b.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.250
It becomes b naught.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:52.480
And what we have
to do is we have

00:40:52.480 --> 00:41:04.915
two transform the
operator a naught.

00:41:04.915 --> 00:41:06.040
Let me just make a comment.

00:41:08.332 --> 00:41:09.790
Sometimes in the
beam splitter, you

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:14.210
want to think a quantum state
comes and is transformed.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:17.180
But instead of transforming
the state of a photon,

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.450
I can also transform
the operator,

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.705
which creates a photon.

00:41:20.705 --> 00:41:22.030
One is the Heisenberg picture.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.530
One is a Schrodinger picture.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.080
So right now, I'll use
the Heisenberg picture.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.160
I have two operators, a, b.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.500
Before the beam splitter is set,
I have two operators, a naught,

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.200
b naught.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.870
Afterwards, I have
two other operators.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:40.040
I have operators a, b.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.520
Afterwards, i have operators
a naught, b naught.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.390
And, if you do the
time evolution,

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.560
it's a unitary transformation.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:53.670
And for operators, we have
to multiply the operators

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.560
from the left and
right hand side,

00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:00.350
with unitary operator,
u and u dagger.

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:03.660
And we really talk
about the beam splitter

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.720
in its full beauty
in a short while.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.930
It will be a special case
of what we discuss later.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:15.590
But I think it's pretty obvious
that a 50-50 beam splitters is

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.420
simply creating two modes.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.040
One of the symmetric
combination.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.265
And one of the anti
symmetric combination.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.120
OK.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:36.900
So in our homodyne
detector, we are now

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:42.965
measuring the number of
photons in the mode a naught.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:47.850
We measure with
the upper detector,

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.560
the number of photons
in the mode b naught.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.980
But what we are then
doing is we run it

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.810
through a different [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.350
We want to cancel
certain noises,

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.060
as you will see in a moment.

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:07.000
This is why we
obtain the difference

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.800
signal, which we call I minus.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.420
So let's now calculate
what I minus is.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:20.110
Well, the number of photons
in the mode a naught

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:21.825
is a naught dagger a naught.

00:43:21.825 --> 00:43:27.470
That's the operator for
the number of photons.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:32.180
We subtract b naught
dagger b naught.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:36.770
And, as you can
immediately see, is

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:41.030
that it because of the
beam splitter, this

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:46.280
is now involving a
product of a and b.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.800
ab dagger plus a dagger b.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.780
So in other words,
when you ask yourself,

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:57.390
how can we-- remember, I said
we peak out the cosine omega t

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.180
component by
multiplying our signal

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.090
with the local oscillator.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.550
And you would say,
how do you multiply

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:09.540
two modes of the
electromagnetic field?

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.040
Well, just send it
to a beam splitter.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.190
In a beam splitter, you
create the sum of them.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:18.760
But then your photo detector
is square [INAUDIBLE] detector.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.290
You measure the electric
fields squared or you

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.350
have to measure the
operator, a dagger a.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:28.380
And now, you get the [INAUDIBLE]
between ab dagger and a dagger

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.250
b.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.320
So this is how we
multiply two operators.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.340
How we get a signal, which is
a proportional to a or a dagger

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.857
times b or b dagger.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.790
By the way, if it wouldn't
take the difference,

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:57.210
we get terms of aa
dagger bb dagger.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.730
Just the mode a or the
mode b by themselves.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.150
And we want to get rid of them.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:03.615
And by taking the difference
between the two photo

00:45:03.615 --> 00:45:07.290
detectors, those parts of
the signal are becoming mode.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.940
And are subtracted out.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.780
So therefore, this is
called balanced homodyne

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.100
because we have the
balanced beam splitter.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.390
We measure to two signals.

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.650
And then we take the
difference of the two signals.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:24.880
OK.

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:31.590
There's one more
thing we have to add.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:37.050
And then we find we understand
the balanced homodyne

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:37.640
detection.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:41.740
We want to explore it.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.590
That our mode b,
remember we want

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:46.990
to measure mode a. a squeezed.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.460
a has quantum properties.
a has only single photons.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:56.360
And b is just a trick to
project out the cosine omega t.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:10.670
And we do that by choosing
for b a strong coherent state,

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:13.430
described by a coherent
state parameter beta.

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:27.790
Of course, whenever we have
a strong coherent state,

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:32.850
that means that we
can replace b by beta,

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.370
and b dagger by beta star.

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:39.440
This is sort of
the classical field

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.600
limit of a strong
coherent state.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:53.740
And now we can ask, what this
our different signal I minus?

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:59.180
Well, the coherent state depends
on the phase angle theta.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.670
So it will be phase sensitive.

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:04.170
It will depend on
the angle theta.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:05.730
But now there is one more thing.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.180
And that is, if you use a
stronger coherent state,

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.680
of course both of our outputs
go up in proportion to beta.

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:19.180
So therefore, we want
to go to a normalization

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.200
by dividing by beta.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.270
So this is now our
normalized output.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.550
I'm looking at this.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:46.120
So this is our operator
for the signal I minus.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.270
And that is a.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:56.060
b has been replaced by, b dagger
has been replaced by b star.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:01.540
That gives us a times
e to the-- because

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.050
of the complex
conjugation-- minus i

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:11.870
theta plus a dagger times e
to the i theta divided by 2.

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:25.540
So therefore, if we
choose the phase to be 0,

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.200
we measure this
symmetric combination,

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.020
a plus a dagger over 2.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:45.570
And this is-- just
comparing notes--

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:49.440
simply the a1 quadrature
operator divided by square root

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.190
2.

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:57.250
And if you put a phase shifter,
just a dispersive element,

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.270
into the strong local
oscillator and shift

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:05.040
the phase by pi over 2, by
delaying the light pulse

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.200
by a quarter wavelength, what
we are now projecting out

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:15.810
is the other
quadrature component.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.250
So therefore, using
the beam splitter

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:24.460
and the local
oscillator, we can now

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:28.960
measure the expectation
value for a1 and for a2.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.990
I've posted a few papers
on the website which

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.140
show some of the pioneering
experiments where

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.440
people did exactly that.

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:46.070
So then, when they observed the
quadrature comportment, which

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:50.230
was squeezed, they usually
did it for a squeezed vacuum,

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:53.540
so a1 and a2 had 0
expectation value.

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.840
But the interesting part is,
how much noise was there?

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:02.200
If you don't squeeze, you find
that your normalized noise

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.860
simply corresponds to the
classical photon shot noise.

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.820
But if you are
squeezed, you find

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.895
that one quadrature
comportment has

00:50:10.895 --> 00:50:13.320
a smaller noise than shot noise.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.600
So [INAUDIBLE] photons
in your different signal.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.396
And your noise is less
than square root n.

00:50:17.396 --> 00:50:18.770
Where as in the
other quadrature,

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.080
the component is larger.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.890
So you can look up
on the website papers

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:29.220
where people slowly varied the
phase of the local oscillator.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.600
And you see, this
is shot noise, how

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.155
the noise is below shot noise.

00:50:33.155 --> 00:50:34.410
Exceeds shot noise.

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:35.540
It's below shot noise.

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.200
And exceeds shot noise.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.110
And this was the first
evidence for the generation

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:41.880
of squeezed light.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:49.780
Questions?

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.040
OK.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:05.750
So we have discussed
the detection

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:09.960
of squeezed light using
balanced homodyne detector.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:15.750
And balanced means that the
beam splitter was 50-50.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:19.720
So now we are ready to
discuss the unbalanced case.

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:38.300
So let's get our
unbalanced beam splitter

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.680
and, just for the
sake of the argument,

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.840
let's say it has a really
good transmission of tt.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.930
So transmission
coefficient t squared

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:53.090
tells you what fraction of
the power is transmitted.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:56.435
And let's just assume for
the sake of the argument, 99%

00:51:56.435 --> 00:51:58.370
are transmitted.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:01.480
So therefore, if we
start with our signal

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.540
a, which may be
[INAUDIBLE] squeezed

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.130
quantum state, number state.

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:09.020
You name it.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.245
a naught is pretty
much the same as a.

00:52:12.245 --> 00:52:15.180
We haven't lost so much.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:20.170
But now we use our
local oscillator,

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.105
which is very strong.

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:29.680
Only a very small fraction
of it will be reflected.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.540
But we can always compensate
for the small reflection

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:36.370
by making b even stronger.

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:38.490
Let's see what we get.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:42.630
So the mode, a naught,
the output mode,

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:46.550
is now the transmission
coefficient times a.

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.530
a and a.

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:53.070
The operators are amplitudes.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:56.730
So we have to use, if you
have a 99% beam splitter,

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.990
we have to take the
square root of 0.99.

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:02.540
This is the transmission
coefficient.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.480
And now we have the
transmission coefficient

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.920
for the strong local
oscillator, which

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.800
we will again approximate
by its eigenvalue.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.950
Coherent state eigenvalue.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.150
And the reflection coefficient
is 1 minus t squared.

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:33.156
So if we make the approximation
that t is approximately 1,

00:53:33.156 --> 00:53:34.780
we can take it out
off the parenthesis.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.980
And we obtain that.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:53.690
If t is close to 1,
we can neglect it.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:58.300
And what we see now is
what we have obtained

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:03.210
is actually the original
quantum state a.

00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:03.910
Or I should say.

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:04.720
The operator.

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.030
I'm in the Heisenberg picture.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:11.320
a is the mode
operator for the input

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.740
of the unbalanced
homodyne detector.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:19.460
And what we have simply done is
we have displaced the operator.

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:22.620
We have displaced
the mode operator a.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.920
And the displacement operator
has an [? argument ?]

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:33.670
of 1 minus t squared beta.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:36.360
And this is a
Hermitian conjugate.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:41.880
1 minus t squared beta.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.820
So what I've shown you here
is that the local oscillator

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:52.740
and the beam splitter is the
realization, or implementation,

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.140
of the displacement operator.

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:08.090
So in the limit that
t goes to unity,

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:12.000
we are not losing anything
of out quantum state.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.680
But by reflecting
in the amplitude

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.520
of a strong coherent state, we
simply take our quantum state,

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.810
and we displace it in this
two dimensional plane.

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:28.500
So that's what this beam
splitter does for us.

00:55:35.557 --> 00:55:36.140
Any questions?

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.420
In the next few
classes, we really

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.360
take advantage of
those elements.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.020
We know now that the
displacement operator is just

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.180
a beam splitter.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:55.270
We know when we have
squeezed some light

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:57.490
by using balanced
homodyne detection,

00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:59.870
we can just do measurement
of one quadrature component

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:01.100
or the other.

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.390
So what I hope for those of
you who haven't heard about it,

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.990
what you take away
from that is that these

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:10.150
are extremely simple elements.

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.820
But by combining
them, we can really

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:18.610
realize very sophisticated
schemes of quantum optics.

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:20.990
To some extent, when I heard
about it for the first time,

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:23.300
I think, the mathematics
look so fancy.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.470
I couldn't believe that such
simple elements can actually

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:31.100
realize what those
operators describe.

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:33.730
So I gave you the example for
the displacement operator.

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.860
When I learned about
the beam splitter,

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:51.250
and its underlying
physics, there

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.540
was one thing which
really fascinated me.

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:59.560
And this is the most simple
element you can think of.

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.250
I mean, what is simpler
than a beam splitter?

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:05.550
A beam splitter has two
inputs, two outputs.

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:09.410
The simplest optical element
is just an attenuator.

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:11.480
Put in a window
in your laser beam

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.650
and you lose 4% of
your power preserves.

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:16.920
Or put in just a little
bit of dirty optics

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.770
and you lose a few percent.

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:20.630
So what I want to
discuss with you now

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:24.125
is, what really is an
attenuator quantum mechanically?

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:35.710
Well if, classically,
the attenuator

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:37.930
would do the following.

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:43.180
An attenuator is a device
which has a transmission, which

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.270
is a transmission
coefficient squared,

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:46.990
which is smaller than unity.

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:54.910
And, in a classical system,
if you have a coherent state,

00:57:54.910 --> 00:58:00.805
you would simply assume that the
coherent state gets multiplied

00:58:00.805 --> 00:58:02.320
by the transmission coefficient.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:17.300
In other words, that you
have your original state,

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:20.880
described by this
phase, or alpha.

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:25.430
And then, the action
of the attenuator

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:35.420
would simply be to
scale everything down

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:38.620
by a transmission
effect of alpha.

00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.750
So the picture you should
have is the following.

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.320
You have a coherent state.

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.400
It gets attenuated by the
transmission coefficient.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.940
But if there are fluctuations
about the coherent state,

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.140
also the fluctuations
get attenuated.

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:55.450
Because everything gets
attenuated by this attenuator.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:59:00.960
So if you look at that, you
should immediately say, no.

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.180
This is quantum
mechanically forbidden.

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:07.160
Because a coherent state with
a minimum uncertainty state,

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:11.170
this shaded area cannot
be smaller than 1/2.

00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:13.600
But here it has become smaller.

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.770
So what I've shown
to you here is

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:18.480
it's a violation of
quantum mechanics.

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:25.190
It would actually mean, let
me just give you the example.

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:40.520
It would mean that if-- yeah.

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.600
The coherent state
is quantum limited.

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.080
And if you calculate what is
the fluctuations in the photo

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.580
number, it's a shot noise.

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:53.970
So just to give you sort of
simple, intuitive example,

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:59.460
if you have 10,000 photons plus
minus 100, it's a shot noise.

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.680
Square root n.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.740
If you could now attenuate
it by a factor of 100,

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:08.050
and you would go from
10,000 plus minus 100,

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:11.910
to 100 plus minus 1.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:13.790
That's much better
than the shot noise.

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:15.560
I mean, this is what
I'm just telling you

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.040
what a simpleminded
attenuator would do.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.590
And you would immediately say,
that's too good to be true.

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:22.550
I cannot get sub
shot noise light.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.490
So what is wrong?

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:34.740
Impossible.

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:37.060
Not allowed.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:40.820
Well, we've just tried
to formulate something

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.730
intuitively.

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:42.820
And we have to be careful.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:55.740
Well, we know
already one way how

01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:00.362
we can attenuate an input beam.

01:01:00.362 --> 01:01:04.300
And maybe we should go back to
the situation and analyze it.

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:08.570
We know what if we can attenuate
it with a beam splitter.

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:12.850
And this beam splitter has a
transmission coefficient of t.

01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:17.260
And then we get our
transmitted coherent light.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:21.720
There is something
getting reflected.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.820
But now we realize that
this beam splitter is not

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.480
just a device which
has one input.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.060
It has another input.

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.600
And you may say, well, I don't
care about the other input.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.340
I don't want to use it.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.890
Well, if you don't
want to use the input,

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:41.620
it has the vacuum state.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.110
So therefore, if you would
realize the attenuator

01:01:51.110 --> 01:02:00.110
with the beam splitter, it
would mean that, in addition,

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:03.190
and this is what the math
really shows, in addition

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:07.140
to the attenuated coherent
state, which mathematically

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:12.350
is also attenuating
the fluctuations,

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:16.240
you have to add something.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.750
Which is the
reflection coefficient

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.945
times the vacuum state.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.120
Which is this.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:35.370
And if you now
correctly do the math,

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:40.960
if you add the two
together, you find

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:50.730
you get a coherent state which
has an amplitude of t alpha.

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:53.510
But has the correct
[INAUDIBLE] fluctuation

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.960
is again a minimum
uncertainty state.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.900
So the disk of your
attenuated state

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.780
hasn't exactly the same area
as the unattenuated state.

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:08.700
So I've shown you
the physical part.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:11.220
I have shown you the
graphical solution.

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.700
The math is very simple.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.300
But I really want you
to do the math yourself.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.730
This is a new
homework problem we

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:19.065
designed to illustrate
the physics.

01:03:19.065 --> 01:03:21.630
But what it tells
you is the following.

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:25.370
If you take a neutral
density filter out

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:28.340
of the lab [INAUDIBLE] and say,
this is not a beam splitter.

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.230
This is an attenuator.

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:31.290
Sorry.

01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:35.500
You cannot simply attenuate
a quantum mechanical mode.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.500
This is not a unitary
time evolution.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.130
What you attenuate [INAUDIBLE]
is, without you knowing it,

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:45.590
it couples the electromagnetic
wave to whatever.

01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:47.790
To the heat path
of the [INAUDIBLE],

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.180
which is in your attenuator.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.950
I don't even want
to describe it.

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:53.820
But you're not
circumventing the limitation

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.160
of the beam splitter.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.630
Whenever you attenuate,
whenever you have a laser beam,

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:01.480
and it undergoes losses,
when you send a laser beam

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.370
through the atmosphere, and
it undergoes some losses by,

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:06.180
who knows,
[INAUDIBLE] scattering

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:10.085
through the air or
something like this.

01:04:10.085 --> 01:04:13.670
That means you get an
attenuated coherent state.

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:16.960
But you couple in the
fluctuations off the vacuum.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.810
And this establishes
shot noise now,

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:22.750
at the lower level of intensity.

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:27.780
So your attenuator is not
a single state device.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.010
Dissipation.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:32.110
Attenuation really
means you connect

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:33.850
with other parts of
[INAUDIBLE] space.

01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:39.520
You cannot attenuate in a
small part [INAUDIBLE] space.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.650
This is impossible.

01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:42.300
This is not unitary
time evolution.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:05.320
So what I've just told you
has dramatic consequences

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:11.560
for any form of non
classical, or squeezed, light.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.370
And that's the following.

01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.030
Most of you are
experimentalists.

01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:19.930
And you know that when you run
a laser at one or two watts,

01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:23.560
you send it through optics, and
shudders, and optical fibers.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.780
How much do you get at the
end of your experiment?

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.560
Not even 50%.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.300
So, whenever you create
light, and then you

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:34.570
want to do something, you
lose some of the light.

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:39.060
And let's now assume that
you have done what was really

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:43.550
a breakthrough in scientific
headlines within your lifetime.

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:46.230
You have generated
squeezed light.

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:48.790
And now we want to use
the squeezed light.

01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:51.642
Shine it on atoms and do
a precision measurement,

01:05:51.642 --> 01:05:53.600
which is better than the
standard quantum limit

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.183
because you have
squeezed the ellipse.

01:05:55.183 --> 01:05:58.420
And you want to now exploit
the sharpness of the ellipse.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:02.560
What happens to your
aspect ratio of the ellipse

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.900
when your beam is attenuated?

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.180
So let me just discuss
it with you graphically.

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.920
So let's assume we
have a squeezed state.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.720
And we send it through
an optical fiber.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.210
The result is you will
never send a squeezed state

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.310
through an optical fiber.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.170
But I want you to realize that.

01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:27.001
So let's assume we have our
squeezed state, symbolized

01:06:27.001 --> 01:06:27.500
by that.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.620
Let's use some red
color for the state.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.240
And now, in the
time evolution, we

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.180
have some [INAUDIBLE]
scattering.

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.840
Some fiber absorption.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.930
But you know already,
the absorption

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:47.310
is in reality a beam splitter,
which happens in the vacuum.

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:47.810
So

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:51.620
We have now some finite
transmission coefficients.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:56.300
And that would mean,
which is the bad news,

01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.940
that your ellipse gets shrunk.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:01.440
It shrinks.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.040
It shrinks by the
transmission factor t.

01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:17.890
But that's what I did bad.

01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:19.240
You lose some of your power.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:28.150
But the really bad thing
is that if I multiply it

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:38.045
with the reflection coefficient,
you couple in the vacuum.

01:07:38.045 --> 01:07:38.545
Oops.

01:07:38.545 --> 01:07:41.030
I'm going to change to red.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:49.750
And, as a result, since
the noise in the vacuum

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:52.620
is equal in both
quadrature components,

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:56.980
you've worked so hard to squeeze
it, to make it asymmetric.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:01.550
But what you get now
is from your ellipse,

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:06.060
you get something which is
much more egg shaped now.

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:10.520
So in other words, you can
write it down with operators.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.970
But once you understand
what is going on,

01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:21.100
you immediately realize that
losses reduce the squeezing.

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:28.090
And this is a challenge to
all the experiments using

01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:29.760
squeezed or non classical light.

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.810
And you see how
the scaling works.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:39.529
If you have squeezed your
ellipse by a factor of 100,

01:08:39.529 --> 01:08:44.729
even 1% of the vacuum
will spoil your squeezing.

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:47.100
So the more you have
squeezed, the more

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:52.149
non-classical the light is--
the more valuable it is.

01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:55.660
The more sensitive it is,
to even very small losses.

01:09:02.999 --> 01:09:03.499
Questions?

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.050
OK, good.

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:17.499
Now we have 10 more minutes.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.950
What I want to do now
is, I want to show you

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:31.120
that the language
which we have used,

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.350
the methods we have introduced,
can now be used for something

01:09:34.350 --> 01:09:37.330
which is really
cool-- teleportation.

01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:41.470
I want to show you how
balanced homodyne detection,

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:44.800
quadrature measurement, and
displacement operator can

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.550
be put together to
generalize is scheme which

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:51.100
is a scheme for
teleporting quantum states.

01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.930
This is an application
of squeezing, homodyning,

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.330
and all that.

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:04.670
Teleportation of light.

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:19.340
Let me just illustrate
what the problem is.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.130
I know we have only
10 minutes, and I've

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:25.170
decided not to write down
all the math for you.

01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:27.110
I went, actually, to
the Wikipedia page,

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:31.290
and corrected a few
mistakes in the equations

01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:33.220
and edited a few explanations.

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.610
I think you can just sit
down and read it by yourself.

01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:37.260
What I want to
explain to you, here,

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:41.310
is the physical concepts
behind teleportation,

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:46.150
and you the crucial steps
to realize teleportation.

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:47.685
So first, what is teleportation?

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:55.600
Well, teleportation has
a sender and a received,

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.750
which in quantum
information science

01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:59.183
are called Alice and Bob.

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:07.850
Teleportation means Alice
has a quantum state, psi.

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:12.630
And she wants to send this
quantum state, psi, to Bob.

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:16.250
In other words, you have,
maybe, some squeezed light.

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:18.170
You have something--
a quantum state,

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:21.760
psi-- which is interesting.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:33.100
And the question is, how can
Bob create an identical copy

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.094
of this quantum
state, psi, that he

01:11:35.094 --> 01:11:37.260
can sort of [INAUDIBLE]
with the same quantum state.

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:43.320
Before you appreciate
teleportation,

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.880
you have to realize
what the problem is.

01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:55.890
The problem is, really,
in fundamental properties

01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:58.610
of quantum systems,
fundamental limitations-- what

01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.600
you can do with
a quantum system.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.530
First, I have to tell you
what is allowed, and what not.

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:06.940
In this game, teleportation
means, of course,

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.660
you will not take your atom and
your photons in the state psi,

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:13.160
just propagate them to
Bob, and Bob has them.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.340
That's trivial.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.780
I can send any
quantum state to you

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.070
by transmitting an atom
or a laser beam to you,

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:22.900
and you have the same
quantum state I had earlier.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.250
This is not teleportation.

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:27.010
This is trivial propagation.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:30.483
What is meant is that we don't
have a quantum channel-- I'm

01:12:30.483 --> 01:12:33.350
not allowed to send my
quantum state to you.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:36.560
But in teleportation, I can do
a measurement on the quantum

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.030
state, call you up through
a classical communication

01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:43.380
channel, and tell you, the
result of my measurement

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.310
is such and such.

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:47.610
And then you would say, well,
if I have a spin system,

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.810
and I measure spin up--
I call you and say,

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:54.510
my measurement was spin up, and
you create a spin up system.

01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:57.110
Isn't that teleportation?

01:12:57.110 --> 01:13:00.460
The answer is no, because
maybe the state I had

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.710
was a superposition
of spin up and down.

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:05.300
And what I measured
is only spin up.

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.220
And by telling you
it's spin up, you

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:08.950
would never create a
superposition state,

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:10.690
you would just create
a spin up state.

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:14.900
So the effect is, that if I
do a measurement on my quantum

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:17.325
state, and report
my results to you,

01:13:17.325 --> 01:13:20.280
you have insufficient
information.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.150
Because a projective
measurement on a quantum

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:27.650
state inevitably leads
to loss of information.

01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:30.180
A measurement on a
single quantum state

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.240
does not create
enough information

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.630
to recreate the quantum state.

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.830
Of course, there is
an obvious solution.

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:42.580
When we want to obtain
information about a quantum

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.830
state, we often, in
quantum mechanics,

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:48.210
have to do many measurements.

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:50.410
And we can take a
spin state, we can

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:52.160
measure what is
its x, what its y,

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.440
what is the c
component of the spin.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.750
We can completely
characterize the spin state,

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:58.720
and then we know
everything about it.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.040
But the problem is, we have
only one quantum state,

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.884
and we can't do
repeated measurements.

01:14:04.884 --> 01:14:07.300
Then you would say, well, the
next thing is, why don't you

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:10.030
just take your quantum
state and Xerox it,

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:11.347
make many, many copies.

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:12.930
And then you have
an ensemble, and you

01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:15.210
can take as many
measurements you want.

01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:17.840
You can do an x
measurement, p measurement.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.650
I mean, you can reconstruct
the complete wave function.

01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:22.640
You can measure with an x basis.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.800
You can measure with
a momentum basis.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.320
You can collect all
the information.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:30.900
But the problem is-- otherwise
the whole teleportation

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.475
would not be an
issue at all-- there

01:14:32.475 --> 01:14:34.490
is the no-cloning theorem.

01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:38.160
You cannot duplicate
a quantum state.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.930
If you have an atom in a certain
quantum state and another atom,

01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:44.250
it is quantum-mechanically
forbidden--

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.670
there is no unitary
transformation,

01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:49.590
no way of creating a
situation that you have

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:53.500
one unknown quantum
state, plus another atom,

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:57.120
or another light beam,
and after some interaction

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.300
you have two times the
same quantum state.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.400
You cannot clone.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:08.335
Therefore, based on all that, we
cannot clone the quantum state.

01:15:08.335 --> 01:15:10.540
We are only left
with the one copy

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.830
of the quantum state,
which Alice has.

01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:14.877
Alice is not allowed
to send it to Bob.

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.710
Maybe Bob is on the
other side of the ocean,

01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:19.150
or on another planet.

01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:22.610
All what Alice can do is,
she can do one measurement

01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:27.010
and tell Bob, this
is my measurement.

01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:29.980
So this is the problem
of teleportation.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:32.890
How is that possible?

01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:37.790
Well, the way how I put
it, it seems impossible.

01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:41.360
But there's a way out of it.

01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:47.770
Let me just write
down what I said.

01:15:47.770 --> 01:16:01.630
So the goal is now-- Alice
performs measurement,

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:06.780
reports result to Bob.

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:28.030
And now, Bob will recreate
the quantum state.

01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:31.600
What I've just said is, to
perform a single measurement

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.760
is not enough information.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.490
So this is not enough.

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:36.680
We need one more resource.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:45.610
And the resource,
which is now used

01:16:45.610 --> 01:16:55.850
to use quantum teleportation,
is that you take some entangled

01:16:55.850 --> 01:17:02.630
system, or-- and this why I talk
about it today-- or squeezed

01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:04.874
light.

01:17:04.874 --> 01:17:05.790
That's the same thing.

01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:09.630
It's a form of entanglement.

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:13.410
I told you that when we
generate squeezed light

01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:15.620
with a parametric
down conversion,

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:20.890
the parametric down conversion
takes a green photon

01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:24.570
and creates two identical
infrared photons.

01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:26.560
Until now, we have
discussed that

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.170
those identical
infrared photons go

01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:31.650
into the same mode,
which is squeezed.

01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:34.440
But now, a slight
extension of this concept

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.410
would mean, in parametric
down conversion,

01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:40.490
you squeeze something, but
one photon goes to Alice,

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:41.450
one photon goes to Bob.

01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:53.930
So now, Alice and Bob have
an additional resource.

01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:57.280
They sort of own--
each of them-- half

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.970
of the two twin brothers,
which are the photons created

01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:03.050
in the parametric down
conversion process.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:09.240
And that will work.

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.980
So the idea is the following.

01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:24.190
To create those twin
beams of photons

01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:29.020
is simply done with an
optical parametric oscillator.

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.755
There is one extension, which
is described on the Wiki.

01:18:31.755 --> 01:18:33.380
I won't have time to
explain it to you.

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.080
But it's a two-mode OPO.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.210
It puts the two identical
photons-- not in the same beam,

01:18:39.210 --> 01:18:41.270
as we did before, we had
the a dagger squared,

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:47.470
a squared operator-- they
go into two different modes.

01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:50.300
You know the magic of
beam splitters by now.

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:51.960
Now, two beams come out.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.470
One goes to Alice,
one goes to Bob.

01:18:55.470 --> 01:19:00.640
If Alice would take her input
state-- this unknown state

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:06.580
which is handed to her
by Victor, somebody

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:10.030
else who participates in
the game-- we know already,

01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:14.160
if Alice would
perform a measurement,

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.200
the quantum state
would be destroyed.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.830
The result of the measurement--
let's talk about spin-1/2--

01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:21.420
would only be one
spin projection.

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:28.600
It's not enough to
reproduce a state.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.270
But what she is doing
is, she uses, again,

01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:33.330
the magic of the beam splitter.

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:36.170
So one of those
twin brother photons

01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:38.650
is now mixed with
the unknown quantum

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:41.110
state at the beam splitter.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:45.390
And the output of
the beam splitter

01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:49.040
is now entering the
balanced homodyne detection,

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.270
which we just discussed.

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:53.320
The output of this beam
splitter-- and there

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.300
are two outputs--
both of them is now

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.040
becoming part of a balanced
homodyne measurement.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.670
And you see the ingredients.

01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:02.900
So this, and this,
will be measured.

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.800
The other input for
the balanced homodyne

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.120
is a strong local oscillator.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.720
The phase of the
local oscillator

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:14.810
is chosen, in one case, that you
measure the x or a 1 quadrature

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:18.280
component, or the p
or the a 2 component.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.490
So now what Alice
has done is, by using

01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:24.060
this balanced
homodyning, she has--

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.730
with this local
oscillator-- has actually

01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:29.430
now performed two measurements.

01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:34.070
The quantum state is destroyed,
but here she gets an x value,

01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:35.345
and here she gets a p value.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.340
So how the magic works out.

01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:44.270
It's really just a few
lines of mathematics, now.

01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:48.170
These were sort of, you
know, twin brothers.

01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:50.610
But it wasn't clear
in which quantum

01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:52.712
state the twin brothers are.

01:20:52.712 --> 01:20:54.212
If you write it
down, and I can show

01:20:54.212 --> 01:20:56.850
you the formula in a moment,
these are twin brothers.

01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:06.790
But those twin brothers-- this
is Brother 1, this is Brother

01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:12.680
2-- are in sort of a
continuum of states.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.480
And when Alice this would
measure that this twin brother

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.930
is in state big X, that would
be a projective measurement.

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:24.490
And Bob's twin brother
would now, with certainty,

01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:28.570
also be in the state, X.

01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:34.460
So therefore, what happens
is, the measurement of x and p

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:38.270
is now producing-- is now,
through the measurement

01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:43.760
process-- putting the other
photon, or the other beam,

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:46.690
the other twin brother, into
a specific quantum state.

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:53.280
And if you look for
few lines of math,

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:57.210
the magic is that the quantum
state-- which is now here,

01:21:57.210 --> 01:22:03.620
with Bob-- turns out
to be a displaced copy

01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:06.070
of the original state.

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:09.930
And the displacement
depends on x and p.

01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:14.750
So if Alice now tells Bob,
hey, I measured x and p,

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:20.170
and Bob is now [INAUDIBLE]
his displacement operator--

01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:21.670
remember, a
displacement operator is

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:26.910
nothing else than an
unbalanced beam splitter,

01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:30.300
with a huge local
oscillator as an input.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.300
So if Bob is now setting up
his displacement operator,

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.210
it makes a displacement
which depends on x and p.

01:22:38.210 --> 01:22:43.270
He can take this other twin
brother, shift it back,

01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:46.530
and he will exactly
regenerate the quantum

01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:50.050
state which Alice had.

01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:52.830
So this is, now,
how a quantum state

01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:57.024
can be transmitted
without having any quantum

01:22:57.024 --> 01:22:58.065
channel for transmission.

01:22:58.065 --> 01:23:00.380
You're not propagating
the quantum state.

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:04.380
You use classical communication,
but the resource you use

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:07.130
is some EPR pairs,
or squeezed light.

01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.760
It's a few lines
of equations, but I

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.300
don't have time
to go through it.

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.730
They're really
annotated in a way

01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:23.240
that I think it will be an
enjoyful reading for you.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.730
Any questions?

01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:27.541
Time is over.

01:23:27.541 --> 01:23:28.040
OK.

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:31.540
A reminder for those who
came late-- this week

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:34.530
we have three classes,
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

01:23:34.530 --> 01:23:36.580
Have a good afternoon.

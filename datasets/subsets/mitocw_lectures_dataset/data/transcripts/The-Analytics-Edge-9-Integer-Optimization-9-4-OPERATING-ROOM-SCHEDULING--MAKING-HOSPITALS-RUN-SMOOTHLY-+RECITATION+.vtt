Hi, this is Angie.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.520
I'll be giving the
recitation this week

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.480
on integer optimization.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.860
In the sports
scheduling lecture,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.290
we saw how integer
optimization was a great way

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.160
to design an optimal schedule.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.620
Today, we'll see how Mount
Sinai Hospital in Toronto

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.950
uses integer optimization to
schedule their operating rooms.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.820
Let's get started.

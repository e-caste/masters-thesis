00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.800
LARRY VALE: When it
comes to public housing,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.790
current concept of
mixed income housing

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.840
really appear very
late in the game

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.700
even though public housing
proponents were very focused

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.100
on incomes right from the start.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.630
Public housing was not
always for the poorest

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.720
and has had a
complex relationship

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.800
with ideas about neighborhoods
and neighborhood renewal.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.720
It's really too simplistic
to think of US public housing

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.410
as a single failed
experiment and as something

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.980
that's now been replaced
by mixed income housing.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.620
I like to think of it
as really a three faced

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.480
social experiment.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.720
There's a first phase that
lasted I think from about 1935,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.240
when the program started,
up until 1960 or so.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.260
And it was not about finding the
poorest people from the worst

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.310
slums and re-housing them.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.630
It was more about
finding the worst slums

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.120
and tearing them down
but not really re-housing

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.110
large numbers of the displaced.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.680
Rather, it was a
chance to seek out

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.730
large numbers of the barely
poor and to build public housing

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.310
communities selectively
from those people.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.940
We don't call them low
income because they probably

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.930
had incomes between 50% and
80% of the area of median,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.980
but they're not very low
income and they're not

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.180
extremely low income
the way that we

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.880
would talk about it today.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.810
But by 1960 or so, and
lasting until 1990 at least,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.150
public housing really
took a different attitude

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.230
towards those who
ought to be housed.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.540
By the mid and late
1960s, public housing

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.960
was predominantly serving a
very low income constituency.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.990
And by the 1980s, an
extremely low income

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.090
constituency, meaning that
it went from 50% or 60%

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.820
of the area median into
between 30% and 50%

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.550
and then all the way
down to about 15% or 20%

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.430
of the median income
by the 1990s or so.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.970
And so that's the phase
of welfare housing

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.070
that we think about
as a second phase.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.490
And since 1990 or
so, there's really

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.040
been a third face, a
series of initiatives

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.900
to return more of public
housing to that first phase

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.030
of selectivity to really try
and find again the people who

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.920
have less extremely low incomes
to give work preferences

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.340
and things like that and to
engage in mixed income housing.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.500
And that's really had
a lot of demolition,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.690
new communities that are
built with different income

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.960
structures, and rule structures.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.600
The images that you
see show three phases

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.690
using Chicago's Cabrini
Green as an example.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.800
I'm not going to talk
much here about Cabrini,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.740
but when we get to class, it'll
be one of the key case studies,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.300
especially since I've
recently completed a book that

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.110
features this place.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.820
But you can see it's a slum.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.720
The blueprint's to build
high rise public housing

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.970
that you see in the middle.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.380
And more recently, the
demolition that that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.330
has occurred.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.520
A lot of people have
had different responses

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.880
to public housing.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.830
And I think it's worth
looking at three of them.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.710
First is that
journalists and scholars

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.570
did have some initial
enthusiasm for the program

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.050
and then a lot of controversy,
leading to a second phase

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.840
that one might call the design
in decline and fall literature,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.020
where everybody seemed to be
telling a story about failures

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.570
of one kind or
another, whether it's

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.320
a failure of design or
management or something else.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.140
But since the late '90s,
2000 or so, there's

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.589
been a series of
revisionist efforts,

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.960
to really rethink the
complexity of public housing

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.570
and the values of
what has taken place.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.930
And not see everything
as a complete disaster.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.000
I tend to go really far
back in thinking about it.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.680
And you don't have to do
it entirely to the 1600s

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.060
to make sense of this.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.990
But I think it's
important to talk

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.570
about ideology and institutional
origins of public housing

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.740
and not treat this as simply
something that emerges

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.040
in the 1930s out of nowhere.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.980
You may not want to go all
the way back to the 1630s

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.625
as I tried to do in my book.

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:02.250
And you certainly don't need to
do that if you come from places

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.960
that are very distant
for many Puritans,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.110
but I see a long
continuity in housing

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.870
over questions of
really moral judgment.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.650
On the one hand, there's
a reward tradition,

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.180
a sense that the government
can help low income

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.160
people in ways that reward them
for certain kinds of behaviors.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.630
So in the upper right, you can
see an African American family

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.330
taking advantage
of the Homestead

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.220
Act in the mid 19th century.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.660
The system that enabled you
to get entire plots of land

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.812
if you would promise
to work and live on it

00:05:42.812 --> 00:05:45.020
and then it would become
yours after a certain number

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.770
of years.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.050
So there's a tradition
that goes with pensions

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.110
for veterans and other kinds
of reward that tie housing

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.230
to good behavior
and particularly

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.954
good working behavior.

00:05:58.954 --> 00:06:00.370
And then there's
another tradition

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.184
that I might call
the coping tradition.

00:06:02.184 --> 00:06:03.850
If you look at the
bottom right, there's

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.830
a picture of one of the
[INAUDIBLE] houses in Boston.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.230
This one's from
about 1800, designed

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.190
by Charles [INAUDIBLE], the
same guy that did the State

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.380
House just a few years earlier.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.870
And it had a wing for men and
a wing for women and a chapel

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.490
in between.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.660
And this was the
place where people

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.612
went if they really couldn't
afford to live on the town.

00:06:24.612 --> 00:06:27.070
They didn't have friends or
family that could support them.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.040
So the state built
a grand edifice

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.380
and built a lot of them.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.280
So you have on the one
hand, certain housing

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.650
that is given as a reward
for certain behavior

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.560
and then another
tradition that's

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.990
really about coping with
a set of people that

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.310
are not behaving as needed.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.820
By the end of the
19th century, you

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.590
get one of my favorite books.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.800
This is called Civilizations
Inferno-- Studies

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.090
in the Social Cellar by a man
named Benjamin Orange Flower.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.320
It's the equivalent of the Jacob
Riis book about New York, How

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.300
the Other Half Lives.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.410
But this one's about Boston.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.350
And if you look
at it, it's a kind

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.510
for the society, the
frontispiece piece of the book

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.250
here.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.060
It shows the happy,
wealthy people

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.450
in the top dancing
in their town home

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.470
while increasingly
levels dire circumstances

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.830
of poverty lurking below them.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.140
The immediate next lower level
are the well intentioned men

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.660
that are out of work.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.930
The Depression of
1893 was happening.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.930
And they were people for
whom no fault of their own,

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.810
they were out of
work, in trouble,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.710
and poor for that reason.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.510
And then there's a
second deserving poor.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.560
The widows and
orphans that you can

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.940
see in the third lower level.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:01.910
And those two were a piece of
the poor of a city like Boston.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.200
But then there was
the social cellar.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.890
They the undeserving poor.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.210
The criminals, the
misbehaving masses tht

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.810
couldn't quite be trusted.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.030
And this is the
kind of thing that

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.310
made it very
complicated to decide

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.180
what is the role of
the government when

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.600
it comes to housing.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.180
So when you get
housing authorities,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.670
and here's a picture
of the men who

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.840
formed the five person
Boston Housing Authority,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.130
meaning the board of the
authority in the 1940s,

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.909
you had a sense of judging
poverty in a different sense.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.919
They wanted to make
sure that the people who

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.900
came into public housing were
from that second and third tier

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.370
and not from the fourth tier.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.440
And even better,
they wanted to find

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.660
people that were ready
to move up into the top.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.290
That were not going to
be employed very long

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:01.390
and were not just deserving
poor, but actually

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.900
ready to move onward
into the middle class

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.730
and wouldn't need public
housing very long.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:12.260
So you can see if you look at
a variety of graphic imagery

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.610
from all over the country,
the different housing reports

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.050
and other city agency
reports were setting

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.750
a contrast between
public housing and slums

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.490
that was really very important.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.630
The 1930s and '40s
were a time when

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.390
people focused on sub
clearance and employment

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.070
in the building trades.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.660
And so when you got to
the Housing Act of 1937,

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.640
it linked all new low rent
housing to slum clearance.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:45.609
It mandated an equivalent
elimination agreement.

00:09:45.609 --> 00:09:47.400
In other words, public
housing construction

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.970
had to be accompanied by
what they called elimination

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.120
by demolition or condemnation
or effective closing

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.690
or the compulsory
repair and improvement

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.330
of unsafe or insanitary
dwelling situated

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.700
in the locality or
metropolitan area.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.720
And that that was going to be
substantially equal the number

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.310
to the number of newly
constructed dwellings

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.675
provided by the project.

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.050
So in other words,
public housing

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:17.120
was intended not to compete with
anything in the private sector

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.210
because it wasn't going to
make any gains in the low rent

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.720
housing stock.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.710
Even if elimination was achieved
by rehabilitation rather than

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.540
demolition, the
improved properties

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.930
were probably going to
cost a lot more and demand

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.450
substantially higher
monthly rentals.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.430
So what this did was to
require or at least encourage

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.940
public housing construction
in inner city neighborhoods

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.040
rather than the more
affluent peripheral areas.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.340
So it was almost a form
of neighborhood renewal

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.460
in the form of
replacement housing

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.250
even though many
other neighborhoods

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.270
were cleared for
other purposes that

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.960
included more private purposes
rather than public ones.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.910
So the Newark
example, the green one

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.790
near towards the bottom
right, is a pretty good one.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.020
It's a booklet that shows
the changes between people

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.800
in the slum in the
upper left side of it

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.310
and the public housing
in the bottom right side.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.090
It's almost a
environmental determinism

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.800
from badly behaved people
that need the police

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.360
and sit on stoops and don't
do the things they're supposed

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.080
to do to the Boy Scouts
and the happy woman

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.600
at her sink and
the people playing

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.930
in their yard and the sunshine
and the lighter colors

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.200
that predominate.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.940
It's almost implying
that the new appliances

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.260
are leading to new behavior.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.630
But it's really in practice
more changing of people

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.050
rather than changing in them.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.730
At least it's worth
thinking about.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.580
It may be just a
different set of people.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:08.350
I was struck by that constantly
when I looked at this.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:13.340
So slum clearance had multiple
forms of justification,

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:19.180
mostly having to do with
issues of crime and health.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.344
Chicago, in this
brochure, depicted itself,

00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:25.260
meaning the housing
authority, depicted itself

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.340
as having what they
called a dirty backyard.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.840
And it is a very
revealing evidence

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.670
for how one thinks about the
relationship between the haves

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.330
and the have nots and the sense
that the dirty backyard had

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:45.600
to be cleaned up for the benefit
of those that were valuing it.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.580
The goal was to deal
with what were called

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.460
streets of dreariness and
the dangerous people that

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.750
lived in them.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.040
It's a sense that these
were a menace to themselves.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.330
So they did charts
like once that compared

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.660
the prevalence of
fires and tuberculosis

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.580
and violence and juvenile
delinquency between slum areas

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.150
and non slum areas.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.630
And there's a
picture on the left

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.390
of a family that has a
caption and another place that

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.900
makes clear that this is
supposed to be telling you

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.900
about the evils of broken
families in the slums

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.960
because the husband has run
off and abandoned these women

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.960
and girls in that place.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:36.140
So these attitudes towards
the slums of people and places

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.380
to get rid of were
implied largely

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.640
to do with things like disease.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.840
The health risks of bad housing
were promoted constantly

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.030
in all the brochures
and annual reports

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.680
and report-- and other
documents that came out

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.420
during the '30s and '40s.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.900
The health risks were paramount.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:05.180
But there was also a set
of rewards that were still

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.170
part of the tradition.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.320
The public housing
had really inherited

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.890
from both sides of that reward
and the coping mechanism.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.320
For the most part,
in the '40s, it

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.060
was still part of
the reward tradition.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.390
It was used to reward
returning veterans,

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:24.100
like you can see in the
upper left in Los Angeles.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:30.360
It's an effort to, as
the middle one says,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.590
make juvenile gangsters
take a back seat.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.880
And it's still that
19th century sense

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.850
of public housing as a
reward for good behavior

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.410
and an accompanying mistrust
for many of the poor.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:50.100
It really is constant
across the country.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.560
Here's one of my
favorite examples.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.780
In Boston, the Boston
Housing Authority

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.670
used dramatic photographs
in their annual report.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.010
This is from the 1940s or so.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.890
And these binary juxtapositions.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.160
Out of the shadows,
into the sun.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.350
It says, if you
can't quite read it,

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:14.910
after they built the first
eight of these projects,

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.870
the housing authority wanted
to take stock in the 1940s.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.780
And they said it beheld eight,
clean shining developments

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.350
rising fresh to the sun where
once, in dreary dirt filled

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.930
dilapidation, slum
dwellings had shambled

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.650
in contaminating hopelessness
against a gray and somber sky.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.100
So even the weather was going to
get better from public housing.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.740
But something's
really missing here,

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.530
or at least it's
very misleading.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.270
The implication of
the text and the image

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.390
is that the children
from the shadowy alleys

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.640
are being rescued
by transporting them

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.960
into the sunshine and the
openness of public housing.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.580
But I guarantee you
none of those kids

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.030
in the left picture ended
up being the happy kids

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.290
in the sunshine in the right.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.120
Or at least it's very unlikely.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.200
When I looked at the records,
I saw that of the first four

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.910
public housing developments
in Boston, between 50% and 80%

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.360
of the people
actually sought entry

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.430
into them that were
the ones completed

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.640
under the Housing Act of 1937.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.170
But when I actually examined
the lists of tenants

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.090
in these places, I found
that only between 2% and 12%

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.660
of the projects
had actually gained

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.790
a place-- the people gained
a place in the project.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.440
And this is not atypical.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.230
I've seen statistics
for New York that

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.790
showed that all the way
up to 1957, only about 18%

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.130
of the former residents
of public housing sites

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.800
were re housed in the
new public housing.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.340
If the patterns were
consistent around the country

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.570
as I think they may have
been, it's more evidence then

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.320
that the goals of public
housing were not really centered

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.730
on serving the people who
were displaced to create it.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.580
There was just intense
scrutiny about who

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.530
was wanted in public housing.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.690
You had to have a head
of the household that

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.750
was a US citizen, it
was segregated by race,

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.900
it had family sizes that
had to be between two

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.290
and nine persons so you
couldn't be a single person.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.079
You couldn't have a large
family or an extended family.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.910
You certainly couldn't be
a gay or lesbian couple.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.619
There were no rooming
houses available,

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:21.400
no living with friends, nobody
without a stable employment

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.829
to pay the rent.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:28.670
It was a very selective effort
to find a public citizen.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:33.960
And I like this image in the
upper left of the young child

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.130
and his picket fence
in the new Norfolk,

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.690
Virginia public housing
called a citizen

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.580
of Norfolk's Merrimack Park.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.560
They were very pleased
with the people

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.110
that they got, whether
it was toddlers or teens.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.620
In the upper right,
the caption says

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.660
boy meets girl in a
Brentwood Park home.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.680
All three look nice.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.170
That's the thing
that was going on.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:03.290
But if you look at the bottom
chart also from Norfolk,

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.880
it's an analysis of
who really is intended

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.870
to receive public housing.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.910
They said they've
got 47,000 dwellings

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.450
and only 17,000 of
them are substandard.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.789
But of those 17,000
that are substandard,

00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:22.330
which would seem to
be the good place

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.030
to look for public
housing residence,

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.880
they found that 4,000 earn
too much for public housing,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.250
meaning they really
weren't all that poor.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.650
But 7,000 earned too little.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.680
In other words,
only 6,000 of 17,000

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.440
were the target audience.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.480
What does it really mean to earn
too little for public housing?

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.050
It means that they
were targeting

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:51.620
not the lowest of the
incomes, but a near poor group

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.330
of people.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.320
And not worrying so much about
the people at the bottom.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.620
They were more interested
in seeing public housing

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.790
as a social progression.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.890
In many cases, all the way
from a slum by way of public

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.350
housing up to home ownership.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:13.650
This thing appears repeatedly,
whether in text or in graphics.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.280
The upwardly mobile working
class were intended.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.294
Built in a mixed
income community,

00:19:20.294 --> 00:19:21.460
if you want to call it that.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.650
It's just that nobody was very
rich and nobody was very poor.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.390
The assumptions were there
about upward mobility

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.830
towards home ownership.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.550
Race is undergirding
all of this, of course.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:40.650
This is a Miami example of
the situation prevailing

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:45.319
in what they inelegantly called
the central negro district, not

00:19:45.319 --> 00:19:47.610
the central business district,
but you can see that off

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.693
to just the right of that.

00:19:48.693 --> 00:19:52.550
But actually an area that
was seen as a district

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.720
defined by race.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.270
And really vilified by race.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.320
If you look at the bottom right
the section of the Coconut

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.970
Grove negro area
as they called it,

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.800
the blocks are
classified by what

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.030
was called the
block median penalty

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:14.430
score, with red and black
being-- red and brown

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.239
being the worst cases.

00:20:17.239 --> 00:20:19.030
And so you could see
a lot of it was there.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.850
And that had to do with
lending and the things that

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:27.000
were going on and a way of
self-fulfilling a prophecy

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.440
of disinvestment in the place.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.730
So this kind of a situation
where white and race were tied

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.230
into it were really important.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.370
And there certainly were efforts
going on into the '40s and '50s

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.890
to cope with white
racism and deal

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:49.890
with the extent to which
public housing still

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:55.400
needed to be seen as entering
into a segregated city.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.280
The right side is the
Baltimore urban league's effort

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.330
to try and downplay the fears
of a changing neighborhood.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.570
But those things were
very much a part of it.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.920
And so public
housing gets built.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.000
And after a short while where
many people were very positive

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.710
about it, you enter into
decline and fall literature,

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.130
where a lot of the scholarship
from the 1970s and '80s

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.660
was just relentlessly
negative about public housing.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.720
Lee Rainwater's book Behind
Ghetto Walls from 1970

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:37.200
about Pruitt-Igoe, written just
before the demolition of it.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.230
Or the book by
Arnold Hirsch, Making

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.150
the Second Ghetto in the 1980s.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.830
And then by the 1990s,
Alex Kotlowitz's book,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.770
There Are No Children Here,
about the impossibility

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:56.190
of childhood in the Henry
Horner Homes of Chicago.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.435
Those things were happening.

00:21:58.435 --> 00:22:00.330
But what I find
really interesting

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.200
is that there have been
revisionist lenses that

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.140
really do matter.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.126
Since about 2000,
new ways of looking.

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:11.320
Thinking about what success
has been or could be,

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.240
taking the role of tenants
much more seriously.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.090
And also really thinking
about the role of design.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.100
So if we say a little
bit about each of those.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.640
In 2008 and 2009,
I was fascinated

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.090
to see two books with almost
diametrically opposed titles

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.060
come out.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.490
Brad Hunt wrote about Chicago
with the title Blueprint

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:38.510
for Disaster-- The Unraveling
of Chicago Public Housing.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.850
At almost the same
time, Nick Bloom

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.960
is writing a book called Public
Housing That Worked-- New

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.840
York in the 20th Century.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.510
Now, one could think it's
just the time period.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.420
The middle volume here, When
Public Housing Was Paradise

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.810
is a book about
Chicago in its first 20

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.770
years of public housing.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.330
But Bloom's book
says public housing

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.730
worked in the 20th century,
meaning all the way up

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.200
until pretty recently.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.350
Since 2000, I think there's been
a lot more publicity for New

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.940
York and [INAUDIBLE] problems.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.280
And it suggests that some
places, including the city that

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.960
has the most public
housing, is very far

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.290
from the worst case situation.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.710
But Chicago was probably
the worst for the longest.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.470
Though several other cities
had lawsuits and receiverships

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:34.460
and HUD takeovers and all
sorts of things like that.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.860
In Boston, for instance,
there was a receiver, really

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:43.750
the first of this who took
over in 1980, Harry Spence.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:48.600
And the court put him in charge
and told him to try and fix

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.500
a very broken system.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.150
The Boston Globe
magazine cover here

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:58.110
says that, I think, in some
really interesting ways.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.270
Think about what
you're seeing here.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.200
What is this
suggesting about how

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.350
positive change comes about?

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.810
Can this man save
public housing?

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.310
Is that the right question?

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.420
What is it actually asking?

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.230
I want to return to this
image when we get to class

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.840
and talk about it and
try to deconstruct

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.040
it a little bit more.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:19.850
So think about it.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.640
Think what you're seeing here.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.770
I think that picture
and that sentence

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:30.020
is encoding the whole history
of American housing very neatly

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.130
in a single composite image.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.660
So think about what
you're seeing here.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.050
It's not the only picture
like, that strangely.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.830
A decade later, another
housing authority in crisis,

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.690
another newspaper,
Sunday Magazine,

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.740
is asking a similar question.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.730
Can this man save the CHA,
the Chicago Housing Authority.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.770
This time, the man is the
head of the CHA, Vincent Lane,

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.460
a former developer.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.670
And at least he gets to pose
on top of the buildings,

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.240
it's Cabrini Green.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.130
I'm not sure that's
an advantage, though.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:07.020
Is he dwarfed by the challenge
or is he on top of his world?

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.810
You can make your own guess.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.360
He didn't last very long
despite making some very highly

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.870
publicized interventions
of the mixed income

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.800
housing at Lake park place.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.240
The anti-drug sweeps
that brought him national

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.570
and international attention.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:28.450
And by 1995, the CHA was
taken over by HUD from '95

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:29.860
until 1998.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.730
And then they launched the
famous Plan for Transformation

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.870
in 2000, which we'll talk
about a bit in class.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.710
So there's a very mixed
record of achievement

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:44.150
from the successes to the
failures to the ambitious plans

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.480
to try and turn failure
back into success.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.510
But one of the things
that I find so striking

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:57.420
in recent years is that there's
a latter day revaluation

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:03.160
and revaluing the activism of
the tenants, the residents.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.000
It's really a change
in the scholarship

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.240
about public housing.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.470
More of it has become
tenant centered.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.590
It's not just about public
politicians and housing

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.890
authority leaders.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.800
But it's about the
coping mechanisms

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.630
of tenants who've had to
endure terrible conditions.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.010
It puts people like
Thelma Smith, who's

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.320
in the middle picture, a tenant
leader at Boston's Franklin

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.960
Field development, it puts them
at the center of the picture

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.210
and not shunted to the margins.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.520
Rhonda Williams's
book about Baltimore,

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.120
The Politics of Public
Housing, is one.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.040
Roberta Feldman
and Susan Stall's

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.440
book, The Dignity of Resistance,
about women tenant activists

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.050
at Chicago's Wentworth Gardens.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:53.610
Sudhir Venkatesh's complex view
of the complexities of gang

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.450
culture and politics and
economics at Robert Taylor

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:01.960
Homes in Chicago, American
Project, a project that is now

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.590
demolished and we'll
talk about what's

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.120
happened to that as well.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.660
My own reclaiming public
housing book about the 50 year

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.960
struggles of three
communities in Boston

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.700
to try and get past
dire conditions

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.504
and return to
desirable communities.

00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:21.170
And I think a lot of
people have started

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.990
asking the question that's
posed in the title of the book

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.290
by Larry Bennett, Janet
Smith, and Patricia Wright,

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.660
Where Are Poor People To Live?

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.890
It's not so obvious
as public housing

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.360
itself has come to change.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.060
The last of the
real changes that I

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.030
think is starting to take
place is a more complex view

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.450
about the role of design.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.470
More of the thinking
and the writing

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:50.610
has emphasized the
importance of design.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.760
There was always a long
history emphasizing

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.610
the negative consequences
and design was always

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.990
a key part of that.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.800
The fact that it
was initially built

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.490
to emphasize the distinctiveness
of public housing,

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.940
not to just be bare and
austere and off putting,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.630
but to appear as a security
and safe and modern alternative

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:17.820
to the wooden fire traps
of the aging slums.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.030
You can see in the middle of
the picture of the Orchard Park

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.080
development built in 1942 in
Boston, although the pictures

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.255
from 2000 and then a picture
just a few years later of Hope

00:28:27.255 --> 00:28:30.510
Six redevelopment
of Orchard Gardens.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.630
Pretty much the same
spot in the place.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:39.160
But there have been other
aspects to the conversation.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:43.940
When I see the design centered
revisionism that's taking place

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.160
has often taken, again, a
environmental determinist

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.430
stance.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:54.010
There was a book that is little
remembered now by [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.390
and the better known
Christopher Alexander,

00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:01.680
called Community and
Privacy, that's 1965.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:08.470
But it also had the attack on
project centric mentalities

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:13.360
that was much more wildly
and widely influential

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.190
by Jane Jacobs in 1961.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.760
And then by 1972, there
was Oscar Newman's work,

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.690
Defensible Space-- Crime
Prevention Through Urban Design

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.420
that really was
trying to suggest

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.760
that it was possible to
use design and urban design

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.420
to shape behavior.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.760
It was about crime reduction
and showed early cases

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.940
of how public housing
projects could be retrofitted

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.630
and redesigned to make them
safer through residence

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:46.220
by encouraging a territoriality.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:50.020
And it was fascinating to
me in the mid 1990s the way

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.020
HUD embraced Oscar Newman's
defensible space ideas

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:59.930
and had him author an
entire manual in the 1990s.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:05.070
And soon after that, HUD
embraced the new urbanist wing.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.560
You can see a
co-authored publication,

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.360
Principles for Inner
City Neighborhood Design

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.420
at the left.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.440
And particularly emphasizing
the neo traditional development

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.370
side of new urbanism
and was really

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.380
trying to rethink the whole
overall image of public housing

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.930
developments.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.900
So rather than public housing
being this deliberately

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.880
different looking
modernist alternative

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.080
to decrepit and ill provisioned
rows of wooden or brick

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.590
townhouse that that seem to
signify mid century blight

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:38.070
and slum conditions, the
new urbanist paradigm wanted

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.120
to sanitize an
update the reputation

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.610
of the pre modern urban models
and make future public housing

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.740
look much more like
private sector neighbors.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.300
Not standing implacably, in
part from the [INAUDIBLE],

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.230
the colors in the
Orchard Garden look

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.400
pretty different
than anything you'd

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.990
find in that part
of the neighborhood.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.420
It still stands out, but it
stands out in a different way.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.040
The goal if you take defensible
space and new urbanism

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.190
together is a tableau of
middle class Americana, that

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.980
normalizes the appearance
of public housing

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.420
to a point where it really
could be accepted again

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.344
into the fabric of existing,
market friendly neighborhoods.

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:20.760
And that's pretty
necessary if you

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.460
want to start thinking
about mixed income.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.810
But it raises a question.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:34.710
Does Hope Six and HUD's
program with its picket fences

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.600
and pastel facades, it's a
new look for public housing

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.130
and it's buried within a
larger concept of mixed income

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.260
housing, it's managed
by private firms rather

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.810
than the public sector,
but is it actually

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.770
displacing the poorest again
just like they were displaced

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.110
from the slums to build
public housing back

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.980
in the '30s and '40s?

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.630
There's a book by
Edward Goetz that's

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:04.640
coming out in 2013 called New
Deal Ruins-- Race, Economic

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.250
Justice, and Public
Housing Policy.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.820
And I had a chance to look
at an advance copy of it.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:13.270
And it's an entire book about
public housing demolition.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.290
And it really strongly critiques
the extent of displacement

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.740
caused by Hope Six and
suggests that displacement

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.250
has been disproportionately
born and has

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.000
had a disproportionately
negative impact on African

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.520
Americans.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.370
My own book, which is
also due out in 2013,

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.390
is called Purging the Poorest--
Public Housing and the Design

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.400
Politics of Twice
Cleared Communities.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.660
And despite its
title, it's probably

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.340
a little more evenhanded
than the Goetz book,

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.860
but it's attempting
to understand

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.500
why the leadership
of some cities,

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.480
particularly
Atlanta and Chicago,

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.960
has been so intent on
introducing mixed income

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.070
communities to replace
the public housing

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.120
projects of the past.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.520
So really, what I've
wanted to do here

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.070
is to frame some of the current
challenges of mixed income

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.874
housing.

00:33:01.874 --> 00:33:03.540
I hope you're going
to keep in mind some

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.110
of these deeper cultural issues
that I've been discussing here.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.470
It's not just public
housing about our attitudes

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:14.020
towards the housing
that is important.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.680
It also matters what we mean
by the public in public housing

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.510
and which parts of that
public are expected

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.990
to benefit from
housing redevelopment

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:26.970
and what form those
benefits ought to take.

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.220
And those are the
things that I hope

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.920
you'll think about in
the days up to class

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.150
and we'll get a chance to
talk in person very soon.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.700
Thanks.

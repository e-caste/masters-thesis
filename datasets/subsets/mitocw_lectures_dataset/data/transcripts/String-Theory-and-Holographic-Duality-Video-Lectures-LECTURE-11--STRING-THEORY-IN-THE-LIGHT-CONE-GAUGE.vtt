00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.800
PROFESSOR: No, no minus sign.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.280
I think maybe-- yeah, it
should be a plus sign.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.780
Yeah.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.500
Should be a plus sign.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.440
Yeah.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.090
Yeah, you should correct that
minus sign to a plus sign.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.510
Yeah, both should be plus sign.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.760
Yeah-- I wrote on my
notes was correct,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.510
but then on this board,
somehow-- [INAUDIBLE] maybe

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.270
I should have a minus
sign and put it there.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.800
But didn't realize.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.300
Yeah.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.835
So let me first remind you
what we did in last lecture.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.720
So first, we have
some gauge symmetries

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.645
on the [? worksheet. ?]
And then we

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:11.820
can use that, say, [INAUDIBLE]
traditional symmetry.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.320
You can re-parametrize the
[? worksheet ?] coordinates,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.090
and also to a [? while ?]
scaling for the metric itself.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.980
Use those freedom, we can
set the metric to, just

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.510
to the flat Minkowski metric.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.260
[? On worksheet. ?]

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.090
Now after you do that, then
the [? worksheet ?] action

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.650
then becomes just like
a free scalar field.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.360
Then of course, the
equation of motion

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.730
is just given by the
standard [? wave ?] equation.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.900
I then can solve it immediately.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.520
And essentially, you just
have some left-moving wave,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.130
some right-moving wave,
and plus, some zero modes.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.310
And then for a
closed string, these

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.620
are independent functions.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.640
So then for the
closed string, closed,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.930
so you can have independent
left-moving modes,

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.489
and then also independent
right-moving modes.

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.155
And but for the open
stream, because you

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:13.530
have boundary
conditions, and then

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.840
you only have one set of
modes, because you are-- yeah,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.210
because boundary conditions
give you a constraint.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.500
So it's just like you
have a standing wave.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.040
And then X l should
be equal to L r.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.580
Yeah, X l should
be equal to X r.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.740
But this is not-- but
[? quantized ?] string theory,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.010
even in this gauge, is not just
quantized scalar field theory,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.150
because we still need
to solve the equation

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.530
motion come from doing
the variation of gamma

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.560
a b themselves.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.560
And the way you do the variation
of gamma a b themselves,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.040
they see [INAUDIBLE] to set the
stress tensor of this scalar

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.630
field theory zero.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.960
Yeah, to set the zero,
the stress tensor.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.320
And so, already,
just-- yeah, so they're

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.890
two independent equations.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.550
Y is the diagonal component.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.580
It should be zero.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.140
And then the other is the
off-diagonal component,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.120
should be zero.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.250
So you have two
sets of equations.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.110
And those equations are
in general hard to solve.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.020
So they are non-linear
quadratic equations.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.670
Which I did not write them here.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.260
So they're non-linear
constrained equations, which

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.340
are, in general, hard to solve.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.370
Then the important
trick we discussed

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.510
is that you can go to
the light-cone gauge.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.670
We said even after this
fixing, there's still

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.330
some remaining gauge freedom.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.720
That you can actually make one
more choice to set the X plus,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.940
set it to be the same as tau.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.290
And the X plus, we always
use this definition.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.760
So you can see that the all
directions, X zero, X one, two,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.860
et cetera.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.460
And then we combine
X zero and X one

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.980
together to form X plus X minus.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.779
And then the rest
we call them X i.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.220
So these are also sometimes
called transverse directions.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.390
So also called
transverse directions.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.670
And so now, then we can use
this remaining gauge freedom

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.080
to go to so-called
light-cone gauge.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.980
Then the X plus becomes V plus
times tau, some constant times

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.220
tau.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.320
And then this light-cone
gauge, then those equations

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.010
can be written in
a very simple way.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.300
In particular, the dependence
on X minus becomes linear.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.600
Then you can actually
use these two equations--

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.170
you can solve X minus exactly.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.450
And so this tells
you that actually,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.850
the independent [? degree of ?]
freedom just X i's.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.130
OK?

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.040
The independent [? degree of ?]
freedom just X i's.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.490
Any questions about this?

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.670
So let me just put
the equation number,

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.800
because I'm going to use
this equation number later.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.657
Which inherited from
the last lecture.

00:05:18.657 --> 00:05:20.115
AUDIENCE: So the--
[? confidence ?]

00:05:20.115 --> 00:05:23.296
on the [? energy ?]
[INAUDIBLE] because they're

00:05:23.296 --> 00:05:26.630
[? close together ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.270
PROFESSOR: No.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.770
No.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.900
This come from the equation
motion for gamma a b.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.320
So [? remember, ?]
previously, the gamma a b

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.157
is also a dynamic variable.

00:05:36.157 --> 00:05:37.740
Even when you fix
the gauge, you still

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.330
impose the equation motion.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.460
And so that's essentially this.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.960
Yes?

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:47.370
AUDIENCE: Aren't the
remaining degrees of freedom

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.610
for X minus just because
of the boundary condition,

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.835
or something like that?

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:55.670
Is there a freedom
in specifying that?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.950
PROFESSOR: What--
There's some constant,

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.935
a [? possibility ?] constant
and we can-- of all constants.

00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:06.590
Yeah, because this determines
all the derivative dependents.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.660
And they might be,
overall, constant.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.190
And that you can always--
yeah, it's not important.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.790
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.834
Any other questions?

00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:19.334
Yes?

00:06:19.334 --> 00:06:21.375
AUDIENCE: So going back
to what you said earlier.

00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:23.790
So for the boundary conditions
for the open string,

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.810
the derivative's also positive?

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.130
So there's not a minus sign?

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.350
Let me also add here--
so for the open string,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.070
for the moment, we can see
the so-called Neumann boundary

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.500
condition.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.200
So this is equal to zero.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.090
So that, we'll keep that.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.180
Yeah, so one correction.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.990
In the last lecture, I
wrote a minus sign there.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.230
That should be
corrected by plus sign.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.307
The both equations should
be corrected by plus sign.

00:06:54.307 --> 00:06:54.807
Yeah.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.860
Good?

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.970
So with this set up, then we
are ready for quantization.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.580
Because now, we only need
to quantize the X i's,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.980
because X i's are
independent-- only X i's

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.430
are independent variables.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.770
And so we only need
to quantize X i's.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.340
And X i's, they are
just a free field.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.700
And that's very simple.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.380
OK?

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.715
But before do that, let me
just emphasize one point.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.360
Emphasize one point.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:47.940
So the light-cone gauge,
by making this choice,

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.460
you make those
equations very simple,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.300
but you also
sacrifice something.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.940
Because of the light-cone
gauge, because the [? shaky ?]

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.890
choice itself, it
breaks Lorentz symmetry.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.400
OK?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.060
Because [INAUDIBLE]
[? it lacks ?]

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.170
two special directions.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.920
So X zero X one, and you
form X plus from them,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.412
and you impose some
conditions on X plus.

00:08:19.412 --> 00:08:20.745
So this breaks Lorentz symmetry.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.480
OK?

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.960
So when we say "break,"
this does not really

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.600
break the Lorentz symmetry.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.200
Just say this gauge
choice itself does not

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.630
respect Lorentz symmetry.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.230
OK?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.720
So the theory is still
Lorentz symmetric.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.220
The theory should still
have Lorentz symmetry.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.720
It's just Lorenz
symmetry not manifest.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.145
Say, yeah, say
just not manifest.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.100
Yeah, maybe I should--
using proper English,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:14.780
I should say, in the
light-cone gauge,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.060
Lorentz symmetry
is not manifest.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.954
I think this is a
better way to say it.

00:09:20.954 --> 00:09:21.830
OK?

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.730
It's not manifest.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.990
So this equation breaks
Lorentz symmetry,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.370
and then the Lorentz
symmetry is not manifest.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:37.000
So but there's a third group.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.960
Lorentz symmetry
is still manifest.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.200
So that's the group
which rotates the X i.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:10:01.435
So this remaining s o d minus
two, which rotating X i's.

00:10:04.397 --> 00:10:05.105
This is manifest.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:11.850
OK.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.830
The remaining rotating
X i is manifest.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.070
OK?

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.950
So keep this in mind.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:20.200
OK?

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.450
This is very important point.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.530
OK.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.100
So now we can proceed
to quantize it.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.670
So before doing
the quantization,

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:43.830
let me develop a
little bit further

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.490
to make the task of
the quantization easy.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.750
So I ask, what we do in free
field theory is [? continue ?]

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.260
to expand to those
arbitrary functions in terms

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.310
of Fourier modes.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.430
OK?

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.010
And they are periodic
functions of 2 pi,

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.040
so we can easily expand
them in Fourier modes.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.610
For example, X r X
l mu sigma plus tau

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:22.200
can be written as
i over prime 2.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:39.680
OK?

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.900
So this alpha prime, so this
[? pre-factor ?] is purely

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.710
convention.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.540
OK?

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.240
Just for the later convenience.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.160
And this one over n is
also purely convention.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.210
And you can choose
what you want.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.870
So the key is that
you are expanding

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.800
this periodic function.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.390
Inferior modes.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.870
Because you have to
be periodic in sigma,

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.790
so the coefficient
here must be integer n.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.510
And we exclude
unequal to zero mode,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.100
because the unequal to zero,
this is just a constant.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.590
And that is already
included here.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.320
And that is already
included here.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.750
So we say exclude
unequal to zero.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.870
And also this is
a real function.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.530
Then this means that
the alpha n mu should

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.930
be equal to alpha minus n.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.500
So with this convention
over n here, and with this i

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.580
here, would be alpha
minus n mu [? ba. ?] OK?

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.993
And similarly, you can write
down the expansion for X r.

00:12:56.144 --> 00:12:58.310
Similarly, you can write
down the expansion for X r.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.390
The same [? pre-factor. ?] And
this n sum for minus infinity

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.040
to plus infinity but not
equal to-- unequal to zero,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.850
so we call the modes f
n tilde divided by n.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.510
[INAUDIBLE] tau plus
sigma, tau minus sigma.

00:13:25.842 --> 00:13:26.730
OK?

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.060
And here, again,
alpha tilde mu should

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.500
be equal to [? ba ?]
alpha tilde mu minus n,

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.750
in order this to be real.

00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:55.093
OK.

00:13:55.093 --> 00:13:58.500
For the open string, you
only have one set of modes.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.322
For open strings.

00:13:59.322 --> 00:14:00.530
So this is for closed string.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:09.150
For open string, you
can-- you just have alpha.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:14.560
Yeah, just alpha and mu, you
go to alpha and mu tilde.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.326
So you only have
one set of modes,

00:14:16.326 --> 00:14:17.450
OK, because are they equal.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.290
OK.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:27.590
So you can plug this, those
expressions, into here.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.930
Then you have most general
form of X mu in terms

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.600
of these Fourier modes.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.100
OK?

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.220
So to save time, let
me not do that step.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.570
So you should try to
do-- yeah, just so

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.170
a trivial step of yourself,
write those things

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.539
into a single equation.

00:14:47.539 --> 00:14:49.080
And then that's the
most general form

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.480
of X mu in terms of
these specific modes.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.420
So now let me make some remarks.

00:15:10.464 --> 00:15:12.130
You might wonder,
what's the implication

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.820
of those zero modes here?

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.570
OK?

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.120
So those just
describe the center

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.630
of mass motion of the string.

00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:24.045
Center of mass
motion of the string.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:40.040
It's given by-- say, you just
average the motion of-- you

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.190
average the motion of,
say, of the string.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.240
So that gives you the center
of mass motion of the string.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.910
And all those are
periodic functions.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.230
So all of those are
periodic functions.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.280
So all X a or X r
periodic functions.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.560
So when they integrate,
they give you zero.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.630
So the only thing remaining
are those zero modes.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:12.320
And so you just get
the X mu plus V mu tau.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.960
OK?

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.340
So if you think of the
center of mass of the string,

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.210
that's a particle.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.507
It is a point, it's
a point particle.

00:16:21.507 --> 00:16:23.340
So this essentially
gives you the trajectory

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.880
of the particle in terms
of the proper time.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.925
So you can think of this tau as
the proper time for the center

00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:32.610
of mass of the string.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.640
And then this just-- yeah.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:41.120
V mu is the velocity
for the center

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.740
of mass in terms of the
proper time along the string.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.240
OK?

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.460
And so all these
different alpha n, alpha n

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.050
tilde-- so those
just parametrize

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.730
the different oscillation modes.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.910
So they just parametrize
the different oscillations

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.609
of the string.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.260
Yeah, of a string.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.390
Oscillation of a string.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.590
So any particular
alpha n is non-zero,

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.100
means that particular
harmonic is

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.120
present in the string motion.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.980
Et cetera.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.340
OK?

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.270
And for the closed
string, as I said,

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.140
before we have both
left- and right-moving.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:55.687
Because you have left-
plus right-moving waves.

00:17:55.687 --> 00:17:57.770
But for the open string,
you essentially only have

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:04.630
a standing wave, because
of the boundary condition.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.600
OK?

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.410
So you only have one set
of oscillation modes,

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.310
rather than two sets.

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:16.130
So any questions on this?

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.660
Good?

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.120
So in the light-cone
gauge, we can do further.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.740
Between the light-cone gauge, we
can further solve this X minus.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.959
OK?

00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:35.375
So let's try to
do it classically.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:57.530
In the light-cone gauge-- OK.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:09.950
So X minus can be solved
by inserting the mode

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:27.331
expansion into this
equation 14 on the 15.

00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:27.830
OK?

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:35.530
Then you're just equating
different Fourier modes,

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:48.215
the coefficients of
different Fourier modes.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.880
OK?

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:06.850
And then you can solve V minus,
alpha n minus, alpha n minus,

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.820
alpha n tilde minus, et cetera.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.320
OK?

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.440
So now let's look
at the zero modes.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:24.940
OK?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.405
So let's look at the equation
satisfied by V minus.

00:20:30.177 --> 00:20:31.510
So let's look at the zero modes.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:48.350
So let's look at-- first
look at equation 14.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.920
So if you say zero mode,
means we look at the unequal

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.440
to zero modes.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.220
And equal to zero modes
here, partial tau X minus,

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.670
you just have a V minus.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:05.310
So left-hand side-- so
from 14-- so let's first

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.565
do for the open string.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.595
So left-hand side you
have 2 V [? 2 ?] minus.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.275
So the right-hand side.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.670
So if you look-- again,
you look at the mode,

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.430
which is unequal to zero.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.330
So there's one obvious
term come from just

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.570
taking derivative of this term.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.800
And so we have a
V i squared term.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.930
OK?

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:42.160
And then you will have a
contribution from oscillators.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.930
Which I will not go
into details here.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.840
So you can easily
calculate it yourself.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.540
So you find for the open string.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.550
That's the answer.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.250
And so there's only
one set of modes.

00:21:57.187 --> 00:21:59.145
And similarly, you can
do it for the co-string.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.750
Again, on the left-hand side,
just 2 V plus, 2 V minus,

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.430
and the right-hand side
you have V i squared.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.251
But now you have
two sets of modes.

00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:14.125
And also there's some
coefficient difference.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.870
So other than this
[? pre-factor ?] 2 on the one,

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.600
here, you can actually wrote
down those expression just

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.280
by closing your eyes.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.396
Just write them down.

00:22:47.396 --> 00:22:49.020
Because you have a
zero mode, these two

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.444
have to add up to zero.

00:22:51.444 --> 00:22:52.735
So that's the only possibility.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.520
So other than this
factor of 2 in the one

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.930
you need to check yourself,
you can essentially

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:03.200
write down this
expression immediately,

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.060
just from the structure
of that equation.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:05.559
OK?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.710
AUDIENCE: What's the
definition of V i?

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.180
PROFESSOR: V i is there.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.550
V mu in the i direction.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.410
And V minus, V
plus, it's all that.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.010
So those equations are
of great importance.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.500
And let me box them.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.860
Which is also the reason
I write them down.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.795
So but now, I did not leave
space to give them numbers.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.960
Yeah, anyway, these are the
two equations [? of ?] add

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.310
the numbers [? nature. ?]

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:59.220
From the 15, from
the equation 15-- so

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:04.840
this is a consequence from the
14, the zero modes from the 14.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.940
From the 15, you get nothing.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.900
You get zero equal to
zero for open string.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.160
So this is obvious, because
on the left-hand side, zero,

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:27.002
because for the open
string-- for the-- yeah.

00:24:27.002 --> 00:24:28.710
Yeah, because for
the-- because left-hand

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.800
is zero, because the zero mode
does not have an [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.980
independent sigma.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.610
So this is zero.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.020
And then you [? credited ?] a
little bit checking yourself,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.450
that the right-hand
side is also zero,

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.647
essentially because of
this structure X 0 equal

00:24:44.647 --> 00:24:48.066
to [? X y. ?] Yeah,
X 0 equal to X r.

00:24:48.066 --> 00:24:49.690
And but for closed
string, you actually

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.870
find non-trivial equations.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.870
You find it-- the
left-hand again, is zero.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.880
And the right-hand side--
the right-hand side,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.030
if you want to find the
zero mode, essentially you

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.529
just integrate over
the whole thing.

00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:08.880
So let me just
write it explicitly.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.655
So you can write it
also in terms of modes.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.430
OK.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.220
So this equation is
very interesting.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:08.040
So this tells you that
the overall amplitude

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:12.134
of the left-moving string,
yeah, left-moving modes,

00:26:12.134 --> 00:26:13.550
when you add them
together, should

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:18.880
be the same as the overall
moving, overall amplitude.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:27.800
Say-- yeah, in this combination
of the right-moving string.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.110
OK?

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.800
Yeah, they have to be balanced.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.020
So if we look at the
source of this equation,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.570
and the reason the left-hand
side is equal to zero

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:44.417
is essentially due to the
periodic boundary conditions.

00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:46.500
Because the periodic
boundary-- for closed system,

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.000
because periodic
boundary condition,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.154
you cannot have any
term linear in sigma.

00:26:51.154 --> 00:26:53.320
And the periodic boundary
condition, in other words,

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.460
it means that there is no
special point on the string.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:56.960
OK?

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.840
Any point is the
same as the other.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.220
So your choice of origin
is actually arbitrary.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.160
And so this equation
essentially reflects that.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.740
So the fact along the string,
there's no special point,

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:16.297
and they give you a global
constraint on the oscillation

00:27:16.297 --> 00:27:16.880
of the string.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.409
OK?

00:27:17.409 --> 00:27:19.700
Between the left-moving part
and the right-moving part.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:31.005
And then, if you
look at the-- so

00:27:31.005 --> 00:27:34.985
if you look at the
nth modes, then

00:27:34.985 --> 00:27:39.380
you can find out alpha n minus,
alpha n tilde minus, et cetera.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.105
OK?

00:27:42.105 --> 00:27:44.480
In the piece that you have a
[? problem, ?] you will have

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.438
[? found ?] doing this.

00:27:50.096 --> 00:27:50.970
Any questions so far?

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.490
So now let's look at
the physical meaning

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.811
of those equations.

00:27:58.811 --> 00:27:59.310
OK?

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.840
I boxed them.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.940
I said they are very important.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.800
And now let's look at
the physical meaning

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.610
of those equations.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:27.437
So this can be considered as
consequence of no special point

00:28:27.437 --> 00:28:28.431
on the string.

00:28:35.444 --> 00:28:37.360
And now let's look at
the physical [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.370
of those modes, of
those equations.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.310
So this is the fourth comment.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.630
The third remark--
fourth remark.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:55.380
So let me remind you that
previously, the action

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.505
have the global symmetries.

00:29:02.922 --> 00:29:04.380
So this comes from
the translation.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.512
Sorry, by some
constant [? m a ?] mu,

00:29:12.512 --> 00:29:13.845
all are Lorentz transformations.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.990
OK?

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.902
So those global
symmetries, as we know,

00:29:20.902 --> 00:29:23.027
they are [INAUDIBLE] to
[? conserve ?] the current.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:34.567
Conserved current on
the [? worksheet. ?] OK?

00:29:34.567 --> 00:29:35.525
On the [? worksheet. ?]

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:43.175
So for the moment, let us
consider the translation.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.350
So it's actually-- so
it's a couple of lines,

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.080
but I will leave you
to do it yourself.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.420
I think you will also do
it in your [? p ?] set.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.500
To derive the conserved
current for this one.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.820
So let me just write
down the answer.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:14.140
So the conserved current for the
translation-- for translation,

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.847
you can derive the conserved
current because this [? t ?]

00:30:19.847 --> 00:30:20.430
such symmetry.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:23.460
For each mu, there's a symmetry.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.350
So the current is labeled by mu.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.690
But there's also
[? worksheet-- ?] index

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:31.550
to index, this is a current
on the [? worksheet. ?] OK?

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:35.310
So this can be written
as 2 pi alpha prime.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:42.760
So I'm just writing down
the answer, but you should--

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.510
you will check yourself
in the [? piece ?]

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.840
that this is the right answer.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.950
OK?

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.320
So you can immediately see
that this current is conserved,

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.060
because the-- if you
act partial a on here,

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.010
you just get the equation
motion when it's zero.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.690
Equation motion just
partial a squared

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:05.021
equal to partial a squared
acting on x mu equal to zero.

00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:05.520
OK?

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.845
So you can immediately see
this is indeed conserved.

00:31:08.845 --> 00:31:09.595
This is conserved.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.270
And then this will lead
us to a conserved charge.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:16.770
OK?

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.820
Say, if I integrate it
all along the string--

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.030
so let's do the-- for example,
for the closed string,

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:27.980
if I integrate it for the
string, and this partial zero

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.240
component.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.490
So the zero component, so the
time component of this current,

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:39.120
and then this is conserved
charge on the worksheet.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.760
OK?

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.330
So do you have any guess what
should be this conserved charge

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:49.585
equals 1 [? to? ?] Yes?

00:31:52.832 --> 00:31:54.194
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:54.194 --> 00:31:54.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.551
Should be, must be, the
space-time momentum.

00:31:58.551 --> 00:31:59.050
OK?

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.230
In your-- maybe
[? level ?] one, you

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.340
should have learned
that-- say, if you

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:17.940
look in the classical
mechanics, for particle move

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.160
with the translation
symmetry, then

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.070
the momentum should
be conserved.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.770
OK?

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:26.600
So here, we have a string with
the translation symmetry--

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.220
moving the space time is
a translation symmetry--

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.900
and then the corresponding
momentum must be conserved.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.681
And this conserved charge
must be that momentum.

00:32:36.681 --> 00:32:37.180
OK?

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.789
So these scenes-- so
if I can see the p mu,

00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:52.330
so let me write in
the p [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:57.795
if you can see the p mu, which
is this integration of 2 pi.

00:32:57.795 --> 00:32:59.170
So this is for
the closed string.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.680
Similarly, for the open
string, you integrate over pi.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.510
So this must be-- so
this is the space time.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.020
So this-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.000
This is a space-time
momentum over the string.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.500
OK?

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:55.110
Yes?

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.026
AUDIENCE: What's the
definition of d partial a

00:33:57.026 --> 00:34:00.880
in the definition
of the current?

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.760
PROFESSOR: So this is
a conserved current,

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.520
because [? one ?] into
this global translation.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.737
AUDIENCE: But what's d sub a?

00:34:08.737 --> 00:34:09.320
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.350
Just the derivative of a.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:12.679
Derivative of sigma a.

00:34:15.224 --> 00:34:17.320
So I have always
used a notation here.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:24.230
That the partial a
is partial sigma a.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.219
So I should-- this goes to one
into the space time momentum

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:35.889
over the string.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:39.230
OK?

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.110
So for the closed string, you
integrate from zero to 2 pi.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.245
From open string, you're not
going from only from zero

00:34:45.245 --> 00:34:46.690
to pi.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.925
So now if you plug in that
mode expansion to here,

00:34:49.925 --> 00:34:51.300
again, all the
oscillatory modes,

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.080
they should not contribute.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.090
OK?

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.880
And because this is a-- you can
check they do not contribute.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.260
So the only thing
contribute is zero modes.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:09.200
So you find that
this V mu, p mu,

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:14.086
is equal to v mu
divided by alpha prime.

00:35:14.086 --> 00:35:15.210
So this is a closed string.

00:35:18.469 --> 00:35:20.010
So this is
[? overviews ?] from here,

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.700
because this gives
you v mu times 2 pi,

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.270
and then 2 pi can still
give you alpha prime.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:30.050
But for the open string,
you only integrate over pi.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:32.120
So you get 2 alpha prime.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.670
So this is for the open.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.670
OK?

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.560
Or in other words--
or in other words,

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.600
in terms of the space
time momentum-- so this

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.890
is a more physical quantity
then this v mu-- so

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.330
in terms of the
space time momentum,

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.975
the v mu can be written
as alpha prime p

00:35:51.975 --> 00:35:56.420
mu, which is for the closed.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:01.860
And 2 alpha prime p mu,
this is for the open.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:14.420
And then this itself, of course,
should be in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:28.160
that space-time momentum
density along the string.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.140
OK?

00:36:52.450 --> 00:37:00.610
So now we have found that
the v mu secretly is just

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.071
the space-time momentum.

00:37:02.071 --> 00:37:02.570
OK?

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.111
Essentially just
space-time momentum,

00:37:04.111 --> 00:37:06.670
up to some overall constant.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.510
So now we can integrate
those equations.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.730
Now we can integrate
those equations.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.294
Then we can write them.

00:37:16.294 --> 00:37:17.960
So for example, for
the first equation--

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.335
so now, let me
give you a number.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:26.680
Yeah, actually, on my notes
here, it's equation 18.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.856
Let me just write
the equation 18 here.

00:37:29.856 --> 00:37:31.685
Only this is equation
19 for the closed.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.430
So I have more equation
number in my notes than here,

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:47.550
because I did not copy
all the equations.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.830
Anyway, so that's-- for
example, equation 18.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:02.590
Now I can rewrite it in
terms of the momentum.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:03.780
OK?

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:08.660
So let me put all
v to a single side.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:13.790
So I can write as
2 p plus p minus,

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:18.720
minus p i squared equal to.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.380
So each p [? rated ?] 2 alpha.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.450
Under that 2 alpha here, so
that's 1 over 2 alpha sum

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:34.040
over m equal to zero alpha
m i, alpha minus m i.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:34.540
OK?

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:38.930
OK?

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.670
So now what is this?

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.228
Do you recognize what's this?

00:38:44.228 --> 00:38:45.100
AUDIENCE: p squared.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.475
PROFESSOR: This
is just p square.

00:38:50.765 --> 00:38:54.920
Or depend on your rotation,
is minus p square.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.760
OK?

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.090
Minus p mu, p mu.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:01.100
Maybe-- let me
write [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.540
Minus p mu p mu.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:09.802
So what is minus p mu p mu?

00:39:09.802 --> 00:39:10.760
AUDIENCE: Mass squared.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah it's
the mass squared.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.510
So this equation should be
interpreted as a mass equation.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:22.780
So this tells you--
so it tells you

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:39.800
the mass of the string should
be written as the form-- OK?

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:46.160
So now we have
obtained the relation,

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:54.140
we see that this relation-- so
this is for the open string--

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.732
so we have obtained the relation
between the mass of the string.

00:39:57.732 --> 00:39:59.690
So if you think about
the center-of-mass motion

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:01.820
of a string-- think,
it's like a particle,

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.959
then this particle
can have a mass--

00:40:03.959 --> 00:40:06.500
than this mass over the string,
mass squared over the string,

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:12.080
is related, can be expressed
in terms of oscillation

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.420
modes in this way.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:15.700
OK?

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:23.290
And similarly, this equation
19 for the closed string,

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:28.370
you find that m squared
equal to-- again,

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:38.240
just differ by pre-factor--
then alpha minus m i alpha

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:44.016
m i, plus alpha tilde
minus m i, alpha m i.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:54.790
So this is the mass equation
for the closed string.

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:59.510
So these are typically called
the mass-shell conditions.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:00.589
OK?

00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:01.755
So these are for the closed.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.310
Any questions on this?

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.615
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:14.615 --> 00:41:15.537
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:41:15.537 --> 00:41:17.032
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] tilde?

00:41:17.032 --> 00:41:17.740
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.290
AUDIENCE: Would there
be another tilde?

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:19.940
PROFESSOR: Oh that's right.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.290
Yeah.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:20.789
Thanks.

00:41:34.466 --> 00:41:35.400
Good.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
have a question that here,

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.974
before, it's a
expression that we'll

00:41:40.974 --> 00:41:46.008
have to enter to find
the mass of the string.

00:41:46.008 --> 00:41:47.815
So this is a kind
of a definition

00:41:47.815 --> 00:41:48.815
of the mass of the str--

00:41:48.815 --> 00:41:49.565
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:41:49.565 --> 00:41:53.940
The definition of the
mass of the string

00:41:53.940 --> 00:42:00.561
is determined by how the
center-of-mass motion, right?

00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:02.060
How would you tell
the [? power ?]--

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.730
the particle moves is from
the center-of-mass motion.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:08.680
And that determines its mass.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.540
This is a conserved quantity,
p is a conserved quantity,

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:18.110
and the dispersion relation
determines your mass, right?

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.860
Yes, so this is the mass
in the [? right. ?] Yeah.

00:42:25.407 --> 00:42:26.240
Any other questions?

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:31.637
Good.

00:42:31.637 --> 00:42:33.470
So now, finally, we can
do the quantization,

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:34.636
with all those preparations.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.020
OK?

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.566
So now we can finally
do the quantization.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.506
So similarly, I will not go
into here-- similarly, yeah,

00:42:57.506 --> 00:43:02.675
let me just also mention by
looking at this transformation,

00:43:02.675 --> 00:43:05.480
you can write down the conserved
[? chart, ?] conserved current

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.170
[? running ?] the
Lorentz transformation.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.520
Then that will give you rise
to the angular momentum.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.310
And also give rise to the
corresponding charge associated

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.111
with the boost, et cetera.

00:43:17.111 --> 00:43:17.610
OK?

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.660
And we will not go into
there, they actually

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.860
play a very important role
understand the various aspects

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.460
of the string also.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:31.960
OK.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.927
So now let's-- now
we can quantize it.

00:43:34.927 --> 00:43:37.385
And as we said before, we only
need to quantize independent

00:43:37.385 --> 00:43:40.770
[? degrees of ?]
freedom, so those X i's.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:51.530
So only need to quantize x i.

00:43:54.442 --> 00:43:56.650
Because these are the
independent degrees of freedom.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:05.170
And from here, from here, you
can immediately write down

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:07.470
the canonical momentum.

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.900
Say, the canonical
[? worksheet ?] momentum

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.670
for the string-- for the x i.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:20.370
So the canonical
[? worksheet ?] momentum.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:26.430
So I should distinguish
this with this guy.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.920
So that is the-- this
goes one into the current,

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.190
goes one into the
space-time momentum.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.400
And this is just treating so
this is just treating the x

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.652
i as a two-dimensional field.

00:44:36.652 --> 00:44:38.610
We can write down its
[? worksheet ?] canonical

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:40.420
momentum.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.340
And we just take
the time derivative

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.170
of that action for
the i direction,

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:56.560
and then you find it's given by
2 pi alpha prime partial tau x

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.790
i.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:00.540
OK?

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:04.030
So this is the standard
to the canonical momentum

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.330
for the two-dimensional
field series.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.030
So this happens to agree.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:10.030
So this happens to be the
same as that momentum.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.240
But you should keep in mind that
the physical interpretations

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.700
were a bit different.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.710
There, it's corresponding
to the density

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:22.145
for the space-time momentum,
and here, this just

00:45:22.145 --> 00:45:25.550
goes one into the
canonical momentum,

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:26.710
into the quantization.

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:27.210
OK?

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.195
So now you've found
the canonical momentum,

00:45:34.195 --> 00:45:36.320
then we can just impose
the quantization condition.

00:45:47.029 --> 00:45:48.820
You can just impose
quantization condition.

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:02.930
So now, we will-- you promote
all this as operators,

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:07.150
all the classical field
is promoted as operators,

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:12.750
and then you imposes a canonical
quantization condition.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:18.580
So x i x j, for different x
sigma prime, but evaluated

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.565
same tau, should commute.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.430
You commute.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:36.375
Same thing if you do the pi at
a different sigma prime, but tau

00:46:36.375 --> 00:46:37.000
should commute.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:50.430
But x i sigma tau and
the pi j sigma prime tau

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:55.310
then should give you i delta
i j, then delta function

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.030
sigma minus sigma prime.

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.530
OK?

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:09.750
So this is just the-- you just
impose the-- this a free field,

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.960
you just impose a standard
canonical quantization

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.420
condition as a
two-dimensional field.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:20.900
And now all of these modes,
all these different modes--

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:26.770
oh, which I just erased
half of it-- and all

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:35.040
these different modes--
so x i p i-- so p i-- v

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:41.640
i is the same as v i-- and then
alpha n i, alpha n tilde i,

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.655
they are all operators.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.790
So classically, because
one into integration

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:59.130
constant for the
equation of motion,

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:00.740
and then quantum
mechanically, they

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.830
become integration constant
for your operator equation.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:10.630
So they're just constant
operators quantum mechanically.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:11.920
OK?

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.170
And then when you plug in those
mode expansions into here, just

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:24.810
as usual, in your free
field theory quantization,

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:27.420
then you just find the
accommodation relation.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:35.010
For example, you just find x
i p j equal to i delta i j.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:43.170
Then you also find alpha m
i alpha n j equal to alpha

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:55.007
m tilde i alpha n tilde j
equal to m delta i j delta.

00:48:55.007 --> 00:48:56.840
So I'm just writing
down the answer for you.

00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:08.830
OK?

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:14.377
So this is all straightforward,
other than unconventional

00:49:14.377 --> 00:49:14.960
organizations.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.560
AUDIENCE: So that's things like
delta m minus n, or something?

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:31.310
Yeah.

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:37.880
So now if you look
at this, OK, if you

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.340
look at this, so this is m.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:45.840
So this m is related
to this normalization

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.570
we were choosing here.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.110
Here we are choosing n.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:53.000
[INAUDIBLE] here, there's
appearing some m here.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.640
OK?

00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:00.510
And from this
scene, you can see--

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:06.024
so these all others all other
commutation relation, all

00:50:06.024 --> 00:50:07.065
other commutators vanish.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:09.920
OK.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.860
So these are the only
non-vanishing ones.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:17.940
So if you look at this equation.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:22.620
So let's see for m
greater than zero,

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:27.567
so for m greater than
zero, then this is m,

00:50:27.567 --> 00:50:29.400
then this is only
[? non-manageable ?] for m

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.441
equal to m equal to zero.

00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:35.400
So this alpha m alpha minus
m, then you go to m something.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.540
It's a positive number.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:41.170
So that means, tells
you, that in terms

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:44.872
of a standard location,
square root m alpha

00:50:44.872 --> 00:50:49.206
m i should be interpreted
as the, say, the standard

00:50:49.206 --> 00:50:50.080
[INAUDIBLE] operator.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:58.470
And the square root
m alpha minus m i

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:01.840
should be interpreted
as a i dagger.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.890
So this is all for
m greater than zero.

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:07.350
OK?

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:10.119
Similarly for the tildes.

00:51:10.119 --> 00:51:11.160
Similarly for the tildes.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.820
So that's what the
equation means.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.145
OK?

00:51:16.145 --> 00:51:17.020
So it's clear to you?

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:28.940
Then we essentially-- then
we have essentially finished

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.330
the quantization of the string.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:30.830
OK?

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:39.090
We have solved the
Heisenberg equations.

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:48.260
And so, this is now-- we saw
those modes [? expression ?]

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.350
plug in.

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:55.830
This is now interpreted as to
the solution to the Heisenberg

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:57.710
equations.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.620
And then the integration
constant in these equations,

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.470
they satisfy those
commutation relations.

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:07.120
They satisfy those
commutation relations.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.535
And also, the commutation
relation between x i

00:52:10.535 --> 00:52:13.810
and the p, indeed
is it what you would

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.980
expect for point particle.

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:20.040
So this goes one into the
center-of-mass location

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.920
and the center-of-mass momentum.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.140
And indeed, you would
expect between the position

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.316
and the momentum.

00:52:27.316 --> 00:52:27.816
OK?

00:52:32.232 --> 00:52:32.815
Any questions?

00:52:35.361 --> 00:52:35.860
Yes?

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:39.208
AUDIENCE: Are we dropping the
index m on the [? eight? ?]

00:52:39.208 --> 00:52:41.864
Or is that a subscript?

00:52:41.864 --> 00:52:42.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.950
But then we always use
the notation of alpha.

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:50.210
I will not use a.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:53.180
Yeah, but just keep in mind that
their relation is like that.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.160
And then a and a dagger will
have the standard commutation

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.110
relation equal to 1.

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:58.610
OK?

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:06.110
So now, we can now
work out the spectrum.

00:53:12.121 --> 00:53:13.620
So now we can work
out the spectrum.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.150
Let me see.

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:30.785
So we can work out the spectrum.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:39.660
So the lowest state is
so-called oscillator vacuum.

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.020
So when we quantize it,
we define our vacuum.

00:53:45.254 --> 00:53:46.670
So the vacuum
[? does ?] run into,

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:50.870
of course, the states, which are
[INAUDIBLE] by all [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:53.022
operators.

00:53:53.022 --> 00:53:55.105
[INAUDIBLE] by all our
[? relational ?] operators.

00:54:03.075 --> 00:54:03.575
OK?

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:15.560
Greater than zero and i.

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.060
OK.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.880
So we first define-- so in order
to-- so we are quantizing--

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.055
so this is like a
free field theory,

00:54:22.055 --> 00:54:25.250
and so we define our vacuum,
which is a [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:27.600
by all [INAUDIBLE] operator.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:33.890
But the difference from the
standard quantum fields theory,

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.850
two-dimensional quantum
fields theory, is that now,

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:39.100
the vacuum here is
labeled [? by ?] p.

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:39.600
OK?

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.550
This is the space-time,
center-of-mass momentum

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:43.970
of the string.

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:46.446
So we are taking
the vacuum to be,

00:54:46.446 --> 00:54:47.820
say a momentum
[INAUDIBLE] state.

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.540
OK?

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.920
In terms of space-time.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.550
And so this zero p,
which because one and two

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:59.900
have low oscillator
exactly on the string,

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:03.790
but can still have a momentum,
a space-time momentum,

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:08.000
so this is labeled by
center-of-mass momentum.

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:15.760
OK?

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:24.880
And then you can also
build up other state.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.220
Then you can-- so this is the
lowest state, on the-- so this

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:31.449
is, in some sense, the
vacuum state on the string.

00:55:31.449 --> 00:55:33.490
And then you can also
build up the excited state.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:45.630
And so you just elect
arbitrary number

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:47.130
of alpha and alpha tildes.

00:55:56.925 --> 00:55:59.721
On this vacuum state.

00:55:59.721 --> 00:56:00.220
OK?

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:14.010
So yeah, let me also
label the equations.

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:16.471
So let me call this equation 20.

00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:16.970
OK?

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:32.610
So for the open
string-- yeah, so this

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:34.480
is for the closed string.

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:39.810
For the open string,
you only have one set.

00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:43.910
You just have one set
of, say, alpha n i.

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:45.080
And you still have two sets.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:45.580
OK?

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.350
It's also convenient to
define oscillator number.

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:03.440
OK?

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.130
So which we call--
define in terms

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:12.490
of the standard [INAUDIBLE]
And then the alpha minus m i,

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:16.791
alpha m i, so it would
be equal to m N m i.

00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:17.290
OK?

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:21.360
So this is oscillator
number for the m's mode

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.980
and in i directions.

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.440
OK?

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.200
So in this equation
there's no summation of i.

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:33.420
Also there's no summation
of m, just a-- OK?

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.060
So I hope this is clear.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:46.400
Good.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:46.983
Any questions?

00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:00.010
So now let's look
at those equations.

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:03.620
Now let's look at the--
those mass-shell conditions.

00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:05.873
So the quantum
[? variable. ?] OK?

00:58:05.873 --> 00:58:07.160
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.329
What does operators x and
p do in those vacuums?

00:58:10.329 --> 00:58:10.954
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:58:10.954 --> 00:58:12.930
AUDIENCE: Operators x and p.

00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:15.757
What do they do with
those right here?

00:58:15.757 --> 00:58:16.590
PROFESSOR: No no no.

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:19.780
So we take-- so back here,
so we take the vacuum

00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:22.940
to be a [INAUDIBLE] state of p.

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:24.542
And then yeah, then that's it.

00:58:24.542 --> 00:58:25.041
Yeah.

00:58:25.041 --> 00:58:27.807
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] p
i [INAUDIBLE] right here,

00:58:27.807 --> 00:58:29.190
what do they do?

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.730
PROFESSOR: So this is
[INAUDIBLE] state of p.

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:34.010
And the action of
x on p, it just

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.613
asks what do you do
in quantum mechanics.

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:37.112
Yeah.

00:58:40.721 --> 00:58:41.220
Yes?

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
kind of a dumb thing, but.

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:48.647
So the p mu, that only includes
the i [INAUDIBLE], or all?

00:58:48.647 --> 00:58:49.730
PROFESSOR: All components.

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:52.150
All components.

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:53.512
But then they must be satisfied.

00:58:53.512 --> 00:58:54.470
AUDIENCE: Right, right.

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:55.440
So they have to satisfy--

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.280
PROFESSOR: Then
they have to satisfy

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.135
this kind of constraint.

00:58:57.135 --> 00:58:57.801
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:11.240
PROFESSOR: Other questions?

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.371
Good.

00:59:12.371 --> 00:59:13.400
Good.

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.610
So now, we can
write down-- so now

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:20.510
let's write down the mass-shell
condition in terms of-- so this

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:23.900
is a classical equation.

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:24.400
OK?

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.816
These are the
classical equations.

00:59:30.755 --> 00:59:32.880
So now we can write down
the quantum version of it.

00:59:44.642 --> 00:59:46.600
So we can write down the
quantum version of it.

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:58.400
So each state, so the typical
state, here, will carry some p,

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.720
will carry some p.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.610
So p i are independent, but
then p minus p i and p plus,

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:09.530
for example, yeah,
for x plus, this

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.420
will also give you a p plus.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.340
For p i and p plus
are independent.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.560
But then the p minus,
then it's determined

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.780
from those equations,
determined from

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.450
these mass-shell conditions.

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:23.115
OK?

01:00:23.115 --> 01:00:25.240
So now let's write down
those mass-shell conditions

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.330
in terms of quantum form.

01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:31.320
So now let's, again, look at
the mass-shell conditions.

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:44.910
So let's first, again,
do the open string.

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:46.515
So we just take these.

01:00:53.042 --> 01:00:54.500
So when you go to
quantum, then you

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.470
have to worry
about the ordering.

01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.970
OK?

01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:00.840
Then you have to worry about
the ordering, because now they

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.540
don't [? commute. ?] OK?

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:05.380
So now you have--
about the ordering.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:08.570
So let me-- for the
moment, don't-- then

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.990
there's an ordering
constant, et cetera.

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:13.710
And it's easy to
understand what should

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:19.040
be the ordering constant,
because this is a string,

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.740
and each oscillation mode
behaves like an-- it's just

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.690
a harmonic oscillator.

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:29.850
And then you just add up
all the zero-point energy

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:32.100
of the harmonic oscillator,
and that will give you

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:33.350
the ordering constant.

01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:33.850
OK?

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:37.715
It's just the same as a
harmonic oscillator problem.

01:01:37.715 --> 01:01:41.720
So to translate this into a
quantum operator expression,

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.830
so I just do it-- [? isolate ?]
the harmonic oscillator.

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:46.470
OK?

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:47.990
Because I just--
have essentially

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:50.350
have m harmonic oscillators.

01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:52.490
Have all these different
harmonic oscillators.

01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:54.000
Then this is easy.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.660
So I just copy this
one of alpha prime.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:02.010
So this is m from minus
infinity to plus infinity.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.910
So let me rewrite it from m
equal to 1, to plus infinity.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:07.060
Then I have a factor of 2.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:11.540
Then the overall factor becomes
1 over i, 1 over alpha prime.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.410
OK?

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.890
And now, let me--
also making the sum

01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:19.640
over i explicit, so
from 2 to D minus 1,

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:23.380
all the transverse
directions, and then I sum

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:27.060
over m equal to 1 to infinity.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.590
And this, I have
written down before.

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:34.480
This is essentially just this
m times the oscillation number.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.390
m N m i.

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:40.050
OK?

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:42.610
So now I have to write
down the zero-point energy.

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:45.820
So let me call it a zero.

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.930
So the zero-point
energy, so you just

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.040
do it as a harmonic oscillator.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.170
So this is for the
oscillator number.

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:54.530
So for harmonic oscillator,
we have m plus 1/2, OK?

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:57.590
So for each oscillator,
you have 1/2.

01:02:57.590 --> 01:03:04.200
So a zero must be equal to 1
over alpha prime sum over i sum

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.626
over m then 1/2 times m.

01:03:09.626 --> 01:03:10.125
OK?

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:14.840
So is this clear to you?

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.440
Yes?

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.830
AUDIENCE: So in here, we're
not actually summing over i,

01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:18.330
are we?

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:20.390
Is there an implicit sum over i?

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:21.910
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, oh, sorry.

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:23.120
Here.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.584
Here, repeated index
always means we summed.

01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:27.500
AUDIENCE: Even though
they're both up indices?

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.090
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:33.318
Yeah, because we are working
with Minkowski metric.

01:03:33.318 --> 01:03:33.984
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:03:33.984 --> 01:03:34.484
OK.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.220
PROFESSOR: OK?

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:47.050
So essentially, you have
the harmonic oscillator

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:48.450
with a frequency m.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:48.950
OK?

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.210
Because that's what
each the-- yeah,

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:55.185
I should have
emphasized one step.

01:03:55.185 --> 01:03:56.540
Let me see.

01:03:59.484 --> 01:04:02.350
Yeah, I did not write
it down explicitly here.

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:05.320
But if you remind yourself,
when you quantize a free quantum

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.380
fields theory,
the harmon-- now I

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.900
have erased my
harmonic expansion--

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.100
and in the harmonic
expansion, under the nth mode,

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.920
we have frequency n.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.420
OK?

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.380
Yeah, say-- let me
just add it here.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:33.690
So when we write down [? pi-- ?]
say tau minus sigma-- yeah,

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:35.500
it'll be some pre-factor.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:40.590
So this n, this just the
frequency of each mode,

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:43.690
OK, as a harmonic oscillator.

01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:46.750
So that's why, here, for
the zero point [INAUDIBLE],

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:51.700
so each one, each
mode, contribute 1/2 m.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.320
OK?

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.590
So is this clear to you?

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.670
AUDIENCE: And you can also
get that from the computation

01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:04.010
relationship?

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.745
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:05:04.745 --> 01:05:05.806
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:05.806 --> 01:05:07.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
let me just say,

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.960
I want to write down the quantum
version of this equation.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.910
The way I do it is that I
write down the quantum version

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:15.300
of the harmonic oscillator.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:20.212
Treat each mode as a harmonic
oscillator, and then the zero--

01:05:20.212 --> 01:05:22.295
then this will be just a
sum of an infinite number

01:05:22.295 --> 01:05:23.990
of harmonic oscillators.

01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:27.920
And each harmonic oscillator
have a frequency n.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.230
So each harmonic oscillator
have frequency n.

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:33.070
OK?

01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:36.270
So each harmonic oscillator
has a frequency n.

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:41.660
Then this is the oscillator
number times the frequency.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:46.600
And the zero mode is just
1/2 times the frequency.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.970
Yeah.

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:49.630
Clear?

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:51.480
Good.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.584
And similarly, we can
write down the equation

01:05:53.584 --> 01:05:54.500
for the closed string.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:14.000
Again, sum over i sum
over m not equal to zero,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.600
or sum m equal to one
to infinity, then m,

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.630
m N i plus m N m i tilde.

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.590
OK?

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:28.640
And then, again, plus a zero.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:33.070
So this here, a zero,
it's essentially the same.

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:40.510
Is the-- so now you
have this equation.

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:46.260
So this is alpha 2 sum over
i sum over m from minus 1

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:53.280
to infinity, from 1 to
infinity, 1/2 m plus m.

01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.963
So 1/2 m plus m because
there's two modes here.

01:07:00.963 --> 01:07:01.770
OK?

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:07.950
Yeah, maybe I should
write m 1/2 plus 1/2.

01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:14.390
Yeah?

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:16.265
AUDIENCE: I'm still
confused about something.

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:18.345
So where exactly did
the a zero come from?

01:07:18.345 --> 01:07:20.547
Where is it defined before?

01:07:20.547 --> 01:07:21.380
PROFESSOR: No no no.

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:24.160
No, a zero come from
here, come from I'm

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.920
rewriting this equation
as a quantum equation.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:34.430
So this is-- so if you
look at it here, here,

01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:36.890
each one is a dagger and a.

01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:39.450
So there's an
ordering issue here.

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:42.640
And there's an
ordering issue here.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.490
So I'm just giving
you a simple trick

01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:48.130
to find out what is the-- how
to resolve the ordering issue,

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:51.190
because each term is like
a harmonic oscillator.

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:53.780
And then this will
be just like, exactly

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.101
like a harmonic oscillator.

01:07:55.101 --> 01:07:55.642
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:07:55.642 --> 01:07:58.317
So you're just taking all those
contributions and packaging it?

01:07:58.317 --> 01:08:00.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
right, that's right.

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:01.930
Yeah, just like
you're writing down

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:03.610
the energy of a
harmonic oscillator.

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:04.100
AUDIENCE: Gotcha.

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:04.600
OK.

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:09.300
PROFESSOR: Yes?

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.516
AUDIENCE: I'm a bit surprised
that these terms contribute

01:08:12.516 --> 01:08:14.748
to m squared, not to m.

01:08:14.748 --> 01:08:19.020
They look like
[INAUDIBLE] of a--

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:19.939
PROFESSOR: Which one?

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:21.750
AUDIENCE: I mean
[INAUDIBLE] so the a

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.760
zero, all zero-point energies?

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.920
Intuitively I would have
thought that they would add up

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.776
to-- they would contribute
to the mass of the string,

01:08:30.776 --> 01:08:32.250
not to the mass squared.

01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:40.333
PROFESSOR: It depends on where
is your intuition come from.

01:08:40.333 --> 01:08:43.750
AUDIENCE: I don't
know, it-- is it--

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:46.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this is
a-- this is in the-- yeah.

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:53.790
I think, again, so, so here,
I'm assuming the-- yeah,

01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:57.140
let me just-- I understand
where you've-- yeah,

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.430
let me just explain
one more thing.

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:02.340
Let me just explain
one more thing.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.450
So that equation, which
I write in that form,

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:07.934
m square equal to that thing.

01:09:07.934 --> 01:09:09.170
OK?

01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:14.700
And this should be
understood as the 2 p plus p

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:21.380
minus-- minus p i
square, say minus--

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:23.800
yeah, minus p i squared
equal to that thing.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.859
OK?

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:28.830
And then this can also-- so this
essentially gives you p minus.

01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:32.010
You could do this, the rest.

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:35.880
And the p minus is the image
in the light-cone frame.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.310
And so, you are just
[? conceding ?] the image,

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:39.599
but in the light-cone frame.

01:09:42.449 --> 01:09:44.286
AUDIENCE: Why does that
get p minus, sorry?

01:09:44.286 --> 01:09:44.952
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:44.952 --> 01:09:49.160
I'm just saying this equation
itself-- think about how

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.270
we derived this equation.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:55.150
This come from here.

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:55.960
Come from here.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.960
Yeah, I'm doing it a
little bit fast today.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.770
So come from here.

01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:05.050
So this equation
should be considered

01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:08.990
as a constrained equation
which you solve for p minus.

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:13.756
And p minus is precisely the
image in the light-cone frame.

01:10:13.756 --> 01:10:18.660
Yeah, this is a precise image
in the light-cone frame.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.360
Yeah.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.404
That's why.

01:10:22.404 --> 01:10:22.904
Yeah.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.781
So is it clear?

01:10:27.781 --> 01:10:29.780
AUDIENCE: I need to think
about it a little bit.

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:30.446
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:10:30.446 --> 01:10:33.101
And so, that's, yeah.

01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:33.600
Yeah.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.750
This is a good question.

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:36.749
I should have emphasized
this point a little bit

01:10:36.749 --> 01:10:40.340
earlier, in jump
from here to there.

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:40.840
Yeah.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:46.650
You should think
of this-- so this

01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:49.410
is an equation which
you can imagine it

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:51.310
as solve for p minus.

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:53.990
And p minus is the image
in the light-cone frame.

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:57.140
And then all these
contributions,

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.630
the right-hand side, can be
considered as the contribution

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.560
to the light-cone image.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:06.116
And then we're just repackaging
it in terms of the mass term.

01:11:06.116 --> 01:11:06.615
Yeah.

01:11:09.819 --> 01:11:10.860
So now we have a problem.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.390
Because if you look at
the zero-point energy--

01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:18.510
so any other questions?

01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:20.808
AUDIENCE: So the
mass square, the mass

01:11:20.808 --> 01:11:24.360
of the string [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.640
PROFESSOR: The mass
over the-- no no no no.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.330
That's not the way you should
think about-- sorry, say it

01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:29.830
again?

01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:32.070
AUDIENCE: Because you said p
minus the energy, and then.

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:33.870
PROFESSOR: p minus is
the light-cone energy.

01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:34.650
AUDIENCE: Light-cone, yeah.

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:35.316
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:11:35.316 --> 01:11:37.840
So the light-cone image--
yeah, the light-cone energy.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.050
Yeah, this is a light-cone
[? image. ?] Yes?

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:42.512
AUDIENCE: But then
is-- what he was

01:11:42.512 --> 01:11:47.120
asking is why the contribution
from the zero point energy

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.451
is-- you are contributing
to the m squared, right?

01:11:50.451 --> 01:11:50.950
So.

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:52.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:56.700
My answer is that the zero-point
energy is contributing

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.680
to the light-cone image.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:03.870
It's contributing to
the light-cone image.

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:06.680
Yeah, just repackage it in
terms of the mass-squared term.

01:12:12.006 --> 01:12:13.130
AUDIENCE: One more comment.

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:16.980
That [INAUDIBLE] in
the [INAUDIBLE] case

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:19.890
and that you will find
the [INAUDIBLE] p minus.

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:21.754
That is [INAUDIBLE]
interpretation.

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:22.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:26.190
Just say because we are
going to the light cone,

01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:30.874
and in the light cone,
the p minus is the image.

01:12:30.874 --> 01:12:33.040
And then we repackage it
into the mass-squared term.

01:12:38.632 --> 01:12:41.770
Is it clear?

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:47.470
Yeah, so what he was asking
is-- so his intuition is right,

01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:51.660
because this-- at least
in the light-cone gauge,

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:55.020
you can interpret it--
so this zero-point image

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.340
is contributing to
something like image,

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:00.300
rather than something
like mass square,

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.240
even though this equation is
acting like a mass square.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.620
Yeah.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.550
That was my explanation to him.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:08.050
Yeah?

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.383
AUDIENCE: So one other question.

01:13:09.383 --> 01:13:12.450
If indeed there is an
infinite constant [INAUDIBLE],

01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:15.910
like there is normal
quantum physics,

01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:17.500
how does string
theory get around

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.374
this issue of-- so it
seems that you're still

01:13:19.374 --> 01:13:22.408
looking at this issue with
infinite energy in a vacuum.

01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:27.057
PROFESSOR: We're
not going into that.

01:13:27.057 --> 01:13:28.390
Yeah, we're not going into that.

01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:35.440
So this is a standard issue.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:43.470
So now we see that
you have-- so now you

01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:45.780
see you have a sum of an
infinite number of modes,

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:49.580
and each mode
contributing to 1/2 m.

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:51.360
So each mode
contribute to 1/2 m.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.250
So this is apparently
an infinite answer.

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:03.490
OK?

01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:06.345
But now we have a trick.

01:14:06.345 --> 01:14:07.345
But now we have a trick.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:17.700
The trick is this sum
is actually equal to--

01:14:21.137 --> 01:14:22.610
AUDIENCE: Oh my gosh.

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:26.540
[GIGGLING]

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:27.910
PROFESSOR: So we have a trick.

01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:30.940
And the trick is that this
is actually-- we equate it

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:34.110
to minus 1/2-- minus 1/12.

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:36.400
OK?

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.900
So there are many ways
to justify this thing.

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:43.690
But I will not do it here.

01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:45.950
I will only do it in one way.

01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:49.480
One way, which is the
quickest way, but maybe

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.280
it's most unsatisfying
way physically.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.450
But it's the-- mathematically,
the quickest way.

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:57.540
OK?

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.702
And this is so-called zeta
function regularization.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:20.590
So typically-- so
a trick we often

01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:25.690
used in physics is
that when you go

01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:34.850
to-- so when you get an
infinite quantity, what you do

01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:39.800
is you slightly change
the form of your quantity

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.790
so that this is finite.

01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:45.910
And then you manage
to take the limit.

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:52.340
To go back to the
original limit.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:57.270
And yeah, let me first just
write down the answer for you.

01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:59.167
And then I talk
about philosophy.

01:15:59.167 --> 01:16:01.185
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:01.185 --> 01:16:02.810
PROFESSOR: So the
key is a [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:06.020
And let's define a function
called the zeta function.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:09.580
So this is the so-called
Riemann zeta function.

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:13.776
And so this is sum of n equal
to 1 to infinity 1 over n

01:16:13.776 --> 01:16:14.810
to the power s.

01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:17.340
OK?

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:25.470
So as you all know, this
sum is only convergent

01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:28.980
only for s greater than 1.

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.450
And it's a famous sum
that when s equal to 1,

01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:33.220
this is a logarithm divergent.

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:35.350
OK?

01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:40.670
So this function have
[? a pole. ?] So [? this ?]

01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:42.540
thing over these
[? a ?] function.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.780
So what you can do is
you can do the sum.

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.920
For s greater than 1, then
you can actually-- we'll

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.300
call the analytic
function letter s.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:53.800
Use this as a definition
for this function.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.602
And this function is well
defined for s greater than 1.

01:16:56.602 --> 01:16:58.640
And then you find this
function has a pole.

01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:06.820
And the zeta equal to, say, 1.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.560
At s, you could do 1.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.280
Because 1 into this-- as
a logarithm divergence,

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.692
yeah, for 1 plus 1/2, et cetera.

01:17:17.692 --> 01:17:27.580
But this function--
or, I can do it here--

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.676
but this function have
an analytical condition.

01:17:39.331 --> 01:17:41.080
But this function,
this analytic function,

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.960
can be analytically
continued beyond s equal to 1

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.310
to smaller value of s.

01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:50.700
In particular, you find can
be analytically continued

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.150
to minus 1.

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:54.250
So minus 1 is a
situation, what we

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:58.600
are seeing-- looking at here,
with s equal to minus 1,

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.149
this equal to that.

01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:02.440
And then this function when
you [INAUDIBLE] to minus 1,

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.770
you find it's actually finite,
and then given by minus 1/12.

01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:07.970
OK?

01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:12.050
So this is a rationale
for the manipulation.

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:18.830
So this is very
similar-- this is

01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:21.620
very similar to
dimensional regularization

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.720
you used in quantum
field theory.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.990
And you see, certain
integrals are divergent.

01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:32.680
Say, certain integrals are
divergent in four dimensions.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.750
And then, the trick we did,
when you do your quantum field

01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:43.140
theory, is that we promote
the dimension as a variable.

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:46.890
Rather than equal to 4,
we called it general d.

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:49.460
And then, for that
general d, then there

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:52.275
exists some range
of that d, which

01:18:52.275 --> 01:18:54.350
is that integral is finite.

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:56.880
And then you can evaluate it
as an analytic function of d.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.270
And [? analytic ?]
continue to d equal to 4.

01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:04.990
And sometimes that just
give you a finite answer.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:07.240
And sometimes that still
gives you a divergent answer,

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.149
and then you need to do
[? regularization. ?]

01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:10.690
But sometimes when
you do that trick,

01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:12.960
you just get a finite
answer, and then

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:15.660
there's even no need to
do a [? regularization. ?]

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.540
That trick just works.

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:21.370
So this is exactly the
same as that trick.

01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:25.920
So this trick is exactly
in the same sense as that.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.210
But of course, this is
only a mathematical trick.

01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:32.420
And to justify it
physically, you

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:35.320
have to think about the--
to justify it physically,

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:41.220
it's the same as the
philosophy for your [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.730
in general quantum
field theories.

01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:49.280
It's that this system have
many, many high-energy modes.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.140
So the divergence come
from very large m,

01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:55.170
have very, very
high-energy modes.

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:58.360
And so the
justification is that--

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.942
so those high-energy modes,
so the low-energy physics,

01:20:01.942 --> 01:20:03.900
which is related to the
zero point [? energy ?]

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.880
[? excitement, ?] should be
insensitive to the physics

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.060
of those high-energy modes.

01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:09.080
Then you can subtract
the infinity, et cetera.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.980
So that philosophy's the
same as what you normally

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:17.170
do in the [? regularization ?]
quantum fields theory.

01:20:17.170 --> 01:20:18.290
OK.

01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:21.198
Any other questions here?

01:20:21.198 --> 01:20:24.315
AUDIENCE: So can we say that
the true physical theory doesn't

01:20:24.315 --> 01:20:27.150
have any divergences, but it's
just this effective theory

01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:31.980
that kind of works out, has
divergences that we then,

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:35.520
kind of, get rid
of by the strings?

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:40.280
But the real physical theory,
that real wouldn't, shouldn't

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.120
wouldn't have any divergences?

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:47.480
PROFESSOR: So you just
say the physics-- say

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.550
this particular
quantity does not

01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:53.810
depend on the details
of your UV physics.

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:59.520
So this divergence itself comes
from a particular assumption

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.710
of the UV physics.

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:06.090
But you can modify your UV
physics in a certain way,

01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:07.540
and this particular
answer should

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:10.880
be independent of those
details of that UV physics.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.380
Yeah.

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:15.560
So this is a standard philosophy
behind the regularization.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.740
And so you can
justify this answer

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:20.940
using many different ways.

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:24.160
You can also justify
it-- so you can also

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.489
just put some constant
in there, and then

01:21:27.489 --> 01:21:29.405
impose some other
self-consistency conditions,

01:21:29.405 --> 01:21:30.821
and you can determine
this answer.

01:21:30.821 --> 01:21:33.710
Anyway, there are many ways
you can derive this answer.

01:21:33.710 --> 01:21:36.690
And this is one way, or the
one quickest way of doing it,

01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:39.022
so we are just do it here.

01:21:39.022 --> 01:21:39.980
So any other questions?

01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:44.520
Good.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.500
OK.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:50.620
So now, from here, we can
find that for the open string,

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:54.780
the a zero is just equal
to minus, d minus 2 divided

01:21:54.780 --> 01:22:00.250
by 24, 1 over alpha
prime, for the open.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:05.980
And then for the closed string,
is equal to minus d minus 2

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:11.440
divided by 24
alpha prime over 4.

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.940
Closed.

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.490
OK?

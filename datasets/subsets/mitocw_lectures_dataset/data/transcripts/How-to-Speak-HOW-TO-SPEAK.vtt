00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.840
PATRICK WINSTON: The Uniform
Code of Military Justice

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.530
specifies court martial for
any officer who sends a soldier

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.620
into battle without a weapon.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.995
There ought to be a similar
protection for students

00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:34.370
because students
shouldn't go out

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.070
into life without the
ability to communicate,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.340
and that's because
your success in life

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.760
will be determined largely
by your ability to speak,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.840
your ability to write, and
the quality of your ideas,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840
in that order.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.670
I know that I can be
successful in this

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.050
because the quality
of communication,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.450
your speaking, your
writing, is largely

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.880
determined by this formula.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.150
It's a matter of how
much knowledge you have,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.670
how much you practice
with that knowledge,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.100
and your inherent
talent, and notice

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.230
that the T is very small.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.860
What really matters
is what you know.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.970
This point came to me suddenly
a few decades ago when

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.610
I was skiing at Sun Valley.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.430
I had heard that it was
Celebrity Weekend, and one

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.800
of the celebrities
was Mary Lou Retton,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.480
famous Olympic gymnast,
perfect 10s in the vault.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.510
And I heard that she
was a novice at skiing,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.070
so when the opportune
moment arrived,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.470
I looked over on
the novice slope

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.270
and saw this young woman who,
when she became unbalanced,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.350
went like that.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.330
And I said that's got to be her.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.570
That must be the gymnast.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.210
But then, it occurred to
me, I'm a much better skier

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.820
than she is, and she's an
Olympic athlete-- not only

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.230
an ordinary Olympic
athlete, an outstanding one.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.120
And I was a better skier because
I had the K, and I had the P,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.729
and all she had
was the T. So you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.860
can get a lot better
than people who

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.140
may have inherent
talents if you have

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.460
the right amount of knowledge.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.960
So that's what my objective is
today, and here's my promise.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.830
Today, you will
see some examples

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.400
of what you can put in your
armamentarium of speaking

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.810
techniques, and it
will be the case

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.640
that some one of those examples,
some heuristic, some technique,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.040
maybe only one, will make--

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.050
will be the one that
gets you the job.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.600
And so this is a very
non-linear process.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.752
You never know when
it's going to happen,

00:02:47.752 --> 00:02:48.710
but that is my promise.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.350
By the end of the
next 60 minutes,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.490
you'll have been exposed to
a lot of ideas, some of which

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.180
you'll incorporate into
your own repertoire,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.080
and they will ensure that you
get the maximum opportunity

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.410
to have your ideas
valued and accepted

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.900
by the people you speak with.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.300
Now, in order to
do that, we have

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.150
to have a rule of
engagement, and that

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.710
is no laptops, no cell phones.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.600
So if you could
close those, I'll

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.300
start up as soon as you're done.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.800
Some people ask why that
is a rule of engagement,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.830
and the answer
is, we humans only

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.990
have one language processor.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.760
And if your language
processor is enga--

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.590
could you shut the
laptop, please?

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.850
If your language processor
is engaged browsing the web

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.030
or reading your email,
you're distracted.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.880
And worse yet, you distract
all of the people around you.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.570
Studies have shown that.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.160
And worse yet, if I see a
open laptop somewhere back

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.470
there or up here, it drives
me nuts, and I do a worse job.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.710
And so that ensures
that all of your friends

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.520
who are paying attention
don't get the performance

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.230
that they came to have.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.830
So that's it for preamble.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.620
Let's get started.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.670
First thing we talk about,
of course, is how to start.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.740
Some people think
the right thing to do

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.140
is to start a talk with a joke.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.300
I don't recommend
it, and the reason

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.820
is that, in the
beginning of a talk,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.420
people are still putting
their laptops away.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.250
They're becoming adjusted
to your speaking parameters,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.670
to your vocal parameters, and
they're not ready for a joke.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.090
So it doesn't work very well.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.420
They usually fall flat.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.110
What you want to do instead is
start with empowerment promise.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.060
You want to tell
people what they're

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.660
going to know at
the end of the hour

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.560
that they didn't know at
the beginning of the hour.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.808
It's an empowerment promise.

00:05:17.808 --> 00:05:19.100
It's the reason for being here.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.910
What would be an example?

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.230
Oh, I see.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.820
At the end of this 60
minutes, you will know things

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.952
about speaking you
don't know now,

00:05:30.952 --> 00:05:32.660
and something among
those things you know

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.310
will make a difference
in your life.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.200
Yeah, that's an
empowerment promise,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.960
so that's the best way to start.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.540
So now that I've talked a
little bit about how to start,

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.900
what I want to do is give you
some samples of heuristics

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.970
that are always on my
mind when I give a talk,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.185
and first of these heuristics is
that it's a good idea to cycle

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:53.810
on the subject.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.980
Go around it.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.360
Go round it again.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.250
Go round it again.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.900
Some people say, tell him
what you want to tell him.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.690
Tell him again, and then
tell him a third time,

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.900
as if people
weren't intelligent.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.830
But the point is--

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.190
the reason is-- well, there
are many reasons, one of which

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.340
is, at any given
moment, about 20% of you

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.030
will be fogged out no
matter what the lecture is.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.530
So if you want to ensure that
the probability that everybody

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.120
gets it is high, you need
to say it three times.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.250
So cycling is one of
the things that I always

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.500
think about when I give a talk.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.190
Another thing I think about
is, in explaining my idea,

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:45.590
I want to build a fence around
it so that it's not confused

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.030
with somebody else's idea.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.900
So if you were from Mars,
and I was teaching you

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.510
about what an arch is,
I might say to you,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.333
well, that's an arch.

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:57.500
And that's not to be confused
with some other things

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.970
that other people
might think is--

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:59.950
this is not an arch.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.010
That's not an arch.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.780
I'm building a
fence around my idea

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.020
so that it can be distinguished
from somebody else's idea.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.330
So in a more technical
sense, I might say, well,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.990
my algorithm might similar--

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.740
might seem similar
to Jones's algorithm,

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.285
except his is exponential,
and mine's linear.

00:07:18.285 --> 00:07:19.910
That's putting a
fence around your idea

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.998
so that people can not
be confused about how it

00:07:22.998 --> 00:07:24.290
might relate to something else.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.230
The third thing on
this list of samples

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.440
is the idea of
verbal punctuation.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.050
And the idea here is
that, because people

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.730
will occasionally fog out and
need to get back on the bus,

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.210
you need to provide some
landmark places where

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.260
you're announcing that it's
a good time to get back on.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.480
So I might, in this
talk, say something

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.840
about this being my outline.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.030
The first thing we're going to
do is talk about how to start.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.480
Then we're going to deal
with these four samples,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.880
and among these
four samples, I've

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.550
talked about the first
idea-- that's cycling.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.200
The second idea,
building-- and now,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.040
the third idea is
verbal punctuation.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.770
So I'm enumerating
and providing numbers.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.040
I'm giving you a sense that
there's a seam in the talk,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.360
and you can get back on.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:38.130
So now, we're on a roll,
and since we're on a roll,

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.270
can you guess what fourth
idea might be here--

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.480
an idea that helps people
get back on the bus?

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.405
AUDIENCE: Ask a question.

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:52.280
PATRICK WINSTON: Yes?

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.322
AUDIENCE: Ask a question.

00:08:53.322 --> 00:08:53.860
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.570
PATRICK WINSTON:
Ask a question, yes.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.220
Thank you.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.150
So ask a question.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.030
And so I will ask a question--
how much dead air can there be?

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.010
How long can I pause?

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.080
I counted seven seconds.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.300
It seemed like an eternity to
me to wait and not say anything

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.740
for seven seconds, but that's
the standard amount of time

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.910
you can wait for an answer.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.700
And of course, the question
has to be carefully chosen.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.620
It can't be too obvious
because then people

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.410
will be embarrassed to say
it, but the answers can't

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.580
be too hard because then nobody
will have anything to say.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.800
So here are some
sample heuristics

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.110
you can put in
your armamentarium

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:43.460
and build up your repertoire
of ideas about presentation.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.340
And now, if this
persuades you that there

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.620
is something to know,
that there is knowledge,

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.500
then I've already succeeded
because what I want to convince

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.160
you of, is if you watch the
speakers you admire and feel

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.140
are effective,
and ask yourselves

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.030
why they're successful,
then you can

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.000
build up your own
personal repertoire

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.010
and develop your
own personal style.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.830
And that's my
fundamental objective,

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.900
and the rest of this
talk is about some

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.180
of the things that are
in my armamentarium

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.550
that I think are effective.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.280
So next thing on
our agenda, as we

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.830
start to discuss
these other things,

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.170
is a discussion
of time and place.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.420
So what do you think is a
good time to have a lecture?

00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:31.660
11 AM?

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.160
Yeah.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:44.670
And the reason is most people
at MIT are awake by then,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.170
and hardly anyone has
gone back to sleep.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.100
It's not right after a meal.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.560
People aren't fatigued
from this or that.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.970
It's a great time
to have a lecture.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.970
So that brings me, next,
to the question of what

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.546
about the place?

00:10:58.546 --> 00:11:01.440
And the most important
thing about the place

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.830
is that it be well lit.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.990
This room is well lit.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.370
Problem with other kinds
of rooms is that we humans,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.740
whenever the lights
go down, or whenever

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.410
the room is dimly
lighted, it signals

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.350
that we should go to sleep.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.100
So whenever I go
somewhere to give a talk,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.440
even today, the
first thing I do when

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.220
I speak to the
audio-visual people

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.240
is say, keep the lights full up.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.000
Oh, they might reply, people
will see the slides better

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.610
if we turn the lights
off, and then I reply,

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.985
it's extremely hard to see
slides through closed eyelids.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.070
What else can you
say about the place?

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:58.710
Well, the place
should be cased, and I

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.680
mean that in a colloquial
sense, of like if you're

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.520
robbing a bank, you
would go to the bank

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.400
some occasions before
to see what it's like,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.170
so there are no surprises
when you do your robbery.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.750
So whenever I go
somewhere to speak,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.600
the first thing I ask my host
to do is to take me to the place

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.320
where I'll be speaking so that
if there are any weirdnesses,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.520
I'll be able to deal with it.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.010
Sometimes, it might
require some intervention.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.800
Sometimes, it just might
require me to understand

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.660
what the challenges are.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.960
So when I came
here this morning,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.203
I did what I typically do.

00:12:39.203 --> 00:12:40.620
I imagined that
all the seats were

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.340
filled with disinterested
farm animals,

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.830
and that way, I knew that,
no matter how bad it was,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.120
it wouldn't be as bad as that.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.540
So finally, it should
be reasonably--

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.460
it should be
reasonably populated.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.340
It should be the case that--

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.370
if there were 10
people in this hall,

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.050
everyone would be
wondering, what's

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.230
going on that's so much more
interesting that nobody's here.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.055
So you want to get a
right sized place that's--

00:13:17.055 --> 00:13:18.430
doesn't have to
be packed, but it

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.950
has to be more than half full.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.550
So those are some thoughts
about a time and place.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.640
Next thing I want to
talk about is a subject

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.385
of boards and props and slides.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.230
Well, these are the
tools of the trade.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:49.420
I believe that this is the
right tool for speaking

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.330
when your purpose is informing.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.290
The slides are good when
your purpose is exposing,

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.610
but this is what I use when I'm
informing, teaching, lecturing,

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.440
and there's several
reasons why I use it.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.480
For one thing, when
you use the board,

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.605
you have a graphic quality.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.440
It's the case that, when
you have a board, then

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.990
you can easily exploit the
fact that you can use graphics

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.668
in your presentation.

00:14:22.668 --> 00:14:25.210
So that's the graphic quality
that I like, and the next thing

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.755
I like is the speed property.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.440
The speed with which you
write on the blackboard

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.220
is approximately the speed at
which people can absorb ideas.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.040
If you go flipping
through a bunch of slides,

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.210
nobody can go that fast.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.260
Finally, one great
property of a board

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.750
is that it can be a target.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:59.200
Many people who are
novices at speaking

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.000
find themselves suddenly
aware of their hands.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.370
It's as if their hands were
private parts that shouldn't

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.820
be exposed in public, so right
away, they go into the pockets,

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.290
and this is considered insulting
in some parts of the world.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.120
Or alternatively,
maybe the hands

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.690
will go in back like this.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:27.820
I was once in a convent
in Serbia, and my host--

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.370
as soon as we entered,
a nun came up to us

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.260
and offered us a refreshment.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.980
And I was about to
say, no, thank you,

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.410
and he said, eat
that stuff or die.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.370
It's a question of local
custom and politeness.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.150
But then before
anything happened there,

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.360
the nun pulled my
hands out like this

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.330
because it was extraordinarily
insulting in that culture

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.880
to have your hands
behind your back.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.080
So why is that?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.210
Well, it's usually
supposed that that's

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.170
that it has to do with whether
you're concealing a weapon.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.860
So if your hands are in your
pockets or behind your back,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.810
then it looks like you
might have a weapon,

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.010
and that's what I
mean by the virtue--

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.583
one of these virtues
of the board.

00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:15.500
Now, you have something
to do with your hands.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.050
You can point out the stuff.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.310
I was once watching Seymour
Papert give a lecture,

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.110
and I thought it was terrific.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.850
So I went a second time--

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.170
first time to absorb
the content, second time

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.880
to note style.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.090
And what I discovered is
that Papert was constantly

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.568
pointing at the board.

00:16:33.568 --> 00:16:35.360
And then I thought
about it a little while,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.638
and I noted that none of
the stuff he was pointing to

00:16:38.638 --> 00:16:40.430
had anything to do with
what he was saying.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:46.371
Nevertheless, it was
an effective technique.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.070
So that's just a little
bit about the virtue

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.260
of blackboards.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.850
Now, I want to talk about props.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.820
The custodians of
knowledge about props

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.890
are the playwrights.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.730
Many decades ago, I saw
a play by Henrik Ibsen.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.589
It was Hedda Gabler.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:11.670
I remember vaguely that it was
about a woman in an unhappy

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:16.349
marriage, and her husband was in
competition for an academic job

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.599
with somebody else.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:20.910
And he was going to lose
partly because he was boring,

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.220
and partly because the
competitor had just

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.650
written a magnificent book.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.150
By the way, this
is back in the days

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.710
before there were copying
machines and computers.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:43.590
Anyhow, as the play opens,
there's a potbellied stove,

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.000
and in the beginning
of the play,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.130
the potbelly stove,
with its open door,

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.330
just has some slightly
glowing embers.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.000
But the potbellied
stove is always there,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.640
and as tension
mounts in the play,

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.170
and you see this
manuscript, this

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:06.210
prop that Ibsen so artfully
used, you just know

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.520
that something's
going to happen,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.890
because as the play goes on,
the fire gets bigger and hotter

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.750
and finally all
consuming, and you just

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:21.210
know that that manuscript is
going to go into that fire.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:26.070
This memorable thing is what
I remember about the play.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.590
So playwrights have got
this all figured out,

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.860
but on the other hand,
they're not the only people

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.380
who can use props.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.010
Here's an example of
the use of a prop, also

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.750
due to Seymour Papert.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.540
He was talking about how
it's important to look

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.260
at the problem in the
right way, and here's

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.015
an example that not only teaches
that, but makes it possible

00:18:50.015 --> 00:18:51.390
for you to embarrass
your friends

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.190
in mechanical engineering.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.110
So here's what you do.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.140
Take a bicycle wheel, and
you start it spinning.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.010
And then you put some
torque on the axle,

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.240
or equivalently, you
blow on the edge.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.570
And the issue is,
does it go that way,

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.790
or does it go that way?

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.590
Now, the mechanical engineers
will immediately say, oh, yes,

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.250
I see-- right hand screw wheel.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.970
And they'll put their
fingers in this position,

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.090
but forget exactly how
to align their fingers

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.870
with the various
aspects of the problem.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.420
And so it's usually the
case that they get it right

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.260
with about a 50% probability.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.670
So their very fancy
education gets them up

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.060
to the point where they're
equivalent to flipping a coin.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.720
But it doesn't
have to be that way

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.030
because you can think about the
problem a little differently.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.980
So here's what you do.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.080
You take some duct
tape, and you put it

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.450
around the part of
the wheel like that.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.250
And now, you start to think
about, not the whole wheel,

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.920
but just a little piece that's
underneath the duct tape.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.720
So here, that piece comes
rolling over the top,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.455
and at this point, you blow
on it with a puff of air.

00:20:09.455 --> 00:20:11.080
Forgetting about the
rest of the wheel,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.747
what happens to that
little piece that's

00:20:12.747 --> 00:20:13.655
under the duct tape?

00:20:13.655 --> 00:20:15.280
It must want to go
that way because you

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.040
banged on it like that.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.420
It's already going
down like that.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.910
And what about the next piece?

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.830
Same thing.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.330
Next piece?

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.200
Same thing.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.620
So the only thing
that can happen

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.090
is that the wheel
goes over like that.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.370
And so now, you'll
never wonder again

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.000
because you're thinking about
the problem in the right way,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
and it's demonstrated
by the use of a prop.

00:20:38.703 --> 00:20:40.120
You can try this
after we're done.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.980
Another example I
like to remember

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.880
is one from when
I was taking 8.01.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.960
Alan Lazarus was the
instructor at the time,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.220
and he was talking about the
conservation of energy, kinetic

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.450
and potential.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:04.420
And there was a long wire in
a ceiling in 26-100 attached

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.800
to a much bigger
steel ball, but one--

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.270
not one like this.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:15.100
And Lazarus took the ball up
against the wall like this.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.210
He put his head flat against
the wall to steady himself,

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.390
and then he let go,
and the pendulum

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.750
takes many seconds
to go over and back,

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:31.300
and then gently
kisses Lazarus's nose.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.700
And so you have many
seconds to think,

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.550
this guy really believes in
the conservation of energy.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.600
Do not try this at home.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.180
The problem is that, the
first time you do this,

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.820
you may not just let go.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.640
There's a natural
human tendency to push.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.510
So that's a little bit
on a subject of props.

00:22:24.612 --> 00:22:25.320
It's interesting.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.810
Whenever surveys are taken,
students always say more chalk,

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.800
less PowerPoint.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.230
And why would that be?

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.080
Props are also very effective.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.420
Why would that be?

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.870
I'll give you my lunatic
fringe view on this.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:23:02.350
It has to do with what I would
call empathetic mirroring.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.020
When you're sitting up there
watching me write on the board,

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.950
all those little mirror neurons
in your head, I believe,

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.560
become actuated, and
you can feel yourself

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.060
writing on the blackboard.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:18.560
And even more so, when I talk
about this steel ball going

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.270
that way and this way,
you can feel the ball

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:26.380
as if you were me, and you
can't do that with a slide.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.190
You can't do it with a picture.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.820
You need to see it in
the physical world.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.090
That's why I think that--

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.803
oh, yes, of course, it's--

00:23:35.803 --> 00:23:37.470
there are speed
questions involved, too,

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.640
that have to be separated out.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.140
But I think the
empathetic mirroring

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:47.890
is why props and the use of a
blackboard are so effective.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:53.990
Well, let's see-- oh, yes,
there is one more thing

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.100
by way of the
tools, and that has

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.500
to do with the use of slides.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.140
I repeat, I think they're
for exposing ideas,

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.440
not for teaching ideas, but
that's what we do in a job talk

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.230
or conference talk--

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:12.130
expose ideas.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.090
We don't teach them.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.840
So let me tell you a little
bit about my views on that.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:29.060
I remember, once, I was in
Terminal A at Logan Airport.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:33.240
I'd just come back from a
really miserable conference,

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.155
and the flight was
really horrible.

00:24:35.155 --> 00:24:37.530
It was one of those that feels
like an unbalanced washing

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.095
machine.

00:24:39.095 --> 00:24:40.470
And for the only
time in my life,

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:46.620
I decided to stop on my way to
my car and have a cup of coffee

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.560
and relax a little bit.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.450
And as I was there for a few
minutes, someone came up to me

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.690
and said, are you
Professor Winston?

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.808
I think so, I said.

00:24:57.808 --> 00:24:58.350
I don't know.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.570
I guess I was
trying to be funny.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.700
In any event, he said,
I'm on my way to Europe

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.320
to give a job talk.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.440
Would you mine
critiquing my slides?

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.610
Not at all, I said.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.750
You have too many, and
they have too many words.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.280
How did you know, he
said, thinking perhaps I

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.790
had seen a talk of his before.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.800
I hadn't.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.770
My reply was, because
it's always true.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.310
There are always too many
slides, always too many words.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.725
So let me show you some extreme
examples of how not to use

00:25:29.725 --> 00:25:30.225
slides.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:42.270
Well, for this demonstration,
I need to be way over here

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:48.510
and when I get over here, then
I can start to say things like,

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.342
one of the things you shouldn't
do is read your transparencies.

00:25:51.342 --> 00:25:53.050
People in your audience
know how to read,

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.410
and reading will
just annoy them.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.940
Also, you should
be sure that you

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.700
have only a few words
on each transparency,

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.160
and that the words
are easy to read.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.310
And I hope I'm driving
you crazy because I'm

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.550
committing all kinds of
crimes, the first of which

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:12.540
is that there are too
many words on the slide.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.630
Second of which is,
I'm way over there,

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.560
and the slide's way over there.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.070
So you get into this
tennis match feeling

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.700
of shifting back and
forth between the slide

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.600
and the speaker.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.790
You want the slides to
be condiments to what

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.730
you're saying, not the main
event or the opposite way

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:31.150
around.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.420
So how can we fix this?

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.860
Step number one is to get
rid of the background junk.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.560
That's always distraction.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.590
Step number two is to
get rid of the words.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.320
When I reduced the
words to these,

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.210
then everything I
read a previous time,

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.270
I'm not licensed to say,
because it's not on the slide.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.090
I'm not reading
my slides anymore,

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.370
but I'm saying what was
written on the slides

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:02.010
in a previous example.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.310
So what else can we
do to simplify this?

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.760
Well, we can get
rid of the logos.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.750
We don't need them.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.030
Simplification.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.400
What else can we do?

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.410
Get rid of the title.

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:20.240
Now, I want to talk to you
about some rules for slide

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.250
preparation.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:22.840
I'm telling you the title.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.880
It doesn't have to be up there.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.370
By reducing the number
of words on the slide,

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.350
I'm allowing you to pay
more attention to me

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:32.295
and less to what's
written on the slide.

00:27:32.295 --> 00:27:34.420
I mentioned it before--
we-- have only one language

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.140
processor, and we can
either use it to read stuff

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.170
or to listen to the speaker.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.240
And so if we have too
many words on the slide,

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.700
it forces people in the
audience to read this stuff

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.330
and not listen.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.570
A student of mine did an
experiment a few years ago.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:28:00.130
He taught some students some
web-based programming ideas.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.580
Half the information was on
slides, he said the other half,

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.630
and then for a control
group, he reversed it.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.960
And the question was,
what did the subjects--

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.240
that is to say, freshmen
at his fraternity--

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.040
what did the subjects
remember best, what he said,

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.260
or what they read on the slide?

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.432
And the answer is, what
they read on the slide.

00:28:26.432 --> 00:28:28.390
When their slides have
a lot of material on it,

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.110
they don't pay attention
to the speaker.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.190
In fact, in the after action
report, one of the subjects

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.100
said, I wish you
hadn't talked so much.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.060
It was distracting.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.120
Well, the last item
is eliminate clutter.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.230
Here's some clutter.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.710
No reason even
for those bullets.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.780
So the too many words
problem is a consequence

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.410
of a crime Microsoft
has committed

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.350
by allowing you to use
fonts that are too small.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:03.570
So you should all have
a sample slide like this

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.240
that you can use to determine
what the minimum font

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.480
size is that's easily legible.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.745
[INAUDIBLE],, what do
you think of those?

00:29:14.745 --> 00:29:16.212
AUDIENCE: Which size is right?

00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:17.190
PATRICK WINSTON: What's that?

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:19.023
AUDIENCE: Did you ask
me what size is right?

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:21.560
PATRICK WINSTON:
Yeah, minimum, maybe.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.770
AUDIENCE: 40 or 50.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.990
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah,
he says 40 or 50.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.050
I think that's about right.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.730
35 is beginning to get
too small, not necessarily

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.917
because you can't read it,
but because you're probably

00:29:32.917 --> 00:29:34.750
using it to get too
many words on the slide.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.940
What other crimes do we have?

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.755
Well, we have the
laser pointer crime.

00:29:43.755 --> 00:29:46.890
And for that-- in
the old days, when

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.120
we didn't have laser
pointers, we used wooden ones,

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.590
and people would go waving
these things around.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:59.450
And pretty soon it became almost
like a baton twirling contest,

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.400
so here's what I
recommended in the old days

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.080
for dealing with
this kind of pointer.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.530
This is an example
of use of a prop.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.090
Jim Glass up there saw this
talk about 20 years ago,

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.380
and said, oh, yeah,
I remember that talk.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.250
That's the one where
you broke the pointer.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.200
It's amazing how
props tend to be

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.480
the things that are remembered.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.215
Well, now, we don't have
physical pointers anymore.

00:30:32.215 --> 00:30:35.880
We've got laser pointers.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.090
It's a wonder more people aren't
driven into epileptic fits

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.190
over this sort of stuff.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.848
Well, here's what
tends to happen.

00:30:43.848 --> 00:30:44.390
Look at that.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:49.170
It's a lovely recursive picture,
and I can become part of it

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.026
by putting that laser beam
right on the back of my head

00:30:52.026 --> 00:30:52.526
up there.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.720
Then what do you see?

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.440
You see the back of my head.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.830
I have no eye contact,
no engagement, nothing.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:08.300
I was sitting with a student
watching a talk one day,

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.790
and she said, you know
what, we could all leave,

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:12.710
and he wouldn't know.

00:31:16.065 --> 00:31:17.940
So what happens when
you use a laser pointer?

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.090
You can't use a laser pointer
without turning your head

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:25.050
and pointing it at something,
and when you do that,

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.570
you lose contact
with the audience.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.590
You don't want to do it.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.705
So what do you do if you
need to identify something

00:31:32.705 --> 00:31:34.080
in your image,
and you don't want

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.280
to point at it with a laser?

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.840
This is what you do.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.340
Put a little arrow
on there and say,

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.730
now, look at that guy at
the end of arrow number one.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.730
You don't need to have
laser pointer to do that.

00:31:48.933 --> 00:31:52.480
The too-heavy
crime-- when people

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.370
ask me to review
a presentation, I

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.940
ask them to print it out
and lay it out on a table.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.450
When they do that, it's easy
to see whether the talk is

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.740
too heavy, too much
text, not enough air, not

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.950
enough white space,
not enough imagery.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:16.540
This is a good example
of such a talk--

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.300
way too heavy.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.982
The presenter has taken
advantage of a small font sizes

00:32:22.982 --> 00:32:24.690
to get as much on the
slide as he wanted.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.080
Lots of other crimes here,
but the too-heavy-- the fact

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.800
that it's too heavy is what
I wanted to illustrate.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.750
So here, by contrast,
another talk--

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.890
one I gave a few years ago.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.520
It's not-- it wasn't a
deeply technical talk,

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.800
but I show it to you
because there's air in it.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.110
It's mostly pictures of things.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.930
There are three or four
slides that have text on them,

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.282
but when I come to those, I give
the audience time to read them.

00:32:56.282 --> 00:32:57.990
And they're there
because they might have

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.613
some historical significance.

00:33:00.613 --> 00:33:02.280
The first slide with
a lot of text on it

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.120
is an extraction from the 1957--

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.830
from the proposal for the 1957
AI conference at Dartmouth.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.190
Extraordinarily
interesting event,

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.790
and that historical
extraction from the proposal

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.960
helps drive that point home.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.080
What else have we got here?

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.680
Oh, yeah, your vocabulary
word for the day.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.770
This is an hapax legomenon.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.170
What that means is, this
is the kind of slide

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:36.540
you can get away with exactly
once in your presentation.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.910
This is a slide that got
some currency some years

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:43.500
ago because it shows the
complexity of governing

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:49.640
in Afghanistan by showing
how impossibly complex it is.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.480
It's something you in the
audience can't understand,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.920
and that's the point, but
you can't have many of these.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.590
You can have one per work,
one per presentation,

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.780
one per paper, one per book.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.620
That's what hapax legomenon is,
and this is an example of it.

00:34:06.725 --> 00:34:08.100
Well, I've shown
you some crimes.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.739
So you might be asking, do
these crimes actually occur?

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:16.861
So they do.

00:34:16.861 --> 00:34:21.775
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:21.775 --> 00:34:23.400
There's the hands in
the pockets crime.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:32.210
There's a crime and time
and place selection here.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.837
This is how you get
to the Bartos Theater.

00:34:35.837 --> 00:34:37.670
First thing you do is
you get on these steps

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:44.120
over at the Media Lab, then you
cross this large open space,

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.920
then you turn right
down this corridor.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.201
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:47.201 --> 00:34:48.860
At this point,
whenever I go in there,

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.962
I wonder if there are torture
implements around the corner.

00:34:51.962 --> 00:34:52.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:52.462 --> 00:34:54.530
And then when you
get in there, you

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.680
get into this
dark, gloomy place.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.418
So it's well named when they
call it the Bartos Theater

00:35:00.418 --> 00:35:02.460
because it's a place where
you can watch a movie,

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.418
but it's not a place
where you can give a talk.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.700
Now, on a subject
of does it happen,

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.870
here's a talk I attended
a while back in Stata.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.150
Notice that the speaker is
far away from the slides.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:22.750
Speaker's using a laser pointer.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.110
And you say to me, well,
what's happening here?

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:29.500
It's, by the way,
the 80th - 80th!

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.460
slide of the presentation.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.320
Notice that it extends
with the words,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.810
this is the first of
10 conclusions slides.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:37.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.740
So what's the audience reaction?

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.572
That's the sponsor
of the meeting.

00:35:43.572 --> 00:35:44.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.320
He's reading his email.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.240
This is the co-sponsor
of the meeting.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.012
He's examining the lunch menu.

00:35:52.012 --> 00:35:54.552
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:55.510
What about this person?

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:02.250
This person looks like
he's paying attention,

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.863
but just because
it's a still picture.

00:36:04.863 --> 00:36:06.780
If you were to see a
video, what you would see

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:10.555
is something like this [YAWNS].

00:36:10.555 --> 00:36:14.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.960
So yeah, it does happen.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:23.080
Well, now, that's a
quick review of tools.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.700
Now, I want to talk
about some special cases.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.830
We could talk a little
bit about the informing

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:38.010
or to say another way,
doing what I'm doing now.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.360
But I'll just say a
few words about that.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.340
In that kind of
presentation, you

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.870
want to start with a promise
like I did for this hour

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.255
that we're going through now.

00:36:48.255 --> 00:36:49.630
And then it comes
to the question

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.888
of how do you inspire people?

00:36:52.888 --> 00:36:54.430
I've given this talk
for a long time,

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:58.300
and a few years ago,
our department chairman

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.260
said, would you please give
this talk to a new faculty,

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:06.732
and be sure to emphasize what
it takes to inspire students.

00:37:06.732 --> 00:37:09.190
And strangely, I hadn't thought
about that question before.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.290
So I started a survey.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.490
I'd talked to some of my
incoming freshmen advisees,

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.290
and I talked to senior
faculty and everything

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:21.520
in between about how
they've been inspired.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.963
What I found from
the incoming freshmen

00:37:23.963 --> 00:37:26.380
is that they were inspired by
some high school teacher who

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.050
told them they could do it.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:32.140
What I found in
the senior faculty,

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.280
they were inspired
by someone who

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.310
helped them see a
problem in a new way.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:44.050
And what I saw from everyone
is that they were inspired when

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:49.680
someone exhibited passion
about what they were doing,

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.920
exhibited passion about
what they were doing.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.720
So that's one way
to be inspiring.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:03.310
It's easy for me because I
do artificial intelligence.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:06.030
And how can you
not be interested

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.230
in artificial intelligence?

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.842
I mean, if you're not interested
in artificial intelligence,

00:38:10.842 --> 00:38:13.050
you're probably not interested
in interesting things.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:20.640
So when I'm lecturing in my
AI class, it's natural for me

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.550
to talk about what
I think is cool

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:27.320
and how exciting
some new idea is.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.080
So that's the kind of
expression of passion

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.950
that makes a difference
while informing with respect

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.080
to this question of inspiring.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.540
Oh, yeah and of course,
during this promise phase,

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.070
you can also express
how cool stuff is.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:50.670
Let me give you an example of
a lecture that starts this way.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:53.060
I'm talking about
resource allocation.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.760
It's the same sort of stuff
you would think of when your--

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.302
it's the same sort
of ideas you would

00:38:57.302 --> 00:39:01.290
need if you're allocating
aircraft to a flight schedule

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:04.000
or trying to schedule a
factory or something like that.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.060
But the example
is putting colors

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.760
on the states in
the United States

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.380
without any bordering states
having the same color.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.050
So here it goes.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.600
This is what I show at the
beginning of the class.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.520
This is a way of
doing that coloring.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.440
And you might say, well, why
don't we wait till it finishes?

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.190
Would you like to do that?

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.283
No?

00:39:29.283 --> 00:39:31.200
Well, we're not going
to wait till it finishes

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.990
because the sun will have
exploded and consumed the earth

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.430
before this program finishes.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.520
But with a slight adjustment
to how the program works, which

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.070
I tell my students you will
understand in the next 50

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.660
minutes, this is what you get.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:50.630
Isn't that cool?

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.160
You got to be
amazed by stuff that

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.830
takes a computation from
longer than the lifetime

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:00.920
of the solar system
into a few seconds.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.757
So that's what I mean by
providing a promise upfront

00:40:05.757 --> 00:40:07.340
and expressing some
passion about what

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.400
you're talking about.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.080
Well, the last item
in this little block

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.110
here is it has to
do with what people

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.640
think that they do it at MIT.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.880
You ask faculty what the
most important purpose is,

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.480
and they'll say, well, the
most important thing I do

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.060
is teach people how to think.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.090
And then you say
oh, that's great.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:32.030
How do you teach
people how to think?

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.730
Blank stare.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.040
No one can quite
respond to that part,

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.693
that natural next question.

00:40:40.693 --> 00:40:42.360
So how do you teach
people how to think?

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:48.840
Well, I believe that we
are storytelling animals.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.518
And that we start
developing our story,

00:40:52.518 --> 00:40:54.060
understanding and
manipulating skills

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.810
with fairy tales in
childhood and continue on

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:02.490
through professional schools
like law, business, medicine,

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:03.870
everything.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.690
And we continue doing
that throughout life.

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.870
So if that is what
thinking is all about.

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.730
And we want to teach
people how to think,

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.490
you provide them with the
stories they need to know,

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:17.070
the questions they need to
ask about those stories,

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.350
mechanisms for
analyzing those stories,

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.890
ways of putting
stories together,

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:24.760
ways of evaluating how
reliable a story is.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.080
And that's what I think you
need to do when you teach people

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.770
how to think.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.920
But that's all about education.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.790
And many of you here
are not necessarily

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:39.870
for that, but rather
for this part,

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:43.410
for persuading, which breaks
down into several categories,

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:48.210
oral exams, not shown,
shop talks, getting famous.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:51.720
I won't say much about oral
exams other than the fact

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.930
that they used to be a lot
scarier than they are today.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:59.280
In the old days,
reading the literature

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.410
in a foreign language
was a part of that.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.350
And there was a
high failure rate.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:08.790
And when you look back
on those failures,

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:12.540
the most usual reason for
people failing an oral exam

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:17.460
is failure to situate and
a failure to practice.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.430
By situate, I mean,
it's important to talk

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:22.680
about your research in context.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.530
This is a problem that's being
pursued all over the world.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:30.450
There hasn't been any progress
before me in the past 30 years.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.160
Everyone is looking
for a solution

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.840
because it will
have impact on so

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.380
many other things, such
situating and time and place

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.860
and feel.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.970
And then as far as
practice is concerned, yes,

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:43.530
practice is important.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:48.090
But that doesn't mean showing
your slides to the people

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.370
you share an with.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:54.023
The problem with that is that if
people know what you're doing,

00:42:54.023 --> 00:42:55.440
they will hallucinate
that there's

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.480
material in your
presentation that isn't there

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.748
if it isn't there.

00:42:59.748 --> 00:43:01.290
A variation on the
scene, by the way,

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:06.330
is your faculty supervisor
is not a very good person

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.300
to help you debug a talk
because they, in fact, know

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.200
what you're doing.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.940
And they will, in
fact, hallucinate

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.818
there's material in your
presentation that isn't there.

00:43:14.818 --> 00:43:16.860
So you need to get together
with some friends who

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.180
don't know what you're
doing and have them--

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.760
well, you start the
practice session by saying,

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.330
if you can't make me cry,
I won't value as a friend

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:27.840
anymore.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.600
And then when you get to
the faculty on a oral exam,

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.350
it will be easy.

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:39.000
You see, difficulty--
the amount of flak

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.990
you'll get from somebody
is proportional to age.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:45.390
The older somebody
is, the more they

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.160
understand where they
are in the world.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.470
But the young people are
trying to show the old people

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.122
how smart they are, so
it's subtly vicious.

00:43:52.122 --> 00:43:53.580
So whenever you
have an opportunity

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.140
to have an examining
committee that's

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:59.490
full of people with gray
hair, that's what you want.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.500
Well, that's just a word
or two about something

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.460
I haven't listed here.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.610
Let's get into the
subject of job talks.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:14.230
So I was sitting in a bar
many years ago in San Diego.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.680
I was a member of the
Navy Science Board,

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:21.420
and I was sitting with a couple
of my colleagues on the board

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:24.910
Delores Etter from the
University of Colorado.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.960
She made me so jealous I could
spit because she'd written 21

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.660
books, and I'd only written 17.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:35.130
And then the other
one was Bill Weldon

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.230
from the University of Texas.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:41.280
He was an electromagnetism
guy, and he

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.030
knew how to use rail guns to
drive steel rods through tank

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.660
armor.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.590
These were interesting people.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:53.880
So I said, what do you look
for in a faculty candidate?

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.000
And within one
microsecond, Delores

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.270
said, they have
to show us they've

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:05.940
got some kind of vision, quickly
followed by Bill who said,

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.063
they have to show us that
they've done something.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.550
Oh, that sounds good, I said.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.560
And then I said
to them, how long

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.640
does a candidate have to
establish these two things?

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.850
What do you think?

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.510
Well, compare your
answer to theirs.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.803
Five minutes.

00:45:36.803 --> 00:45:38.470
So if you haven't
expressed your vision,

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:42.850
if you haven't told people that
you've done something in five

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.880
minutes, you've already lost.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.630
So you have to be
able to do that.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:51.250
And let me just mention a couple
of things in that connection.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:54.190
Here, the vision is
in part, a problem

00:45:54.190 --> 00:46:00.340
that somebody cares about and
something new in your approach.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:08.560
So the problem is
understanding the nature

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.480
of human intelligence.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.640
And the approach
is asking questions

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.510
about what makes us
different from chimpanzees

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.130
and Neanderthals.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.720
Is it merely a
matter of quantity,

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.320
or we're just a little bit
smarter in some continuous way?

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.490
Or do we have something
that's fundamentally different

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:30.550
that chimpanzees don't have
and Neanderthals either?

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:34.630
And the answer is yes, we
do have something different.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.900
We are symbolic creatures.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.550
And because we're
symbolic creatures,

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:44.560
we can build
symbolic descriptions

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.330
of relations and events.

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:48.835
We can string them
together and make stories.

00:46:48.835 --> 00:46:51.760
And because we can make stories,
that's what makes us different.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.190
So that's my stump speech.

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:56.560
That's how I start
most of my talks

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.260
on my own personal research.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:04.990
How do you express the notion
that you've done something?

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:10.240
By listing the steps that need
to be taken in order to achieve

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.602
the solution to that problem.

00:47:12.602 --> 00:47:14.560
You don't have to have
done all of those steps.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.370
But you can say here's
what needs to be done.

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:20.660
An example, here's
what needs to be done.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.260
We need to specify
some behavior.

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.840
We need to enumerate
the constraints that

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.690
make it possible to
deal with that behavior.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:31.030
We have to implement a system
because we're engineers,

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.190
and we don't think that
we've understood something

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:35.333
unless we can build it.

00:47:35.333 --> 00:47:37.000
And we've built such
a system, and we're

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.542
about to demonstrate
it to you today.

00:47:38.542 --> 00:47:42.040
That would be an example of
enumerating a series of steps

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.290
needed to realize the vision.

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:49.280
So then blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.250
And then you conclude by--

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:54.550
you conclude by enumerating
your contributions.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:03.930
It's kind of mirror
of these steps.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:06.610
And it helps to establish
that you've done something.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.730
So that's a kind of
general purpose framework

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:12.180
for doing a technical talk.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:16.930
Now, only a few more
things left to do today.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.360
Getting famous is the
next item on our agenda

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.920
because once you've
got the job, you

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.420
need to think a
little bit about how

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.790
you're going to be
recognized for what you do.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:38.140
So oh, first of all, why should
you care about getting famous?

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.360
I thought about
this in connection

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.920
with a fundraising
event I attended

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:49.920
once, a fundraising
event for raising money

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.680
to save Venice from going under
water and having all of its art

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.820
destroyed.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:49:00.210
Anyway, I was sitting here,
and JC was sitting here.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:03.210
That was Julia, the
late Julia Child.

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:10.950
And as the evening wore
on, more and more people

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:14.760
would come up and ask Julia
to autograph something

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:19.590
or express a feeling that
she had changed their life.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:23.380
And it just happened
over and over again.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:27.810
So eventually, I turned to
Julia, and I said, Ms. Child,

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:30.157
is it fun to be famous?

00:49:30.157 --> 00:49:31.740
And she thought about
it for a second.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.752
And she said, you
get used to it.

00:49:34.752 --> 00:49:35.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.070
But you know what occured to me?

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:41.590
You never get used
to being ignored.

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:45.240
So it's-- here's a
way to think about it.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.100
Your ideas are
like your children.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.370
And you don't want them to
go into the world in rags.

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.870
So what you want
to do is to be sure

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:55.390
that you have these
techniques, these mechanisms,

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:58.470
these thoughts about how to
present ideas that you have so

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:02.280
that they're recognized for
the value that is in them.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.370
So that's why it's a legitimate
thing to concern yourself

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:08.010
with packaging.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:11.070
Now, how do you get remembered?

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:14.720
Well, there's something I
like to call Winston's star.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:20.130
And every one of the items
I'm about to articulate starts

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:24.510
with an S. So if you want
your presentation ideas

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:27.240
to be remembered, one of
the things you need to do

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:32.820
is to make sure that you have
some kind of symbol associated

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.590
with your work.

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:37.980
So this arch example is
actually from my PhD thesis

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.780
many, many years ago.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:45.000
And in the course of
my work at that time,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.820
this work on arch learning
became mildly famous,

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.770
and I didn't know why.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:51.630
It was only many years
later that I realized

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:54.660
that that work accidentally
had all of the elements

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.220
on this star.

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.910
So the first element is that
there was a kind of symbol.

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:00.900
It's the arch itself.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:10.480
Next thing you need is
some kind of slogan,

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.740
a kind of phrase that
provides a handle on the work.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:17.160
And in this case, the phrase
was one shot learning.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.340
And it was one shot
because the program I wrote

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:27.030
learned something definite
from every example that

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:28.860
was presented to us.

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:32.970
So in going from a model
based on this configuration

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:35.940
to something that isn't an arch
base on that configuration,

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.640
the program learned that
it has to be on top,

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.490
one shot learning.

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:45.210
So that's a symbol, slogan.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:46.575
And now we need a surprise.

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.290
Yeah, the surprise is you
don't need a million examples

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:55.910
of something to learn.

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:58.010
You can do it with
one example if you're

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:02.180
smart enough to make use of
that example appropriately.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.230
So that was the surprise.

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:07.160
You can learn something
definite from each example.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.840
Next item was a salient idea.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.785
Now, when I say salient
idea, I don't mean important.

00:52:16.785 --> 00:52:18.410
What I mean is an
idea that sticks out.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.080
Some theses, funnily enough,
have too many good ideas,

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.110
and you don't know what it's all
about because which one is it?

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.290
So you need an idea
that sticks out.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:33.890
And the idea that stuck out here
was the notion of a near miss.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:43.650
You see, this is not an arch,
but it doesn't miss by much.

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:45.490
So it's a near miss.

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:50.920
And finally, you need
to tell the story

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:56.160
of how you did it, how it
works, why it's important.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.720
So that's a bit on how to
not so much get famous,

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:06.240
but how to ensure that
your work is recognized.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.890
Well, we're almost
finished because now we're

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:13.470
down to this last item,
which is how to stop.

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:14.998
And when we come
to that, there's

00:53:14.998 --> 00:53:17.290
a question of all right,
well, what is the final slide?

00:53:22.412 --> 00:53:23.620
And what are the final words?

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:32.830
So for the final
slide, let me give you

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:34.750
some examples of possibilities.

00:53:37.588 --> 00:53:38.380
How about this one?

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:50.610
Well, you might see that
slide and think to yourself,

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:53.730
there are 1,000 faculty at MIT.

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.770
Nice piece of work,
but not so much,

00:53:55.770 --> 00:54:01.050
but it's only a tiny piece of
work if you divide by 1,000.

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.810
So when you show a whole
gigantic list of collaborators

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:07.380
at the end of a talk,
it's a kind of let down

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:09.150
because it suggests
that nobody knows.

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:12.650
Well, did you do
anything significant?

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:15.180
Now, you've got to recognize
your collaborators, right?

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.970
So where do you do that?

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:19.877
Not on the last slide,
on the first slide.

00:54:19.877 --> 00:54:21.210
All this was on the first slide.

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.263
These are the
collaborators, so you don't

00:54:23.263 --> 00:54:24.430
want to put them at the end.

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:25.805
You don't want a
slide like this.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:31.060
How about this one?

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.050
This is the worst possible
way to end a talk.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:34.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:39.410
Because this slide can be
up there for 20 minutes.

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:40.660
I've seen it happen.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.820
It squanders real estate.

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:47.420
It squanders an opportunity
to tell people who you are.

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:48.200
It's just--

00:54:51.777 --> 00:54:52.610
What about this one?

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:57.800
I often see it.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:01.300
I never see anybody
write it down.

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.991
Also, it wastes opportunity.

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:11.440
Oh my God, even worse.

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:18.180
All of these lines
do nothing for you.

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.840
They waste an opportunity
for you to tell people--

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.730
to leave people with what you--

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:26.360
with who you are.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.000
Well, what about this?

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.450
Is this a good one?

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:34.660
It might seem so at first,
but here's the problem.

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.040
If you say these
are my conclusions,

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.960
these are perfectly
legitimate conclusions

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.910
that nobody cares about.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:47.557
What they care about
is what you have done.

00:55:47.557 --> 00:55:49.140
And that's why your
final slide should

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:53.460
have this label, contributions.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.510
It's a mirror of what I said
over there about how job talks

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:57.830
ought to be like a sandwich.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.460
And the final slide,
the one that's

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.240
up there while people are
asking questions and filing out,

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.470
it ought to be the one that
has your contributions on it.

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:09.140
Here's an example from
my own stump speech.

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:13.020
Yeah, this is what
I talk about a lot.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:16.912
Yes, here are the things
that I typically demonstrate.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.146
And I wait for
people to read it.

00:56:23.146 --> 00:56:27.616
And the final element there is
this is what we get out of it,

00:56:27.616 --> 00:56:32.780
so that's an example of
a contribution slide.

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:37.670
All right, now, what
about the other part?

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.740
You got your final
slide up there.

00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:41.150
It's a contribution slide.

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:44.430
Somehow you have to tell
people you're finished.

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:47.551
So let's see it, check
out a few possibilities.

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:54.700
One thing you could
do in the final words

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.000
is you could tell a joke.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.232
It's OK.

00:57:02.232 --> 00:57:04.565
By the time you're done,
people have adjusted themselves

00:57:04.565 --> 00:57:05.728
to your voice parameters.

00:57:05.728 --> 00:57:06.770
They're ready for a joke.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.010
I was sitting in another bar,
this time in Austin, Texas

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:16.310
with a colleague of
mine named Doug Lenat.

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:18.880
And Doug's a fantastic speaker.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.920
And so I said to
Doug, Doug, you're

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.860
a fantastic speaker,
what's your secret?

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:29.440
And he said, oh, I always
finish with a joke,

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.120
and that way, people think
they've had fun the whole time.

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:39.540
So yeah, a joke will
work down there.

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.580
How about this one?

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:51.270
Thank you.

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:55.650
I don't recommend it.

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:58.410
It's a weak move.

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:00.330
You will not go to
hell if you conclude

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.730
your talk by saying thank
you, but it's a weak move,

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:04.880
and here's why.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:08.460
When you say thank you, even
worse, thank you for listening,

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.350
it suggests that
everybody has stayed

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:14.310
that long out of politeness and
that they had a profound desire

00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:15.632
to be somewhere else.

00:58:15.632 --> 00:58:17.340
But they're so polite,
they stuck it out.

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.430
And that's what you're
thanking them for.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:21.990
So once wild
applause has started,

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:24.240
you can mouth a thank
you, and there's

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.380
nothing wrong with that.

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:29.992
But the last thing you do
should not be saying thank you.

00:58:29.992 --> 00:58:31.950
Now, you say to me, well,
doesn't everybody say

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:33.570
thank you?

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:37.800
Well, what everybody does is
not necessarily the right thing.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.110
And I like to illustrate
how some talks can

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:41.580
end without saying thank you.

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:45.210
I like to draw from
political speeches,

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:47.956
but the ones that I've heard
recently aren't so good, so--

00:58:47.956 --> 00:58:50.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:55.500
So I'm going to have to
go go back a little bit.

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.010
So here is Governor Christie.

00:58:57.010 --> 00:59:03.680
He gave the Republican
keynote address one year.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.040
This is the end of his talk.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.214
Let's see what he does.

00:59:07.214 --> 00:59:08.966
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:08.966 --> 00:59:11.920
CHRIS CHRISTIE: And together,
everybody, together.

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.060
We will stand up once again
for American greatness

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.190
for our children
and grandchildren.

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:20.583
God bless you, and
God bless America.

00:59:20.583 --> 00:59:23.241
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:27.260
PATRICK WINSTON: So that's a
classic benediction ending.

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:30.620
God bless you,
God bless America.

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.610
Now, I don't want to
be partisan about this.

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:35.570
So I think I'd better switch
to the keynote address

00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.840
in the Democratic Convention.

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.050
It was delivered that year
by Bill Clinton, who knows

00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:45.010
something about how to speak.

00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:46.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.940
BILL CLINTON: If that
is what you want,

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:52.300
if that is what you
believe, you must vote,

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:57.046
and you must re-elect
President Barack Obama.

00:59:57.046 --> 00:59:58.588
God bless you, and
God bless America.

00:59:58.588 --> 01:00:00.061
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:00.061 --> 01:00:03.989
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.410
PATRICK WINSTON:
Now, watch this.

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:13.297
Let's go back a little
bit and redo it.

01:00:13.297 --> 01:00:15.130
What I want you to see
is that at one point,

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:18.430
he seems to be almost pressing
his lips together, forcing

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:20.315
himself not to say thank you.

01:00:20.315 --> 01:00:22.690
Then there's another place
where he does a little salute.

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:24.784
So watch for those
this time around.

01:00:24.784 --> 01:00:25.650
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.210
BILL CLINTON: If that
is what you want,

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:31.470
if that is what you
believe, you must vote,

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:36.310
and you must re-elect
President Barack Obama.

01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:38.470
God bless you., and
God bless America.

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:39.625
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:42.208
PATRICK WINSTON: That's
where he's pursing his lips.

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.186
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:43.186 --> 01:00:45.142
There's the salute.

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:49.455
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:49.455 --> 01:00:50.830
Yeah, I think
that's pretty good.

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.640
Now, what are we gonna
take away from this?

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.910
Well, I suppose I could conclude
this talk by saying God bless

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:00.960
you, and God bless the
Massachusetts Institute

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.732
of Technology, but it
might not work so well.

01:01:04.732 --> 01:01:06.190
But what you can
get out of this is

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:08.110
you don't have to say thank you.

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:09.850
There are other
things you can do.

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:13.060
And it's interesting that over
time, people figure this out,

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.730
and there's some stock
ways of ending things.

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:21.180
So in the Catholic church,
and the good old Latin mass,

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:27.990
it ended with ite
missa est, which

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:31.380
translates approximately
to OK, the mass is over,

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.718
you can go home now.

01:01:32.718 --> 01:01:34.470
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:37.440
And of course, at
musical concerts,

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.230
you know that it's time to clap
not at the end of the song,

01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:45.810
but rather when the conductor
goes over and shakes hands

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:47.280
with the concert master.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.850
Those are conventions that tell
you that the event is over.

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:58.500
So those are all
possibilities for here.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.180
But one more
possibility, and that

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:07.320
is that you can
salute the audience.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.070
And by that, I mean,
you can say something

01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:13.060
about how much you value
your time at a place.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:20.000
So I could say, well, it's
been great fun being here.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.780
It's been fascinating to see
what you folks are doing here

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.190
at MIT.

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:27.535
I've been much
stimulated and provoked

01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:29.410
by the kinds of questions
you've been asking,

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:30.800
it's been really great.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.380
And I look forward
to coming back

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.210
on many occasions in the future.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.693
So that salutes the audience.

01:02:36.693 --> 01:02:37.360
You can do that.

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.520
Well, there it is.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.260
You know what?

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.940
I'm glad you're here.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.830
And the reason is
by being here, I

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:51.590
think you have demonstrated
an understanding

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:54.770
that how you present and how
you package your ideas is

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.510
an important thing.

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:58.013
And I salute you for that.

01:02:58.013 --> 01:03:03.500
[LAUGHTER] And I suggest that
you come back again and bring

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.990
your friends.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:09.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.850
PROFESSOR: OK, so
time for new subject.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.350
Let's introduce the subject and
pose the questions that we're

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.870
going to try to answer.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.300
And I feel that with
identical particles,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.820
there's lots to think
about, and it makes it

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.170
into an interesting way
to conclude the course.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.950
So identical particles.

00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:39.540
So there is the issue
of defining what do you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.610
mean by identical particles?

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.060
And then the issue
of treating them.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.770
So when do we say that two
particles are identical?

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.950
We say two particles
are identical if all

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:00.930
their intrinsic properties--
like mass, spin, charge,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.850
magnetic moment--

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.780
if all these things are the
same, these two particles--

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.330
we have particle
1 and particle 2--

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.610
are said to be identical.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.350
For example, all electrons
are said to be identical.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.140
And if you think about it,
well, what does that mean?

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.250
You can have an electron
moving with some velocity

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.050
and an electron standing here,
and they don't look identical.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.410
They have different states.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.840
Well, they're
identical in the sense

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.720
that-- what we said-- the
intrinsic properties are

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.860
the same.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.710
Those two particle
have the same mass.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.800
They have the same spin--

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.910
in principle.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.160
They have the same charge.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.009
Have the same magnetic moment.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.300
Have all these same properties.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.360
Now, they can be in
different states.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.120
One electron can be
one momentum state,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.510
an electron can be in
another momentum state.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.840
One electron can be in
a spin state-- spin up.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.660
This can mean spin down.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.920
But what we would
mean is that if you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000
would put, by saying these
particles are identical,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.740
we also mean they're
indistinguishable.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.740
What that would mean
is that if one of you

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.941
gives me an electron with spin
up with some momentum state,

00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:33.440
and--

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.760
yeah, let's say spin up
on some momentum state.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.990
And another one of you gives me
another electron with same spin

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.210
up, same momentum state, and
I have those two electrons

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.070
and I play with
them for a minute

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.680
and I give them back
to you, you have

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.580
no way of telling you
got the same electron

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.790
or you got your
friend's electron.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.230
There's no possible
experiment that can

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.170
tell which electron you got.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.820
So when we have identical
particles like electrons--

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.810
elementary particles--
we understand

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.330
what it means to be identical.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.400
Doesn't mean they're
in the same state.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.770
It means that this is a
particle that all the properties

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.740
intrinsic of them are the same.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.200
If you have a more
complicated particle,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.440
you still can use the concept
of identical particles.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.600
So, for example,
you have a proton.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.510
A proton is a more
complicated particle.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.060
It is made of quarks.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.160
And if you have
two protons, they

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.620
are identical in
that same sense.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.280
All the properties we
can give to the proton--

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.310
the spin state of
the proton, mass

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.150
of the proton, the dipole
moment of a proton,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.980
the magnetic moment of a--

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.480
all those are the same.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.020
If you prepare those
protons in identical states,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.370
I cannot tell which is proton
1 and which is proton 2.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.370
Then you have the neutrons.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.100
Neutrons are the same thing.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.200
The neutrons can be
in several states,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.640
but two neutrons are
considered to be identical.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.950
We can complicate matters more.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.020
We can take hydrogen atoms.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.110
Are hydrogen atoms
identical particles?

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.970
And in quantum mechanics,
we can think of them

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.720
as identical particles--
or identical atoms,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.170
or identical molecules, or if
you write the wave function

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.160
for a hydrogen atom-- a new
kind of entity of particle--

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.610
we will use the axioms
of identical particles

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.170
even for the hydrogen atom.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.150
But you could say, oh, no,
but they're not identical.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.870
A hydrogen atom can be
in the ground state,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.250
or it can be in
an excited state.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.970
But that's the same as
saying this electrode is

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.030
going with little momentum,
and this is with high momentum.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.580
These are states of
the hydrogen atom.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.430
Just like an electron has
spin up and spin down,

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.370
hydrogen atom has this state,
that state, that state.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.410
If you arrange them
in the same state,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.460
you cannot tell
they are different.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.720
So however clear these
comments can seem--

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.750
or confusing, perhaps--
things can be a little subtle.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.390
In many ways, for
example, physicists

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:51.170
used to think of protons and
neutrons as the same particle.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.840
Said what?

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.620
Well, that's the way
they thought about it.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.950
It's a very nice thing.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.370
If you're working
with energy scales,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.770
the proton and neutron
mass difference

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.640
is not that big, first of all.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.140
So at some scale for the
resolution of some experiments,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.440
or physicists that didn't
have that many tools,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.880
the proton and the neutron
were almost identical,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.030
and people invented this
term called isospin.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.640
And you might have heard of it.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.850
It's a very famous symmetry
of the strong interactions.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.380
In fact, for the
strong interactions,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.360
you have a nucleus.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.280
Whether you're a
proton or a neutron

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.290
doesn't make that
much difference.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:50.470
So people used to think of
this thing as an isospin state.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.040
Just the spin one half--
you have spin up, spin down.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:01.030
Isospin means spin in some new
direction that is unimaginable.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.680
But the isospin up
would be the proton,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.340
the isospin down
would be the neutron.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.660
And you will have a doublet.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.320
So people used to think
of these two particles

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.560
as different states
of a nucleon,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.970
and then they would say,
all nucleons are identical.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.070
Why do you complain?

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.360
A proton is the
same as a neutron.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.630
It's just a different
state of the isospin,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.620
just like the spin electron
up or spin down is the same.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.280
So the power of the
[? formalism ?] in quantum

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.400
mechanics is that it
allows you to treat

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.840
these things as
identical particles,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.910
and this makes sense.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.010
For you-- for your experiments--
these are identical things

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.030
that you can think of
different states of that.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.350
You may as well
treat them that way.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.630
So this is basically
what happens.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.910
Now, so we define
the identical--

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.060
I didn't write anything here.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.640
I'm going to get notes
out today on scattering,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.990
and some of these
things as well.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.470
So in classical mechanics--

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:29.460
classical mechanics-- identical
particles are distinguishable.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.990
And that's the main thing.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.530
How are they distinguishable?

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:46.940
Well, you have two
particles, and I can follow--

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.330
whenever they're moving, I can
say, OK, this is particle 1.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.470
This is particle 2.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.800
With quantum mechanics,
you can do the same thing

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.590
when they are really far
away-- those particles--

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.560
and they don't come
close together.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.160
There's some sense in which
classical mechanics sometimes

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.370
applies, and that's
when they're far away.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.800
Now, when the particles
in quantum mechanics

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.960
get close to each
other, then you

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.030
lose track which one is which.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.310
They occupy the same position.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.490
But in classical mechanics,
they are distinguishable,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:29.990
because you can follow
their trajectories, which

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.040
is very nice.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.600
You have an experiment.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.600
You follow the particle,
say, oh, this is particle 1.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.920
This is particle 2.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.000
They're here together.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.680
They're going around.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.080
And they split, you
follow the trajectories

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.550
from the beginning to the end.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.160
In quantum mechanics, there's no
such thing as the trajectories.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.500
There's these waves.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.200
The waves mix together.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.630
They do things, then
they separate out,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.660
and you just can't
tell what they do.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.440
There's another technique that
we use in classical physics

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.360
that it's probably
also relevant.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.960
We can tag the particles.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.560
That means, if you're doing an
experiment with billiard balls

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.890
colliding, you could
take a little marker

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:25.290
and put a red dot on one
of them and a black dot

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.550
on the other one,
and that tagging

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.710
doesn't affect the collisions.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.590
And you can tell, at the
end, where is the red ball,

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.140
and which is the black ball.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.760
We do the same with
quantum mechanics.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.090
There's no way anyone
has figured out

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:48.250
the tagging a particle
without changing drastically

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.370
the way interactions happen.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.640
So it's a nice option
in classical physics,

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.390
but doesn't work in
quantum mechanics.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:05.620
Even in classical physics, we
have something that survives.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.750
If you have a Hamiltonian
for identical particles--

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:21.810
R2, P2-- that Hamiltonian is
symmetric under the exchange.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.480
Whatever the
formula is, it's not

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.850
changed if you put
r2, p2 and r1, p1.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.760
It's a symmetric thing.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.790
The Hamiltonians
have that symmetry,

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:47.310
and there's no way to do this.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.960
So let's get to the bottom--

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.780
the real problem with
identical particles

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.220
with quantum mechanics.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.230
We cannot tag them.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.500
Once these particles
get together,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.630
you don't know what they did.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.910
You do an experiment
of scattering

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.850
in the classical
mechanics, and you

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:16.000
put two particles coming
in, two detectors,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.110
and you tag the particles
and you see what they do.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.240
You do it in quantum
mechanics, and you

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.220
don't know if particle 1 did
that and particle 2 did this,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.780
or if particle 1 did that
and particle 2 did that.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.590
It's just not possible to tell.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.940
They're very different.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.690
So how do we deal with this?

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.570
Well, that's the subject
of what we're going to do,

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:53.350
but let's just conclude
today by stating the problem.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:57.180
So the problem is that when we
had distinguishable particles

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.300
in quantum mechanics, we used
that tensor product to describe

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.910
a state.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:10.260
So for distinguishable
particles, this thing which

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:19.220
all particles, say, 1 up to n,
we would use the tensor product

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:25.200
and write PSI i1 for
the particle one,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:34.930
PSI i2 for the particle two,
PSI in for the particle n.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:39.270
And this says particle one
is in the state PSI i1,

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:44.140
particle two is in the
state PSI i2, PSI in.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.730
And these states are one of
many states, for example.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.490
That's all good.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.250
And this is for
distinguishable particles.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.790
And that's all correct.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:06.870
Now, suppose you have two
electrons, one up and one down.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.550
If they are
indistinguishable, how

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.350
are we supposed to write the
state of the two electrons

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.390
or to spin one-half particles,
or maybe, in some cases,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.560
maybe some other particles.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:35.450
Am I supposed to write that the
first particle is in state up

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.510
and the second is in state down?

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.090
Or are I supposed to write
that the first particle is

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:46.960
in state down and the second
particle is in state up?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:56.920
How do I describe the state
with this one or with this one?

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.780
They look equally plausible.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:07.790
So if you were in charge of
inventing quantum mechanics,

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.140
one possibility that
it may occur to you

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:16.780
is that if the particles
are defined to be identical,

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:22.870
then those two states
should be identical.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:27.130
They should be
indistinguishable, identical,

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.990
physically equivalent.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:36.740
And this might be a good
hypothesis to consider.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.420
Unfortunately,
that does not work.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.060
You say, why not?

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.780
It seems so logical.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.240
I cannot tell the difference
between these two.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.950
Can I say that
they're equivalent?

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.080
Well, no.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:16:00.520
If they would be equivalent,
you could form a state PSI alpha

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:08.980
beta, which is alpha
times the first plus

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:14.460
minus plus beta times
the second minus plus.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.830
And I'm not going to write all
the subscripts nor the tensors

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.500
sometimes.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:27.520
With alpha and beta having
this for normalization.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.410
That's a normalized state.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.410
Now, if all those
are equivalent,

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.710
if those two are
equivalent, all these

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.600
are equivalent for all
values in alpha and beta

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.490
because the superposition
of equivalence state

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.990
is an equivalent state.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.370
But then let's ask for what is
the probability that we find

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:53.380
the two particles
in the state PSI 0,

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.090
which is plus along
the x direction times

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.480
plus along the x direction.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.130
You know, whatever I do
whether this hypothesis there

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.540
that those two states are
equivalent is correct,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.800
a state that is plus
and plus can only

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.290
be described one
way-- plus plus.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.810
So I ask, what is
the probability

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.359
that this state PSI
alpha beta in the plus

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.690
along x and in the plus along x.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.400
Now, you'll remember those
pluses are states like plus,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:38.200
plus minus, 10 surplus
plus minus with a 1

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.160
over square root of 2.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.510
And that becomes this.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:50.240
So this is 1/2 of plus
plus plus plus minus,

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.330
plus minus plus
plus minus minus.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.510
That's the state.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:04.020
So what is the probability
that PSI alpha beta

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.025
is found in the state PSI 0?

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.890
It's this number.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:18.170
Now, if you do the inner
product of these two vectors,

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.890
only the mixes ones
go with each other.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:27.995
And this gives you 1/2 of
alpha plus beta squared.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.200
And 1/2 of alpha
plus beta squared

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.790
is the inner product
of these two states.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:40.550
And now you see that it depends
on the values of alpha and beta

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:47.960
because this is in fact 1/2 of
alpha squared plus beta squared

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.300
plus 2 real of alpha beta star.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.490
And since alpha and
beta are normalized,

00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:05.390
this is 1/2 plus real
of alpha beta star.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:10.700
So this hypothesis that these
two states are equivalent

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.080
would mean that these states are
equivalent for all alpha beta

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.980
that are normalized.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.690
And then you would have
that the probability

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.240
to be found in
PSI 0 would depend

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.310
on what the values of
alpha and beta you choose.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.460
So it's a contradiction.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.870
So we cannot solve the problem
of the degeneracy of identical

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.010
particles by declaring that
all the states are the same.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.840
So we have to find a
different way to do it.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.610
And that's what we
will do next time.

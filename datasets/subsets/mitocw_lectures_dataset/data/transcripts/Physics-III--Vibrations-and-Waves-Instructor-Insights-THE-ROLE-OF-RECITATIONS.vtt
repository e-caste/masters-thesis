YEN-JIE LEE: So
during the semester,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.140
we have a few
recitation instructors.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.970
They help with the students
during the recitation section.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.020
So during those sections,
usually the instructor

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.800
will solve a similar problem,
like what is actually

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
covered during the lecture.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.409
And that gives the
students another chance

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.630
to look at more example
and to get familiar or get

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.540
used to the calculation which we
carried out for the first time

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.260
during the lecture.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.680
So also the recitation section--

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.040
during the recitation
section, the instructors

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.100
help the students.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.080
So they can actually ask more
questions during the recitation

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.540
sections, including
the questions

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.890
they have in the p-set or
any additional questions

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.560
they thought about
after the lecture.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.060
OK.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.900
So that they get
another chance to clear

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.870
some of the concepts
which they don't really

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.660
understand during the lecture.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.880
So we did not record
the recitation sections

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.070
during the Fall
semester in 2016.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.330
On the other hand, we included
problem-solving videos

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.630
from Professor Wit
Busza, which is

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.260
similar to what we do during
the recitation sections

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.470
from previous years, to go
with the lecture videos done

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.408
during the semester.

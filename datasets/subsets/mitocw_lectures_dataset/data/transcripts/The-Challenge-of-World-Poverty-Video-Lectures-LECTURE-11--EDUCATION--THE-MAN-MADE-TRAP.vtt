00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.800
PROFESSOR: So this is, as I
understand it, continuing the

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.110
conversation you've already
started on education.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.170
And this is sort of the last
of the education lectures.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.240
So what I propose to do today is
to just kind of try to tell

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.750
a story, a single story
that kind of fits some

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.390
of the facts together.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.240
You've seen some of the broad
patterns of dysfunctionality

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.420
already, as well as some
of the local success

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.600
stories, if you like.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.680
I think the last lecture was
about this NGO [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.050
and its many efforts to
improve education.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.720
So what I'm going to do today
is continue from there, but

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.610
talk a little bit more
sort of big picture,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.420
focusing mostly on--

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.250
the goal is to tie things
together into a story that

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.790
might make some sense, and help
us think forward about,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.090
if this is what's going on,
where should we act?

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.270
That's always the ultimate
question we have in mind,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.360
which is to try to find a way to
an action point or a lever.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.720
And it's only by wrapping in
these facts into a narrative

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.700
that we can find a lever.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.040
So what I want to do is
I want to go from

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.479
the fact to a lever.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.930
And the way we will go there is
by talking about a specific

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.370
interpretation of the facts.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.050
So that's what I want to do.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.090
And I'm hoping that you already
read some of this

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.210
material and are sufficiently
engaged with it, that we'll

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.920
have a lot of discussion along
the way about, is this a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.550
reasonable interpretation
of the facts or not?

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.340
And I'm very much open to the
idea that you may think that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.260
this is not the right
interpretation.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.040
And we can definitely, you
should feel free to propose

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.930
alternatives or whatever
you think.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.760
You think I'm going too fast,
or trying to push the logic

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.270
too far, you should stop me,
or if you have questions.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:18.240
So I think that the first fact,
which is I think very,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.890
very widely accepted but somehow
not necessarily very

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.220
widely documented, is that
education is actually

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.050
beneficial for the people
who get it.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.270
And you would that this is
something that we would have

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.880
seen tons and tons of reliable
evidence on.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.580
But in fact, the reliable
evidence, even on this very

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.860
basic question, is
relatively weak.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.990
The reason why education
evidence tends to be weak is

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:57.510
that, as you know, education's
not like taking a medicine.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.830
The nice thing about
taking medicine is

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.450
that I take a medicine.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.730
A week later, I'm better.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.320
Education is something that
has action at a distance.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.370
It's like something that I get
educated today and tomorrow

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.530
and day after, the
day after that.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.700
And then distant future, I get
a job, and that's where it

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.589
benefits me.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:28.210
So that sort remoteness of it is
actually part of the reason

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.850
why it's hard to find good
evidence for education.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.290
You need to have a data set
where you saw who got educated

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.540
today, and what happened
to their

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.530
salaries' 20 years later.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.460
And that's not always easy to
find, for obvious reasons.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.680
You might imagine that
you do need to track

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.640
people in some way.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.930
So that's why there's
not much evidence.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.690
The evidence that there is, a
significant part of it comes

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.870
from countries like
the US, where the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.200
evidence is very clear.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.810
Education seems to have a clear
and relatively high,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.640
stable rate of return.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.360
Hasn't changed very
much over time.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.630
And a few studies like the one
from Indonesia which also find

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.820
the same thing, and actually
find, surprisingly, relatively

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.000
similar rates of return
on education.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.530
The benefits of education in
Indonesia seem to be similar

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.750
to that in the US.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.870
And that's something that, when
it came out, was rather

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.260
surprising to people.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.890
Why would it be surprising?

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.140
What would you have expected?

00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:44.098
AUDIENCE: I don't know, that
education here might be better

00:05:44.098 --> 00:05:44.600
or something.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.400
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.700
So you could imagine
that it would be--

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.210
education in the US has higher
quality, so maybe the returns

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.150
would be higher in the US.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.903
Anybody want to suggest a
reason for the opposite?

00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:04.330
AUDIENCE: Education in the
US is more expensive.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.450
PROFESSOR: That's an
excellent point.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.390
But primary education is what
we're talking about right now.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.835
So that's not very
expensive, right?

00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:15.360
It's mostly free.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.264
AUDIENCE: If everyone in the
US has an education,

00:06:18.264 --> 00:06:19.514
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:24.080
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.780
The opposite view is
that education

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.640
is scarce in Indonesia.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.270
And especially in the early
'70s, very few people had

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.440
primary education.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.760
So you might imagine that
something that's scarce

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.465
typically has a higher price.

00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:44.750
So you might imagine that it
would be more rewarding.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.210
So you could imagine it
going either way.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.390
Turns out, these two effects
seem to have cancelled out.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.470
And you get on net, roughly the
same rate on education in

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.310
the US as you get
in Indonesia.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.820
But that's all to say that we
seem to think that there is--

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.440
it's not that there's a huge
amount of evidence.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.460
But what there is seems pretty
consistent and compelling.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.990
So I think most people accept
the idea that there is a

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.240
benefit from education.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:31.420
And then the next question that
then arises is if there's

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.500
a benefit from education,
why are people

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.425
getting such lousy quality?

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.320
Why isn't it the case that
education systems kind of

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.570
stand up and deliver?

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.580
If education's valuable, why
isn't there a system that

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.730
supplies it?

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.500
Why is it that you have all
these schools where kids are

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.930
going and learning nothing?

00:08:06.996 --> 00:08:10.275
AUDIENCE: Unlike other
investments, one is it's not

00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:12.375
made by the primary
beneficiary.

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:15.265
I mean, parents that
fundamentally pay for the

00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:17.680
investment or the government's
a case maybe.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.502
And the parents paid the
lost wages that that

00:08:20.502 --> 00:08:21.954
child could be earning.

00:08:21.954 --> 00:08:24.540
The other thing that, unlike
other investments, is the

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.940
returns, like we talked about
earlier, are very long-term.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.880
PROFESSOR: So you're saying that
one reason why education

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.429
might be different is the
connection between the cost

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.770
you're paying and the returns
you're getting is weak.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.740
So maybe the government,
I don't really

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.550
think about the returns.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.000
The government wants me to send
my children to school.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.820
So I send them.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.450
But I don't really
think about it.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.090
So I don't think of
all the returns.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.070
I don't make the investments
in it.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.918
I don't really care about it.

00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:04.250
It's just something the
government wants me to do.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.920
And therefore, I don't
get benefits.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.770
So I'm going to try to suggest
evidence that that's not

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.440
what's going on.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.760
But that's exactly right.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.420
One very plausible hypothesis is
that this is something that

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.600
people really, they're
not buying education

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.940
like they buy machines.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.170
They're getting education
from the government

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.460
as a kind of gift.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.180
And therefore, they don't
care about it.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.840
So that's one kind
of explanation.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.200
But that's exactly right.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.310
That's one possibility.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.920
Let's keep going a bit,
and we'll come--

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.170
go ahead.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.200
AUDIENCE: Well, one of the
things that was written was

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.895
that they have this mistaken
impression that the first few

00:09:48.895 --> 00:09:52.570
years of schooling have very low
returns and that secondary

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.265
education or university
education is where you

00:09:55.265 --> 00:09:57.470
actually get a meaningful
increase.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.900
So it gives the most incentive
to care about effective

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.600
education [INAUDIBLE] it's
someone they're planning on

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.335
funding later on.

00:10:04.335 --> 00:10:05.305
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:09.280
And an alternative view, which
we'll come back to and spend

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.830
some time on, is that people
actually don't--

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.070
it's not that people don't
believe education's valuable.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.110
They don't know which part
of education is valuable.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.570
And that's sort of what
you're suggesting.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.040
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.225
So we just talked about how,
in Indonesia, we saw there

00:10:27.225 --> 00:10:28.940
were benefits to education.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.920
And now we're talking about the

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.390
education being poor quality.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.032
So is the idea that even this
poor quality education is

00:10:34.032 --> 00:10:38.335
still incurring benefits that
people aren't realizing, that

00:10:38.335 --> 00:10:39.940
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.910
PROFESSOR: So I think that goes
back to the conversation

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.540
we had a little while ago, which
is that we would imagine

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.520
that in Indonesia, education
would be a lot more valuable

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.360
than in the US.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.020
Because there's so
much less of it.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.220
And you would think that when
I'm the first primary educated

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.470
person in the village, that's
much more valuable than being

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.820
the 2,000th.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.740
Never the less, we don't find
high returns in Indonesia.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.650
We find comparable to the US.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.790
So the idea is, implicitly, that
the returns to education

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.830
are lower in Indonesia partly
because the quality is--

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.240
actually somebody suggested
exactly that, which is that

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.930
one reason why you might
expect lower returns in

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.420
Indonesia is that the
quality is lower.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.420
And so I think the concern is

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.130
education is socially valuable.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:41.070
We want it because there's
not many educated people.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.830
On the other hand, maybe the
delivery systems are weak.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.960
And therefore, it's not
worth getting it.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.850
So that's a trade off.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.500
And the question, if you look at
the other evidence, you've

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.760
already looked at it, it seems
like it's hard to imagine

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.470
somebody who's in fifth grade
and can't really read having

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.240
got much benefit
from education.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.960
So our presumption is that at
least a significant proportion

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.420
of the people who are getting
to fifth grade without being

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.250
able to read are not getting
anything out of education.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.630
They're just going through
the motions.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.870
So why is it that there are so
many people who are going

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.050
through the motions rather than
saying look, why am I

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.370
wasting my time with this
education thing, unless it's

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.970
worth something to me?

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.670
That's sort of the question.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:34.440
And a corollary to that question
comes from the fact

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.040
that, in fact, the Pratham
experience suggests, is it's

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.800
not even that hard to
improve quality.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.500
It may well be that you could
imagine that it's just

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.630
impossible to improve quality,
because kids are very

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.140
difficult to teach.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.660
But in fact, kids are not
difficult to teach.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.080
The whole Pratham experience is
that whenever you have an

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.740
intervention which sort of
provides them with some little

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.180
bit of extra help and some
focused help on what they

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.670
need, the kids improve fast.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.340
So that makes it even
more positing.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.200
Because at some level, it's
easy to improve them.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.060
The kids' education, if you've
got a high quality education,

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.570
that has value.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.150
So what's going on?

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.310
Where's the pipeline broken?

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.428
Yeah.

00:13:19.428 --> 00:13:21.923
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] education
focused on all

00:13:21.923 --> 00:13:26.414
levels of students,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:32.152
So it's not geared to
the basic needs that

00:13:32.152 --> 00:13:33.899
each student needs?

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:35.057
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:37.550
I think that that is part--

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.860
we're going to come and try to,
in a sense, develop that

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.830
hypothesis and look at how that
can help us explain a

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.200
whole bunch of different
things.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.540
So that's exactly the kind of
hypothesis that we'll come to.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.510
And it's good that we already
start hinting at it.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:02.430
But I just want to first frame
the question quite sharply.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.890
This seems like education is
something that, prima facie,

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.670
is valuable.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.170
And it's not hard to deliver.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.870
Those two things are
what you've seen.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.180
You've seen that it
seems valuable.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.240
It seems very low quality.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.300
So many of you aren't getting
anything out of it.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.130
And it's easy to make
sure that they get

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:20.990
something out of it.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.110
Those three facts, how are
they sitting together?

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.720
That's the question.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.510
You would think that one of
these facts has to give.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.240
That's the puzzle.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.220
Why is it that this thing that's
easy to improve is not

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.500
being improved, even though
improvements will generate

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.750
large gains.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:46.060
Yeah.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.935
AUDIENCE: Maybe it's easy to
improve on a small scale, but

00:14:48.935 --> 00:14:50.200
not so much on a large
and consistent scale.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.410
PROFESSOR: That's another
possibility.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.400
Now, part of the reason we
emphasize some of the Pratham

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.330
experience was that large
is a relative word.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.760
But Pratham operates
on a fairly--

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:12.310
like a state in India is often
larger than any five countries

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.360
you would randomly name
in the world.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.120
So it's not small in any
obvious scale of small.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.620
That's why we were
emphasizing it.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.600
So if you take five countries
at random, the sum of the

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.170
states, the way they work, would
be smaller than this.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.980
Because India has
so many people.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.470
OK.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:39.810
So this is sort of the story
that several of you have

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:49.120
already hinted at, which is a
story that parents have the

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.570
wrong view of which part of
an education is valuable.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.370
So starting point of
that is we call

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.340
it an illusory s-shape.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:05.020
So you know the idea of
an s-shape, right?

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:10.770
The idea of an s-shape is that
when you get a little bit of

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.380
education that has very
little value.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.500
And then as I get more and more
education, the value of

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.500
the education I'm getting
goes up for a while.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.240
And then at some point,
presumably, it flattens off.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.510
Once you've got your Ph.D.,
presumably a second Ph.D.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.550
isn't worth that much, at
least in income terms.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.820
So at some point, it's
going to flatten out.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.390
So the returns go kind of like
that, then like that,

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.270
and then like that.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.910
That's an s.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.670
Is that clear, why it's an s?

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.820
So that idea.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.300
One of the hypothesis that
I think we've been most

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:58.650
persuaded by is that parents
seem to believe that there is

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.090
a real jackpot if you
get to the end of

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.180
the education tunnel.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.560
So they think of education
as being this tunnel.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.810
Once you get into a tunnel,
there's nothing good happening

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:11.609
for a long time.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.315
When you come out of the tunnel,
those who manage to

00:17:14.315 --> 00:17:16.609
come out of the tunnel, which
means you get through the

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.859
whole school system and you
graduate from high school,

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.000
then you get a government
job automatically.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.020
That's how they describe it.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.510
70% of them think that if my
child could only get through

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.900
high school, he will actually
get a government job.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.980
In fact, the probability that
he would actually get a

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.730
government job is less
than half of that.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:41.510
So they seem to, at the
top end, they seem

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.060
to overvalue education.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.700
They think that if my child
could only get through this

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.600
whole tunnel, there's a
job waiting for him.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.110
But in fact, that's not true.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.340
There are not enough government
jobs around.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.840
So you don't get these
good jobs.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:05.550
On the other end, and this is
the fact that's much harder to

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.900
appreciate, you will find out
what the probability of

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.060
getting a government job
is relatively easily.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.160
But what's really hard to find
out is what are the benefits?

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.810
And especially if you are an
illiterate parent, what are

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:24.070
the benefits of getting three
years of education?

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:28.140
And if you think about it in
the US, the US actually,

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.890
nobody gets three years
of education.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.240
Therefore, we can't even tell
what the benefits are.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.030
But I think what is surprising,
but maybe not

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.680
surprising once you think about
it, is that the benefits

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.100
of people who get three years of
education's insubstantial.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.950
Why are they substantial?

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:52.930
There are a bunch of stuff that
it's hard to appreciate

00:18:52.930 --> 00:19:01.260
living from the perspective of
living in the US now, but are

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.270
not automatic.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.210
So for example, many people
don't find out about

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.740
government programs that are
available to help them.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.140
Why?

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:15.080
Because we don't read any
newspapers or flyers or when

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.780
the TV person say something,
they don't understand what is

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.670
being said.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.580
So even a minimal understanding
of just how the

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:27.280
system works actually gets
you large benefits.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.370
Or another example people often
give is that even if you

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.390
go from first grade to third
grade and you learn to read,

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.460
you can read the instructions
on your bag of fertilizer.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.540
And your bag of fertilizer
says, use one

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.950
teaspoon, no more.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.330
You know you're to use one
teaspoon, no more.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.870
And put one cup of
water with it.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.050
Just being able to read that has
a large benefit in a world

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.860
where people suddenly, lots of
evidence of people overusing

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.140
and underusing fertilizer.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.740
So just the fact they can read
the instructions on the packet

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.950
is very, very large,
has large benefits.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:08.170
So the reason why even getting
a third grade education has a

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.910
benefit is because there are
lots of things in the world,

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.255
lots of information that's
transmitted through reading,

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:15.150
for example.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.700
Like what the government program
is, how to properly

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.030
use fertilizer, what new
seeds have become

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.490
available for planting.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.790
And that might be in
the newspaper.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.680
Somebody might have
taken an ad.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.810
But you don't read the ad,
and you never find out.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.180
So there are lots of benefits
even if you can read a little.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.180
You don't have to be able to do
calculus to be able to get

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.380
benefits of education.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.140
I think that's the evidence.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.870
This picture that I'm going to
show you plots kind of actual

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:56.530
and perceived returns in
Madagascar to the extent that

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.540
they can be estimated.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.920
The actual returns are
pretty constant.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.960
The perceived returns come from
a survey where parents

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.000
were asked what the
returns were.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.360
And the perceived returns
look more concave.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.460
This is to say, they are more
flat in the beginning, lower

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.560
returns at the beginning.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.070
The beginning, you think
that you're not

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.750
going to get much returns.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.260
And then as you go
up, they get--

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.110
they cross, and you think you
are going to get more returns

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.460
than you actually get.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.530
PROFESSOR: What that is is
really the percentage increase

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:42.840
in your earnings for an extra
year of education.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.330
When you go to 11, to 12,
what's your percentage

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.580
increase in earnings?

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.830
So this in some sense
is actually not--

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.320
this picture sort of
gets the idea.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.880
But in fact, it doesn't
actually tell you how

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.410
big the effect is.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.740
The reason is that in fact,
there are some people who

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.460
generally overestimate the
benefits for education.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.850
So some parents think
education's

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.090
extraordinary valuable.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.870
And a lot of parents think that

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.650
education's completely useless.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.580
So this yellow curve is
an average of very

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.830
lows and very highs.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:30.150
So in some sense, the average
looks actually less wrong than

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.380
the individual parents think.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.460
So some parents are
overestimating their returns.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.330
They're all sending their
children to school.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.000
Others just think education's
worthless, at

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.890
least for their children.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.030
And their children is important
in that sentence,

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.290
because a lot of people think
education is something that

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.150
benefits those other children.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.610
People from rich families can
benefit from education.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.580
Our children don't benefit.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:23:00.810
So there's clearly a strong kind
of self-discrimination,

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.460
which we'll come back
to in a bit.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:09.256
So that average actually masks
a lot of divergence.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:23.850
So what I want to do now is I'm
going to take this as a

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:28.010
hypothesis, the fact that this
what I would call elite bias,

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.200
the idea that people think
it's an s shape.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.890
Returns are at the high end,
no returns at the low end.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.320
Assume that that's true.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.540
And look at how that can
help us explain a

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.790
bunch of other facts.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:52.060
So we're going to look at what
this does for the parents, the

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.310
teachers, the students.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.180
You see where we're going?

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.480
We're going to make
a hypothesis.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.670
We've made the hypothesis.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.140
Now we're going to look at what
that hypothesis does.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.990
Particularly, you know a bunch
of facts, and we'll try to fit

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.710
together a bunch
of those facts.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.900
Then at the end, I'll tell you
some other facts that you

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.250
probably don't know, which
also kind of fit this

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.655
hypothesis.

00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:21.560
So it's sort of a way to
give it a bit more

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.000
power, if you like.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.290
Try it out on things.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:44.320
So one implication is think of
the first implication of this.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.450
Imagine that, I believe that you
get benefits only if you

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.850
get through high school.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.640
And you have three children.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.610
And you can't really afford to
put all three of them through

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:00.860
high school.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:10.000
So in truth, as we saw, the
returns are pretty constant.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.900
So an extra year is
an extra year.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.650
If it were the case that an
extra year, an extra year, how

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:18.900
should you spend the money?

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.690
Equally.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.530
Since all the children,
there's no reason to

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.370
discriminate.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.160
Why give one of them a chance
and not the others?

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.420
Any bias towards equity will
make you just spend equal

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.570
amounts over the children.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.050
Because they're all
your children.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.680
Why discriminate?

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.270
One year of education is
one year of education.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.820
So there's no reason
to discriminate.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.870
Now, imagine we believed
something else.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.680
We believe that the
first years of

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.390
education are worth much.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.410
But then the final years
are worth a lot.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.466
How would we spend our money?

00:26:01.466 --> 00:26:03.156
AUDIENCE: I'm assuming
you have two

00:26:03.156 --> 00:26:04.364
kids who are identical.

00:26:04.364 --> 00:26:07.262
You have [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:07.262 --> 00:26:07.745
between the two.

00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:09.677
And you believe that the latter
is the most important

00:26:09.677 --> 00:26:11.610
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.990
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.630
You think of it as being--

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.160
you guess which of
your children

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.450
will be good at education.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.370
And you're going to give all
your education to that child,

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.130
and give the other
one nothing.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.640
That's one implication of this
view, is that you're going to

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.610
discriminate among
your children.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:38.120
Now, the way you're going to
discriminate is probably, you

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.766
probably don't believe your
children are identical.

00:26:39.766 --> 00:26:43.030
So you're going to
look for signs.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.700
Maybe in first grade, one of the
children was doing better

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.880
than the other.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.860
It means nothing.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.520
Some children do well
in first grade.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.570
Some children do badly
in first grade.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.310
Many of you who are at MIT
were doing badly in first

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.080
grade, and then ended
up at MIT.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.480
I'm sure some people
were doing very

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.720
well in first grade.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.320
Didn't get to MIT.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.180
So it's a very poor predictor.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.840
Your first grade performance, a
very, very poor predictor of

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.920
your long term performance.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.280
It's a predictor, but not
particularly a reliable one.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.770
But parents, what do
they have to go on?

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.140
They're going to look at which
child is doing well in first

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.370
grade, and then put their
money on that one.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.650
So you wouldn't probably
pick one at random.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.960
But you pick one based on
some very noisy signal.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:39.280
You observe whether they come
back from first grade with,

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.450
they chewed up their pencils
in first grade

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.525
more or less or something.

00:27:42.525 --> 00:27:44.890
And you decide, well, this
one's fit for education.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.000
This one's not.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.470
And then you're going to
put your money on that.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.340
You're going to find some way
of, since you can't spend

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.530
equal amounts on both, you're
going to find some signal

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.970
that's going to allow
you to discriminate.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.220
Right?

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.470
That's what you'd expect.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:34.180
So actually, let me go back one
slide and just talk about

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.820
discrimination a little bit more
before we get to this.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:55.800
So this is something that
if you do field work in

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.890
developing countries, this
is something that

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:58.850
jumps out at you.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.540
And something that you spend--

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.470
like me, I've spent all my
adult life in the US.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.870
So I'm kind of used
to the US now.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.490
So you go to somebody's house.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.170
What's the chance you'll hear
a parent with two children,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:18.240
one sitting here, the other
standing there, and he looks

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.570
at the child who's sitting there
and says, oh, that one,

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:24.250
he's an idiot.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.810
He's not capable of
study, literally.

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.170
I don't mean metaphorically.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.000
I mean literally, that
one's an idiot.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.930
But this one, she's
really bright.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.510
And you hear that
all the time.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.370
It's something you'll never
hear in the US.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.230
You'll never hear parents
actually pointing to one of

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.440
their children and saying,
this one's an idiot.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.010
That comes very much out of this
theory that in a sense,

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.030
there are these, I have
the pick the winner.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.240
The pressure on the parents
is to pick the winner.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.300
Because if you don't pick the
winner, you wasted your money.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.480
So they're trying to
pick the winner.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.710
And in a sense, they are, in
fact, trying to persuade not

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:08.320
just themselves, but also the
siblings to go along with it.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.920
And you see that very much.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.960
I've also seen, which is even
more touching, is one child

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.830
saying, you ask him which
school you go to?

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.510
He says, oh, I go to
this school, but I

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.820
don't really go anymore.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.940
And I said, why?

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.795
And he says, well, I'm stupid.

00:30:23.795 --> 00:30:25.010
I can't do it.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.240
But you know, my brother over
there, he's really smart.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.570
He's going to the private
school, and

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:30.730
he's doing very well.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.160
And so everybody in the system
internalizes it.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.790
You see that very clear, every
word having internalized.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.250
And that's useful
for the family.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:44.690
Because the family doesn't want
to sustain a feeling of

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:45.600
inequality.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.550
So if all children believe that
there's only one child

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.550
who is smart among them, then
it's good for the family.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.200
The harmony in the
family remains.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.490
Because all the other children
are willing to not be

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.000
educated, because they
think they are

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.410
not fit to be educated.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.320
So everybody buys into
this idea that this

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.730
one child is bright.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.580
And you see that all the time.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:11.080
Just prima facie, you
see it all the time.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.570
We'll also talk about
evidence.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.630
But I also wanted to say that
that's the shape of it, is

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.060
often, you hear people pointing
to this child and

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.650
saying, that one is an idiot.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.090
And that's very striking.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:25.620
If you come to the US, you never
hear a parent say that.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.490
And I don't think it comes out
of the fact that these are

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.100
worse parents.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.390
They love their children.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.190
They'll do lots for
their children.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.970
But they really believe that
there is this sort of--

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.410
they need to be very good at
picking who's the winner.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.400
Because they need to justify
that to themselves.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.150
They need to justify that to
their other children, the fact

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:49.510
that they pick the
right winner.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.960
That's very important to them.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.130
And you see that very much.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.800
So two studies.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:04.500
One is in Burkina Faso, they
found that if conditional on

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:13.570
my cognitive score, in a simple
test score, if my

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.640
brother is doing well, I'm less
likely to be in school.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.250
So if my brother's doing well,
or my sister's doing well,

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:25.950
that hurts my chances of
getting investment.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.260
So that's exactly what
we're talking

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.940
about, picking winners.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:39.940
Second, in Colombia,
they were given a

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.590
conditional cash transfer.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.270
Conditional cash transfer is
like some money which you get

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.540
if you child is in school.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.670
And the way it had been
implemented is that some

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.870
children were eligible for it.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.170
So basically, when some children
were eligible for it,

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:03.570
parents decided, well, we'll
invest in this child.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:05.480
That picked the child
to invest in.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.136
That meant you stopped investing
in the other one.

00:33:08.136 --> 00:33:11.750
The other child actually were
less likely to go to school,

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:16.010
if your brother was
encouraged by the

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.670
government to go to school.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:24.310
So the government was actually
kind of focused on one child.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.320
And you were getting some money
from sending one of the

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.280
children to school.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.890
The other one was
then neglected.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.510
And so you see exactly this
pattern of parents trying--

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.267
yeah.

00:33:34.267 --> 00:33:37.249
AUDIENCE: How did they choose
the children to get the

00:33:37.249 --> 00:33:38.080
investment?

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.530
PROFESSOR: In this particular
case, I think it was based on

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.210
some age rule.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:46.090
I think only certain grades
were eligible,

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.380
if I remember right.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:54.080
So it was like seventh graders
can get it, but sixth graders

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.410
can't, or something.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:56.635
I think that was the rule.

00:33:56.635 --> 00:34:00.200
It was an age rule, age or
I think maybe a class.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.630
AUDIENCE: So they chose a class
at a particular level.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.546
And then they continued
that class throughout.

00:34:05.546 --> 00:34:05.910
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.845
I think that's right.

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:10.745
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:34:10.745 --> 00:34:12.218
Well, I have two questions.

00:34:12.218 --> 00:34:16.146
Does this pattern stay the
same if school is free?

00:34:16.146 --> 00:34:18.110
If it's still one child
that goes to school?

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.056
And also, if it's conditional
cash transfer, wouldn't that

00:34:21.056 --> 00:34:22.529
increase the income
to the family?

00:34:22.529 --> 00:34:24.770
So they would have more
resources to spread around?

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:25.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.865
So both are excellent
questions.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:35.310
I think yes, it's still
true where it's free.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:38.460
Because one of the ways you
discriminate is by sending

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.500
your bright child to
private school.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.810
You actually spend resources to
send him to private school.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.510
Or you get him a tutor.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.030
He gets special help.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.110
Or he doesn't have to
do the housework.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.060
He gets time to do his homework
in the evening, while

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:59.240
all the other children are
like tying up the goat or

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.930
whatever, giving food to
the cow, or whatever

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:02.790
else they are doing.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.480
He's the one who gets
to do the homework.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.160
So that's one sense in which
you still have lots of

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.410
discrimination.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:21.596
And to answer your other
question, it's true that I

00:35:21.596 --> 00:35:23.810
think that discrimination,
again, that's related.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:27.170
The answer I just gave is also
relevant for that, which is

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.550
that part of the way to
operate is not just

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:35.990
discrimination in money spent,
it's also in time.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:40.360
It's also in this, whose job
is to tie up the cow?

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.500
Whose job is to take care
of the younger siblings?

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.680
All of those get allocated
unequally.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.670
So the child who gets to go to
private school typically is

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.680
also the one who doesn't
take care of the cow.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.090
So you get loaded on
benefits from that.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.890
Does that answer
your question?

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.310
OK.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:40.240
So another implication of this
is that, this is a related

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:48.190
point, which is that parents
will often--

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:53.160
another implication of this is
that if people associate

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:59.590
education with particular forms
of getting a particular

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:04.740
job, then when there are more of
those jobs, they might now

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.000
start discriminating more
against the children.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.810
Why?

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:12.810
Because now there is a valuable
opportunity available

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.500
for my daughter.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.050
She can get this kind of job if
she only gets this degree.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:24.920
And I'm going to now try to,
therefore, find resources to

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.600
make sure my daughter
can get that degree.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.130
That might mean that I'm going
to give up on my son entirely.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.350
So discrimination.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:38.540
Another related consequence of
this is that when a particular

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:50.700
job appears which has high
returns, which you perceive

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.960
generates high returns for
education, you would target

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.880
money towards getting
that job.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.190
And that would increase
this tendency toward

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.980
discrimination.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:12.000
So there's an experiment in
India, a very nice experiment.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.110
What this guy did is
there are all these

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.240
call centers in India.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.760
You must have dealt with one.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.740
If you've ever had to call
United Airlines, for example.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.950
One of the things I love about
this is once they hear my

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:35.000
name, their accent
quickly changes.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.710
And they stop trying to fake
an American accent.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.770
They figure that I don't
care so much.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:50.400
But so these call centers are
in this part of North India

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.740
where this is actually
huge discrimination

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.070
against girls, otherwise.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:39:00.080
But what he did in this
experiment is he went to these

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.500
villages near the call center
and said, well, there's a call

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.400
center right there.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.800
And if your daughter graduates
high school, she

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.410
can get a job there.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:10.420
So that was the experiment.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.870
And he went and told--

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:16.630
and you immediately find parents
suddenly starting to

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.690
discriminate against
their sons.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:24.620
They start to figure out,
my daughter can

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.140
get this good job.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.630
Now I should just put all the
money in her education.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.670
And what happens to my son
doesn't matter anymore.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:35.930
So you get this pattern of once
parents decide that there

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:40.410
is a jackpot to be had, it's
very easy to get into these

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:41.500
patterns of massive

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.110
discrimination within the family.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:00.830
So in particular, girls'
education went up?

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:00.990
Why?

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.870
Because call centers
like girls.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:07.930
Apparently, the view is, may
or may not be true, is that

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:12.360
girls are easier to train to
be call center employees.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.090
They're more docile,
more, I don't know.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.610
They learn English faster.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.700
There are all kinds
of theories.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.400
But in any case, call centers
like girls, for some

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.880
unspecified reason.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.950
So they found out that there
was a big demand for girls.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:34.570
The result was that you get
this effect on boys.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.670
On net, boys were
not affected.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:42.360
But parents already, the
baseline had said, this son,

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.740
he's not really fit
for education.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.680
So those kids are really got
hurt when this happened.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.700
Because all of those kids who
the parents had decided were

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.300
not fit for education, their
education actually dropped

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.690
when their sisters started
getting these jobs.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:06.570
You started substituting away
from their education towards

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:10.240
less education for them.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:15.200
So this is all to say that
parents are actually using all

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.960
these cues to figure out which
child to put the money on.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.290
Because they believe that if I
put money on one child, I'll

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:26.340
get much bigger benefits than
sharing it across children.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:31.130
And then all these cues
seem to matter.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:35.600
OK, let's go back to
a different fact.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.630
Another thing that of
course matters is

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.290
information in this world.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:47.270
For parents, what matters is
their perceived returns.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:48.480
That's what we're talking.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.540
We're talking about
perceived returns.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.910
We're talking about the fact
that parents think their

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:56.890
returns are higher when you get
12th grade education, and

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:01.850
low if you get less than 12th
grade education, et cetera.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:07.650
So Madagascar, parents were
shown this particular picture.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.280
This picture's kind of
a way to capture

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.530
the returns to education.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.250
So without any degree, you
get three kg of grain.

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:31.705
If you get a few more
years, you get four.

00:42:31.705 --> 00:42:35.810
If you get more, you get
seven, et cetera.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.970
So this was roughly
the right scaling.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:43.280
So this is roughly how the
returns are in Madagascar.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.130
AUDIENCE: Is it [INAUDIBLE]
the political [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:47.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.760
So that's the range.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.030
For females, it goes
from 34 to 163.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:01.610
For men, from 47 to 225.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:06.230
So this was what they
were shown.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:10.350
When they were shown this,
turned out-- so actually,

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.660
before they did that, they
actually asked parents, what

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.790
do you think are the returns
to education?

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.610
Before they showed them, they
actually asked them, if your

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.550
child got an education,
how much would his

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:26.570
income go up by?

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.710
So they had written that down.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.090
Then they showed them
this picture.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:36.100
And what's nice is that the
parents who already thought

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.840
that children were going to
get high returns, their

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.430
behavior didn't change
very much.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.250
Whose behavior has changed?

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.980
The parents who thought that the
returns for the children

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.590
were much lower than
they really are.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:57.020
And about 50% of the parents
had very low returns.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.310
And for those parents,
you get a very

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:04.140
substantial improvement in--

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.683
no, that's not it.

00:44:05.683 --> 00:44:06.950
I don't know where--

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.930
OK.

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:19.530
So it was a very substantial
improvement in the children's

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:23.800
school attendance, to the point
where every intervention

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:29.000
we have studied, the cheapest
way to improve school

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.410
attendance that we found,
ever, is this one.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:35.640
This really is an
extraordinarily cheap

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:35.925
intervention.

00:44:35.925 --> 00:44:39.260
It doesn't cost much money to
tell people the returns on

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.230
education are higher
than you think.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:47.360
If you can do it in a credible
way, that improves education

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.290
very cheaply.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.880
And it has a substantial
effect.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.500
This turns out to be the
cheapest single thing that

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.870
Poverty Action's lab researchers
found for

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:58.090
improving education.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:00.680
Obviously, it doesn't
do everything.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.230
You can't go very
far with this.

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:06.130
Because it's not going
to distill all

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:06.990
kinds of other things.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.000
If the education system's
broken, then people are not

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.110
going to learn anything from
the school, et cetera.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:16.000
But to get them into school,
this is a very, very

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.030
cheap way to do it.

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:19.740
So there's lots of parents who
are clearly discriminating

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.410
against their children and not
sending them to school because

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.150
they think their children
are not going to get

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.670
anything out of it.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:27.050
Why do they think that?

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:28.860
Well, they think that their
children are never going to

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:33.730
make it through the 12th grade,
or whatever it takes to

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.960
get real money from education.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.480
So they'll already assume that,
my child is never going

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.940
to make it 12th grade.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.255
Since he's never going
to make it to 12th

00:45:42.255 --> 00:45:43.750
grade, what's the point?

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.030
And therefore, they don't
send children to school.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.980
You persuade them that even if
you went from third grade to

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:52.610
fifth grade you get extra
returns, then they start

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.290
sending children to school.

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:57.310
So the returns to primary
education for many, many

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.870
parents are massively
underestimated.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:00.670
Yeah.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.782
AUDIENCE: I have a
quick question.

00:46:02.782 --> 00:46:06.750
Is it distributed evenly across
the incoming classes?

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:09.726
So for example, you were trying
to say education was

00:46:09.726 --> 00:46:10.718
for people who are
very wealthy.

00:46:10.718 --> 00:46:14.355
It could be 120% returns to
people-- it's education to

00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:19.808
people who are lower class to
be 0.5%, in which case, that

00:46:19.808 --> 00:46:22.218
progression will be tilted
towards the high end.

00:46:22.218 --> 00:46:23.190
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.800
So people have looked at that.

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:32.810
Typically, it's difficult
to look at.

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:37.050
Because you could imagine that
very few people who are

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:40.280
wealthy families stop
at third grade.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.990
But to the extent that you can
look at it, you don't see big

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.240
differences.

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.350
There's some differences, but
not of the order of magnitude

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:52.126
you're suggesting.

00:46:52.126 --> 00:46:53.851
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if anyone has

00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:56.070
looked at the peer effects.

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:57.056
Like you have a village.

00:46:57.056 --> 00:46:59.028
And there's several families.

00:46:59.028 --> 00:47:00.260
And some of them are sending
their kids to school, and

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.986
others aren't.

00:47:01.986 --> 00:47:05.190
Are there any effects that just
one family sees how the

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.409
other kids, look, they're
going to school.

00:47:07.409 --> 00:47:07.902
And they seem to be learning.

00:47:07.902 --> 00:47:09.381
And they seem to be
accomplishing something.

00:47:09.381 --> 00:47:11.860
Do they feel like they're
just wasting their time?

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.490
Their parents always complain
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:18.370
Are there any effects
between families?

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:19.200
PROFESSOR: Probably.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.110
Nobody's looked.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:21.340
I mean, people look at this.

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:25.420
But the problem is that when
you study peer effects, the

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.480
first problem is that typically,
your peers are not

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.090
randomly chosen.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:34.620
So you hang out with families
that are like yours.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:39.640
So therefore, the peer effects
tend to be over estimated.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.630
What looked like peer effects
could be just the effect of,

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.570
who do you hang out with?

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:54.840
So there's lots of evidence of
peer effects, but not so much

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.820
at this level.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:59.330
Because it's hard to randomly
assign peers.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:02.080
The one place where you can
randomly assign peers turns

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.280
out to be in college.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.860
So there is a nice set of
studies, like of Dartmouth,

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.910
for example.

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:11.450
In Dartmouth, there's
a college lottery.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:14.280
And you get different roommates

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.700
based on your lottery.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:19.410
So if you get roommates who are
more inclined to study,

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.090
you're more inclined to study.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:23.480
You get roommates who are more
inclined to drink, you are

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.990
more inclined to drink.

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.520
There seems to be clear
evidence of some

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.730
kinds of peer effects.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:35.070
But it's hard to find because
of this reason.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.160
If you look at the data,
it looks like

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.200
there's huge peer effects.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.850
If you look in the US, and you
look around Boston, you'll

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:45.850
find that in Somerville, people
who live in Somerville

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:49.790
seem to live with other
people who don't

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:50.675
get much of an education.

00:48:50.675 --> 00:48:54.080
And people that live in
Lexington live with other

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.580
people that get a lot
of education.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.390
That's not because of
large peer effects.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.940
It's because people who want
to get a lot of education,

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.375
good education, go to
live in Lexington.

00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:06.680
Or other characteristics of
people who live in Lexington,

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.540
rich people live in Lexington.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.730
It's not because of peer.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:11.480
So peer effects are
hard to detect.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.590
But I think that where people
have tried to look at it, like

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:17.460
with this Dartmouth lotteries
and stuff, they find it.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:22.973
But it's hard to detect for the
reason we just discussed.

00:49:22.973 --> 00:49:24.223
OK.

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:34.920
So now what I want to do is
switch to the teachers.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:42.390
So we talked about the effect
of this on the parents.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:44.150
The parents do two things.

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:47.880
One is that they don't invest
in most of their children.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.330
I'll come back to the parents,
actually, later.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:54.520
And the second is that
they discriminate.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.470
Let's go to the teachers.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:59.730
Same hypothesis.

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:02.360
Teachers also believe, and
maybe teachers don't

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.760
intrinsically have to believe
this, if parents believe that

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:09.570
the only goal of the school is
to get their children to 12th

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:13.180
grade or whatever to get through
school, then teachers

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.470
will have the same incentives.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:17.270
So the teachers will believe
what the parents believe.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:21.320
Because it doesn't matter
what the truth is.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.970
I'm going to get paid if
the parents like me.

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:27.420
And the parents like
me if I have the

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.490
belief that they have.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:33.480
So it's not clear that the
teachers even need to have the

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.620
wrong beliefs.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:38.550
But I suspect parents,
teachers do

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:40.170
have the wrong belief.

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:42.228
I'll tell you why
in a little bit.

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:51.630
So first thing that that implies
is that teachers will

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:52.880
teach to the top of the class.

00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:01.860
If you believe that the goal of
this whole thing is to get

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:05.300
children to complete 12th grade,
and in addition, you

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:09.100
believe that you live in a
country where most people

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.640
don't complete 12th grade,
then you're going to say,

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.430
well, most people are
not capable of

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.470
completing 12th grade.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:18.850
Because in fact, that's
what you see.

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:20.860
Only 20% complete 12th grade.

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.750
In Madagascar, maybe 10%
complete 12th grade.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.940
And you see that, you say that
most people are not going to

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.180
complete 12th grade.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:31.410
So therefore, doesn't make any
sense to try to get the bottom

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:33.880
of the class to--

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:37.650
if I believe A, that completing
12th grade is the

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:43.420
only thing that I care about,
and B, that only a small

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.880
fraction of these kids are
capable of reaching 12th

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:49.770
grade, I think both of which
are probably false, but

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.760
imagine I believe those
two things.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.010
How should I teach?

00:51:56.139 --> 00:51:59.000
I'll teach to the top
of the class.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.790
Because those are the
only people who are

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:01.810
going to make it.

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:05.670
So I might as well concentrate
my resources on that, and

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:06.610
forget about the rest.

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:08.770
The rest are here
as passengers.

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:09.430
They're going to come.

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:10.640
They're going to listen.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.590
They won't get anything.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:12.340
They'll leave.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.270
I don't really care, because
that's not the goal.

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:26.300
And in particular, there's
a nice instance of this.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:31.760
I'll talk about an experiment
in a little bit where the

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.450
school got an extra teacher,
let's say for eighth grade, or

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:36.430
fourth grade.

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:39.110
And in fourth grade, this
class was split up.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:44.020
And half the class was given
to the extra teacher.

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.750
And half the class was given
to the original teacher.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:54.690
In some of the schools, it was
done so that the better

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.430
performing children went to
one teacher, and the worst

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:00.590
performing children go
to the other teacher.

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:02.040
This was done by lottery.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.130
So there was a lottery.

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:06.320
And one teacher got one, and
the other got the other.

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.020
The teacher who got the
bottom half of the

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.540
class was really upset.

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:17.590
Because they really believe
this is pointless.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:21.510
They thought that this was just,
why am I teaching the

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:22.600
bottom half of the class?

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.300
There's no point in
teaching them.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.370
Because they, too, believe that
the bottom of the class

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.210
can't learn.

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:32.485
Because their whole goal is not
to get them from fourth

00:53:32.485 --> 00:53:36.290
grade to fifth grade, but to get
them from fourth grade to

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.710
12th grade.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.710
So the goal of teaching, it's
pointless to teach people at

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:40.920
the bottom of the class.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.140
Because people at the bottom
of the class can't learn.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.170
So once you believe that people
at the bottom of the

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:51.525
class can't learn, then you
focus your effort at the top

00:53:51.525 --> 00:53:54.350
of the class.

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:58.770
Now as you can imagine, what is
the consequence of that on

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.020
the students?

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:11.594
What would that do to students
at the bottom of the class?

00:54:11.594 --> 00:54:13.518
AUDIENCE: Well, they were
probably discouraged.

00:54:13.518 --> 00:54:18.328
They'd feel more discouraging if
the teacher is actively or

00:54:18.328 --> 00:54:21.230
subconsciously [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:22.016
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:54:22.016 --> 00:54:24.310
Is that what you were
going to say?

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:24.800
Yeah.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.560
So they're going to
get discouraged.

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.302
Now what happens when they
get discouraged?

00:54:29.302 --> 00:54:30.640
AUDIENCE: Poor performance.

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.610
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:33.293
AUDIENCE: I said poor
performance.

00:54:33.293 --> 00:54:35.100
PROFESSOR: They perform
poorly.

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.706
What does the teacher think?

00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:37.192
AUDIENCE: Stupid.

00:54:37.192 --> 00:54:39.136
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
they're stupid.

00:54:39.136 --> 00:54:42.060
So it's a vicious cycle.

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.160
Because once I believe the start
from this theory, that

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.420
the bottom of the class
can't perform, then I

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:48.730
give them no attention.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:50.100
They're all discouraged.

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.390
They're not trying.

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:53.740
They're doing badly.

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.330
I think they're stupid.

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:58.180
Then I feel like, you know, I
was right in focusing on the

00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.190
top of the class.

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:04.665
So you get into this vicious
cycle of false beliefs.

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:22.900
The other thing that this would
mean is that teachers

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:26.430
also really--

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:29.560
so teachers also, in class, they
will look for the kids

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:34.650
who can get to their view of
whatever the goal is, getting

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:36.090
through high school.

00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:39.320
And if there are a few kids like
that in high school in

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:43.900
this class, they're going to
stop putting in effort.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.480
You also expect why teachers
would not put in a lot of

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.310
effort, because they'll think,
look, I got stuck with a bunch

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:54.200
of dodos who can't learn.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.550
What am I doing here?

00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:00.580
So once teachers start believing
that children are

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:05.410
unequal, then you get this
phenomenon that lots of

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:06.660
teachers also give up.

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:18.150
So the Pratham experience is,
I think, illuminating here.

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:22.950
So one of the experiments you
must have talked about was the

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.720
summer school experiment.

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.160
The summer school was basically,
some villages

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.820
randomly got a summer school.

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:35.810
The teacher was given
some extra money to

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:37.250
run a summer school.

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:44.720
This is the same teacher who
teaches in school where the

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:48.950
schools are very
low performing.

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:52.950
Yet, when this teacher was given
a small amount of money

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:57.820
and was asked to run a six weeks
summer school after a

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:01.160
few days of training, that had
very large effects on the

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.580
children's learning.

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:05.700
The children who went to summer
school learned a lot.

00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:09.560
So why is it that this teacher
who can teach these children

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.440
quite effectively in summer
school, why doesn't he teach

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.380
them effectively during
the school year?

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:21.010
What's going on?

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:26.240
How can it be that the same
teacher, when he teaches

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.770
summer school, he gets
large gains.

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:38.290
But when he teaches regular
school, he does so badly?

00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:43.590
And one explanation is that in
summer school, his job is to

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:48.300
attend to the worst performing
children.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.490
In the regular school, his
perception is that his job is

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:55.600
to attend to the top
of the class.

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.150
So in the regular year.

00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:58.640
he's not teaching
these children.

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.740
He's teaching the top
of the class.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:04.140
When he's actually told, teach
these children, he actually

00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.575
can do it just fine.

00:58:05.575 --> 00:58:09.640
It's just that's not what the
system is telling him.

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.290
His view of what his job is is
that I have to get the top of

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:18.470
the class to learn the entire
curriculum, and be able to get

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:23.270
into whatever, into a better
high school or something.

00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:25.715
He doesn't see his goal
as teaching the

00:58:25.715 --> 00:58:26.610
bottom of the class.

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:29.630
When you actually ask him to
teach the bottom of the class,

00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:34.140
when that is his assigned
job, he does just fine.

00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.730
So that would also be consistent
with this view that

00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:39.470
the real problem is not that
the teachers don't have the

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:41.740
incentive to teach, or they
don't want to teach.

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.570
But they're being told to
teach the wrong thing.

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:49.610
They're trying to teach these
children something that

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:50.860
actually isn't.

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:55.450
So here's the experiment
I talked about.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:57.740
This is very much
on this point.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:04.180
I already talked about this
experiment, 120 schools were

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:07.680
cut into two, in 60 schools.

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.880
All schools were given
extra teachers.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:17.610
And then half of those schools,
the extra teacher was

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:22.170
assigned to, the class
was split at random.

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:25.510
So every class, they used
to have one teacher.

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:26.760
Now they have two teachers.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.310
Class was split at random.

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:36.230
So half the class went to one,
half went to the other.

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:38.410
In the other half of the
schools, they were

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:39.070
not split at random.

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:43.140
They were split by baseline
competency.

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:46.940
So the better performing
children

00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.990
were sent to one teacher.

00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:50.180
The worst performing
children were sent

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:56.550
to the other teacher.

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:58.060
The teacher assigned
was random.

00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.520
So you didn't get a better
teacher or a worst teacher,

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:06.330
but you got to be in
a classroom with

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:08.740
children like you.

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:11.480
What would our theory say about
what's going to happen?

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.490
If you have any of the
top, what would

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:16.030
happen in this setting?

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:19.763
AUDIENCE: In both situations,
you teach to the top.

01:00:19.763 --> 01:00:23.837
What it means for the teacher in
the randomly assigned room

01:00:23.837 --> 01:00:27.550
is that the people who were
respectively at the top of the

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.776
class one, they still
get taught to.

01:00:29.776 --> 01:00:32.650
But it means the people, when
it's divided into the high

01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:36.003
performer, low performer, is
you teach the top of that

01:00:36.003 --> 01:00:37.450
little [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:38.180
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.810
So what this does is, I always
wanted to teach the best four

01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:44.770
people only in the classroom.

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:47.870
But the best people in the
classroom have changed.

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:51.400
When I divide the classroom in
this way, the best people in

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:56.120
the low classroom is someone who
would have never got any

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.260
attention in the original
classroom.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:03.030
Or if it was divided
at random, he would

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:04.830
never be at the top.

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:08.500
So it changes who
gets attention.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.210
Moreover, because I'm now paying
attention to somebody

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:15.410
who's not at the top of the
class but in the middle of the

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:20.520
class, the children who are at
the bottom of the class are

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.340
more likely to get something
out of the class.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:29.510
Because what happens is that
the distance between--

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:33.480
imagine that this is a class
which has me and someone else.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.250
And I can't really read.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:38.760
And somebody else can
read Shakespeare.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.890
Now, if you teach to
the top of the

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:42.470
class, I'll get nothing.

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:44.767
But if I'm put it in the
classroom with somebody who

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:48.030
can read a little better
than me, but not that

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:50.220
much better, then.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.590
If you teach to him, I'll still
get something out of it

01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:54.840
because I'm closer to him.

01:02:00.396 --> 01:02:02.524
AUDIENCE: Do the teachers
know something?

01:02:02.524 --> 01:02:04.660
That they've got better--

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:04.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.180
That's why they were
protesting.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:06.720
And I said this before.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.670
They were actually protesting.

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:11.620
But once they found out, they
decided fine, we'll teach the

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.060
best of this class.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:16.230
But the best of this class is
still much less different from

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:20.050
the worst of this class, then
the difference between the

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:22.180
best and the worst in
the original class.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.980
So even the worst in this class
gets something out of

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:27.480
the teaching, where you would
have got nothing before.

01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:36.300
AUDIENCE: So do you think that
it'd be more effective to try

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.730
to re-educate teachers such
that they don't have the

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:42.180
attitude that they only teach
to the top of the class?

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.610
Or is it better just to accept
that as a reality, sort of

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:47.080
like in this survey.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.040
And then just trying to make
some circumstance to get a

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.530
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.330
PROFESSOR: That's an
excellent question.

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:57.840
I guess my view is that it's
difficult to get the teachers

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:03.980
to believe that they should have
a different attitude as

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.950
long as parents have
that attitude.

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.710
So you need to start
with the parents.

01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:09.430
Because after all, the
demand for education

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:11.310
comes from the parents.

01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:13.620
So the parents are
the ones who are

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.760
demanding this education.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:22.050
So in other words, to go back
to where we started, in this

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:24.620
view, what's wrong with the
school system is that the

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:30.580
parents think that there's no
point in educating their

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:34.350
children unless the children
are good enough to graduate

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:35.380
high school.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:39.000
Therefore, they want the entire
education system to

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.940
focus on the few people in the
classroom who are high

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:45.311
performing, and ignore
the rest.

01:03:45.311 --> 01:03:47.870
If that's what the parents
want, the teachers will

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:48.680
deliver that.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.670
And it's going to get
too hard to get them

01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:51.660
to do anything else.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.280
You'll first have to start with
persuading parents that

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.490
even if their child is not going
to get to high school,

01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:58.720
he still should be educated.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.900
I think that's sort of
the, I think, this--

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:11.910
so in fact, that's exactly
what they found.

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:18.230
They found that when you do
this, when you divide this

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.720
class up, everybody benefits.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.190
The top children benefit.

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:26.570
Because they're now
being taught.

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:29.180
The teacher is focusing
on them.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:32.700
The top children of the bottom
class benefit, because the

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.930
teacher is benefiting
from them.

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:38.180
The bottom children of the top
class benefit, because they

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.630
are now closer to the top
of their own classroom.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:45.100
And the bottom children in the
bottom class benefit because

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.090
they are closer to the top
of their classroom.

01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:51.150
So everybody is better
off in this outcome.

01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:58.080
Because as long as you can't
force the teachers to teach

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.610
the bottom, then what you can
do, next best thing, is to

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:05.250
bring the bottom closer
to the top.

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:06.895
And this is what this does.

01:05:06.895 --> 01:05:09.230
If teachers are going to teach
to the top, then you should

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:10.890
try to have classrooms
where the bottom is

01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:13.290
close to the stop.

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:14.210
And that's what you see.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:18.180
The evidence is very clear,
everyone benefits from

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.430
creating these tracks.

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:27.060
This is the table.

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.250
I won't go through it.

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.500
Because we're going to
run out of time.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:37.820
This has already we've said.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:43.120
Who else gets hurt by this is
the children, obviously.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:58.160
The children get hurt because
they get discouraged.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.630
Most children get discouraged.

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:01.690
Because they think education
is not for them.

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:08.440
And this is especially true in
historically discriminated

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.150
populations.

01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:12.600
So historically the
discriminated populations in

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:19.850
many countries tend to be either
by race or in India,

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:25.800
it's by caste, or girls,
depending on the particular

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.910
structure of discrimination.

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:31.670
Historically, discriminated
populations tend to already

01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:35.920
assume that since they have very
few people who have been

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.310
educated, they assume that
that's perhaps because they

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:41.230
have no talent for it.

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:43.720
And then if you go and
tell them, look.

01:06:46.965 --> 01:06:52.010
So another way to put it is that
if you happen to be from

01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:56.090
a family who believe that you
can be educated, then if the

01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:58.420
teacher says, you're stupid,
they won't believe it.

01:06:58.420 --> 01:06:59.900
They're going to go and argue
with the teacher.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:05.905
And say, look, in my family,
everybody has a Ph.D. What do

01:07:05.905 --> 01:07:07.520
you mean, my son is stupid?

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.090
Whereas if you're actually from
a family where no one has

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:15.680
an education, it's much easier
to persuade them that their

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.050
child is not fit
for education.

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:20.590
So what you're going to do is
you're going to reinforce

01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:22.760
stereotypes in society.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:26.170
Because who's going to believe
you when you say

01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:27.740
your child is stupid?

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.790
It's going to be the people
who have been told

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:33.590
historically that they're
not fit for education.

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:35.710
They're going to be the most
likely to believe you.

01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:44.110
So this kind of stereotype, the
existing stereotype will

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:48.050
be reinforced by, if you give
people the message that their

01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:50.480
child is stupid, the existing
stereotype would get

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.420
reinforced.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.350
So that's something that
you see a lot.

01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:59.300
You see that the parents in
these kind of very poor

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.030
families tend to be more
likely to believe these

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:05.530
negative stereotypes
of their children.

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:08.210
Another thing that this would
explain is why children don't

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:10.770
come to school.

01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:14.430
One thing that people don't
emphasize is how rarely

01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:15.680
children show up in school.

01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:34.270
A lot of children basically
completely don't believe that

01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:35.560
school is for them.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.750
And they may be enrolled
in school.

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:42.270
So on a given day, up to 50% of
the children don't show up

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:43.094
in a class.

01:08:43.094 --> 01:08:46.720
Now, that's also true at MIT, as
it turns out, but probably

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.970
not for the same reasons.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:58.270
But many of these children
basically

01:08:58.270 --> 01:08:59.830
hate being in school.

01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:02.100
And they hate being in school
for the right reason, which is

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.109
that they're constantly being
told that this is not for you.

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:13.399
One interesting additional fact
that was, this goes back

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:17.010
to the stereotype, this
is a nice experiment.

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:21.359
So children were asked
to solve mazes.

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:24.240
You know what mazes are?

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.770
Like these things where you
have to draw a line, and

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:28.859
there's a point of entry
and a point of exit.

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:31.279
And you have to find
your way out of it.

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:33.270
So they were given these mazes
and asked to solve them.

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:34.100
I've done this, actually.

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:34.850
It's fun to do.

01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:39.380
You can take a bunch of sheets
and get people in the village

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:42.910
to give their kids, and get
them to solve them.

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:45.609
And it's a very good
test of cognitive

01:09:45.609 --> 01:09:47.220
abilities, it turns out.

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.950
So that's what people
usually do.

01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:54.410
Now, somebody has a good idea
of trying to follow it.

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:58.140
They went to a village in India,
and they got together a

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:02.450
group of historically low caste
people, people who were

01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:04.000
discriminated against.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.800
And combined them with people
from high castes, and put them

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.960
in the same group.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.910
And one experiment, they just
asked them, play the maze.

01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:14.060
Do the maze.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.560
And they found no difference
between high

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:16.700
caste and low caste.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:19.650
They got the exactly
same scores.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.910
Not everybody didn't get the
same score, obviously, but on

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:23.920
average, there was
no difference.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.710
Second experiment, before they
play the game, everybody was

01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:31.450
asked their caste.

01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:32.700
So caste was made salient.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.870
And immediately, you see
a big difference.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.740
You see that the people
who were historically

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:45.070
discriminated self-discriminate.

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:46.840
They start playing badly.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.690
They believe that they can't
compete with the other guys.

01:10:49.690 --> 01:10:51.430
And they do much worse.

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:54.200
So once you make caste salient,
it's exactly this

01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:01.170
fact that once you prime my
belief that I already am

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:04.340
unsure whether I can do these
things, you prime my belief

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:05.900
that I am from a particular
caste.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:09.220
I'm playing against these guys
from a superior caste.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:12.310
I'm just going to think
I'm going to lose.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.110
And it's very simple.

01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:19.030
You just have to get them to
remember what their caste is.

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:21.710
And there's another experiment
which is also interesting.

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:26.680
I'll just say that
and then move on.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.280
In another experiment, teachers
were asked to grade

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.060
the same paper.

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:35.070
And in some, they were told that
the paper was from a high

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:36.290
caste person.

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:40.340
And some, they were told that
the same paper was from a low

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.310
caste person.

01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:44.680
Same paper, exact same paper,
photo copy of the same thing

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.900
with the same answers, but
you're asked to grade it.

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:50.830
And in one case, I said, this
is from Caste A, the other

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:53.310
case, I say it's from Caste B.

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:54.560
That was the experiment.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.375
Then the teachers themselves,
some of them were from a high

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:04.210
caste, and some of them
were low caste.

01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:06.570
Who do you think
discriminated?

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:07.820
What was the pattern
of discrimination?

01:12:10.619 --> 01:12:13.577
AUDIENCE: I'm guessing the
high class discriminated

01:12:13.577 --> 01:12:15.060
against the low class.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.820
PROFESSOR: Turns out
the opposite.

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:18.460
The low class discriminated
against the low class.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:23.310
Low class were scoring their
own caste people lower.

01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:27.540
Because they also believe
that people from their

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:30.110
caste cannot do it.

01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:32.920
So you have this underlying
stereotype.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.940
And now you prime that by
saying, this kid is stupid.

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.380
What are they going to do?

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:40.700
They're going to give
up very quickly.

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.980
As they already believe that
they are not really

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.670
capable of doing it.

01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:48.121
AUDIENCE: In the maze
experiment, did the results

01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:50.586
from the high caste
[INAUDIBLE]

01:12:50.586 --> 01:12:52.558
change [INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:52.558 --> 01:12:56.122
PROFESSOR: I think they went
down, if I remember correctly.

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:59.086
They went down, but the
others went down.

01:12:59.086 --> 01:13:03.540
AUDIENCE: In the grade paper
example, did the high caste

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:06.358
graders discriminate also
against the low caste?

01:13:06.358 --> 01:13:07.820
PROFESSOR: No.

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:09.650
No discrimination from
the high caste.

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:10.770
Only the low caste--

01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:14.006
AUDIENCE: Did they grade the
high caste papers any higher?

01:13:14.006 --> 01:13:14.469
PROFESSOR: No.

01:13:14.469 --> 01:13:15.395
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:18.135
PROFESSOR: Zero effect
of the high caste.

01:13:18.135 --> 01:13:20.650
Only the low caste teachers
discriminated against the low

01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:22.440
caste students.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.780
It was dramatically--

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:25.980
it's not what I expected.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.840
But it does show this

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.240
self-discrimination is very powerful.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.860
The reason I emphasize that is
that that's the problem here.

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:36.550
Once I have a classroom full
of kids who are being told

01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:39.763
they're stupid, the ones who
are from a high caste are

01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:45.220
going to say, look, I know my
grandfather was a religious

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.700
teacher, and my father's
a religious teacher.

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.340
I know I am fit for education.

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:50.080
I'm going to continue.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.640
It's the people who have weak
self-belief who are going to

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.640
be hurt by a system which
basically discriminates

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.890
against them.

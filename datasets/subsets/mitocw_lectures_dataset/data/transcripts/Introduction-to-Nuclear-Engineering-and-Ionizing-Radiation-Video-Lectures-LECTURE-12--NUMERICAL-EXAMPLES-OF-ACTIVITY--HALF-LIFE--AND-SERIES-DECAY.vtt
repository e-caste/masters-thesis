00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.040
MICHAEL SHORT: You guys asked
to do some numerical examples

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.873
of the stuff that we've
been learning today,

00:00:26.873 --> 00:00:28.470
and I've got a fun one for you.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.700
A very real one, because
it happens all the time

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.930
in reactors all over the world.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.970
So to set the stage for
this, hey, suppose I had--

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.560
just suppose, I had a
radioactive cobalt-60 source,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.640
that was calibrated
in March, 2011

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.430
to be approximately
one microcurie.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.747
And it's now October 2016.

00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:53.330
So let's start off
with the easy part.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.890
Let's say I posed the question,
how active was this source

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.720
actually when it was made?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.570
Because it just says--

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.770
what does it say--

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.460
1 microcurie.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:15.920
Supposedly, this was 1
microcurie on March, 2011.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.850
What does that mean the
actual activity could be?

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.550
There's not a lot of
confidence in that number.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.830
Remember significant figures
from high school chemistry

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.498
and physics.

00:01:28.498 --> 00:01:30.290
This is when they're
important, because you

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.790
got to know what you're buying.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.160
So what is the actual
activity of this source

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.120
when it was calibrated?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.590
What is our uncertainty on this?

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.960
Anyone remember
this from sig figs?

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.252
I hope so.

00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:47.850
If not, I'll
refresh your memory.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.060
It's plus or minus the
next decimal point.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.180
So really, this was 1 plus
or minus 0.5 microcuries.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.100
So you might have a
1/2 microcurie source.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.650
You might have a 1 and
1/2 microcurie source.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.355
They specifically
decided to leave out

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:04.980
the second decimal
point so they're not

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.860
liable for a source that's
out of that calibration level.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.610
So we supposedly have
a 1 microcurie source.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.610
And I've measured it
on-- let's say it's now--

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.680
October, 2016.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.230
Suppose I went and
made a measurement,

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.890
and it was 0.52 microcuries.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.830
And we want to know, how
active was this source actually

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.497
when we got it?

00:02:29.497 --> 00:02:30.330
Where would I begin?

00:02:34.503 --> 00:02:35.902
AUDIENCE: Look up the half-life.

00:02:35.902 --> 00:02:37.360
MICHAEL SHORT: OK,
yeah, that's why

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.040
I've got the table of
nuclides right here.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.010
So let's look up the
half-life of cobalt-60.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.290
And there it is right
there, 1,925 days.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:58.140
So we know that the half-live
for cobalt-60 is 1,925.4 days,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.150
which equals--

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.610
and I pre-did the math out so
I wouldn't spend lots of time

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.010
on the calculator.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.130
Activity, how many
seconds is that?

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.000
1.66 times 10 to
the eighth seconds.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.920
And we also remember
that activity equation,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.250
where the activity
as a function of time

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.970
equals the original activity
times e to the minus lambda t.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.910
The only thing missing here
is the initial activity

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.160
and lambda, so how
do we find lambda?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.808
Anyone remember that expression?

00:03:34.808 --> 00:03:37.108
AUDIENCE: Log of
2 over half-life.

00:03:37.108 --> 00:03:37.900
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.520
And we know that
lambda equals log of 2

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.910
over the half-life,
which in this case

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:55.630
is about 0.693
over 1.66 times 10

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:04.050
to the eighth, which equals
4.17 times 10 to the minus 9

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.980
per second.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.320
And so now it's pretty easy.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.000
We know what lambda is.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.560
We know what our current A is.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.000
So we can say that our
original activity is simply

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.640
our current activity divided
by e to the minus lambda t.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.480
What's t?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.090
Well, I made an
approximation here.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.640
It's been about five
years and seven months.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.700
I assumed that a month
has 30 days, on average,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.840
which comes out to t--

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.220
I remember calculating
this already--

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.730
1.74 times 10 to
the eighth seconds.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.090
So we plug in that t right
here, plug in that lambda

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.190
right there, and we get
our initial activity--

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.860
what did I get?--

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.450
was 1.07 microcuries.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.570
Now hopefully, this result
is fairly intuitive.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.300
Because the half-life
of cobalt-57

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.050
is 1,925 days, which is
about 5 and 1/4 years.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.620
And it's just over 5 and
1/4 years since this source

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.940
was calibrated.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.510
And we have just under half
of the original activity.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.800
So hopefully that's an
intuitive numerical example.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.260
Now, let's say, how many atoms
of cobalt-60 did we have?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.277
Or better yet, what was
the mass of cobalt-60?

00:05:33.277 --> 00:05:34.360
Where would I go for that?

00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:41.958
I'll give you a hint.

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:42.750
It's on the screen.

00:05:46.884 --> 00:05:48.820
AUDIENCE: Are you
saying the mass

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.870
that we have in the pellet?

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.200
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, so for
this plastic check source

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.690
right here, what's
the actual mass

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.310
of cobalt-60 that we
put in in the beginning,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.740
again, supposing I had one of
these right in front of you?

00:06:03.795 --> 00:06:05.580
AUDIENCE: Look at
the binding energy.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.830
MICHAEL SHORT: You could
look at binding energy, which

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.140
is a form of mass.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.690
Or luckily, we've got the atomic
mass right up there in AMU.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.840
So again, this is a quick
review of high school chemistry.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.250
We need to find out how many
atoms we have in this pellet.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.010
And once we know the
number of atoms--

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.710
and we have the molar mass up
there in either AMU per atom

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.070
or same thing as moles
per gram, pretty much--

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.430
we'll know what the
mass of cobalt-60 was.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.770
So one important
conversion factor to note

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:43.240
is that 1 curie of
radiation is 3.7 times

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.770
10 to the 10 becquerel.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.550
And remember that 1 becquerel
is 1 disintegration per second.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.620
So if we know the initial
activity of our material,

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.070
using our decay constant, we
should know the number of atoms

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.610
that we had right there.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.810
So we know our initial
activity, A0 is 1.07 microcurie.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.690
And anyone remember,
what's the relation

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.780
between the activity and
the number of atoms present?

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.866
Just yell it out.

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:29.170
I hope you'd know that by now.

00:07:32.443 --> 00:07:33.860
Does this look
familiar to anyone?

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.660
Where the activity is directly
proportional to the number

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.390
of atoms there, times
it's decay constant.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:50.160
So since we now know A0, we
can find N0, because now we

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.320
know lambda as well.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.000
So the number of atoms
we had at the beginning

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.250
is just, our
activity over lambda.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:06.410
And our activity is
1.07 microcuries.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.450
Let's convert up to curies.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:16.210
So we know that there is 1 curie
in 10 to the 6 microcuries.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.150
And we'll use that conversion
factor right there,

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:29.710
times 3.7, times 10 to the
10 becquerel per 1 curie,

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:37.320
divided by our decay constant,
4.17 times 10 to the minus 9

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.760
per second.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.520
Let's check our units to make
sure everything comes out.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.970
I brought a canceling color.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.440
We have microcuries on the
top, microcuries on the bottom,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.420
curies on the top,
curies on the bottom.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.860
And we have a
becquerels, which is

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.260
a disintegrations per second.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.450
And we have a per second
down on the bottom.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.720
So the per second goes away
and the becquerels just

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.675
becomes atoms.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.600
And so we actually get, N0 is--

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.310
I think it's something
times 10 to 12th.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.930
Yeah, 9.5 times 10
to the 12th atoms.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.250
That's the way it looks.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.790
So the final step, how do we go
from number of atoms to mass?

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.730
Can anyone tell me?

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.530
AUDIENCE: Convert it to
Avogrado's number and moles.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.760
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.920
So the last thing
we'll do is we'll

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:44.080
say we have 9.5 times
10 to the 12th atoms,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.300
times Avogadro's number, which
is 1 mole in every 6 times 10

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.605
to the 23rd atoms.

00:09:53.732 --> 00:09:55.190
Then we go to the
table of nuclides

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.308
to get its atomic mass.

00:09:57.308 --> 00:09:58.850
This is one of those
situations where

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.850
you don't need to take
the eighth decimal place,

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.070
because you're not converting
from mass to energy.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.330
You're just getting mass.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.120
So if you might wonder, where
did all the decimal points go,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.520
think of what type of
calculation we're doing.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.007
If we started off with a one
significant digit number,

00:10:14.007 --> 00:10:16.340
do we really care about keeping
the eighth decimal place

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.050
in the rest of everything?

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.480
No, definitely not.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.080
We're not turning AMU
into MEV, in which case

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.417
the sixth decimal point could
put you off by half an MEV,

00:10:27.417 --> 00:10:29.000
or like the rest
mass of the electron.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.690
We're just getting masses here.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.530
So let's just call that 59.9--

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.340
that's enough for me--

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:43.310
59.9 grams in 1
mole of cobalt-60.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:49.950
And just to confirm, we have
atoms here, atoms there,

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.540
moles there, moles there.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.840
We should get a mass in grams.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:05.150
And this came out to 0.95
nanograms of cobalt-60.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.910
Not a lot of cobalt-60
can pack quite a wallop

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.570
in terms of activity.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.570
So even though this has
a pretty long half-life,

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.230
as far as isotopes go, it
takes very little of it

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.540
to have quite a bit of
activity, certainly enough

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.705
for our fairly inefficient
handmade Geiger counter

00:11:21.705 --> 00:11:22.830
to measure what's going on.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.130
Pretty neat, huh?

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.530
Cool.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.620
Now, let's say I ask you another
question, a simpler question.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.570
How many disintegrations
per second

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.060
are coming out of
that cobalt-60 source?

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.690
Let's say we wanted to find
the efficiency of our Geiger

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:42.680
counter.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.132
You'd have to know how
many counts you measure.

00:11:45.132 --> 00:11:47.090
You'd have to know how
far away your source is.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.200
And you'd have to know how
many disintegrations per second

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.890
are happening.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.840
So how would I get to the number
of disintegrations per second?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.560
AUDIENCE: Convert
it to becquerels.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.727
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:11:58.727 --> 00:12:00.680
We'll just take our
current activity,

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.430
which is 0.52 microcuries.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:11.420
And so we'll say, 0.52 times
10 to the minus 6 curies,

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:23.230
times 3.7, times 10 to the
10 becquerel in 1 curie is--

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.880
well, we have curies here.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.260
We have curies there.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.955
And this comes out to-- what
was our current activity.

00:12:30.955 --> 00:12:33.230
It was in the tens of thousands.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.910
About 19,000 becquerels.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.880
So we know that,
right now, this source

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.480
is giving off about 19,000
disintegrations per second.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.340
Is that how many gamma
rays it's giving off?

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.593
Do we know that yet?

00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:49.922
AUDIENCE: No.

00:12:49.922 --> 00:12:50.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Why not?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.797
I heard a lot of no's.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.864
What other information
do we need to know?

00:12:57.864 --> 00:12:59.700
AUDIENCE: Type of radiation.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.620
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.980
Luckily we've got
that right here.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.890
So if you look here,
the mode of decay

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.590
is beta decay to nickel-60.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.130
So cobalt-60 is actually
primarily a beta source.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:16.610
However, it's used for its
characteristic gamma rays.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.870
So let's take a quick look.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.920
We look at its decay
diagram, it's pretty simple.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.870
And let's just say, somewhere
near 100% of the time,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.970
it beta decays up
to this energy level

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.150
and can undergo any number
of transitions like this.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.620
The only two we
really tend to see

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:40.020
is, like that one and that
one are the most likely ones.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.750
So on average,
each disintegration

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.590
of a cobalt-60 atom is going
to produce two highly energetic

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.250
gamma rays.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.240
So actually, what you'd have
to know for this source is,

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.550
despite it being 19,000
becquerels of cobalt-60,

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.970
it's giving off 38,000
gamma rays per second.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.890
So that way your
source calculations

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.528
wouldn't be off
by a factor of 2.

00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:06.570
Then if you know the
distance between your source

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.720
and your detector, and you
know how many of those gamma

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.440
rays are going through
the detector itself--

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.870
which we can count calculate
with a solid angle formula,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.472
which I'll give you
a little later--

00:14:17.472 --> 00:14:18.930
you'll know how
many of them should

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.340
interact in here, once you learn
photon nuclear interactions.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.920
And you'll know how many of
them actually get captured.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.500
And that's how you can get the
efficiency of the detector.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.540
So we've kind of filled
in half the puzzle.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.790
You now know, for
a fixed source,

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.910
how many atoms there are, how
many disintegrations there are

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.442
and how many gamma rays
you expect it to give off.

00:14:38.442 --> 00:14:39.900
And then later in
the course, we'll

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.750
tell you how to figure
out how many of them

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.460
make it into the detector
and how many of those

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.380
should interact in the detector.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.350
Is everyone clear on what
we talked about here?

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.850
Yep.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.800
AUDIENCE: Where did you get the
number for 38,000 gamma rays?

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.730
MICHAEL SHORT: Double the number
of cobalt disintegrations.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.777
AUDIENCE: Because we
assume it drops 2?

00:15:00.777 --> 00:15:01.610
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.720
So I'm ignoring
the 0.2% and 0.6%

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.060
decays because they're
extremely unlikely.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.800
And having looked
this up ahead of time,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.970
I know that this transition
and that transition

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.123
are by far the most likely ones.

00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:17.290
And if you don't know that--

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, does
it say it down there?

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.730
MICHAEL SHORT: It sure do.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.980
Those right there, the
99.9-something intensity ones,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.680
it's all there.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.990
So I had some
questions on Piazza.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.590
What happens when we can't read
the pixelated decay diagram?

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.270
That's just there for fun.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.760
The actual table that will tell
you all the information you

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.110
need to know is right below.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.110
And I just decided, all right,
forget the ones that are 2e

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:48.210
to the minus 6 likely or point
0.007, whatever, too many 0's.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.700
So you can say that, on
average, to probably two

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.240
or three significant
digits, that gamma ray,

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.140
that gamma ray are the
only ones you tend to see.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.373
Is everyone clear on how
I made that determination?

00:16:03.373 --> 00:16:06.000
Cool.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.500
Yes.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.260
AUDIENCE: So are
disintegrations just a beta,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.333
and then for each one of
those, it's two gamma rays?

00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:15.500
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.330
The number of
disintegrations is the number

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.740
of atoms that leave
this position.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.520
So let's take a crazier example.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.310
I've already had you
look at americium-241.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.270
Sort of bring home the message
that the number of americium

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.450
disintegrations
does not necessarily

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:40.400
equal the number of gamma rays
that you will expect to see.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.990
Because any one of
these is possible.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.710
There is an 84% likely one.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.290
It looks like it goes to the
third level from the bottom,

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.900
because it's just the third
number I'm seeing here.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.312
If you don't believe
that, then check

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:55.520
how much you have to zoom
out to see what's going on.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.610
Let's see.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.190
Intensity, yep.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.950
The third most
energetic alpha ray,

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:09.390
so the third from the bottom,
is indeed the 84% likely one.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.730
Then there's another
one that's 13% likely,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.527
so we can't discount
that either.

00:17:14.527 --> 00:17:16.319
So you're going to hit
anything from, like,

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.560
the second to the
fourth energy level

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.780
and any number of those gamma
cascades that come off there.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.740
So the intensity of your
source in becquerels or curies

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.270
does not immediately
tell you how

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.060
many gamma rays or other
disintegration products

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.850
you should expect.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:40.080
There are some pretty simple
ones, like the dysprosium

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.070
one that we saw.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.603
Was it 151?

00:17:43.603 --> 00:17:44.520
I've been here before.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.110
It's not purple.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.240
No, that's a complicated one.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.270
All right, I don't remember
which dysprosium isotope just

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.320
had a single decay.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.020
But the only time
that you would get

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.010
one particle per disintegration
is if your decay diagram

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.750
looked like this.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.110
That's your parent and
that's your daughter.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.390
That's the only time you
can expect one thing.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.220
If you have a more complex
decay diagram than that,

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.570
you'll be looking at more
than one quantum of radiation

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.480
of some form per disintegration.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.716
So is that unclear to anybody?

00:18:24.716 --> 00:18:26.640
Cool.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.540
Now let's get into
a more fun problem.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.690
And I'll leave this up
here, since we're going

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.100
to refer to it a fair bit.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.970
So this is a good example of
activity, half-life, mass,

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.540
number of atom calculations.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.570
We're going to use
this information

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.150
to answer a more
interesting question.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:46.910
How was this made?

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:55.640
Anyone have any idea what sort
of intentional nuclear reaction

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.860
could have produced cobalt-60?

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.530
And I'll go back to cobalt-60
so we can get its proton number.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.148
There it is.

00:19:03.148 --> 00:19:04.440
Can you say it a little louder?

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Oh,
I said neutron bombardment

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.710
of cobalt-59.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.220
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure, you can
have a neutron bombardment.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:20.840
So you can have, cobalt-59
absorbs a neutron,

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.520
becomes cobalt-60
with some half-life.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.515
And then we'll decay with
some decay constant lambda,

00:19:28.515 --> 00:19:29.015
and become--

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.620
in this case, it
undergoes beta decay--

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.460
to nickel-60.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.785
Let me make sure I got
the proton number right.

00:19:41.785 --> 00:19:43.675
I'm going from memory here.

00:19:43.675 --> 00:19:45.414
Hooray.

00:19:45.414 --> 00:19:50.320
OK, how do we set up
the series radioactive

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.290
decay and production equations
to describe this phenomenon?

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.170
So we have a physical picture
of what's going on here.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.535
How do we construct the
differential equation model?

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.030
The same way we've been
doing it Friday and Tuesday.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.830
So someone, kick me off.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.856
What do we start with?

00:20:08.856 --> 00:20:13.640
AUDIENCE: So the production
of cobalt-59 is 0.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:20.750
Destruction would be sigma
times flux times the amount

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.540
of cobalt.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.670
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, let's make
a couple of designations.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.830
Let's call cobalt-59--

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.500
I'll use another color for
this, just so it's clear.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.360
We'll call cobalt-59 N1.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.280
We'll call cobalt-60 N2.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:43.650
We'll call nickel-60 N3, just
to keep our notation straight.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.567
And then continuing
our notation pile here,

00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:50.150
you mentioned that
there's going to be

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.620
some sigma, some microscopic
cross-section times some flux,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.780
the number of neutrons
whizzing about the reactor,

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.900
times the amount of cobalt-60.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:06.070
So let's stick our DN,
Dt, equals no production

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.440
minus some destruction.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.410
Does this look eerily
familiar to any of you?

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.120
Forget the fact that
it's a sigma and a flux.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.370
Just treat those as constants.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.220
What does this
look exactly like?

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.560
AUDIENCE: The minus lambda D.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:30.950
It looks just like dN1 dt
equals minus lambda and 1.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.540
Yeah, that's exactly it.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:41.760
This, in effect, is like your
artificially-induced decay.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.210
So the probability that one
atom of N1 absorbs a neutron,

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.250
times the number of
neutrons are there,

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.130
gives you some rate at which
these atoms are destroyed.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.100
Just like a lambda gives
you the rate at which

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.620
those atoms naturally
self-destruct.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.360
So you can think of the sigma
times flux like a lambda.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.970
Mathematically, they're
treated identically.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.390
The only difference is, we're
imposing this neutron flux.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.302
So it's like an
artificial lambda,

00:22:12.302 --> 00:22:14.510
which means solving the
equations and setting them up

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.590
is exactly the same.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.480
So how about N2?

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.140
What's the production and
destruction rate of cobalt-60?

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.678
First of all, someone yell it
out, what's the creation rate?

00:22:27.678 --> 00:22:30.480
AUDIENCE: Lambda N1.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.680
MICHAEL SHORT: Which lambda?

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.600
AUDIENCE: Oh, lambda 1 I mean.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.940
MICHAEL SHORT: So what
is lambda 1, this one?

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.240
AUDIENCE: Sigma, yeah.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.617
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, so let's
keep with these notations.

00:22:39.617 --> 00:22:41.700
I'm going to say this is
like a lambda artificial,

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:47.840
but I'm going to keep
with sigma flux and 1.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.100
And just so we keep
our notation straight,

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.830
I want to be able
to cleanly separate

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.920
the natural and the artificial
production and destruction.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.300
And what's the destruction rate?

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.372
AUDIENCE: Sigma phi N2.

00:23:00.372 --> 00:23:04.175
MICHAEL SHORT: So you
said sigma phi N2.

00:23:04.175 --> 00:23:06.050
Is that the physical
picture we have up here?

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.880
Not quite, because
like we can see

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.240
here, cobalt-60 self-destructs
on its own, right?

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.380
Yeah.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.740
However, that actually is
a correct term to put in.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.430
The other one that we're missing
would be minus lambda N2.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.120
So you know what?

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.330
Let's escalate this a
bit into reality and say,

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.290
we're going to do this.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.623
The actual equation is not
going to be that much harder.

00:23:38.623 --> 00:23:39.890
So thanks, Sean.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.120
Let's do this.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.620
Yeah.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.370
AUDIENCE: Would those
sigmas be different?

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.850
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yes, good question.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.290
That's what I was getting to.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.900
So there is an
absorption cross-section

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.320
for every reaction
for every isotope.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.080
And now I'd like to show
you guys where to find them.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.810
On the 22.01 site,
there is a link

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.640
to what's called the
Janis Database, which

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.460
is tabulated and plottable
cross-sections of all kinds.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.820
So every single database
that we know of,

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.640
it's updated
continuously by the OECD,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.593
so you can trust that
the data is updated.

00:24:12.593 --> 00:24:15.010
I won't say accurate, because
some of these cross-sections

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.960
are not very well known.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.310
So I've already started it up.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.520
In this case, we don't
have neutron capture data

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.170
for cobalt-60.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.450
Let's keep it in
the symbols for now.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.300
And then later on, we're just
going to say, it's probably 0.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.460
But let's keep it together.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.600
So for cobalt-59,
double-click on that, and you

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.190
are presented with an enormous
host of possible reactions.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.990
Like right here, you
have N comma total,

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:47.030
which is the total cross-section
for all interactions

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.460
of neutrons with cobalt-59.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.890
And you can see
that this varies,

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.580
but the same sort of shape
that I was haphazardly drawing.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.330
It's low.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.310
There are some resonances.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.250
And then it continuously
increases at lower energies.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.050
Is this the right
cross-section to use?

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.390
If it accounts for every
possible interaction

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.880
of a neutron with cobalt-59.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.380
No.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.260
So what other reactions, besides
the one that we want, which is

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.178
capture, could this account for?

00:25:20.178 --> 00:25:21.130
AUDIENCE: Scattering.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:21.606
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:25:21.606 --> 00:25:22.560
AUDIENCE: Fission.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.960
MICHAEL SHORT: Scattering,
fission, n2n production.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.760
Sometimes one neutron
goes in and two

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.070
come out, like for
beryllium, like we

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.720
talked about at the
beginning of class.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.840
So you've got to know to
choose the right cross-section.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.450
And in nuclear
reaction parlance--

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.040
that's shorthand right there--

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.180
that's N comma total.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.460
That accounts for
elastic scattering,

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.690
inelastic scattering to any
energy level, capture, fission,

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.550
n2n reactions, sometimes proton
release, sometimes exploding,

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.830
whatever nuclei do.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.380
So let's look at
our other choices.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.150
I'll shrink that.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:02.920
We have the elastic
cross-section.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.840
Compare that with
a total, and you

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.600
get a general idea
of how much the total

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.790
at elastic cross-sections
actually matter.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.622
So a lot of those resonances
are elastic cross-section

00:26:14.622 --> 00:26:16.330
resonances, but there
are other reactions

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.788
that are responsible for a lot
of the other craziness going

00:26:18.788 --> 00:26:20.600
on.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.001
So let's unselect that.

00:26:25.001 --> 00:26:25.950
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:31.210
I meant MT 1 Let's
compare MT 1 and MT 2.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.545
So MT 2, elastic.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.990
There we go.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.620
OK, that's what
I was hoping for.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.350
So right now, the red one
is the total cross-section,

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.095
and the green one is the
elastic cross-section.

00:26:46.095 --> 00:26:47.720
And you can see that,
at high energies,

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.370
the total
cross-section is mostly

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.050
the elastic cross-section.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.790
But at low energies,
especially right around here

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:57.330
at the thermal energy of
neutrons in a reactor,

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.100
there's something
else responsible.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.470
That's probably what
we're going after.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:06.762
So let's keep looking
through this Janis Database.

00:27:06.762 --> 00:27:09.080
Hey, there's the n2n
reaction, if you guys

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.710
want to see how likely this is.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.180
It's another one
of those reactions

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.560
that-- look at that-- it's
0 until you get to 11 MEV.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.570
So what do you guys
think the q-value

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:24.068
for n2n production
of cobalt-59 is?

00:27:24.068 --> 00:27:25.543
AUDIENCE: Very negative.

00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:26.710
MICHAEL SHORT: How negative?

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.674
It's on the graph.

00:27:28.674 --> 00:27:29.570
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.160
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, negative
looks like 10, or maybe 10

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.510
and 1/2, MEV.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.210
AUDIENCE: 0.454.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.280
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, hey, awesome.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:38.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.680
AUDIENCE: I think
it moves it around.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.972
MICHAEL SHORT: So there you go.

00:27:41.972 --> 00:27:44.460
Yeah, indeed, it's very
energetically unlikely

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.650
to fire in one
neutrons and get two.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.580
But if you have a
10.454 MEV neutron,

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.700
you can make it happen.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.470
Pretty cool, huh?

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.870
That's not the reaction
we're going for.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:01.370
What we want-- let's
see if I can find it.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.520
Proton plus neutron,
neutron plus deuteron, all

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.320
the inelastic energy levels.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.510
There it is, capture.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.810
The gamma reaction here is
what's referred to as capture.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.660
And there we go, a nice
normal-looking cross-section.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.990
So for cobalt-59, if we
go down to about 0.025

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:26.830
EV here, read it off,
it's about 20 barns.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.440
Because you guys asked
for a numerical example.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:36.670
So let's say that our capture
cross-section for cobalt-59

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.640
is about 20 barns,
which is to say

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:47.160
20 times 10 to the minus
24th centimeter squared.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.645
Let's also put up our
capture one for cobalt-60.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.403
So let's go back to our table,
take a look at cobalt-60.

00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.320
I think I know what the
answer is going to be,

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.980
which is, we don't know.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.870
Not in this database,
unfortunately.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.330
So for symbolism,
let's keep it there.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.850
But we're going to say,
well, we don't know.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.147
Yeah.

00:29:15.147 --> 00:29:17.230
So let's designate these
different cross-sections.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:25.780
Let's call it
sigma-59 and sigma-60.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.930
So those will be our
two cross-sections.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.445
We'll just call
this one sigma-59,

00:29:32.445 --> 00:29:34.360
and call this one sigma-60.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.450
And we already know the
lambda for cobalt-60.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:46.160
So let's say the lambda for
60 cobalt, from this stuff

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:53.690
up here, 4.17 times 10 to
the minus 9 per second.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.430
Let's just refer
to that as lambda

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.220
for ease of writing things down.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.985
So we've got a complete set
of reactions for a dN2 dt.

00:30:04.985 --> 00:30:05.610
What about dN3?

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.197
What's the production
rate of N3?

00:30:18.921 --> 00:30:20.180
AUDIENCE: Lambda

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep, lambda N2.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.597
Anything else?

00:30:25.597 --> 00:30:26.930
What about the destruction rate?

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:32.620
Is what?

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.408
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:34.408 --> 00:30:35.950
MICHAEL SHORT: It's
a stable isotope.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.300
AUDIENCE: We don't know.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.290
MICHAEL SHORT: But you
were on to it, Sean.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.840
So what would you add, based
on what you added to N2?

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:51.160
AUDIENCE: Sigma
whatever, phi N3.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.600
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, there's
going to be some new sigma--

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.460
let's call it sigma
nickel-60, phi N3.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah, is the sigma
going to be 0 this time around,

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.000
or is it actually going to be--

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.170
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's find out.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.280
Let's go to our tables.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.760
There, there's
data for nickel-60.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.050
Let's look up its
absorption cross-section.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.950
So we'll scroll
down to our Z gamma,

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.650
our capture
cross-section, plot it.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:28.200
Take a look at
around 1e minus 8.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.460
And it's like 2 barns--

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.751
not negligible.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.365
So our capture cross-section
for nickel-60--

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.100
I keep overwriting
myself, and then I

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.580
remember it's a blackboard.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:53.150
2 barns, which is 2 times 10
to the minus 24th cm squared.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:57.820
So we can just refer to
that as sigma nickel.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.460
For the purposes
of this problem,

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.640
we don't particularly care how
much nickel-60 we're making.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.390
Nickel-60 is a stable
isotope of nickel.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.320
Eh, forget it.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.610
So for the purposes
of this problem,

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.677
forget the N3 equation.

00:32:13.677 --> 00:32:15.760
We don't care how much
stable nickel-60 that we're

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.760
making, because it's a
lot cheaper to get it out

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.950
of the ground, probably
something like 10

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.260
orders of magnitude cheaper.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:21.890
Yep.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.182
AUDIENCE: Where did you pick
that incident energy from,

00:32:24.182 --> 00:32:26.120
the MEV [INAUDIBLE]
1 times 10/8?

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.100
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, so the
incident energy I picked--

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.990
because one thing
we had gone over

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.730
is that the thermal
energy of a neutron

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:43.450
is around 0.025 EV, which
is equal to 2.5 times

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:47.770
10 to the minus eighth MEV.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:51.340
So I took that value,
about 2.5 times 10

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.850
to the minus eighth MEV, so
around here, and just went up.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:33:00.150
And on a log scale, it looks
to be closest to 2 barns.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:04.830
You can always get
the actual value.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:07.280
So if you want to
zoom right in, I'm

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:12.162
going to keep zooming into the
10 to the minus eighth region.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.850
Maybe not.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:21.660
You can set your
bounds accordingly.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.380
Oh, 0 or negative
values-- ah, OK, whatever.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.030
Let's just read off
the graph for now.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.340
You can use this tool
to get the actual value.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.530
But for problems
like this, I think

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.930
estimating it from the
graph is going to be fine.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.370
When you get into
22.05 and you're

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:38.280
like, what's the actual flux
in the reactor to within 1%

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.140
or something, estimating
from the graph

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.270
is no longer allowable.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.100
There are tabulated
values of these things.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.690
Oh, yeah, so you can actually
set the plot settings,

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.650
get the tables.

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:56.260
Oh, tabulated-- there we go.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.200
So you can read off values
of the cross-sections

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.393
from a table like that.

00:34:00.393 --> 00:34:01.810
But for now, since
we want to make

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:03.670
sure to get this
problem done, let's

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.450
just stick with the graph.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.130
So we don't care
about the N3 equation.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:14.179
We're also going to say, well,
let's not ignore sigma-60 yet.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.980
So how do we solve
this set of equations?

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.120
Let's make a little
separation here.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.880
First of all, the easy one--

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.320
what's N1 as a function of time?

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:35.952
AUDIENCE: e to the
minus sigma-59, phi.

00:34:35.952 --> 00:34:42.560
MICHAEL SHORT: e to the minus
sigma-59, phi, and what else?

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.590
AUDIENCE: N0.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:48.554
MICHAEL SHORT: There is
an N1 0, and there's a t.

00:34:48.554 --> 00:34:49.929
Because as you're
burning it out,

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.550
it matters how
much time you have.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.420
Doesn't this look eerily
similar to an N equals N0 e

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.820
to the minus lambda t?

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.360
Again, it's like exponential
artificial decay,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.120
because we're burning
those things out.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.880
For a fixed amount
of neutrons going in,

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.940
the amount that we burn is
proportional to the amount

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:12.930
that is there.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.340
So that's the burn rate.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.050
That's the amount that's there.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:18.370
This is our artificial lambda.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.990
So that equation's easy.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:21.550
What we really want
to know is, what

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:26.360
is N2 as a function of time?

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.410
That's the $60 million
dollar question.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:32.500
And I'm not exaggerating there,
because cobalt-60 is expensive.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.860
So the question I'm posing
to you guys on the homework--

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.250
so for those of you who
have started problem set 4,

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.292
I'm going to be swapping
out the noodle scratcher

00:35:39.292 --> 00:35:43.080
problem to this problem that
we're going to begin together

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.080
in class.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.140
And you guys are going to
finish on the homework.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.480
So I'm kind of giving
you help on the homework.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.690
What is N2, the amount of
cobalt-60 in your reactor,

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.100
as a function of time?

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:58.500
And what is your profit
for running the reactor

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.150
as a function of time?

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.930
Assuming a few things-- so
let's set up some parameters.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.120
I'm going to say that
the neutron flux is

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.950
the same as that in the MIT
reactor, which is about 10

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:15.440
to the 14th neutrons per
centimeter squared per second.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.210
We already have
all of our lambdas.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.190
We have all of our sigmas.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:24.950
I'm going to say that the cost
of running the reactor is--

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:27.170
and I have a quote on this--

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:37.630
$1,000 per day, which is the
same as $0.01 per second.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.430
Not a bad rate to stick
something in the reactor,

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.160
right?

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.228
It's not bad at all.

00:36:43.228 --> 00:36:44.770
If you had to build
your own reactor,

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.020
your daily operating cost
would actually be $1 million

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.230
a day for a commercial
power plant.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.380
So every time a plant goes
down, you lose $1 million a day,

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.740
plus the lost electricity or
whatever that you have to buy.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.210
So let's put that in there.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:04.270
And from the cost of this
hypothetical cobalt-60 source,

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:15.420
we know that cobalt-60 runs
about $100 per microcurie,

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.110
because these sources
run for about $100.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.870
And so the eventual problem
that we're going to set up here

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.912
and you guys are going to
solve on the homework--

00:37:23.912 --> 00:37:26.520
and we can keep going a little
bit on Friday if you want--

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.660
is, at what point, at what t
do you shut off your reactor

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.050
and extract your cobalt-60
to maximize your profit?

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.640
And this is an
actual value judgment

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.670
that folks that make
cobalt-60 have to make.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:41.040
How long do you keep your
nickel target in there

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.410
and not hit diminishing returns?

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:45.360
Because you're
always going to be,

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.680
let's say, increasing
the amount of cobalt-60

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.270
that you make if your source
is basically undefeatable,

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.270
until you reach some
certain half-life criterion.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.580
But it might not make
financial sense to do so.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.550
So let's start getting
the solution to N2.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.910
Let's see.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.860
So I'm going to
rewrite our N2 equation

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.370
and we can start solving it.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:19.070
I'm sorry, that's
a dN2 dt, equals

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:33.800
sigma-59, flux, N1 minus lambda
N2 minus sigma-60 flux N2.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.490
So how do we go about solving
this differential equation?

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.290
AUDIENCE: Integrating factor.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.248
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep, the
old integrating factor.

00:38:41.248 --> 00:38:42.748
First, we want to
get rid of the N1,

00:38:42.748 --> 00:38:44.100
because that's another variable.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:53.140
And we've already
decided right here

00:38:53.140 --> 00:39:03.980
that N1 is N1 0 times e to
the minus sigma-59 flux t.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.810
And we haven't
specified, what's N1 0?

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:08.930
Let's do that now.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:14.830
The last number we'll put in
is, we started with a 100 gram

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:19.300
source of cobalt-59.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.700
When we write it in isotope
parlance, it sounds exotic.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.452
But that's actually the only
stable isotope of cobalt.

00:39:24.452 --> 00:39:26.410
So that's just a lump of
cobalt from the ground

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:27.118
that we stick in.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:32.090
So we know what N1 0 is.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:35.770
So we can now rewrite
this equation as--

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:39.190
let's just go with N2
prime for shorthand.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:42.190
And we'll put everything on
one side of the equation.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:53.730
So we'll have, plus lambda
plus sigma-60 phi N2,

00:39:53.730 --> 00:40:06.590
minus sigma 59 phi times e
to the minus sigma-59 phi t,

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.820
equals 0.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.160
So what is our
integrating factor here?

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.587
AUDIENCE: e to the lambda
plus sigma-60 phi t.

00:40:18.587 --> 00:40:19.420
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.210
So it is, e to the
integral of whatever

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:33.810
is in front of our N2,
lambda plus sigma-60 phi dt,

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:40.650
which equals e to the
lambda plus sigma-60 phi t.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.930
So we now multiply every
term in this equation

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:47.170
by our mu, our
integrating factor.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:52.510
So let's say we have
N2 prime times--

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.700
I'm just going to use mu for
shorthand, since it's going

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.770
to take a long time to write.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:05.050
Plus-- let's see, that right
there is like mu prime,

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:09.580
because if we take the
integral of mu times N2--

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.080
let's see.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.700
Oh, yeah, this is right.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:22.960
So we have lambda plus
sigma-60 N2 times mu,

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:35.790
minus mu times sigma-59 phi e
to the minus sigma-59 phi t,

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.280
equals 0.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.530
This stuff right here is like
the an expanded product rule,

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.250
so we can write it more simply.

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:51.895
So we can say, N2
times mu prime--

00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:03.530
let's see-- equals mu sigma-59
phi e to the minus sigma

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:08.730
59 phi times t.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:12.315
So next we integrate both sides.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.500
And we get N2 times mu equals--

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.090
let's see.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:26.610
Let's expand everything out now.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:37.890
So that stuff would
be sigma-59 phi

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:45.630
e to the lambda
plus sigma-60 phi,

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:53.230
minus sigma-59 phi times t.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.850
So if we integrate
all of that, we're

00:42:54.850 --> 00:43:01.335
going to get sigma-59 phi.

00:43:01.335 --> 00:43:05.300
I think there's an N0
missing here, isn't there?

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:05.825
Let's see.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.820
There should be an
N1 0 missing here.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.320
Yep.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.380
There's an N1 0 that I
dropped for some reason.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.170
Let's stick that back in--

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:27.600
N1 0, and N1 0.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:40.900
N1 0 over that stuff,
lambda plus sigma-60 phi

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:50.100
minus sigma-59 phi,
times whatever is left,

00:43:50.100 --> 00:44:05.570
e to the lambda plus sigma-60
phi, minus sigma-59 phi t,

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.800
plus C.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.252
So now we can say, what's
our integration constant C?

00:44:13.252 --> 00:44:14.710
The last thing we
haven't specified

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:16.240
is our initial condition.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:24.070
So let's assume that when
we started our reactor,

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:26.300
there was no cobalt-60.

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.110
That makes for the
simplest initial condition.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.400
So we can substitute
that in here.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.740
So at t equals 0, N equals 0.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.530
So we've got get 0 equals--

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:45.110
if t is 0, then that just
becomes sigma-59 phi N10

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:57.050
over lambda plus sigma-60
phi, minus sigma-59 phi,

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:02.500
plus C. And so that
makes things pretty easy,

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:09.900
because we know C equals
minus sigma-59 phi N1 0,

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.290
over that stuff that I keep
saying over and over again.

00:45:20.222 --> 00:45:22.180
And then we've pretty
much solved the equation.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.210
The last thing we have
to do is divide by mu,

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:26.950
and we'll end up with
the same solution

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:29.290
that we got on Friday
and the same solution

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:30.820
that we got on Tuesday.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.430
So I realized, the second after
I said it last time, that,

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.640
oh, we can't just absorb
some e to the something

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.190
t into our integration
constant C because there's

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.660
a variable t in it.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.420
So I would say, look
at this derivation

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.340
to know the whole solution.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.770
And so finally we end up with--

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.776
anyone mind if I erase a little
bit of this stuff up top?

00:45:51.776 --> 00:45:54.810
OK, I'll erase the decay
diagram because we're not

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:57.090
using that anymore.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.838
And hopefully everybody
knows our conversion factor.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:10.260
So the end solution, N2
of t, would look like,

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:20.910
sigma-59 phi N1 0, over
lambda plus sigma-60 phi,

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:30.300
minus sigma-59 phi,
times e to the minus--

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.990
what's lambda 2 in this case?

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:39.660
Lambda plus sigma-60
phi t, minus e

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:45.411
to the minus sigma-59 phi t.

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.860
And that right there is
our full equation for N2.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.800
Now you guys said, let's
make this numerical.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:59.568
OK, we have every numerical
value already chosen.

00:46:59.568 --> 00:47:01.610
I've already plugged these
into the Desmos thing,

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:05.500
so you can see
generally how this goes.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.060
So we've solved
it theoretically,

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:10.090
so now let's make this numerical
and make some sort of a value

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:11.290
judgment, right?

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.410
We know sigma-59, because
we just looked that up.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:16.700
We know phi.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:23.240
We impose that as 10 to the
14th neutrons per second.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.210
There it is.

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:28.060
We know our lambda.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.060
We don't know our
sigma-60, so we're just

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.140
going to forget that for now.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:37.360
But the point is, for
everything except time and N2,

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.100
we have numerical
constants for this.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:44.290
So once we plug it all in, I
modified the Desmos example

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.870
from last time to
have the actual unit.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:53.130
So you can see that our
fake L1, our lambda--

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:58.780
we'll call it lambda 1--
equals sigma-59 times

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.620
phi, which is 20 barns.

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:09.160
20 times 10 to the minus 24th
centimeters squared, times 10

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:14.230
to the 14th neutrons per
centimeter squared per second.

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:18.160
And the centimeter
squareds cancel.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.810
That becomes, to the minus 10.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:29.770
And we get that our lambda 1 is
like 2 times 10 to the minus 9

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.570
per second.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:37.190
Our lambda 2, well, we already
have that, 4.17 times 10

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.120
to the minus 9 per second.

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:44.860
So this is one of those cases
where lambda 1 approximately

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.197
equals lambda 2.

00:48:47.197 --> 00:48:48.780
So just like you see
in the book, when

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.630
you plug in all the numbers,
you get a very similar equation.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:57.400
Which is to say, there's going
to be some maximum of cobalt-60

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:57.900
produced.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.820
And in this case,
the x-axis I have

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.770
in seconds, because
that's the units we're

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.210
using for everything.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:05.080
The y-axis is number of atoms.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.210
So right there, 6 times 10
to the 23rd, that's one mole.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:13.050
So at most, you can
make up about 1/3

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:21.540
of a mole of cobalt-60 out of
100 moles of cobalt-59, which

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.920
means you're never
actually going

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.380
to have one mole of cobalt-60.

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:30.150
Because of the way that our
natural and artificial decay

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.700
constants work out, because
they're fairly equal,

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.580
you're never going to be able
to convert and harvest it all.

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.520
That's the numerical
output of this.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.710
Now I have another
question for you.

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:44.490
Is the top of this curve
necessarily the profit point

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:45.770
for this reactor?

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.090
No, good answer.

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:47.840
Why do you say no?

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.780
AUDIENCE: Well, you have
to write another equation

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.985
for the costs and the profits
to maximize both of them.

00:49:54.985 --> 00:49:56.040
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.430
That's what you guys are
going to do on the homework.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:01.340
I think we've done the
hard part together here.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.110
And so now I want
you guys to decide,

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:06.020
given those profit parameters--
and I will write them down

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.280
on the Pset--

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.650
how long do you run
your reactor to maximize

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:11.977
your cobalt-60 profit?

00:50:11.977 --> 00:50:13.560
So this is one of
those examples where

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.220
we did the whole
theoretical derivation,

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.340
we decided, yes, let's escalate
the situation for reality.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.260
Everything works out just fine.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.900
The final answer,
well, you just tack

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.240
on this extra
artificial bit of decay

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.920
from the cobalt-60
being in the reactor.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.800
But the form of the equation
is exactly the same.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.760
There's just a couple other
constants in it for reality.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.820
Then if you plug in all the
numbers for the constants,

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.270
so you pretend like that stuff
is lambda 2 and that stuff

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:50.120
is lambda 1, there's lambda
1 again, there's lambda 2,

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.980
there's lambda 1,
and it's exactly

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:56.665
the same equational form as the
original solution that we had.

00:50:56.665 --> 00:50:58.040
When you plug in
all the numbers,

00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.957
you get something
remarkably similar to what's

00:50:59.957 --> 00:51:03.620
in the book, just scaled
for actual units of atoms

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:04.660
and seconds.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.900
Is there a question?

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:06.485
Yeah.

00:51:06.485 --> 00:51:07.860
AUDIENCE: On the
homework, do you

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.237
want us to just assume
that sigma-60 is 0?

00:51:10.237 --> 00:51:11.070
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:12.080
AUDIENCE: And have
that all cancel out?

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.080
MICHAEL SHORT: If you can
find it, that's great.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.160
But I couldn't find
it that easily.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.470
You can hunt through the
different databases in Janis

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:19.220
to try to find it.

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.170
But I'm not going to penalize
you if you can't find it,

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:22.087
if I couldn't find it.

00:51:24.895 --> 00:51:26.270
So yeah, a lot of
the homework is

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.730
going to be redoing this
derivation for yourself.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.230
Because I want to
make sure that you

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:36.740
can go from a set
of equations that

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.320
models an actual
physical solution.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.990
And I guarantee you you'll
have another physical solution

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:44.750
on the exam.

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.960
Solve them using your
knowledge of 1803,

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.840
get some sort of a
solution, which looks crazy,

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.600
but it comes from
straightforward math.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.250
Then plug in some
realistic numbers

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:56.720
and answer an actual question.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.220
How long should you
run your reactor

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:01.062
to maximize your profit?

00:52:01.062 --> 00:52:02.290
So it's kind of neat.

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:03.955
We've been here
one month together,

00:52:03.955 --> 00:52:06.490
and you can already start
answering these value judgment

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.670
questions about
running a reactor.

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:12.880
And so again, I don't know who
did, but I'm glad you asked,

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.620
is this field mostly simulation?

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:16.090
And the answer is no.

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:18.670
You actually have to use math
to make value judgments if you

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:20.020
want to go and make isotopes.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.732
And then you go and
make the isotopes.

00:52:22.732 --> 00:52:24.190
And you sell them
to people like me

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:29.390
so I can bring them into class
and scare unwitting members

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:30.960
of the public, theoretically.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.190
Yeah, hypothetical
source indeed.

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:38.410
So any questions on what we
did here, from start to finish?

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:39.250
Yep.

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:44.250
AUDIENCE: On the equation
right in the middle there,

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:47.090
where it says-- in parenthesis,
it has lambda plus sigma-60--

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:48.090
MICHAEL SHORT: This one?

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:49.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.657
Was the phi drop just like a--

00:52:50.657 --> 00:52:52.490
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, yeah,
that was a mistake.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:53.032
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:53.032 --> 00:52:55.007
I can just pull it back later.

00:52:55.007 --> 00:52:56.590
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
it probably means

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.420
I was talking and
thinking at the same time

00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.462
and forgot to write that.

00:52:59.462 --> 00:53:01.840
But indeed, it's
back everywhere else.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.080
Thank you.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:03.580
Yep.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.490
AUDIENCE: So the lambda in the
final N2 function equation,

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.750
is that lambda 1, the
theoretical lambda 1,

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:10.890
fake lambda 1, or
is that lambda 2?

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:14.520
MICHAEL SHORT: This
lambda right here

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.740
is the actual lambda
for cobalt-60.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.550
Yep.

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:18.990
This right here
is just an analogy

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:23.670
I'm drawing to say that,
it's almost like that stuff

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.230
is lambda 1.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:29.550
That's our original
artificial decay constant.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:32.973
And this stuff here
is like our lambda 2,

00:53:32.973 --> 00:53:34.890
because there's natural
decay and then there's

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.904
reactor-induced destruction.

00:53:37.904 --> 00:53:38.780
Yep.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:41.756
AUDIENCE: What is that factor of
dividing by lambda [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:41.756 --> 00:53:43.740
Where does that come from?

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:47.598
MICHAEL SHORT: That comes
from this solution right here.

00:53:47.598 --> 00:53:49.140
There's another
interesting bit, too.

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.600
Did we necessarily say--

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.130
let's see.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.620
Did we necessarily say that--

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.350
no, never mind, that's fine.

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:01.470
That comes from--
let's trace it through.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:06.030
So mu contains-- yeah, it
comes from C. That's right.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:12.300
So we had it over
here, because that's

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.370
part of our solution for--

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.770
let's see.

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.280
Where would we trace it back to?

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.520
It starts off here in the
differential equation.

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.870
It starts off here as well.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:25.110
So that's part of
what's inside mu.

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:27.030
OK, that's where it came from.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.465
So a mu contains this stuff.

00:54:29.465 --> 00:54:29.965
Yep.

00:54:29.965 --> 00:54:33.230
AUDIENCE: And then
once you integrate,

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:35.100
it just becomes e to the that.

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.760
It doesn't actually
become lambda plus 65.

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.910
MICHAEL SHORT: It becomes e
to the lambda plus 60 phi,

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.230
times t.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:46.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but when we
do the integration of that,

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:49.868
we don't get any factors of
lambda plus 60 phi coming down.

00:54:49.868 --> 00:54:51.160
MICHAEL SHORT: We do, actually.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.280
There is a mu stuck
in right here.

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.100
And so I just wanted to say
that, expanding this term

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.280
comes out to lambda
plus sigma 60 phi,

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.700
minus lambda sigma-59
phi, times t.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:05.260
So when you integrate
this whole term--

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:09.460
and again, there's an
N0 that should be there.

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:12.730
You do bring this whole
pile in front of the t down

00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:14.500
on the bottom of the equation.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.214
So that's where it comes from.

00:55:17.214 --> 00:55:19.410
Yeah, cool.

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:22.680
I don't think there's
any more missing terms.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.900
OK, maybe time for a last
question, because it is 10

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.053
o'clock.

00:55:27.053 --> 00:55:28.470
AUDIENCE: This
doesn't really have

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.215
to do with your
derivation or anything.

00:55:31.215 --> 00:55:33.340
So I'm pretty sure you also
already explained this.

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:39.730
But why can you put
a cross-section,

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:41.770
like that's a measure
of probably in units,

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:44.530
of centimeters squared.

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:46.370
How does that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:49.170
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah, so the
cross-section is almost like,

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:52.080
if you fire a
neutron at an atom,

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.200
the bigger the atom appears to
the neutron, the more likely

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.610
it's going to hit it.

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:58.805
So it's kind of a
theoretical construct,

00:55:58.805 --> 00:56:00.930
to say, if something has
an enormous cross-section,

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:03.110
it's like shooting a bullet
at a gigantic target,

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:06.108
with a high probability
of impact or interaction.

00:56:06.108 --> 00:56:07.650
Something with a
small cross-section,

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:09.348
there's still only
one atom in the way,

00:56:09.348 --> 00:56:11.640
but it's like you're shooting
a bullet at a tiny target

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.307
and have less of a
chance of hitting it.

00:56:16.231 --> 00:56:17.940
Does that makes sense?

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:18.500
Cool.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.660
AUDIENCE: So is it just
a theoretical construct,

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:25.104
or can you actually relate
it to an actual physical

00:56:25.104 --> 00:56:26.933
cross-sectional area?

00:56:26.933 --> 00:56:28.350
MICHAEL SHORT: You
can't relate it

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.850
to a physical cross-sectional
area, as I know.

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:33.630
It's not like a certain
nucleus has a larger

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.063
cross-sectional area.

00:56:35.063 --> 00:56:36.480
Otherwise, things
like gadolinium,

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.490
which has a cross-section
of 100,000 barns,

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:40.600
would just be a larger atom.

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.562
And it's not.

00:56:41.562 --> 00:56:43.510
And yeah, Sean.

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:46.330
AUDIENCE: Are they determined
only experimentally,

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:49.232
or do we know some of
way to calculate it?

00:56:49.232 --> 00:56:50.440
MICHAEL SHORT: Good question.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.800
They can be theoretically
calculated in some cases.

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.340
In the Yip book, Nuclear
Radiation Interactions,

00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:01.950
he does go over how to calculate
those from quantum stuff.

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:04.380
And so you'll get a little
bit of that in 22.02,

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:07.590
in terms of predicting the
cross-section for hydrogen

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.060
and the cross-section for water.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.030
And molecular water is not
just the sum of its parts.

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:13.530
That's the kind of crazy part.

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:16.560
Cross-sections do change when
you put atoms and molecules

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.770
together, just tend to
be at lower energies,

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:22.230
around thermal
energies and such.

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:23.760
Let's say, all of
them probably can

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.940
be theoretically calculated,
just not that easily.

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:31.800
But the really simple ones
you can predict theoretically.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:36.300
Predicting the resonances
in those cross-sections,

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.190
that's tough.

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:43.377
Let's look at a simple
cross-section, like hydrogen.

00:57:43.377 --> 00:57:47.120
AUDIENCE: Can't you calculate
it using simulations?

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.010
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:51.520
Like if you know, let's say, the
full wave function for a given

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:55.440
atom or for all the electrons in
an atom, you should be able to.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.890
So let's do N
total for hydrogen.

00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:02.880
Much simpler, this is the kind
of thing that can be predicted

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.970
from theory quite easily.

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:13.545
In fact, you will be
doing this in 22.02.

00:58:13.545 --> 00:58:14.920
The other one,
no, I don't expect

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.870
you to be able to predict this.

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:18.850
But you will learn why
the resonances are there

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:21.200
and why they take the
shape that they do.

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.430
So last thing-- we did go
like three minutes late,

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:26.230
but everyone's still here.

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:27.940
You can go if you
have to, by the way.

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.530
I can't keep you here.

00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:32.470
If you want to know, if you
want to make this equation more

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:37.000
realistic and account for every
possible energy in the reactor,

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.320
you can make these
cross-sections

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:47.040
a function of energy, and
integrate over the full energy

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:47.540
range.

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.320
And this is actually
how it's done.

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.740
And you will do
this in 22.05, where

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.880
you'll be able to take the
energy-dependent cross-section

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.260
in tabulated or
theoretical form,

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.510
and then integrate
this whole equation,

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:04.360
and also account for the fact
that the flux has an energy

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:04.900
component.

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.240
Usually, it looks something
like-- in a light-water

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.918
reactor, if this is
energy and this is flux,

00:59:10.918 --> 00:59:12.460
there'll be a bit
of a thermal spike.

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.650
There won't be much
going on in the middle.

00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:19.560
I'm sorry, a fast spike, and
there will be a thermal spike.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.080
And knowing how many
neutrons are at every energy

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.500
level, what's the probability
of every neutron at energy level

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.740
interacting, and what are the
cross-sections at every energy

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.200
level integrated over
the full energy range

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.230
is what gets you the
accurate correct solution.

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:37.113
What we've done here is called
the one-group approximation,

00:59:37.113 --> 00:59:39.030
where we've assumed that
all the neutrons have

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:42.030
the same energy,
thermal energy, which

00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:46.610
is an OK assumption for
thermal light-water reactors.

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:49.300
And it'll get you
a good estimate.

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.670
The more neutrons you have
at different energies,

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:53.560
the less good that
estimate becomes.

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.060
Yeah.

00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.647
AUDIENCE: Wait, so
that thermal energy

00:59:55.647 --> 00:59:57.260
you gave us, like
0.02 [INAUDIBLE],,

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.506
that was estimated for the
energy of the neutrons being

01:00:00.506 --> 01:00:01.006
fired.

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:04.240
MICHAEL SHORT:
Let's say you have

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.320
a neutron at about 298 Kelvin.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.660
From the Maxwell-Boltzmann
temperature distribution,

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:15.770
you can turn that temperature
into an average kinetic energy.

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:19.400
And that average kinetic energy
will give you a velocity.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:25.360
And that velocity is around
2,200 meters per second.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.630
And that average kinetic energy
happens to be about 0.025 EV.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:32.180
So thermalized
neutrons, like the ones

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.270
flying about in the reactor,
are moving quite slowly

01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:38.652
at just 2,200 meters
a second, compared

01:00:38.652 --> 01:00:40.360
to the fast neutrons,
which can be moving

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.820
closer to the speed of
light, not that close,

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.163
but much, much, much closer.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.480
Cool.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.938
I'll take it as a good sign
that you all voluntarily stayed

01:00:50.938 --> 01:00:52.480
a little late.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.350
So did you guys find
this example useful?

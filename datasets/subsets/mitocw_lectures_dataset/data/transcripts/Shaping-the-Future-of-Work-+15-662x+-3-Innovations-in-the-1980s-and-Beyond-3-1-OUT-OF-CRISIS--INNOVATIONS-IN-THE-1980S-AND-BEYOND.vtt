00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.150
Welcome to the third
week of our course

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.970
on shaping the future of work.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.700
Now that we've laid the
historical foundation

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.120
by looking at what made
the social contract

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.110
work in our countries
in the past,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.800
it's time to start to lay out
a framework for the future.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.040
So this week we're going to pay
special attention to the time

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.240
when we first began to identify
what made for high road

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.750
firms versus low road firms.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.140
Remember the diagram that
we had in the first chapter

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.800
of the book that we are
reading for this course, where

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.110
we identified what
differentiates firms that

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.430
are perhaps good
for shareholders

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.200
and produce good
financial results, but not

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.640
such good results for workers
compared to those that

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.860
produce good results for both?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.730
We're going to try to
understand what makes

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.380
these different firms work.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.460
And we're going to see if
we can identify how we can

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.070
use these ideas in the future.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.730
Now when we look at
these organizations--

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.390
and we'll bring in examples
like Market Basket, Patagonia,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.950
Ideal, Saturn, Costco,
Southwest Airlines, and others--

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.480
we're not doing that to
put these organizations

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.060
on a pedestal, but really
to dig deeply to understand

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.430
what makes them
work, and how can we

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.080
apply these in the industries
and organizations of interest

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.850
to us.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.280
And to do that we're going to
really focus on two objectives

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.950
this week.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.170
One is just what I said,
what are the ingredients

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.920
of these high road firms?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.440
And then, how might we
use this understanding

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.990
to decide whether or
not we want to work

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.270
for an employer that has some
of these characteristics?

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.230
We'll do that by applying
a tool that you'll

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.740
find in the Assignment
tab of the course.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.690
It's called the
Good Jobs Survey.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.350
And it asks you to go out,
find a firm of interest

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.700
to you or in an
industry that you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.220
may have a particular
interest in working in,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.770
and talk to someone.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.840
Talk to an employee
in that firm.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.530
Ask them about the
conditions of work

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.490
that are present in
that organization.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.920
You'll find a rating form.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.330
You can fill out the form.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.420
Then you provide your answers
on the platform for the course.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.620
And down the road, we
will report what everyone

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.490
learned from that experience.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.890
We want you to remember
these ideas though,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.000
because we'll use them
throughout the rest

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.720
of the course.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.600
Particularly, we're
going to put them

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.180
to work when we come to the
grand finale of this course,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.820
where we negotiate a new social
contract, the next generation's

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.940
social contract.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.700
Governing conditions of
employment in our workplace

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.610
is the future.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.800
So we want you to
use some of the ideas

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.270
that you learned from
both the Good Jobs Survey,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.430
but also from observing
and learning about some

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.670
of the organizations
that have good practices

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.730
that we can then apply
in our own organizations.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.560
So that's a good deal of
what we will do this week.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.450
And I hope that you will have
a good time with the materials

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.340
and that you'll have a good time
applying them as we go forward.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.700
But I'd like to make two quick
comments on what we learned

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.620
from last week's discussion.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.950
I was particularly
impressed with the sample

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.380
of organizations
that you identified

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.790
as you went through your
career planning exercise.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.000
A wide array of very
interesting jobs,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.280
from engineering, clergy
members, disability teachers,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.940
HR managers, labor leaders,
artists, sports agents--

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.110
for the National Football
League, no less--

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.500
psychometricians, people
who use mathematics

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.390
to try to understand how to
measure individual behavior

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.480
and attitudes, futurists,
graphic artists,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.630
technical editors.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.320
Note that all of these
are jobs that really

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.520
are going to require
considerable human touch,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.290
creativity, and effort.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.600
None of these are going
to be totally replaced

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.880
by robots, or artificial
intelligence, or machine

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.500
learning.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.610
And so I don't want
you to be too scared

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.980
about the future of work.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.620
I want you to prepare for it.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.690
That's what we're
learning from this course.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.610
That's what we're learning
from this particular exercise.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.540
So put the pathways
of education that you

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.920
identified in the career
planning exercise to work.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.440
Do your part to be
prepared for the future.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.780
And then work with us and
with other stakeholders

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.780
to make sure that
the conditions are

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.670
present to make it successful.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.390
I was also very
interested to learn

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.060
what you had to say about the
great debate over productivity

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.840
and wages.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.220
You completed a poll.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.110
And here's the
results of that poll.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.960
85% of you agreed that
wages and productivity

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.860
ought to move together.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.620
About 7%, 7.5%, said you're
not sure, and another 7%

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.020
said, well maybe not anymore.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.190
In fact, many of you
indicated while you believe

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.810
in this principle,
you believe it's also

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.380
going to be difficult to apply
it in the current economy given

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.480
changes in technology, changes
in international competition,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.200
and the way in which
organizations are structured

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.230
today.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.570
But I believe there are ways
we can apply these concepts.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.470
But we have to do
it in ways that

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.700
are consistent with the economy
and the workforce today.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.530
So I've added some more
comments on the discussion board

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.720
about how we can apply
productivity and wage

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.380
movements at the national level,
at the organizational level,

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.960
even at the individual level.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.660
So take a look.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.560
Keep that great
discussion going.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.870
And let's see what
we can do to apply

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.190
this concept appropriately
in the economy today

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.750
and in the jobs of the future.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.600
And finally, there are going
to be some new ideas raised

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.040
by our MBA TAs as
they contribute

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.800
from their own
knowledge and experience

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.870
base from around the
world, and from some

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.710
of our special
experts that we will

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.880
introduce into the
course on topics

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.230
as we go forward this week.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.370
So have a good time.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.590
Engage the materials.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.890
And let's keep a good
conversation going.

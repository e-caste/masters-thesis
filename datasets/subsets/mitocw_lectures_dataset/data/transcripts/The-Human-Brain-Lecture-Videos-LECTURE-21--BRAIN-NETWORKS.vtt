00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.580
NANCY KANWISHER: Before we
get on to the topic for today,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.940
I felt like last Monday's
lecture was not my best.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.780
I don't know why.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.363
It's not that I
didn't put time on it.

00:00:19.363 --> 00:00:22.733
I looked and I had the wrong
lecture numbers on slides.

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.900
There was all kind of chaos.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.710
I'm sorry about that.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.252
Sometimes you put
in a lot of effort,

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:28.670
and you still give a lecture
that isn't all that clear.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.620
So let me try to tell you what
I thought were the main points.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.730
I started off by saying why it's
really fundamentally important

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.280
to be able to understand
not just what people look

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.820
like from the outside, but what
we really care about people is

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.880
what's going on the inside
about their thoughts

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.660
and their beliefs.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.460
And we are constantly
making inferences

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.570
about what people know, and
believe, and want, and think.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.940
And we do that all
the time to understand

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.710
why they're doing
something and to predict

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.680
what they'll do next.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.530
And so it's
fundamentally important.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.570
It's the essence of being
a human being in many ways.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.180
It's the essence of literature.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.810
And we do it all the time.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.410
And a classic way that people
have studied false beliefs is--

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.590
or thinking about other
people's thoughts is with

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.060
the false-belief task--

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.310
the Sally-Anne task
that I described.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.590
And the reason people
use the false-belief task

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.810
rather than just a belief task
is if the beliefs are true,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.200
you can answer what somebody
will do based on the world,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.770
not based on their mind.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.125
And so to unconfound the
two, we use a false belief

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:30.000
that's different than
the state of the world.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390
So we can be sure
we're asking people

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.750
what will happen next based
on what that person believes.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.850
And through decades of use of
the Sally-Anne false-belief

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.330
task and variations
of it, it's clear

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.820
that there's a very
distinctive developmental time

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.520
course and ability to
solve this problem.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.170
Five-year-olds
solve it no problem.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.170
Three-year-olds
systematically fail.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.610
And people with
autism typically get--

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.550
pass this task
late or not at all.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.650
High-functioning
people with autism

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.930
pass the task, just
later, like 7, 8, 9 years,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.270
not five years old.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.020
OK?

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.840
So that's the kind of
behavioral background evidence

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.300
that there's something
distinctive about thinking

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.123
about other people's minds.

00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:17.540
Then we considered
whether there's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.550
special brain mechanisms.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.990
And I argued that,
yes, there are.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.990
There's a bunch of them.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.980
But the most impressively
selective one

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.585
is the TBJ shown up there.

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:29.210
And the evidence that
it's specifically

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.490
involved in thinking about
other people's thoughts

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.560
comes from the fact
that that activation

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.320
is a greater activation
when you think about--

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.360
when you solve the
false-belief type problems,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.700
when you think about
another person's thoughts

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.010
compared to when you think
about a representation,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.730
a physical representation,
like a photograph or a map, OK?

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.420
So those are logically
isomorphic problems.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.550
We have to always
answer a question

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.180
about a representation.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.420
It's just the representation
is in somebody's head

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.800
or it's a physical
representation in the world.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.270
And in that difference, you get
that region of the brain, OK?

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.637
So that's cool because it's
a very nicely designed--

00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:09.470
it's not quite a--
nothing's a minimal pair,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.470
but it's a minimal pair
in some respects, right?

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.670
It carves out whether
the representation

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.840
is mental or physical, but
it doesn't solve everything.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.730
And a suite of other
tasks have shown

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.980
that that region is actually
specific in a whole bunch

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.240
of other respects.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.150
It doesn't respond just whenever
you think about a person.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.800
There are external properties.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.660
And most impressively,
it does not even

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.480
respond when you think
about their visceral body

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.550
sensations, like thirst,
and hunger, and pain.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.480
So the TBJ doesn't
respond to just thinking

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.830
about any mental states
of another person.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.330
It's specifically thinking about
their thoughts and beliefs.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.520
And that's pretty damn
remarkable, right?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.590
It's, how abstract can you get?

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.390
And yet, here's a
specific brain region

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.057
for that very abstract,
very specific thing.

00:03:54.057 --> 00:03:55.640
And the final little
bit of evidence I

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.143
showed you is that
it also generalizes.

00:03:58.143 --> 00:03:59.810
It's not just about
language because you

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.860
can show people movies
that have no words in them

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.770
but that clearly show
characters who must be thinking

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.937
about each other's thoughts.

00:04:07.937 --> 00:04:10.145
And in those moments when
the characters are thinking

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:11.840
about each other's
thoughts, that region

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.920
turns on, more, for example,
than when they're thinking

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.980
about each other's pain, OK?

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.850
Yeah.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.160
AUDIENCE: Did somebody
look at what happens

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.440
if other people think about me?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.240
Or if I think they
thinking about me?

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:30.020
NANCY KANWISHER:
You mean if you're

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.390
thinking about other
people thinking about you?

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.440
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, I would
assume that that region would

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.412
be engaged.

00:04:37.412 --> 00:04:38.870
I'm sure there are
studies on that.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.660
Because you're thinking
about their thoughts, right?

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.980
AUDIENCE: But more?

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.130
Is it more interesting?

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.922
NANCY KANWISHER: Probably
just because it's

00:04:45.922 --> 00:04:46.950
more salient, right?

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.920
I actually, oddly,
in this class,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.610
I talk about
attention at the end,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.180
which is weird because attention
is an issue with every study.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.630
But most of the brain
regions we've talked about,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.720
surely, including this one,
are modulable by how strongly

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.380
you're attending to something.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.440
So if something's really
salient, or important,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.320
or you're really paying
a lot of attention to it,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.820
you're going to get
more activation.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.362
And if it's more
interesting to think

00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:11.210
about what other
people think about me

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.150
than to think about what other
people think about each other,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.510
you'll find some modulation
in here, I'm sure.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.720
OK, and then finally, I
talked about moral reasoning

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.830
as a test case.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.230
It's not that the
TPJ is selectively

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.790
involved in moral reasoning.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.390
It's that many of the critical
aspects of moral reasoning

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.490
depend on what a person
knew at the time.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.450
And so to use that information
in moral reasoning,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.100
you need to pull that region in.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.860
So I realized I wrote
that question ambiguously

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.470
on the quiz.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.530
I meant to ask, is the TPJ
engaged specifically or only

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.280
in moral reasoning,
to which they answer--

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.498
the correct answer would be no.

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:51.040
But I didn't put
the "only" in there.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.190
And I decided it was ambiguous,
so if you said "yes,"

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.982
you got the points.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.630
Anyway, I gave several
bits of evidence that,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.687
using the moral-reasoning
case, that the TPJ is--

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.930
it's stronger
evidence it's involved

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.680
in thinking about other
people's thoughts,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.658
first, that we showed
that people with autism

00:06:14.658 --> 00:06:16.200
will have this
difficulty in thinking

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.520
about each other's thoughts.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.010
Even once they can pass
the false-belief task,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.850
they put less emphasis, less
weight on what the person knew

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.900
at the time when evaluating the
moral status of their actions,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.470
OK?

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.122
It's not that they
make a mistake

00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:31.830
or that they're unable
to morally reason.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.120
It's a pretty subtle thing.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.430
It's just a small
difference in how much

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.710
they weigh what another
person knew at the time, OK?

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.040
That's also known as less
forgiveness or less exoneration

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.290
for accidental harm, right?

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.260
You kick somebody by
accident, and they go ouch,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.970
well, maybe you get
a little bit of blame

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.350
because you were a
klutz and you should

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.433
have thought or something.

00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:55.800
But it was an accident, so
you should be exonerated.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.700
People with autism exonerate
slightly less, right?

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.200
OK.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.290
So we then talked about
the fact that if you

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.980
zap the TBJ with TMS,
stick a coil there,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.120
you do the same thing.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.490
You slightly reduce
the weight people

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.370
put on what the person
knew at the time

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.830
in their moral evaluation
of the person's actions.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.350
And then I showed
this bizarre fact

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.500
that, as I think
Gisella asked, well,

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.410
shouldn't the TBJ be different
in people with autism?

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.140
Yes, absolutely, according
to all of this, it should be.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.180
But the basic univariate
measures-- how big it is,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.210
how selective it
is, where it is--

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.430
do not find a difference
in that region

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.590
with that contrast in
high-functioning people

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.400
with autism.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.350
That's surprising.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.410
But one possible answer to
that is even though it's there

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.097
and it's just as big and
strong and all of that, it's--

00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:52.680
that doesn't mean
it doesn't represent

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.790
different information.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.450
And I showed you an example
that in typical people,

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.440
you can decode from the TPJ
whether the person is reading

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.860
about another person's
intentional harm or accidental

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.790
harm.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.530
And you can't in
people with ASD.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.030
OK?

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.210
So that's my summary
of last time.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.640
And then all of that was
focusing very particularly

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.120
on the most fancy,
quintessentially human aspect

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.730
of social cognition, which is
this business of representing

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.440
each other's
thoughts and beliefs.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.100
But I pointed out at the
end that there are also

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.680
lots and lots of other
facets of social perception

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.660
and social cognition,
many of which

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.179
have somewhat selective
brain regions, lots of them

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.429
other parts of the brain,
and we just didn't have time

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.909
to filtrate in to that, OK?

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.440
Hopefully that was a little bit
clearer than I was last time.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.810
OK, so, so far, in
this course, we've

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.850
been focusing on all
these bits of brain

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.610
that seem to do very
distinctive, often

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.453
very selective things, OK?

00:08:51.453 --> 00:08:53.120
So the one we've just
been talking about

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.130
is that little guy right there.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.720
But we've talked about a
lot of these things in here.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.650
And the field of
human-cognitive neuroscience

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.290
has invested lots of
effort to find these things

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.110
and try to characterize
what each of them does.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.730
And that's pretty cool, right?

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.370
This is all stuff we didn't know
20 years ago, and it's nice,

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.940
and it counts as real
progress, I think.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:19.640
But it leaves lots of
things woefully unanswered.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.800
None of these regions
can act alone,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.790
even though I've depicted them
in a somewhat silly fashion,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.150
as nice little
M&Ms on the brain.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.560
None of them act alone.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.190
None of them could act alone.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.650
They need information
to process,

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.710
so there has to be
input to each region.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.210
They need to be able to tell
other regions what they figured

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.860
out or there's no point.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.230
And probably, as
they solve a problem,

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.060
as they conduct
their computations,

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.800
they're probably
interacting all the time

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.550
with lots of other regions.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.630
So we desperately need
to understand not just

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.903
that this patch does faces.

00:09:52.903 --> 00:09:54.320
There's lots more
we need to know.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.153
And one of the things
we really need to know

00:09:56.153 --> 00:09:59.840
is, what is it connected to,
and who is it interacting with?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.130
OK?

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.635
OK.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:03.760
So that's what I just said.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.780
And so that means
looking at not just

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.580
the cortex that
we've been focusing

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.450
on through this whole course,
this dark matter that's

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.030
on the surface of
the brain up there.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.072
But today, we're going to
do a figure-ground flip

00:10:16.072 --> 00:10:18.363
on the brain, and we're going
to start paying attention

00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:20.990
to all that stuff that used
to be background down there,

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.180
all that white matter
underneath, which

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.300
is like a big heap
of myelinated fibers

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.770
that connect long-range regions
of the brain to each other, OK?

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.930
So you might say,
OK, just wires--

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.430
who cares about the wires?

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.290
That was my attitude
for a long time.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.940
I've gotten over it.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.860
We desperately need to
know about the wires

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.053
for all kinds of reasons.

00:10:41.053 --> 00:10:43.220
So I'm going to go through
a whole bunch of reasons.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.630
And there's a lot
of little details,

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.880
and I don't want you to panic.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.500
I just want to give you the
gist of why this is worth

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.000
paying attention to.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.330
OK, so first of
all, white matter

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.860
makes up 45% of the human brain.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.700
So that alone tells you it's
not like some trivial thing.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.770
It's a big part of your brain.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.400
This is all the more
interesting because that's not

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.730
true in other animals.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.570
So I think white matter
makes up a higher

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.910
percent of the human brain
than any other animal,

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.470
or at least we're way up there.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.570
In mice, it's only 10%.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.090
And maybe that's a relatively
uninteresting thing

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.160
about scaling with brain
size, but maybe it's

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.130
something deeper about
human brain-- what's

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.770
special about the human
brain and nobody knows.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.010
And here's a fun fact.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.520
If you took all the myelinated
fibers in the human brain

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.260
and you laid them
out end to end,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.220
you could go around
the world three times.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.820
So we've got lots of
cableage sitting in here.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.900
OK.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.520
So I briefly argued before that
you simply cannot understand

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.660
the cortex without understanding
its connections of one region

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.360
to another.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.560
It's just crazy to study one
little patch of the brain

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.960
and not know who it's
talking to and where

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.700
it gets its inputs from.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.350
And as I just said, the
pressing need for that knowledge

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.660
is heightened by the
presence of this map, which

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.620
we didn't use to have.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.750
Now that we have this
map, it's all the more

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.090
important and pressing to
know what the connections

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.010
of those regions are.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:09.880
OK.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.130
So here's a nice quote
making this point.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.890
This is Heidi Johansen-Berg
and Matt Rushworth.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.840
They say, "Connectivity patterns
define functional networks.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.480
The inputs to a brain region
determine the information

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.170
available to it, whereas its
outputs dictate the influence

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.810
that brain region can
can have on other areas.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.720
Therefore, simply by knowing the
pattern of inputs and outputs

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.690
of a brain region, we can
begin to make inferences

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.088
about its likely
functional specialization."

00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:38.380
So I think that's a nice quote.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.808
It makes the point that
it's not just that we

00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:42.850
need to know the connections,
but the connections

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.640
and the function are bound
to be deeply enmeshed.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.470
One constrains the other.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.760
Yeah?

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.320
OK.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.040
Further, recall way
back, which will quite

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.590
possibly return on
the final exam--

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.390
how do we define
a cortical area?

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.770
I gave you criteria
for a cortical area.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.430
And one of the criteria
was a distinctive pattern

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.810
of connectivity, right?

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:10.310
So it's part of the identifying
properties of a cortical area

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.640
is what it's connected to.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.295
And so that's another
reason we should care.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.190
A third reason is if we knew
of a given cortical area what

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.280
its long-range connections
were to lots of other regions,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.680
that connectivity
fingerprint-- remember

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.960
we talked briefly about
connectivity fingerprints

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.520
a month or so ago?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.890
That fingerprint,
the distinctive set

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.570
of connections of that region--

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.400
you can think of
it as a signature

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.320
of not just how
that region differs

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.260
from other regions in
that same individual brain

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.460
but how we might find a
homolog of that region

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.910
in another species.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.400
And that would be a very
interesting thing to do.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.040
Wouldn't it be cool to know,
is there a TPJ in macaques?

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.140
Well, macaques can't
solve an analog

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.110
of the theory-of-mind task.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.730
Chimps-- we could
debate a little bit.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.950
And narrow domains-- kind
of sort of, a little bit,

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.030
not really.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.210
Macaques-- no, OK?

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.310
So is there a homolog?

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:18.167
Is there a corresponding
region that-- maybe we

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:20.000
took that region, and
we adapted it and made

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.990
it work better so we could
do better things with it?

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.080
And if so, what is it
doing in macaques, right?

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.247
I mean, I think that's just
a totally cool question.

00:14:26.247 --> 00:14:28.940
And in principle,
one way to say what

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.643
counts as "the same region"
across species, which

00:14:31.643 --> 00:14:32.810
is kind of a weird question.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:33.920
They're different
species, so what

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.420
would "the same region" mean?

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.460
One way to say what
the same region means

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.938
is to have a similar
connectivity fingerprint, OK?

00:14:40.938 --> 00:14:42.980
So there are several
studies that try to do that.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.900
I couldn't cram them
into this lecture,

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.210
but if you're interested
in reading on it-- reading

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.750
about it, shoot me an email.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.645
I'll send you some papers.

00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:52.145
OK.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.590
I also mentioned that the
specific set of connections

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.680
of a cortical region,
particularly its inputs,

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.050
play an important
role in development.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.790
Remember the rewired ferrets?

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.100
If you redirect
the input to what

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.190
would have been primary
auditory cortex in a ferret

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.610
and you have that input
come in from the eyes,

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.550
you can get what would have
been primary auditory cortex

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.980
to become a lot like
primary visual cortex.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.100
So connectivity is
important, not just

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.620
in how a region
functions and how

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.720
we say what counts is
the same across species

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.760
but is probably also
crucially important

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.760
in the development
of regions, OK?

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.730
I also showed you evidence that
the visual word-form area--

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.290
we can pick out
exactly where it's

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.180
going to land in
an individual brain

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.670
by the connectivity
fingerprint of that region

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.820
before kids learn to read,
further evidence that

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.260
connectivity determines
later function.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:47.920
OK.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.870
As if this is not
enough, other reasons

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.660
to care about white
matter is that disruptions

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.950
of white matter are at the root
of many clinical disorders--

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.330
dyslexia, autism, developmental
prosopagnosia, amusia,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.830
all of these things and
others, for all of them,

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.250
disruptions in long-range
white-matter connections

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.240
have been implicated as possibly
playing an important role

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:18.820
in the etiology of that disease.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.360
Aging-- most definitely
decline in white matter

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.480
is prominent in aging.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.080
Sorry to say, there's a 10%
decrease in white-matter fibers

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.390
per decade starting at age 20.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:35.140
Use yours now while
you have them.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.520
Let's change the topic.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.200
OK.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.050
There's a lot of talk about how
white-matter connections may

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.710
change with experience, and
learning, and plasticity.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.010
And that's a pretty
patchy literature.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.100
And it's not a very
impressive literature.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.740
The classic thing you
probably learned in 9.00,

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.290
that when you juggle, you
get changes in white-matter

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:00.370
connections from
juggling expertise.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:00.910
Maybe.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:01.420
Maybe not.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.440
There's some problems with
a lot of that literature.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.619
So it's an interesting
question, but it's not clear

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:08.770
what the strong answers are.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.650
And finally, I don't know
about circuit design.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.950
Probably some of you do.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.440
But I gather that
people who think

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.849
a lot about circuit design--

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.550
one of the key features you
need to take into account

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.900
is wiring length.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.810
You want to keep wiring
length short, right?

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.099
You have conduction delays.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:24.940
You have heating.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.950
You have space taken
up in circuits.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.680
All of those things are
bad in circuit design,

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.930
and they're bad in
brain design too.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.280
So a lot of reason to think that
a major factor in the design

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.190
of brains, especially
human brains,

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.640
is minimizing wiring length
because wiring length

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.800
is very expensive metabolically.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.530
You've got to
maintain ion gradients

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.170
across cell membranes.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.660
It's expensive developmentally.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.710
These damn things need to
figure out where to go,

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.377
and if they don't go
to the right place,

00:17:56.377 --> 00:17:59.150
you have a
developmental disorder.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.830
And so it's probably
a real constraint

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.480
on designs of brains.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.970
OK, so that was a
whirlwind-- lots

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.840
of reasons to care about
white matter and connectivity.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.030
Oh, plus, at least
in animal research,

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.220
there's a whole suite
of amazing new methods

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.397
for looking at connectivity
in animal brains.

00:18:19.397 --> 00:18:20.980
And [INAUDIBLE] can
tell us more about

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.403
that than I could
because she's working

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:25.570
in a lab that's right at
the forefront of developing

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.268
those methods.

00:18:26.268 --> 00:18:28.060
Someday, we're going
to apply those methods

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:28.870
to a human brain--

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.960
I can't wait-- and get
the whole wiring diagram.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.590
OK.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.670
Anyway, so what do we know
about the connectivity

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.900
of these regions?

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.560
Well, you may be thinking, don't
we already know all this stuff?

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.005
After all, I showed you
this diagram way back.

00:18:45.005 --> 00:18:46.880
And you've probably seen
it every damn course

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.070
you take in this department.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.590
It's in most textbooks
in the field--

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.033
the whole wiring diagram
of the visual system.

00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:55.700
So don't we already
know all this stuff?

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.870
So what's the big deal?

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.640
Well, here's the big deal.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.370
That's a macaque brain.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.880
And in macaque brain, you
can get the actual answer

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.310
to what is the actual
structural connectivity

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:11.095
of this patch of cortex
to that patch of cortex.

00:19:11.095 --> 00:19:12.470
There's a whole
bunch of methods,

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.470
but traditionally, you
inject some dye here

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.510
that's uptaken by
neurons that travels

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.520
along axons that goes here.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.410
You kill the animal,
slice up the brain,

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.240
and find that tracer over here.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.910
And then those two things
are absolutely connected.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.440
That's the gold standard.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.950
And that's the basis of most
of those studies, that method

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.340
and variations thereof.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.180
But we can't do that
in human brains.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.760
And so we do not have
anything like this information

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.570
in human brains.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.200
Yes, David.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.910
AUDIENCE: When was this done?

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.702
NANCY KANWISHER: Oh,
that is a compilation.

00:19:43.702 --> 00:19:46.140
This was published,
in, I think, 1991.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.765
But that was a compilation
of heaps of studies that

00:19:48.765 --> 00:19:49.890
have been done before that.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.348
It was a big review
article looking

00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:55.855
at all of this literature, where
lots of classic neuroanatomy

00:19:55.855 --> 00:19:57.480
people would do these
things where they

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.760
would inject tracers,
and slice up brains,

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.840
and look in other places.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.480
And it was just a vast
amount of literature

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.315
that did that for many decades.

00:20:05.315 --> 00:20:06.690
It's sort of fallen
out of favor,

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.940
even though these
things are, at least--

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.850
I don't know-- these are
really crucial questions.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.830
Now people use other
methods to do that.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.350
You can use all kinds of
optogenetic and other methods

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.360
to map connectivity in animals.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.020
Yeah.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.582
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:22.680
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.660
NANCY KANWISHER: In here?

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.760
Oh, that's a good question.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.220
Oh, it's probably dorsal
and ventral pathways.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.390
Let me see here.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.650
Yeah.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.570
Yeah, the red ones--

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.930
this is another thing I didn't
even really mention, probably

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.430
let alone give a
short [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.060
That was lame.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.060
But anyway, the visual-- high
levels of the visual system--

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.800
we focused on the
ventral visual pathway

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.675
coming down the bottom
of the temporal lobe.

00:20:45.675 --> 00:20:47.550
But there's a whole
other visual pathway that

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.870
goes up into the parietal lobe.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.360
Did I talk about that a little
bit-- reaching and grasping?

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.290
No, I didn't.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.690
Lame, lame, lame, lame.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.410
Anyway, a major part of
the field I didn't get to.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.660
Anyway, it's a whole other
part of the visual system

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.770
that seems to be more involved
in visually guided action.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.053
And they're actually
very interconnected,

00:21:08.053 --> 00:21:10.470
but they're trying to emphasize
that the dorsal pathway is

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:14.230
at least somewhat
separable in monkeys.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.240
But my point is this
is monkeys where

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.740
they have the
gold-standard methods,

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.850
and they can actually discover
the real connectivity.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.420
Sadly, we can't do
those things in humans.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.020
And in humans, we have only
three methods, and none of them

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.010
are very good.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.170
So we'll talk about them
today anyway because this

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.960
is such an important
question, but the bottom line

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.000
is-- this drives
me out of my mind--

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.730
we basically don't know
the connectivity of any

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.450
of those regions for
sure in human brains.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.940
And somebody's
got to solve that.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.400
Maybe one of you will
go invent a method that

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.640
works in humans that helps us
solve that problem because it's

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.305
actually, I think, really
paralyzing to our field.

00:21:55.305 --> 00:21:57.430
So I'll tell you what we
do know, which isn't much.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.160
But, you know, beggars
can't be choosers.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.480
OK, the first method has
been around for a few years,

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.830
and that's gross dissection.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:10.460
And I mean gross, like
that kind of gross--

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.820
so only good for
post-mortem brains,

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.390
but it's really quite amazing.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:19.030
This is a bottom view of
the brain back and front.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.500
This is actually a
physically dissected brain.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.090
Like, it takes a real
serious neuroanatomist

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.620
and lots of fancy methods--

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.120
I mean, not fancy
methods but lots

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.170
of careful, precise teasing
apart of bits of brain.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.530
And you can actually see these
big fibers coming up here.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.200
So if this is the
back of the brain

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.790
and we're looking
up like this, what

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:43.510
do you think those fibers
are connecting right there?

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:48.280
Big fiber bundle coming
from deep down in the brain

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.980
up to right in there.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.440
AUDIENCE: Is that
thalamus to [INAUDIBLE]??

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.400
NANCY KANWISHER: Bingo.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.600
Exactly.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.820
OK, so that's the
LGN right there.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.620
And this is called
the optic radiation.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.550
It's this huge cable
of fibers that come up.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.290
OK, first, here's
the optic tract.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:06.220
Actually, I forget.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.720
That's not-- I think this
is the optic tract that's

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.710
been snipped there.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.890
Then it comes up in here,
makes a stop in the LGN,

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.990
and then this big
batch of fibers

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:18.100
comes up right there to
primary visual cortex, OK?

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.150
Everybody got that?

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.130
OK, so you can actually see
it in dissecting a dead brain.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.380
OK, that's pretty cool.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.820
But what if we don't want
to wait for people to die?

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.160
Often, we want to ask
questions about a person right

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.510
now in their brain.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.860
Do they have this disorder?

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.500
Are they at risk
of that disorder?

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.450
What is their connectivity?

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.490
So for that, we
have two methods,

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.500
and I'll talk about
these two methods

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.740
in the rest of the lecture.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.170
The first one is
diffusion imaging.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.440
OK, so I talked about
this briefly before.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.260
But let me remind you of what
the basic principles are.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:59.140
So here is a picture of the
optic nerve with a bunch

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.850
of axons oriented like that.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.920
It's a big cable
with a whole bunch

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.550
of little fibers in there.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.020
And the basic kind
of biophysics is

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:13.180
that water wants to diffuse more
along this length, following

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.130
the orientation of
the fibers, than it

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.100
wants to diffuse this way, OK?

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.980
And diffusion imaging-- I'm not
explaining any of the physics,

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.070
but just take it for my word
that what diffusion imaging

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.760
does is give you a picture
of the direction of water

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.100
diffusion, OK?

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.100
So you get a picture
of a piece of brain,

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.670
and it'll show you, for
example, that right in there,

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.660
all the fibers--

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.970
well, the water is
diffusing this way.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.960
And over here, the water's
diffusing that way, OK?

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.560
And that's just what you see
in a diffusion image, OK?

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.230
And so the inference
people make is

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.780
if you have all those
parallel lines telling you

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.280
there's lots of
diffusion like this,

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.670
there's probably a big fiber
bundle going like that--

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:58.600
and there is.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.710
That would be the
corpus callosum.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.210
OK?

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.470
All right.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:09.760
So this method works great for
finding the big fiber bundles.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.260
OK?

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.810
I'm going to dis diffusion
imaging in a bunch of ways,

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.420
but it is great for
finding the big fiber

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.700
bundles because in
those big fiber bundles,

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.440
axons are very parallel.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.230
There's a whole bunch of them,
and you can really see it.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.010
OK.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.540
And so people have
been using this

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.380
for over a decade to find
some of the major fiber

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.830
bundles in the brain.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.720
So you may have heard of
the arcuate fasciculus that

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.960
basically connects language
regions in the temporal lobe

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.040
up to Broca's area in
the frontal lobe, OK?

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.750
It's a big bunch
of fibers that go--

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.690
I guess in me, they go
like this, boom, right?

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.840
[INAUDIBLE] And you can
see those guys with-- this

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.330
is a distant reconstruction,
but you can see

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.400
those with diffusion imaging.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.637
Another one, the goes from the
front of the temporal lobe up

00:25:57.637 --> 00:25:58.470
to the frontal lobe.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:59.680
You don't need to
memorize these.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.400
I don't care about that.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.580
I just want you to get the
idea of what you can see.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.270
Yeah, question?

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.250
AUDIENCE: So these are
discoverable without the person

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.730
having to do
anything [INAUDIBLE]??

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:07.260
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:07.860
Yes.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.730
These are anatomical images.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.820
So in diffusion imaging,
you don't do anything.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.740
You can sleep, actually.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.740
That's ideal because
it's long and boring.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.540
Actually, it's not
boring, but the scanner

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.570
shakes like hell in a
diffusion-imaging scan.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.730
It's pretty wild.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.380
We could charge
admission for it.

00:26:30.078 --> 00:26:30.620
I don't know.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.910
I find it quite wild.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.040
Anyway, this is the inferior
longitudinal fasciculus.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.240
As it goes down
the temporal lobe.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.390
So when we talk about the
ventral-visual pathway--

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.710
face areas, place
areas, all that stuff--

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.550
this is the big fiber
highway that sits right

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.220
on top of that whole
chunk of gray matter

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.630
that does all the processing.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.030
And it's a big pile of
fibers that go straight

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.950
down the temporal lobe, OK?

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.810
OK.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.690
And so here's more recent data.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:07.340
This is from Anastasia Yendiki
over at MHG Charlestown

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:07.840
over there.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.450
And she's developed this
lovely piece of software

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.660
that enables you to take
diffusion images and identify,

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.640
based on an atlas
she's put together,

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.780
18 of the major fiber
tracts in the human brain--

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.297
so nine per hemisphere.

00:27:21.297 --> 00:27:23.380
And this is just showing
you some of the big ones.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.600
This is the inferior
longitudinal fasciculus

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.250
I just showed you and so forth.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.540
Yeah.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.490
AUDIENCE: So how does
this compare to just

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.160
a postmortem dissection?

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.300
Could you see the--

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.450
NANCY KANWISHER:
It's a good question.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:36.110
It's a good question.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.090
I don't exactly know.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.065
It wouldn't be easy.

00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:42.250
That thing I showed
you works because you

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.540
take the stuff off
the top, and it's just

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.710
kind of sitting there.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.380
But then you would have taken
a lot of other stuff out,

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.547
and you wouldn't be able
to see that other stuff you

00:27:49.547 --> 00:27:50.410
had to take out.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.285
You know what I mean?

00:27:51.285 --> 00:27:54.827
So here, you can surf through
and pick out any of these.

00:27:54.827 --> 00:27:56.410
So it's definitely
going to be better.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:00.760
But which of these you can
see with postmortem dissection

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.160
I'm not sure-- some of them,
some of the bigger ones

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.805
but probably not all of them.

00:28:06.805 --> 00:28:09.820
OK, so here are some
of the major tracts.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.500
OK.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.720
But you can do a little bit
more than just find them

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.890
with diffusion imaging.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.050
You can also characterize
them a little bit.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.640
And this is a whole universe.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.140
There's people who
spend their lives

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.610
with all kinds of
fancy measures,

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.730
and I'm just going to tell
you about the most common one.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.180
So recall that the whole
deal with diffusion imaging

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.750
is it's looking for orientations
of maximum water diffusion.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.830
So some parts of the brain
have a systematic set

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.570
of directions of
water diffusion,

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.760
and other ones don't, right?

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.130
Inside a ventricle, the
water can go any which way.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.690
There's nothing determining
which way it goes.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.950
So this is called
isotropic because you

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.350
have diffusion going equally--

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.120
in equal amounts in all
directions and anisotropic,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.620
right?

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.740
So it goes systematically
more in one direction,

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.750
one axis than others, OK?

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.810
Diffusion can't see the axial
direction, like left or right

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:02.950
versus to left.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.750
It can just see
that this axis is

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.640
more prominent than this one,
or this one, or this one, OK?

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.530
So you're not actually seeing it
move in a systematic direction.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.930
OK, so that's the basic signal.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.800
So what you can do is in
a little patch of brain,

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.130
you can ask not
just, what direction

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.380
has maximum diffusion,
which is what

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.120
I've been talking about so far.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.140
You can say, how much more does
it go in that maximum direction

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.430
than any of the others?

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.530
Is it more like this
or more like that?

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.410
And you can imagine a
whole spectrum in-between.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.660
OK, so you're just asking,
how oriented is it?

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.560
Is it totally oriented
or just partially?

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:49.097
And that measure is called
Fractional Anisotropy, or FA.

00:29:49.097 --> 00:29:51.180
It's prominent enough in
the field you should just

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.110
learn this phrase.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.913
And you read any
articles, especially

00:29:53.913 --> 00:29:55.830
any clinical articles,
this is the first thing

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:59.730
you'll see in any
clinical papers that

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.740
use diffusion imaging.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.320
OK, and so fractional
anisotropy-- there's

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.730
a bunch of fancy definitions.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:06.520
And we don't care.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.250
We just want the idea.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:11.840
It's just, to what degree is
that little patch of brain

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.590
in this little part
of a tract that you've

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:18.570
identified more like this
or more like that, OK?

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.400
Is it anisotropic or isotropic?

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.080
OK?

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.600
And so this has been
used a lot to try

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.220
to ask about the nature of fiber
tracts in different groups--

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.480
young versus old,
different clinical groups,

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.900
autism versus typical,
schizophrenia, you name it.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.270
Experience-- you train
people up on a task--

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.540
do you change the FA, the
Fractional Anisotropy,

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.710
of some particular tract.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:46.210
OK?

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.550
So it's just a
characteristic of tract

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.580
is, how oriented is
it along the way?

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.550
Is it super clean,
totally oriented?

00:30:54.550 --> 00:31:00.730
Or does it have some
isotropy mixed in?

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.243
OK?

00:31:01.243 --> 00:31:03.160
All right, so this is
all over the literature.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.090
Let me give you one cool
example from Gabrielli lab

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.840
that came out recently.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.360
So they identified the arcuate
fasciculus that I showed you

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.880
before, going from the--
basically, Wernicke's

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.890
area curving around
up to Broca's area

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:20.580
up there so that you can
identify it anatomically

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.770
in each subject
individually, OK?

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:23.610
Now you've got it.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.650
You've identified
which voxels are

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.930
part of the arcuate fasciculus.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.490
And then what they want to ask--

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.880
what they wanted to ask
is, is the integrity,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.340
or the characteristics of
the arcuate fasciculus--

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:40.560
is that important for
language-- for dyslexia?

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.920
So they measured the
FA along this tract.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.170
How oriented is it all
the way along here?

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.940
And then you get
some kind of average.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.770
And they measured that
in a bunch of kids

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.760
with dyslexia and in a bunch of
kids with no reading disability

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.470
who are matched in
other dimensions

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:59.420
of non-verbal
cognitive ability, OK?

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.000
And what they found is
the fractional anisotropy

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.940
was higher in the typical
kids than the kids

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.090
with reading disability,
with dyslexia, OK?

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.990
And from that, they implicated
that this connection

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.690
may play some role in dyslexia.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.190
OK?

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.602
It's not totally
obvious because one

00:32:18.602 --> 00:32:20.810
would think this region is
connected to that region--

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.030
those are languagey
regions, right?

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.830
It's not visual regions.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.530
You think of dyslexia as a
problem seeing the letters

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.210
and which ones are
oriented which way.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.680
And this suggests
that, at least,

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.710
higher-level connectivity
between language regions

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.570
may be implicated, OK?

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:36.685
Yeah.

00:32:36.685 --> 00:32:38.810
AUDIENCE: So this just
talks about the architecture

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:41.760
and not the per unit
information being [INAUDIBLE]??

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.010
NANCY KANWISHER: That's right.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.300
AUDIENCE: There's no
information [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.550
NANCY KANWISHER: That's right.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.810
It's just saying,
where are the wires,

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.820
and how organized are the wires?

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.930
Period.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:51.750
Yeah.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.595
AUDIENCE: So they won't
flow through some technique

00:32:54.595 --> 00:32:57.500
as-- if I can mess
with it, like I'm

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.330
measuring it, if
there's some means

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.310
to miss the
[INAUDIBLE] diffusion,

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.002
will that have any effect?

00:33:03.002 --> 00:33:04.710
NANCY KANWISHER: I
didn't quite get that.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:05.600
Say it again.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.318
AUDIENCE: So there's
this water diffusion

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.110
that's happening that
I'm going to measure.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:13.370
But what if I have some
way to intervene and change

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.703
the rate of diffusion some such?

00:33:14.703 --> 00:33:16.703
NANCY KANWISHER: I don't
know how you'd do that.

00:33:16.703 --> 00:33:18.740
I mean, it's a pretty
basic physical property--

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.130
diffusion of water and how it's
constrained by lipids, right?

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.180
AUDIENCE: But that
shouldn't affect,

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.220
like the function of
information flow [INAUDIBLE]??

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.070
NANCY KANWISHER: Ooh.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.720
I have no idea.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.480
I mean, that's a biophysical
question I don't know about.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.690
But notice, this is a
pretty distant proxy.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.660
You're mostly looking at
water between axons, not even

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.900
within them.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.010
And so it's just a proxy
for, how well can we

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.670
see those fibers and how
they're oriented, OK?

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.850
Yeah, it's pretty removed
from actual signals

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.460
going along the wires.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.585
Anyway, so everybody get
the sense that-- you know,

00:33:56.585 --> 00:33:57.740
it's one little finding.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:03.680
But it implicates something
about that tract in dyslexia.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.440
OK, so that's interesting.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.457
But first, it's
just correlational.

00:34:08.457 --> 00:34:10.040
Lots of things are
just correlational.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.290
Most of the stuff in this
class is just correlational.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.480
Same is true here.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.010
But a little more
seriously, it's

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.350
not totally clear what
fractional anisotropy means,

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:19.850
OK?

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.120
So there's a real
tradition of treating

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.540
high-fractional anisotropy
as if that's good.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.429
After all, we're
in a fiber bundle.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:30.949
Shouldn't all the axons
be oriented nicely

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:32.389
in there and not all scrambled?

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:36.260
Surely, oriented is good,
and scrambled is bad.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.443
Well, maybe, but sometimes,
fibers cross a fiber bundle.

00:34:40.443 --> 00:34:42.860
So you can have a fiber bundle
like this with other fibers

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.920
crossing it.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.250
And so when that happens,
maybe that's good.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.420
And so people use FA as
a proxy for good fiber.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.000
People say "fiber
integrity" even.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.048
But there's a whole question
about what exactly it means.

00:34:56.048 --> 00:34:57.590
People will spend
their lives looking

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.290
at the biophysics of fibers
and all the different things

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.770
that fractional anisotropy and
the other measures might mean.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:08.030
And it's actually pretty
complicated and unresolved.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.850
Another challenge with
fractional anisotropy

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:14.540
is it's extremely
vulnerable to artifacts.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.150
All of diffusion
imaging is extremely

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.370
vulnerable to artifacts, OK?

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.860
And I'm going to give you
an example of a study we

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.240
did a few years ago.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.760
So I was, for a while,
trying to work on autism.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.010
I've, more or less,
given up because it's, as

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.810
far as I can tell, impossible.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.480
But back while I
was still trying,

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.660
we scanned a whole bunch of
kids with and without autism

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.150
with diffusion imaging, OK?

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:41.480
And at the time, there were
about 50 published papers,

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.650
almost all of which said one of
the things you find with autism

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.570
is that there's an
underdevelopment

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.360
of long-range connectivity
and an overdevelopment

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.040
of short-range connectivity.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.980
And so then people
would free associate

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.630
with all kinds of
speculations about,

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.750
OK, this explains aspects
of the autism phenotype.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.533
They can't put
different ideas together

00:36:01.533 --> 00:36:03.950
because their connections
across the brain aren't as good.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.020
And they're obsessed
with little details

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.680
because they have too many local
connections and all kinds of--

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.870
suggestive, but very, very
fuzzy ideas like that.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:17.720
So 50 papers pretty much all
found underdeveloped lower

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.810
fractional anisotropy and
long-range connections,

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:25.480
long-range tracts in autism,
a very established finding

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.150
So we went in not to
raise hell but just

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.800
to kind of replicate
some of those

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.560
basic findings while
studying some other things.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.040
And, in fact, when we did
what everyone else does--

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.530
that is standard analysis--

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.170
you collect your
diffusion-imaging data,

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.660
and you eyeball it
loosely, and if it really

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.640
looks terribly
tainted with artifact,

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.790
you throw that subject out.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.870
And, otherwise, you keep it,
and you analyze your data.

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.750
And you look at, here
are the 18 fiber tracts

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.730
that I showed you before.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:58.450
And you ask, which of
those have higher or lower

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.300
fractional anisotropy
in kids with autism

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.190
compared to typical kids?

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.840
And the basic finding--

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.610
we replicated the usual finding.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:07.780
And that is, overall--

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.510
this is column A--
most of those tracts

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.910
showed lower
fractional anisotropy

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:17.230
in the kids with autism
than the typical kids, OK?

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.180
Many of those differences
were individually

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.430
significant in
individual tracts.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.680
Those are the ones
with the asterisks.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.190
OK.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.232
So that's the standard
finding in the literature,

00:37:26.232 --> 00:37:27.730
and we replicated it.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:33.070
However, we noticed
that a lot of the data

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.300
really seemed suspect.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.190
And we started
measuring the amount

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:39.430
of head motion between the
kids with autism and the kids

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:40.600
without.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.740
And guess what.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:45.640
Kids with autism move in the
scanner more than kids without.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.380
And guess what.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.040
Diffusion imaging and fractional
anisotropy in particular

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.690
are highly influenced
by head motion.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:57.700
So then we said, OK, let's
get a little more careful.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.980
And so we did a more
stringent analysis.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.660
And we looked at the kids.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.270
We had quite a few of
them in each group.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.370
And we took the subset
of kids who we could

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.680
match for head motion, OK?

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.650
So now we've got the kids with
autism and the typical kids,

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.860
but we've now got the
subset we have to choose

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.700
to match for head motion, OK?

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.300
It usually means the typical
kids who move a little more

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.910
and the autistic kids who had
slightly less head motion.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.560
That's what you need
to do to match them.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.010
And when we do that, the
usual pattern disappears.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.400
Now there's only a
single tract that

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.470
shows lower
fractional anisotropy

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.520
in the kids with autism
than the typical kids, OK?

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.000
The inferior
longitudinal fasciculus.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.350
So that's worrying.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.507
But then further, we thought,
OK since many of those kids

00:38:48.507 --> 00:38:50.590
we had, especially the
typical kids-- many of them

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.900
we had scanned twice.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.690
So we thought, OK, let's
really make this case.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:57.620
This is clearly a
problem in the field.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.050
In fact, it's a broader problem.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.660
Pretty much any comparison
across age groups

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.950
or clinical groups--

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.095
one group moves more
than the other group.

00:39:05.095 --> 00:39:06.310
Uh-oh.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.680
What about the
entire literature?

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.680
Hundreds, probably thousands
of published papers,

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.180
essentially, none of which
pay attention to this--

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.370
this is 2014.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:18.460
People have cleaned up their
act since, but up until 2014,

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.140
almost none of them
paid any attention

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.160
to this whopping problem.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.365
So we figured we better
make this point salient

00:39:24.365 --> 00:39:25.990
because there's a
lot of money and time

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.200
being wasted publishing garbage.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.030
And we want to make
the point saliently.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:36.070
So we took the typical kids
who we had scanned twice, OK?

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.170
And sometimes a kid
will-- the same kid

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.140
will move more in one
session than another session.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.950
So we said, OK, let's
compare the very same kids

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.440
on the session where they
move more than the session

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.640
where they moved less.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.990
And you know what?

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:53.160
We replicated the
autism phenotype.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.980
Those were typical
kids, not autistic kids.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.860
The point is head
motion alone will

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.740
reduce fractional anisotropy
and will look a whole lot

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.980
like a clinical disorder.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.820
And so every time you see that
a clinical disorder is marked

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.850
by some anatomical difference,
your first thought should be,

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.340
how carefully did
they deal with head

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.020
motion and other
artifacts that are

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.220
going to differ between groups?

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.830
OK?

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.140
So I say that not to dis
the entire literature

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.770
but just to alert you that
these things can really matter.

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.710
The paper from Gabrielli
Lab that I just described--

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.927
I looked, of course, before
I presented it in here,

00:40:27.927 --> 00:40:29.760
and they cited us, and
they used our methods

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.020
for matching head motion--

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.080
good for them.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.860
So these things
are changing, and I

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.380
think the field will
start cleaning up its act.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:42.590
But it's amazing
it took this long.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:44.800
OK.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.440
All right, so
finding fiber tracts

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.770
and characterizing them
with fractional anisotropy

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.260
are nice, but, really,
what we want to know

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.140
is what's connected to what, OK?

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.370
Which of these things are
connected to each other?

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:01.210
Which other brain regions
are they connected to?

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:06.070
And so to find that out,
we need to not just study

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.050
white matter itself
and the tracts,

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.150
but we have to get
out of the tracts

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.100
and into the gray matter.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.620
So we need to start in
a patch of gray matter

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.910
and figure out where we can go
by following those axons, OK?

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.060
And so the method for doing
that is called tractography.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.560
So there are many
versions of this.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.810
I showed briefly
these pictures before.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.246
I'm sure you've seen these.

00:41:28.246 --> 00:41:30.460
The simplest idea
of what you do,

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.660
leaving out all
the details, is you

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.000
start in some
gray-matter region,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.680
some voxel in the gray matter.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.900
You want to know what
it's connected to.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.365
You just follow those little
orientations, and you can--

00:41:44.365 --> 00:41:46.780
you see where you can go.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.250
OK?

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.850
And so that's basically
how you make this diagram.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:51.350
OK?

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.660
You're just following those.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.118
You start over here you follow
the orientation-- go do, do,

00:41:55.118 --> 00:41:56.260
do, do, do, do, do, right?

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.490
OK?

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.590
I mean, you do that
in a computer, right?

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:02.560
An algorithm does that,
follows along-- ch, ch, OK?

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.720
OK, so that's
called tractography.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.580
And the idea's
awesome-- how great

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.710
to be able to see what's
connected to what.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.530
And there are many,
many thousands

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:14.410
of papers that do
this for good reason.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:16.540
We need to know what's
connected to what.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.640
This is our
currently best method

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.800
for looking at the
structural connectivity

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.950
of different gray-matter
regions to each other.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.160
And so you can ask,
for example, OK,

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.620
let's put a seed in
the fusiform face area

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.090
and see where it goes.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.060
Wouldn't that be cool?

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.380
Right.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.030
Wouldn't it be cool?

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:40.820
Unfortunately, it doesn't work.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.640
So I have to tell
you that I don't

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.560
know if I'm the best person
to report to this because I'm

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.060
not--

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.308
I've only been trying to
do this for a few years.

00:42:48.308 --> 00:42:50.350
But, I've been collaborating
with the best people

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.960
in the world over there
at MGH Charlestown who

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.230
are working closely with us.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.310
And we can't get this
thing to work worth a damn.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.610
And so now I'm actually confused
whether the entire literature

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:01.330
is garbage.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:02.920
I don't think it's
entirely garbage.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.700
But I think it's full of
overoptimistic evaluations

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:10.210
of what you can tell
from tractography

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:13.990
because in our hands, we
started with reality checks,

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:16.270
put a seed in the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:19.450
Let's make damn sure
we can get up to V1.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.700
Well, you can get
up to V1, but you

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.250
can get up to V2,
and V3, and V4,

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.320
as well, which are
all wrong, right?

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.540
LGN only goes to V1.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:32.428
Worse, you stick a seed next
door in the medial geniculate

00:43:32.428 --> 00:43:34.720
nucleus, which is the part
of the thalamus that goes up

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.990
to auditory cortex,
you also end up in V1.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.500
Wrong.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:38.890
Wrong.

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:39.390
Wrong.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:40.570
Wrong.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.155
There's not very many anatomical
connections in the human brain

00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:46.030
where we actually know
the right answer where

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.640
we can do these reality
checks, but of the ones

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.687
we know that we've
tried, it doesn't work.

00:43:51.687 --> 00:43:53.770
And we're using the best
diffusion-imaging scanner

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:54.340
in the world.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.880
It's right over there.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.610
So maybe I'm doing
everything wrong.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.960
But at the very
least, I think there

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.585
are a lot of problems
with this method.

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:07.590
This is not just me
worrying about this.

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:09.007
And many people
have been worrying

00:44:09.007 --> 00:44:12.090
about this for the whole 15,
20-year life of diffusion

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:12.810
tractography.

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.480
And some of the challenges
are, like, famous.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.335
So to follow those
little orientations,

00:44:17.335 --> 00:44:19.710
you need to-- you can see,
like there'd be lots of places

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:23.220
where, OK, there's a bunch of
different ways you could go.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.180
It's ill posed, right?

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.970
So people use heuristics to
constrain those solutions.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:29.100
And those heuristics
are based on assumptions

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.320
about how fibers bend
in the brain, namely

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.290
that they don't make
really sharp angles, right?

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.110
That's reasonable.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:38.260
Most of the time they don't,
but sometimes they do.

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:41.190
And in particular, when
you're going from white matter

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:44.370
to cortex, often, you
make a very sharp turn.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.650
And so it's very, very
difficult to figure out

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.930
how to get from a
given gray-matter patch

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.510
into the underlying
white matter exactly what

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.130
the connectivity is.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.330
So that's one problem.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:59.100
Another famous problem
with tractography

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.510
is called the
crossing-fiber problem.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.380
So imagine a bunch of axons
somewhere in the brain

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.820
that cross like this versus
imagine a bunch of fibers

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.660
in the brain that come up to
each other and then go apart,

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.290
OK?

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:14.082
Everybody get this?

00:45:14.082 --> 00:45:16.935
The connectivity's
totally different here--

00:45:16.935 --> 00:45:18.810
no way you're ever going
to distinguish those

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.908
with diffusion tractography.

00:45:20.908 --> 00:45:22.950
So people try to get higher
and higher resolution

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.210
to see down those individual
things, but they're not there.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:28.430
Yeah.

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.233
AUDIENCE: Why would
something like that happen?

00:45:31.233 --> 00:45:33.150
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah,
why would they do that?

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.720
Weird stuff happens
in the brain.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.860
So it's not incredibly common,
but it's not unheard of.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:45.270
Yeah, remember, the
brain wasn't dissolved--

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:49.680
designed now optimally
to solve all the problems

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.180
it needs to solve with the
optimal solution from scratch.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.030
It evolved gradually over time.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:57.780
And so there are all
kinds of weird things

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.840
that are workarounds for
pre-existing decisions

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.790
that evolution made earlier.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:07.800
And so both brain and body
have lots of bizarre attributes

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.180
that aren't how you would
design it from scratch.

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:15.550
They're just the fix that
evolution made at that point

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.930
given what had
already been fixed.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.550
And so there's weird
stuff like that.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.490
Anyway, I mention
this to say I'm

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.130
more negative about diffusion
tractography than probably

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.547
anyone else because I've spent
a lot of the last two years

00:46:28.547 --> 00:46:31.050
trying to do it, and it's
big bust, and I'm cranky.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.300
So it's probably not as
bad as I'm laying out.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.260
Plenty of people do it.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.030
They get some kind
of answers out of it,

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.450
but it's problematic at least.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:43.770
My best guess is that it
is OK for fingerprints.

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:46.590
If you're asking, OK,
here's some patch of brain.

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:50.880
How much does it connect to,
say, these 85 other regions?

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.700
And is that different than the
fingerprint for this region?

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.780
That's probably OK because a lot
of those individual solutions

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.970
might be wrong, and there's
still enough left over

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.840
to see a kind of difference.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.050
So I feel like you can--
conductivity fingerprints

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:06.130
are probably worth doing.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.680
But, actually, just
answering the question of,

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.400
is there a structural
connection from A to B--

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.270
I don't know.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.140
I can't get it to work.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.150
OK?

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:18.358
OK, so I think I did all
this before just to--

00:47:18.358 --> 00:47:20.400
conductivity fingerprints--
do you remember this?

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.250
You start with
one place, and you

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.410
measure how well you can
get from each location

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.850
to each of these other ones.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.240
And I showed you
before that the work

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.090
of Zeynep Saygin and a
bunch of other people

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.790
has shown that you can--
actually, in an adult,

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:40.290
you can predict where
that adult's fusiform face

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:43.560
area is just from their
diffusion tractography data

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.470
alone because it has a
distinctive connectivity

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.510
fingerprint, OK?

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:50.260
I don't want to go
through all that again.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.343
Do you guys remember that,
more or less, the gist?

00:47:52.343 --> 00:47:53.980
OK, so that just
tells you that there

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.240
is this systematic mapping
between the connectivity

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.880
of a region and its function.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.532
And connectivity fingerprints,
despite all these problems

00:48:04.532 --> 00:48:06.490
I've been carrying on
about, have enough signal

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:11.280
left in there to predict
the function of a region

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:17.600
and maybe to say something
about homologies across species.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.030
OK, blah, blah, blah.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.690
Right.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:21.200
OK.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.760
So where do we get?

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.790
You can find the major fiber
bundles with diffusion imaging.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:26.900
That's worthwhile.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.730
You can characterize
fractional anisotropy.

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:33.020
I don't really know what it
means, but it means something.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.330
And you can find very
approximate connectivity

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:38.900
fingerprints good enough
the predict function.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.570
OK, so that's worthwhile.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:44.150
But actual structural
connections of one

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.760
particular cortical area--

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.110
not very good.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:51.210
At best, it's a weak signal.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:53.040
So that's a drag.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.410
So let's consider
the other method

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:59.160
people have used to try
to work these things out.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.700
And that's resting
functional correlations.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.120
So let me describe
where this story starts.

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.440
This story starts with a
paper in 1995 by Biswal,

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.370
and this is the
figure from his paper.

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.730
So, first he had people move--

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:17.280
they had-- he had people in the
scanner doing finger-tapping.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.613
So they're lying in the scanner.

00:49:18.613 --> 00:49:22.140
He's scanning their brains while
they tap both fingers or not,

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.310
or tap both fingers or not.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.310
And you get these-- it's
hard to see-- these two

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:28.320
little bits of motor
cortex corresponding

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.210
to the finger-motor region.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:31.480
OK, no surprise there.

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.320
We're just mapping a
little bit of motor cortex.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.730
But then he does something cool.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:42.480
He looks at the time
course over that experiment

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.010
in one of those motor regions--

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:49.110
in one hemisphere, and he
looks at the time course

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:54.150
in the other hemisphere when
the subject is at rest, not

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:55.652
doing anything, OK?

00:49:55.652 --> 00:49:56.610
Sorry, I left this out.

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.027
You scan them doing
this, and then

00:49:58.027 --> 00:50:01.200
you scan them just lying there
going, dum-de dum-de dum,

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:05.170
or whatever you do when
you don't have a task, OK?

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:10.180
And he finds that these very
far-apart regions at rest,

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.730
when the subject is not
tapping their fingers,

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:17.010
are extremely correlated.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:18.900
So that's very not obvious.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.660
These things are
centimeters apart.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.842
The subject isn't doing
anything in particular.

00:50:23.842 --> 00:50:25.300
You're not telling
them what to do.

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.640
And they certainly aren't
tapping their fingers.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.080
So why are these two bits of
finger-motor cortex going up

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.940
and down in lockstep like that?

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.340
Well, nobody knows, actually.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.800
I mean, this was however--

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.658
20-some years ago, right?

00:50:42.658 --> 00:50:45.200
Still, nobody really knows why
those damn things are going up

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.610
in lockstep like that.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.460
But it's systematic,
it's tantalizing,

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.525
it makes you want to play
more, and many people have.

00:50:52.525 --> 00:50:53.900
OK, so I would
say we still don't

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.960
know exactly why those things
are going up and down together.

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.630
But the pattern of brain regions
that go up and down together

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:01.970
has proven to be a
whole fascinating window

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.320
into the brain.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.030
OK, so that's our
next topic here.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:14.330
OK, so here's another depiction
of more exactly what you do.

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:17.180
OK, so step 1--

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.560
you find a seed region in here,
in left somatosensory motor

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.820
cortex, OK?

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.020
So that's that region there.

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.410
You get its time course, OK?

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:28.567
Sorry, at rest.

00:51:28.567 --> 00:51:30.650
You find that region, and
then you scan the person

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:33.800
while they're just told to
do nothing in particular.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.310
You get the time course averaged
over all those voxels at rest.

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:39.500
There it is, OK?

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.290
Now you take that time course.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.450
And you correlate it
with the time course

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:46.520
of every other
voxel in the brain.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.500
And you say, show
me all the voxels

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:52.790
that are correlated with
this region at rest.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:54.640
And you get this--

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.950
lots of systematic
brain regions that

00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:00.100
are highly correlated
at rest with that region

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.700
you started with.

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:06.100
Everybody get what we just did?

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.080
OK, totally non obvious.

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.640
Well, you might say, OK, fine.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.807
This is finger-motor cortex.

00:52:10.807 --> 00:52:11.723
This is the other one.

00:52:11.723 --> 00:52:13.600
That's what I showed
you from Biswal before.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.950
But why this thing?

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:17.030
Why this thing way
down deep in the brain?

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:19.330
Why that thing down in
the cerebellum miles

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:20.900
away in the brain?

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.220
Why are they all in
cahoots with each other.

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.620
I like using "in cahoots" when
talking about correlations

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.620
because nobody knows what
the correlations mean.

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:33.890
So "in cahoots" is as technical
as I think we should get.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:34.390
Yeah?

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:36.307
AUDIENCE: --correlations
without a time shift.

00:52:36.307 --> 00:52:37.270
Just [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.990
NANCY KANWISHER: Good question.

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.740
Good question.

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.960
Wouldn't we love to know
about the time shift?

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.652
But here's the problem.

00:52:42.652 --> 00:52:44.860
There should be a time shift
because it takes a while

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:48.820
to conduct down axons from
here to here, probably

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.532
a few milliseconds.

00:52:50.532 --> 00:52:52.240
But a few milliseconds
we are never going

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.600
to see with functional MRI.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.660
So, surely, there
is a time shift,

00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:01.770
but this method
can't exploit it, OK?

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:03.400
Yeah, I'll just
leave it at that.

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.520
OK, but does everybody
get what this map is?

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.980
We've just chosen a
seed region, a starting

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:09.570
point just for the hell of it.

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:11.790
And we've asked, what
other bits of the brain

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:13.920
are correlated with
that region at rest?

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.840
It's a pretty weird thing to do.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.080
And you wouldn't do it if you
didn't find systematically

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.250
replicable answers that are
repeatable across subjects.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:24.990
And when that
happens, you go, OK, I

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:27.570
don't know what this means,
but it's pretty systematic.

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:29.630
Let's keep following the thread.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:30.630
OK?

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:31.740
Question?

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:35.357
AUDIENCE: What do you mean
by correlated [INAUDIBLE]??

00:53:35.357 --> 00:53:37.190
NANCY KANWISHER: OK,
so let's do this again.

00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:39.390
You scan people
moving their fingers.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:41.560
You find little-finger
region here.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:44.200
Now you scan the same
person just in the scanner.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.200
You say, I'm going to
scan you for five minutes.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.930
Just close your eyes and don't
do anything in particular.

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:49.530
You lie there.

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.420
I scan your brain.

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:54.210
Now I take that region,
which I found before.

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.580
And I take the time
course of that region

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.260
while you were just lying in
the scanner doing nothing,

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:02.550
and I get some randomish-looking
thing like this.

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:05.490
Now I take that time
course, and I say,

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:08.040
let's see if there are any
other voxels in your brain

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.220
that were correlated when you
were lying there with that time

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.290
course.

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:16.170
And I color them in, and
there are lots of them,

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:19.790
even regions that are far away.

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:20.540
OK?

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.160
It's really not obvious.

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:25.280
You wouldn't have predicted
this would happen, yeah?

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.390
Yeah?

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:28.460
AUDIENCE: So if you look
at the brain just as

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:33.580
some underlying resting rhythm
and like just all regions

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.778
of the brain just have
some resting rhythm,

00:54:35.778 --> 00:54:37.570
wouldn't it be just
always be [INAUDIBLE]??

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:38.487
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:54:38.487 --> 00:54:41.200
OK, so there's been a
whole suite of speculations

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.640
of exactly that kind.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.640
Are there endogenous
rhythms that

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.920
are characteristic of
particular brain regions

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.510
and so those things go together?

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:53.020
Maybe, but so far, that doesn't
seem to be the main answer.

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.520
For a long time,
people thought, OK,

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.080
is it just blood-flow supply?

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.540
Maybe the blood-flow supply
to the brain branches

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.550
and feeds those regions,
and that somehow

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.753
regulates the bold
response in those regions.

00:55:02.753 --> 00:55:05.170
There have been many accounts
like this, and none of those

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:06.400
seem to really capture it.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.120
It really seems like, probably,
those neurons are firing

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.850
in sync with each other, right?

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:15.050
Yeah, question, Nava?

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:17.740
AUDIENCE: Yes, before a
question in direction--

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.230
if you have a time
delay, I guess

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:22.960
the question was because if
you would have a time delay,

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.730
you could see what's
further right.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.380
Can you, instead
of the time delay,

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:30.550
see if you measure it in one of
the regions that seems to be--

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:33.580
seems to be correlated-- if
you measure from one of those,

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.310
if you could estimate the
distance based on how strongly

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:37.543
they correlate [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:37.543 --> 00:55:39.460
NANCY KANWISHER: Oh,
with the thought of maybe

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.085
there's not a time
delay, but maybe you

00:55:41.085 --> 00:55:44.220
lose some of your
correlation with distance.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:44.850
You could.

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:48.510
But just looking at this, these
guys are pretty far apart.

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:52.005
So it's certainly not that
there's just things are--

00:55:52.005 --> 00:55:55.260
that nearby things
have a similar.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.290
AUDIENCE: No, but I
mean, if you would

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:00.660
say those are five
different regions,

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.910
did you measure from region 1?

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:03.535
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, yeah, I got you.

00:56:03.535 --> 00:56:04.110
Yeah.

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:04.610
Yeah.

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:05.490
Yeah, you could.

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.410
I think that's not going
to work because there

00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:09.240
are big, big correlations
that people find

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.210
between very distant regions.

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:13.110
I'll show you more.

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:13.440
Yeah.

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:16.065
I mean, you could try that, and
I'm sure people have done that.

00:56:16.065 --> 00:56:17.430
I can't tell you exactly where.

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:20.370
Actually, they do it as part of
their-- one of the common ways

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.640
you normalize your data is
to take this and normalize it

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:27.240
for distance from the seed
region, which would be a way

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.277
to build that factor in.

00:56:28.277 --> 00:56:30.360
And once you do that, you
still get lots of stuff.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.190
AUDIENCE: They take the
distance and the image space

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.760
for that, right?

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.677
NANCY KANWISHER: You can
do it different ways.

00:56:34.677 --> 00:56:36.780
There's an algorithm
that somebody at MGH

00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:41.340
wrote that is distanced by,
most likely, a white-matter path

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.048
or as the crow flies, not
that the crow can fly straight

00:56:44.048 --> 00:56:45.840
through the brain, but
you see what I mean.

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:49.350
Yeah.

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:50.160
Sorry, go ahead.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.535
AUDIENCE: Is the
result different

00:56:51.535 --> 00:56:53.640
in if you measure
the correlation when

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.850
they're doing the finger-tapping
action versus [INAUDIBLE]??

00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:57.810
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:00.582
OK, so this is a really
important question,

00:57:00.582 --> 00:57:02.040
and it's a whole
part of this field

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.270
that I'm leaving
out of this lecture

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:04.980
because I'm sort of
suspicious of it.

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:07.320
But your question is a good one.

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.270
So you're saying, would
they be correlated

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:10.437
while you're finger-tapping?

00:57:10.437 --> 00:57:12.780
Well, certainly, if
we did the paradigm

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.272
while they're
tapping both fingers,

00:57:14.272 --> 00:57:16.230
they're going to be
correlated because we built

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:17.700
the correlation into the task.

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.510
We said, while you're
doing this, do that.

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.325
And so they will
surely be correlated.

00:57:22.325 --> 00:57:23.700
And so there's a
whole enterprise

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.120
where people try to factor
out those things and ask,

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.000
even after you account for
the activation of the task,

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.910
are there changes in these
patterns of correlation

00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:35.700
with the task you're doing?

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:39.900
And that's called PPI for
physiological interactions.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.910
And lots and lots
of people do it--

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:43.200
hundreds, thousands of papers.

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.575
It's probably
pretty respectable,

00:57:44.575 --> 00:57:46.890
but it drives me nuts because
I don't feel like there's

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:48.690
any way you could
know that you're fully

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:50.080
accounting for the task.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.870
And so I think those
correlations may

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:55.780
be largely reflecting regions
commonly activated by the task,

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:59.200
and that's why I didn't
put that in this lecture.

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.040
But surely, task will also
produce correlations, right?

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.770
Let me just put it another way.

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:08.160
If I flash up a bunch
of faces versus--

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.560
it's like faces versus nothing--

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.900
and then we look
at the correlations

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.180
during that period, well,
you'll find correlations

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:18.510
between V1 and the FFA
because when their face is on,

00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:20.550
both V1 and the FFA turn on.

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:23.170
And when there aren't,
they both turn off.

00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:25.960
That's just a task
response, right?

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.790
So to be able to look at how
these endogenous correlations

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:32.440
are affected by
task, we would have

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.380
to be certain we could siphon
off the entire task effect

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.320
so that we could look
at just the residual.

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.943
And I don't think
any of our analysis

00:58:38.943 --> 00:58:41.110
are good enough to siphon
off an entire task effect.

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:43.060
And that's why I just
don't go there with PPI,

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.635
even though everyone else does.

00:58:44.635 --> 00:58:46.510
If you didn't follow
that, it doesn't matter.

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:48.128
I'm just trying to
give you an answer.

00:58:48.128 --> 00:58:50.170
I'm going to take just
questions of clarification

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:52.753
now because there's a couple of
things I really want to get to

00:58:52.753 --> 00:58:55.750
and I'm running out of time.

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:58.600
OK.

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.700
But everybody should
understand this--

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.810
an activation map that's made by
asking, which brain regions are

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:09.670
correlated at rest with a given
region I choose a seed region

00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:10.450
I choose?

00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:13.340
OK.

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:16.820
OK, important caveat--
even though people

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:20.340
call this "resting
functional connectivity,"

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:22.580
we will not be using
that phrase in this class

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:24.950
because we do not know
that it's connectivity

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:26.450
in the structural sense.

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:29.450
It's just a correlation, OK?

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:31.140
And I'll say more
about that later.

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.620
But if you read about resting
functional connectivity,

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:34.602
it's the same thing.

00:59:34.602 --> 00:59:36.560
It's just, I think, people
are making a mistake

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.390
using that word.

00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:42.480
OK, so let me get
this idea across here.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.660
You may have heard of
the default-mode network.

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.490
There's heaps of papers on this.

00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:47.240
It's a thing.

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.800
There's a lot of
discussion of it.

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.940
And it's bizarre.

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.920
It has arisen from two
independent findings,

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:53.420
OK?

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:55.410
So let's do these
findings one at a time.

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:58.100
The first one is people started
noticing around 15 years

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.770
ago that across lots of
different kinds of tasks,

01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:05.240
if you looked at not the
intended direction, like, say,

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.714
reading sentences
versus staring at a dot,

01:00:07.714 --> 01:00:12.350
or doing a demanding
working-memory task

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:16.430
versus a really passive-viewing
task, anything where there's

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:19.550
a really engaging task
versus an easy task,

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:21.500
you would find a
bunch of regions

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.650
that were activated in the
reverse contrast, regions that

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:27.535
are more activated when you're
doing less mental activity,

01:00:27.535 --> 01:00:29.660
typically, regions that
are active when you're just

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:34.010
lying there at rest compared
to doing something difficult.

01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:37.240
And so originally, people were
like, what's up with that?

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:37.990
How can that be?

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:41.600
It seemed paradoxical,
impossible.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.410
But, in fact, it's
not impossible, right?

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:47.740
Suppose I had you do a bunch
of mental-arithmetic tasks,

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.970
and they're pretty demanding.

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.400
And I compared that to
just having you lie there

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.660
in the scanner doing nothing.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:56.980
It's like, OK, do mental
arithmetic for 20 seconds, rest

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:59.260
20 seconds, mental
arithmetic for 20 seconds,

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.150
rest for 20 seconds.

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:04.000
Now imagine we find parts of
your brain, systematic ones,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.840
that are more engaged at rest.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.890
What might that mean?

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:12.945
David.

01:01:12.945 --> 01:01:15.070
AUDIENCE: That part of the
brain could be, I think,

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.480
like daydreaming.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.440
NANCY KANWISHER:
Daydreaming, exactly.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:18.940
Yeah.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.260
You can't turn your brain off.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.450
You don't turn your
brain off at rest.

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:23.710
You daydream.

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:25.120
Absolutely.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:25.630
What else?

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:26.830
What are the things--
some of the things

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:27.872
you do when you daydream?

01:01:30.275 --> 01:01:32.150
What are the typical
contents of daydreaming?

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.775
I guess it depends who it is and
what you're daydreaming about,

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:36.860
but there are very
systematic things people do.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.320
They recall episodic memories.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.230
It's like, oh, yeah, before
I got in here-- you replay

01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:44.110
things that were happening.

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:45.110
And what else do you do?

01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:46.590
You think about people?

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:47.090
Why?

01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:48.530
Because we're social
primates, and that's

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.790
what we care a lot about.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.927
You don't think
only about people.

01:01:51.927 --> 01:01:54.260
Some of you guys might be
trying to solve a math problem

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.390
that you couldn't solve before.

01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:58.880
But most people in the scan
are asked to do nothing,

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.300
are recalling events, which
usually involve people,

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.360
or thinking about people, OK?

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.930
So this whole suite of brain
regions that was called

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:10.430
the "default-mode network" is
just the regions that are more

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:13.863
engaged when nobody tells you
what to do than for a whole

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.780
bunch of things when
they tell you what to do.

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:19.273
And so it's some weird mix of
daydreaming and other stuff.

01:02:19.273 --> 01:02:20.690
And the interesting
thing about it

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:22.550
is they're reasonably
systematic.

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:25.362
So those are the--

01:02:25.362 --> 01:02:26.570
I keep getting confused here.

01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:26.840
Hang on.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.757
Let me get this right.

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:33.390
Did I label this backwards?

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.310
All right, they're
the green guys.

01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:38.580
Yeah, deactivated
during demanding tasks.

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:39.145
Yeah.

01:02:39.145 --> 01:02:40.770
There's too many
negatives for me here.

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:45.880
The green guys here-- does
that look familiar, that patch?

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:51.020
What does that look like kind
of, not exactly but kind of?

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:51.520
Sorry?

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.832
AUDIENCE: Visual,
the visual system.

01:02:53.832 --> 01:02:56.290
NANCY KANWISHER: It's sort of
near the visual system, yeah.

01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:58.207
It is, but it's also
like something else we've

01:02:58.207 --> 01:02:59.860
been talking about recently.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.690
Our TPT.

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:04.480
It's a little further back, but
it's right in the same region,

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.240
OK?

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.145
And here are these
medial regions.

01:03:09.145 --> 01:03:11.020
There's a medial view
of the left hemisphere,

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.120
like, "take my right hemisphere
out and look at the inside"

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:13.620
view.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.490
That's this-- [INAUDIBLE]
and sulcus, right?

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:17.750
All these medial regions.

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:20.420
It looks a whole lot like the
social-cognition network that I

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:23.840
talked about last time, that
you identify with the contrast

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.840
of belief task versus--

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.920
the false-belief test
versus a false-photo test.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.140
So that's weird
finding number one,

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.030
that there's a
systematic set of regions

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:35.950
that are engaged at rest.

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:38.110
They're called the
default-mode network

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:41.260
because they're what you
do by default when nobody's

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.708
controlling you externally.

01:03:42.708 --> 01:03:45.250
So that's finding number one,
and there's finding number two.

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:46.640
But first, Jack, did
you have a question?

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.265
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:47.265 --> 01:03:48.910
I was just wondering,
does deactivated

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:50.920
during demanding
tasks necessarily

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.297
imply that it is activated
during not-demanding tasks?

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:55.630
NANCY KANWISHER: We're not
distinguishing between those.

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:57.340
We're just taking
those two conditions.

01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.260
You'd have to have
some third baseline

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.310
to figure out whether
those two were different.

01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:03.310
And that's very problematic
because we're are we

01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:05.727
having a problem saying, what
counts as a baseline, right?

01:04:05.727 --> 01:04:09.140
So we'll just compare
those two, OK?

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.838
So that's weird
finding number one.

01:04:10.838 --> 01:04:13.130
And it's not that weird when
you think about it further

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:14.713
because, of course,
you're doing stuff

01:04:14.713 --> 01:04:16.790
when you're lying there, right?

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:19.550
But the further finding that
really put the default mode

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:21.500
network on the map
was when people

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:26.390
started putting seeds in parts
of that default-mode network

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:32.170
up here and finding that
they got the whole rest

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:35.480
of the network at rest, OK?

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.120
So all of those things
are correlated at rest.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.580
It's not just that they're
all activated at rest.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.400
Their time courses are
correlated at rest.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.640
So, actually, what people mean
by default mode network now

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.420
is not, I took the reverse
contrast and all the stuff that

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.540
activated more for rest than
task, I call that default mode.

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:56.843
Actually, what they mean
is I stuck a seed in there

01:04:56.843 --> 01:04:58.760
during my rest scans,
and I took all the stuff

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.250
that was correlated
with that position

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:04.490
because those pick out, more
or less, the same thing.

01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:05.990
OK?

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:08.300
So that's led to a
whole lot of discussion

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.060
about what the default mode
network is, and what it means,

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.530
and what we can learn from it.

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:16.615
That's what all this says.

01:05:16.615 --> 01:05:17.990
I'm just trying
to figure out how

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:19.580
I'm going to do this because
I'm going to run out of time.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.830
Maybe I won't run out of time.

01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:22.940
We'll just go for it.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:23.600
OK.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.040
So people started messing
around with these correlations

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:28.850
at rest.

01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:30.350
And they found
that you could find

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:34.280
other systematic sets of regions
if you stuck seeds elsewhere.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.460
And so another systematic
region, a set of regions,

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:41.850
is all the hot-color ones,
the yellow and red ones here.

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:43.880
And so if you look
in there, you see

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.130
various things-- the
interparietal sulcus,

01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:50.150
a bunch of frontal regions,
Visual-Motion area, MT,

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.970
or other visual
regions down there.

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:55.010
And they found
that set of regions

01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:57.560
was strongly correlated
with each other at rest.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.070
You stick a seed in here, and
you get all that yellow stuff,

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.160
OK?

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.520
And then they looked at it, and
they said, yeah, right, we've

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.840
seen those regions engage.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.160
Whenever people do demanding--
potentially demanding tasks--

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.720
they've seen that before
in other task contrasts.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.142
So all those things that
turn on when you really

01:06:17.142 --> 01:06:18.850
have to pay a lot of
attention and you're

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:20.200
doing a really hard task--

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.830
all those regions do that,
and they're also correlated

01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:25.840
with each other at rest.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.830
OK?

01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:29.330
And so there's this convergence
of these two different lines

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:30.040
of work--

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.350
task contrasts
that just say, what

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:35.440
makes a given set of
regions turn on or off,

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.220
and correlations-- which
things are correlated at rest?

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.090
OK?

01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:42.310
And so they're both
converging here with these two

01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:43.810
different networks.

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:45.640
OK, so I need to
do a little sidebar

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:50.200
on this other hot-color network,
not the default-mode network

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.220
but this other one.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.290
It was originally
called "task-positive"

01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.930
because it turns on more
when you do tasks than rest.

01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:58.660
I mean, that's a really
vague statement, OK?

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.820
But it also has
lots of other names,

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:03.220
and the name that we're
going to refer to here

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:06.400
is the multiple-demand
regions, OK?

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.190
Multiple demand comes out
from another line of work

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:10.480
that just converged with us.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.063
They're picking out pretty much
the same set of brain regions.

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:16.360
But "multiple demand" means
lots of different kinds

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.210
of cognitive demand
activate those same regions.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:20.710
OK?

01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:24.040
So I can give you a difficult
spatial working-memory task.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.500
I can give you a
difficult perceptual

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:30.610
orientation-judgment task,
a difficult arithmetic task.

01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.410
In each of those cases,
I can compare them

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.060
to an easy version
of the same task,

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.500
and I'll get, more or
less, those regions there,

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:39.740
which are--

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.380
it's getting a
little vague here,

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.880
but they're pretty similar to
the task-positive ones, OK?

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:51.070
So this is both
interesting and scandalous.

01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:54.460
It's scandalous because-- to
me only, not to anyone else--

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.100
because unlike all the regions
we've been talking about so far

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.960
that have these very
specific functions--

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.950
they just do face recognition
or just theory of mind--

01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:07.660
these ones will do anything,
almost, anything difficult, OK?

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.987
So whenever you engage
in a difficult task--

01:08:09.987 --> 01:08:11.570
I'm skipping over a
whole literature--

01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:12.862
it's a big literature on this--

01:08:12.862 --> 01:08:15.130
but lots and lots of
totally different kinds

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:17.080
of tasks that have
nothing in common other

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.640
than they're very demanding--
you engage those regions.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.100
And in some ways, that's an
even more fascinating puzzle.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.439
Like, what the hell would
those operations be?

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:28.560
What is in common between
spatial working memory

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.793
and arithmetic and
line-orientation judgment

01:08:31.793 --> 01:08:33.210
and all the other
things that have

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:35.970
been shown to activate these
regions when they're demanding?

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:36.660
Nobody knows.

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.609
I think it's a big,
fascinating puzzle.

01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:40.350
Someday we'll have a
computational story

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:42.430
about what's actually
computed in those regions,

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:45.930
but we don't yet, OK?

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:48.180
There's a lot of stuff on
the multiple-demand regions,

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.180
and they're interesting.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.990
But I can't resist
one little thing.

01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:53.340
All right, I can't.

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:55.050
I have no self-control
because I'm not--

01:08:55.050 --> 01:08:57.000
I don't have enough
multiple-demand activity

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.950
right now, so I'm going to have
to just tell you these things

01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:59.825
because they're cool.

01:08:59.825 --> 01:09:04.380
OK, so a guy named John
Duncan has spent the last 15

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.600
years arguing that the
multiple-demand regions first

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.505
are really truly
multiple demand.

01:09:08.505 --> 01:09:10.380
He's tested lots and
lots of different tasks,

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.620
and they're very,
very domain general.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.450
But second, he thinks
they're implicated

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:17.520
in fluid intelligence.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.670
Fluid intelligence differs
from crystallized intelligence.

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:24.279
Crystallized intelligence is
stuff like your vocabulary,

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:26.609
just stuff you've
learned and cached away,

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:29.189
and facts you've stored, and
abilities you've-- specific

01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:30.540
abilities you've stored.

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.520
Fluid intelligence
you measure with stuff

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.365
like Raven's matrices,
where nothing you know

01:09:35.365 --> 01:09:36.490
is going to help you do it.

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:39.060
You just have to be smart
and see some abstract pattern

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:41.170
or something like that.

01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:44.010
And so Duncan thinks
that these regions are

01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:46.450
related to fluid intelligence.

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:49.200
And one of his measures of
that is if you find people

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.170
with brain damage--

01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:51.953
he had a big set
of around 80 people

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:53.370
who had brain
damage who he'd been

01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:56.580
studying in all different
parts of the brain.

01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:00.540
And what he found is if you have
brain damage in those regions,

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:04.470
your IQ goes down as a result
of the damage in proportion

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:10.980
to the amount of cortical
volume destroyed by the damage.

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:13.140
If you have damage
anywhere else in the brain,

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.360
your IQ is unaffected.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.200
You may become paralyzed, or
aphasic, or prosopagnosic,

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.180
or akinetopsic.

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.370
You may have any of these
very specific deficits

01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:27.090
according to where it lands,
but it won't affect your IQ.

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:29.670
And so the picture here
is that in addition

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:32.400
to all these special-purpose
processors that this course has

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.590
been focusing on, we
have this thing that's

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:39.030
kind of like the brain's
CPU or something like that.

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:42.150
And it seems to live in
approximately those regions,

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:44.070
and it seems to under--

01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:48.475
it seems to be essential
for fluid intelligence, OK?

01:10:48.475 --> 01:10:50.100
So I'm skipping over
lots of literature

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.100
just to heighten that this is
a particularly interesting set

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.320
of regions here, OK?

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.310
Yeah.

01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:58.598
AUDIENCE: Do people
study novelty?

01:10:58.598 --> 01:10:59.515
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

01:10:59.515 --> 01:11:01.750
AUDIENCE: The regions that
specialize in novelty.

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:05.800
NANCY KANWISHER: These guys
will be interested in novelty.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.170
These guys will be interested
in novelty but not only.

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:11.320
You can do the same boring
but difficult task on, and on,

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.880
and on, and they'll keep going.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.290
OK.

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:18.270
The reason I went
on that sidebar

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:20.640
is that you can identify
these regions, not just

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.400
by scanning people while
they're doing difficult tasks

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.620
but by sticking a seed
in any of those regions

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.480
and getting the others, OK?

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.085
That's the task-positive
network pretty much, OK?

01:11:31.085 --> 01:11:32.460
So we're getting
this convergence

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.750
between sets of
brain regions that we

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:38.450
find with a task contrast
and sets of brain regions

01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:40.990
we find by finding what's
correlated with what.

01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:42.740
And the bigger picture
of this whole thing

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.590
is that I've been focusing
on individual regions

01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:48.440
and what they do, and the
gist of this whole resting

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.880
functional-correlation
literature

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.300
is a very relevant
level of organization

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:56.510
of the brain is not just an
individual cortical region

01:11:56.510 --> 01:12:01.897
but a set of cortical regions
that seem to be in cahoots.

01:12:01.897 --> 01:12:03.980
And, again, we don't know
what that means exactly,

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:06.272
but they're correlated at
rest, and they have something

01:12:06.272 --> 01:12:08.030
to do with each other, OK?

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:10.340
So we're finding this
higher-level organization,

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.040
and the multiple-demand
system is part of it.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.943
OK, so how are we
going to look at this?

01:12:16.943 --> 01:12:18.110
So there's a bunch of these.

01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:21.855
I've talked only about the
default mode network and--

01:12:21.855 --> 01:12:24.230
it's another name for the same
thing-- executive control.

01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:25.115
Don't worry about it.

01:12:25.115 --> 01:12:26.657
You think of that
as multiple demand.

01:12:26.657 --> 01:12:28.100
It doesn't matter.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.950
But there's a bunch of them that
you can find by sticking seeds

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:32.580
in different places.

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.850
And so yes, I just
said the big idea here

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.870
is that networks are
an interesting level--

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:39.530
an interesting kind
of unit in thinking

01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:41.477
about brain
organization-- bigger

01:12:41.477 --> 01:12:42.560
than an individual region.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:47.460
It's a set of regions that
have something in common, OK?

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:51.567
But I've sort of backed into
in this awkward way of saying,

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:53.900
OK, here are things that are
correlated with each other,

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.817
and here's what we know
about the same regions

01:12:55.817 --> 01:12:57.970
from previous task analysis.

01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:00.340
Most of the literature on
resting functional correlation

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.437
just looks at correlations and
doesn't try to put it together

01:13:03.437 --> 01:13:05.020
with what we know
about those regions,

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:08.950
and that just seems
deeply weird to me.

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:10.930
So for years, I ignored
this whole thing

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:12.430
because it's like,
I don't know what

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:13.900
these resting correlations are.

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.430
And if I don't
know what they are,

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:17.020
I'm not going to work on them.

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.990
And then Idan Blank came along.

01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:22.540
And when he was a first-year
grad student at Fedorenko,

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.748
said, hey, we have all these
resting-functional data.

01:13:24.748 --> 01:13:27.340
Let's have Idan, for his
rotation, for a month,

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:28.870
analyze the
resting-functional data.

01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:30.040
I said, resting
functional-- we don't

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:30.640
know what the hell it means.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.360
Let's not bother.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.610
She's like, get over yourself.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.803
Let's let him play with it.

01:13:35.803 --> 01:13:37.720
Well, thank God she's
not as stuck in her ways

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.570
as I am because Idan
spent just a month playing

01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:43.690
with some of our data, and
what he found blew me away.

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:45.520
So here's what he did.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:49.570
He said, OK, let's start with
actually identified regions

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:52.390
of brain where we know
something about what they do,

01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:56.020
like the language system and
the multiple-demand system.

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.730
OK?

01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:00.070
Let's identify those
regions in each subject

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:08.252
individually, and then let's
scan subjects at rest, OK?

01:14:08.252 --> 01:14:11.480
First, you scan subjects with
sentences versus nonwords.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.070
You find the language regions.

01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:15.800
Then you scan them with a
difficult-versus-easy spatial

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.700
working-memory task.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.010
You find the
multiple-demand regions.

01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:23.870
Then you scan them at rest, and
you get the average timecourse

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:26.180
from each of those
regions at rest.

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:28.830
These are fake data, just
to give you the gist.

01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:29.330
Makes sense?

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:31.010
Are you with me now?

01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:33.200
Now you can ask, OK,
which of these things

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.283
are correlated with
each other at rest?

01:14:35.283 --> 01:14:36.950
And this is now a
more interesting thing

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:39.590
to do because we're asking this
principled question of regions

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:42.380
we know something about
rather than random seeds

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:45.140
in some random location, right?

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:48.810
OK, so now what we do is we
examine those correlations.

01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:51.290
And we just ask, for
example, how correlated

01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:54.950
are those timecourses of two
different language regions

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:59.910
or those two different parts
of the multiple-demand system?

01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:03.000
And how strong are
the correlations

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.720
between the systems, some little
piece of the language system

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.450
and some little piece of
the multiple-demand system?

01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:10.950
Makes sense?

01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:15.098
So that's a cool question to
ask, and that's what Idan did.

01:15:15.098 --> 01:15:16.140
And here's what he found.

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:17.710
Let me first orient you.

01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:20.520
So here are lots and lots
of regions of interest

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.950
that were identified
functionally-- a whole bunch

01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:24.960
of language regions
up here, a whole bunch

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.520
of multiple-demand
regions down here.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.950
The details don't matter, OK?

01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:31.320
But what I'm going to
show you is in each cell,

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.023
we're going to have a
correlation between a given--

01:15:34.023 --> 01:15:36.690
so this would be a given part of
the cell over here-- given part

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:37.940
of the multiple demand system.

01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:42.480
Sorry, a given part of
the multiple-demand system

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.120
and some other part of the
multiple-demand system,

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.350
or over here, a cell would
be some part of the language

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:52.980
system and some part of the
multiple-demand system, OK?

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.460
So when you do that,
here's what you see.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:59.700
Here are the correlations
at rest between all

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.018
of these pairs of conditions.

01:16:02.018 --> 01:16:03.810
And if you squint a
little-- you don't even

01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:05.820
have to squint much--
but the black ones

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.950
are the ones that are not
significantly correlated

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:08.850
at all.

01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:10.380
Blue means a
negative correlation,

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:13.390
and hot colors mean a
positive correlation.

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:17.750
And so what you see is here
are all the language regions.

01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:19.750
These are the right-hemisphere
language regions,

01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:21.340
which barely even count.

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:23.600
They're just there
for the hell of it.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.310
This is really the
core language regions,

01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:27.010
and you can see
they're all correlated

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:30.880
with each other, even ones
that are really far apart--

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.740
Broca's area and
Wernicke's area--

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:37.150
10, 12 centimeters apart--
strongly correlated at rest,

01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:38.253
OK?

01:16:38.253 --> 01:16:39.670
And if you look
at different parts

01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:42.010
of the multiple-demand
system, they're

01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:44.640
all strongly correlated
at rest, even

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.390
regions that are far
apart-- something way

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:47.765
up in the frontal
lobe, something

01:16:47.765 --> 01:16:50.380
way back in the parietal lobe--
strongly correlated at rest.

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:54.760
And so yeah.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.810
If you zoom in here--

01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:59.150
so what this is really--

01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:01.970
does everybody see that this is
revealing a lot of structure?

01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:02.820
Yeah, question?

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.320
AUDIENCE: So the diagonals would
be, like, self correlation,

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.200
right?

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.075
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah,
that's why it's black.

01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:13.910
Actually, what is it?

01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:14.660
Oh, you know what?

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.452
It's split in half.

01:17:15.452 --> 01:17:16.550
It's split in half.

01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:18.050
It's actually a
better way to do it.

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:19.820
You take your data, and you
have two different halves

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:20.480
of the data.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.420
And so it gives you
a baseline for the--

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.130
no, that doesn't make
any sense, does it?

01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:25.790
Never mind.

01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:26.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:27.225
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:29.105
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:29.105 --> 01:17:30.355
NANCY KANWISHER: It is maroon.

01:17:32.698 --> 01:17:34.240
AUDIENCE: If you
look at the spectrum

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.925
on the bottom, [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:36.925 --> 01:17:37.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:38.120
NANCY KANWISHER:
All right, I'm going

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.100
to have to solve this offline
because I'm now confused,

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.433
unless Anya can figure it out
right now and bail us out.

01:17:42.433 --> 01:17:43.785
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:43.785 --> 01:17:45.910
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, but
as they're pointing out,

01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:47.380
it's not black.

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:47.880
OK.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:48.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.325
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:17:49.325 --> 01:17:50.950
AUDIENCE: I'm saying
it should be high.

01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:52.150
I was just wondering
[INAUDIBLE]..

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:53.110
NANCY KANWISHER: Oh,
it's a correlation of 1.

01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.980
Is that what it is?

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:56.960
NANCY KANWISHER: OK, because
it's correlated with itself.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:57.460
All right.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:57.960
OK.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.560
Thank you.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.140
Anyway, does
everybody get the gist

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.120
that all of these
different pieces

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.460
of the multiple-demand
system that we identified

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:09.190
individually-- they're all
correlated with each other

01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:09.938
at rest?

01:18:09.938 --> 01:18:11.980
All these different pieces
of the language system

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.020
are correlated with
each other at rest.

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:16.120
And there's no
correlation at all

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.100
between any part of
the language system

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.590
and any part of the
multiple-demand system at rest.

01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:22.930
All of these-- OK,
maybe a couple.

01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:25.930
These cells are all either
black for not significant

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:27.610
or inversely correlated.

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:29.500
That's the cool colors.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:33.550
So do you see how this gives
us a totally cool way aside

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:36.190
from just the
functional localizers we

01:18:36.190 --> 01:18:40.960
ran to identify these regions
to show us that these things are

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.590
functioning as a system, right?

01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:46.710
It's not just that Broca's area
is a cool little thing that

01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:49.830
does a piece of language and
some bit of the temporal lobe

01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:52.320
is a cool thing that does
some piece of language.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.900
But those guys are part
of a broader system,

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.790
and these resting
functional correlations

01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:59.940
are revealing this broader
system and the integrity

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:02.940
of the parts within it,
as well as the distinction

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.150
between those parts and parts
of another system, or network.

01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:07.830
Does everybody get that idea?

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:08.490
Good.

01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:11.130
That's a big idea
for this lecture.

01:19:11.130 --> 01:19:12.915
I think what I'll do--

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:14.535
so you can--

01:19:14.535 --> 01:19:17.160
I'll skip that.

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.810
So this is basically
the correlation

01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:21.840
between all of the cells
within the language system,

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.930
all of the cells within
the multiple-demand system,

01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:27.310
and any pair of cells
between systems here.

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:31.680
So that's just averaging over
the matrix I showed you before.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.790
And so this is a cool
way to ask about broader

01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:36.980
systems in the brain.

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:39.920
And I was going to show you some
data published just a month ago

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:42.830
that asked this question
not just about the language

01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:45.530
and multiple-demand
systems but also,

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:51.488
about the theory-of-mind
network, which is basically

01:19:51.488 --> 01:19:53.280
really similar to the
default mode network.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.655
But the theory-of-mind
network we

01:19:54.655 --> 01:19:56.620
can identify that we
talked about last time.

01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.355
And you can go think offline.

01:19:58.355 --> 01:19:59.730
Actually, I'll
take a suggestion.

01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:00.640
What do you think?

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.670
Should the
theory-of-mind network

01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:05.220
be correlated with
the language system,

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:09.234
with the multiple-demand
system, both, or neither?

01:20:09.234 --> 01:20:10.158
AUDIENCE: Neither.

01:20:10.158 --> 01:20:11.200
NANCY KANWISHER: Neither?

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:11.937
Why?

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:13.520
AUDIENCE: This is
something different.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.853
NANCY KANWISHER: OK, that's
a totally reasonable answer,

01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:18.210
and that's largely
true but not 100% true.

01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:19.520
What else might you think?

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:22.400
It is a different system,
and it does function

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.350
quite independently
but not perfectly.

01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:26.910
Yeah.

01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:40.700
AUDIENCE: Because it's
[INAUDIBLE] analyzing

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:54.515
[INAUDIBLE]

01:20:54.515 --> 01:20:55.640
NANCY KANWISHER: All right.

01:20:55.640 --> 01:21:00.380
That's a lovely speculation
and an intelligent one,

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:01.700
and it's half true.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.480
I'll just skip to the data.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:08.660
So in this very recently
published paper,

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:10.803
Alex Paunov, and Idan
Blank, and Ev Fedorenko

01:21:10.803 --> 01:21:13.220
looked at the language system,
the theory-of-mind network,

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.410
which is not just the TPJ
but these other regions

01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:17.000
that I mentioned
briefly that you also

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.370
get in the contrast of
the false-belief test

01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:22.520
versus the false-photo task and
the multiple-demand network.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.940
Same deal-- identify each of
those regions in each subject

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.970
individually, then scan
the subject at rest

01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:30.980
and see what's
correlated with what.

01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:33.200
And here's the answer.

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.410
You see, again, replicate the
language system, especially

01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:38.630
in the left hemisphere.

01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:41.330
The theory of mind
system is all a system.

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:45.390
And the multiple-demand system
is a system, separate system.

01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:47.780
But if you look in
at the cell where

01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:51.740
you have theory of
mind and language,

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:55.760
it's slightly above
chance, not theory of mind

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:58.760
in multiple demand but theory
of mind in language, probably

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.862
for just the reason you said,
the whole essence of language,

01:22:01.862 --> 01:22:03.320
even though it's
a different thing,

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.820
than thinking about the contents
of someone else's thoughts.

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.130
They are so enmeshed
in each other.

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.440
The reason we have language
is to take our thoughts

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.440
and put them in your head
and take your thoughts

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.760
and put them in our head.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:16.910
And so it makes sense that
those things are a little bit

01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:17.530
correlated.

01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:19.703
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] language?

01:22:19.703 --> 01:22:20.620
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:21.530
Yeah.

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:23.180
But neither of
them is correlated

01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:24.560
with multiple-demand.

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.750
It's 1:26, so-- or--

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:27.768
wait.

01:22:27.768 --> 01:22:29.060
Am I reading the wrong-- yeah--

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:29.750
oh, 12:28.

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.053
Sorry.

01:22:31.053 --> 01:22:31.970
There's a number here.

01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:33.387
That's how long
I've been talking.

01:22:33.387 --> 01:22:35.930
So 12:28-- so if you
need to go, that's fine,

01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:37.590
but I'm happy to
answer questions.

01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:38.090
So go ahead.

01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:39.650
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to say,

01:22:39.650 --> 01:22:42.620
there was a review paper
about [INAUDIBLE] talked

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.250
about how there's a behavioral
connection between theory

01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:49.282
of mind and, like, when children
started to learn [INAUDIBLE]..

01:22:49.282 --> 01:22:51.740
NANCY KANWISHER: Lots of links,
especially developmentally,

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:52.500
yeah.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.113
Yeah.

01:22:53.113 --> 01:22:53.780
Did you have a--

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.197
AUDIENCE: By an
extension of that,

01:22:55.197 --> 01:23:00.440
[INAUDIBLE] should be
correlated to the theory of mind

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.250
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:03.590
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes,
wouldn't you think?

01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:04.430
Not really.

01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:05.835
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:05.835 --> 01:23:07.460
NANCY KANWISHER: The
FFA is irritating.

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.293
It's not strongly
correlated with the things

01:23:09.293 --> 01:23:11.530
it ought to be correlated with.

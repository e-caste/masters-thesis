00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.900
PROFESSOR: Here
is your potential.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.910
It's going to be a smooth,
nice potential like that.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.890
V of x.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.750
x, x.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.770
And now, suppose you
don't know anything

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.120
about the energy eigenstates.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.260
Now, this potential will
be assumed to be symmetric.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:36.430
So here is one thing you can do.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.980
You can exploit some things that
you know about this potential.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.810
And here's the wave
function that we're

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.160
going to try to plot.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.900
And we could say the following.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.970
Let's see.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.840
Whatever energy are
here, for bound states,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.200
I'm going to eventually be
in the forbidden region.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.670
So far on the right here, I
will be in the forbidden region.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.630
And I must meet
the wave function

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.970
that looks like the forbidden
region wave function.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.020
And the only possibility
is something like that.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.300
You could say it's
the [INAUDIBLE] of 1,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.890
but actually, if it's
a [INAUDIBLE] then

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.560
I could multiply by minus 1 and
use this one conventionally.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.660
That wave function
is always going

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.210
to be like that over there.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.600
On the other hand,
very important-- the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.720
on the very left, how will
the wave function look?

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.740
Well it also has to decay,
so it can decay like that,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.770
or it might be
decaying like this.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.180
And in fact, you don't
know until you figure out

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.850
what's happening in the middle.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.110
It may be decaying
like this or like that.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.240
I fix the sign here,
so whatever this

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.690
does it should either end up
like that or end up like that.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.880
So these are the guidelines
that you have to solve this.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.030
Should begin like
that, and we'll see.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.020
And it should be either
symmetric or anti-symmetric.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.600
This would be the
case anti-symmetric,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.200
this would be the
case symmetric.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.500
OK.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.460
So let's draw one, two,
three, four lines there.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:45.270
One, two, three, and four.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.820
And I don't know where
the energies lie.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.040
I don't know what is
the ground state energy.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.470
And I want to give you
an insight into how

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.710
you can figure out why you
get this energy one decision

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.650
when this happens.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.955
So let's plot the wave
function for the first case.

00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:19.520
I don't know if I have a
label, but let's assume

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.890
this is E0, E1, E2, E3.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.010
Three energies [INAUDIBLE],
and here's the one for e0.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.270
OK.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.300
So I begin here,
that's how it goes.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.290
And then I go through
my Schrodinger equation,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.120
integrate it.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.620
You see?

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.330
Numerical, you can always
integrate the Schrodinger

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.650
equation.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.005
And this should be always
in this region, let me--

00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:54.505
like this.

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:56.740
And it's growing.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.520
And, oops, there should
be turning points here.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.870
There should be turning points--

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.770
suppose this is--

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.260
I'm not going to get this so
well, but it goes like this.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.900
And now this should
be a turning point.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.130
So I should change to the
other type of curvature,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.320
curvature down.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.890
But what probably will happen
with E0 is that it will switch

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.340
and it will go like and
start to curve, maybe.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.580
Well, if it looks
like that, it must

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.760
match to the development of the
odd piece or the even piece.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.630
Now, it's never going to
match with the odd one,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.870
so it might be with the even.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:54.980
And yes, it would match
turning point here,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.830
but look what has happened here.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.640
You got the corner there.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.190
You know, this was
turning slowly,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.320
and this is starting
to turn slowly,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.170
but here there is
a discontinuity

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.330
in the derivative.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.510
So this is not the solution.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.300
You try, but you fail.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.590
But that's-- right.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.590
Not every energy
gives a solution.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.340
So they should have
matched continuously

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.730
and derivative
continuously at that point,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.860
but it didn't have
enough time to do that.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.740
On the other hand, if we
try the next one, maybe.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.870
The turning points will be here.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.130
Let's see what happens.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:56.280
Well, now the forbidden
energies are over here,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.510
and now you have a
turning point here that--

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.685
in here, the
curvature is negative,

00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:06.800
the second
derivative's curvature.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.290
And it's larger
than it was here.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.660
Here it was small,
here it's larger.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.390
So it's going to curve faster.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.360
Maybe if you get
the E1 right, it

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.550
will curve enough so this
flat here, in which case

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:30.860
the other side will match nicely
and you've got the solution.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.440
So you probably have
to go little by little

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.180
until this becomes
flattened and, boom,

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.230
you've got the solution.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.070
Energy eigenstate.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.770
Let's go a little further.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.070
This graph continues there.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.235
Now I want to go to E2.

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:56.990
How am I going to do that?

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.362
I'm going to do it this way.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.670
So this was here,
this was there.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.550
There is the vertical line here.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.670
And for E2, the turning
points are even further out.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.240
And here is the wave function.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.050
And let's look at this
thing that I have.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.730
Now, the turning point
in this one corresponds

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.410
to the E2 turning point.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.745
This is E1.

00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:37.380
And now this will go
in here, we'll turn,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:44.730
and we will go curve and
maybe do something like that.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.060
Because it's curving more
and more, and faster.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.790
So by the time you
reach here, this

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:56.790
is no good, because this
one will be symmetric.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.130
You know, you would have
an anti-symmetric one

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.820
that is no use.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.230
But now you don't have
a solution, again.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.570
So as you increase the energy,
this is starting to do this,

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.222
and that is not quite so good.

00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:18.850
And then when you go to E3, you
have a turning point over here.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.080
So maybe in this case
it will go up here

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:34.450
and it will start turning, and
it will turn enough to just--

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.490
this dip go to the origin.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:38.990
OK.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.480
You're saying no good either,
because this is terrible, this

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.100
continuous.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.460
But, ah, you were supposed to
draw the other one as well.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:54.290
The old one is actually
perfect for it.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.770
So this is dash,
it doesn't exist,

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:02.930
and this one matches here.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.900
So by the time the dip--

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.100
this is not a solution, but
the dip goes down and down,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.890
and eventually goes to zero,
it matches with this one.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.780
That's why I said sometimes you
don't know whether this matches

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.370
with the one that
comes from here

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.590
or the one that comes
from the bottom.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.700
So there you go.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.830
This is an energy
eigenstate again.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:31.360
It's odd and it has one node.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.300
And that gives you
the intuition how,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.870
as you sort of come from the
end and you reach the middle,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.710
you sometimes match things
or sometimes don't match.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.750
And explains why you
get energy quantization.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.400
The other way in which you're
going to gain intuition

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.830
is with the so-called
shooting method,

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.325
which is the last thing I
want to discuss for a minute.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.290
So the shooting method
in differential equations

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.540
is quite nice.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.030
Shooting method.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.840
Suppose you have a potential
that this symmetric may

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.078
be something like this--

00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:23.296
it doesn't look very symmetric.

00:10:26.677 --> 00:10:30.020
It looks a little better now.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.970
And you want to find
energy eigenstates.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.770
You do the following.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.620
You say, well, the normalization
of the energy eigenstates

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.480
is not so important.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.200
Let's look for even states.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.640
Now, you can look for
even or odd states

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.140
if the potential is symmetric.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.700
Sometimes the potential will
have a wall, in which case

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:08.990
you have to require a
symmetric potential.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.310
It's easy to solve, as well.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.275
But let's consider the case
when the potential is symmetric

00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:17.090
and you look for even states.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.410
So what you do is just,
say, you pick an energy.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:28.890
Pick some energy E0.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.400
And then you put some
boundary condition.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:37.730
You say that the wave
function at x equals 0 is 1.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.975
And then you say that the
derivative of the wave function

00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:45.170
at x equals zero is how much?

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.510
Any suggestion?

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.540
How much should it be?

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.440
You see, you have a second
order differential equation.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:01.380
The second psi is equal to E
minus V. That's the Schrodinger

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:01.880
equation.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.860
You need-- the boundary
conditions are the value of psi

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.800
and the derivative at one
point, and then the computer

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.720
will integrate for you.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.540
Mathematica will do it.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.430
But you have to give
me the derivative, so

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.270
what should I put?

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.380
A number there, 1, 2, 3?

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.420
Is that an unknown?

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.590
What should I pick?

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:30.340
We must put in the 0, because
if you had a wave function whose

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.350
derivative is not 0, and
it's an even wave function,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.230
it would look like this.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:40.410
And there would be a
discontinuity in psi prime--

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:41.400
discontinuous.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.410
And that's not possible
unless you have a hard wall

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.600
or you have a delta function.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.520
So you must put this.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.830
And then you
integrate numerically.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.990
Numerically.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.620
And what will happen?

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.920
Well, if you
integrate numerically,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:11.050
the computer is just going to
integrate and see no problem.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.110
Basically, it's just
going to do the interview.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.860
Ask the computer to calculate
the wave function out

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.920
to x equal 5, it
will calculate it.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.610
So the problem is that--

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:27.630
you can see visually,
if you pick some energy,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.960
the wave function will
do like something,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.135
and then will start blowing up.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.810
And then you say,
oh, that energy

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:46.820
is no good because the wave
function won't be normalizable.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.790
And then you go
back to the computer

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.030
and change the
energy a little bit,

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.766
and then you will
find, well, maybe this.

00:13:56.766 --> 00:14:00.210
Now it blows up in
the other direction.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.930
No good either.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:06.700
But in some energy in
between, as you change,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.700
there must be one
in which it does

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.020
the right thing, which is BK.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.620
Somewhere in between.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.852
And numerically, you change
the value of the energy,

00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:20.810
you go-- in the shooting
method, when you shoot

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.110
it either goes up or down.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.980
And you start working
within those two numbers

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.350
to restrict it
until you get here.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:33.400
If you have a solution
with five-digit accuracy,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.180
it will do this, this,
this, and then blow up.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.530
If you have a solution
with 10 digits after it,

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.460
it will do this and go up
to here and blow up again.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:48.100
You need 500-digits
accuracy to get that wall.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.460
But it's a fun thing that you
can do numerically and play

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.450
with it.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.830
You can calculate five digits
accuracy, ten digits accuracy

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.280
within a matter of minutes.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.430
It's very practical,
and it's very nice,

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:07.550
but one thing you have to
do is clean up your equation

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.830
before you start.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:13.120
You cannot have an equation in
Mathematica with h-bar and m

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.380
and all that.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.830
So you have to clean up the
units, is the first step,

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.060
and write it as an equation
question without units.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.840
Your And this plots very
nicely in Mathematica,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.430
and you will have
lots of practice.

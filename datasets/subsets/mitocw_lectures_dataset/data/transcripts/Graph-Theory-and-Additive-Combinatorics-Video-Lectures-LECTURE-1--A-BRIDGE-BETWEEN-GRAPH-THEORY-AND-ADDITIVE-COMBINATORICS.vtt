00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.000
YUFEI ZHAO: OK,
let's, get started.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.390
Welcome to 18.217.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.970
So this is combinatorial
theory, graph theory,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.220
and additive combinatorics.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.470
So course website is up there.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.520
So all the course
information is on there.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.070
So after around the
middle of the class,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.790
I'll say a bit more about
various course information,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.840
administrative things.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.650
But I want to jump directly
into the mathematical content.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.380
So this course
roughly has two parts.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.990
The first part will
look at graph theory,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.700
in particular problems
in extremal graph theory.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.770
In the second part,
we'll transition

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.110
to additive combinatorics.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.390
But these are not two
separate subjects.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.170
So I want to show you
this topic in a way that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.890
connects these two
areas and show you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.333
that they are quite
related to each other.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.750
And many of the
common themes that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.880
will come up in one
part of the course

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.610
will also show up in the other.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.550
So the story between
graph theory and additive

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.420
combinatorics began
about 100 years ago

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.030
with Schur, the famous
mathematician, Isaai Schur.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.290
Well, he was like
many mathematicians

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.850
of his era trying to prove
Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.480
So here's what's
Schur's approach.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.540
He said, well, let's look at
this equation that comes up

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.870
in from Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.170
And, well, one of the methods
of elementary number theory

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.510
to rule out solutions
to an equation

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.870
is to consider what
happens when you mod p.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.380
If you can rule out for
infinitely many values

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.040
p, possible non-trivial
solutions to this equation mod

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.380
p, then you will rule out
possibilities of solutions

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.600
to Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.790
OK, so this was
Schur's approach.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.990
As you can guess, unfortunately,
this approach did not work.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.320
And Schur proved that this
method definitely doesn't work.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.620
So that's the starting
point of our discussion.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.150
So it turns out that
for every value of n,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.600
there exists
non-trivial solutions

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.870
for all p sufficiently large.

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:55.950
So thereby, ruling
out the strategy.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.750
So let's see how Schur
proved his theorem.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.310
So that will be the first
half of today's lecture.

00:03:06.697 --> 00:03:08.530
So this seems like a
number theory question.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.405
So what does it have to
do with graph theory?

00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:12.710
So I wanted to show
you this connection.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.040
Now, Schur deduced his
theorem from another result.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.690
That is known as
Schur's Theorem, which

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.820
says that if be
positive integers

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:38.310
is colored using
finitely many colors,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:47.520
then there exists a
monochromatic solution

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.520
to the equation x
plus y equals to z.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.240
So if you give me
10 colors and color

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.370
the positive integers
using those 10 colors,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.170
then I can find
for you a solution

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.190
to this equation where x, y,
and z are all of the same color.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.680
Now, this statement--

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.140
OK, so it's a perfectly
understandable statement.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.370
But let me rephrase it in
a somewhat different way.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.820
And this gets to a
point that I want

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.150
to discuss where many statements
in additive combinatorics

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.600
or just combinatorics in general
have different formulations,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.360
one that comes in an
infinitary form, which

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.870
is more qualitative so to
speak and another form that

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.910
is known as finitary.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.260
And that's more
quantitative in nature.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.820
So Schur's Theorem is
stated in a infinitary form.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.420
So it tells you if you color
using finitely many colors,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.180
then there exists a
monochromatic solution.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.970
So many, but not all,
statements of that form

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.770
have an equivalent finitary form
that is sometimes more useful.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.200
And also, once you stay
the right finitary form,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.370
you can ask
additional questions.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.380
So here's what Schur's Theorem
looks like in the equivalent

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.310
finitary form.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.940
You give me an r.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:37.320
For every r, there exists
some N as a function of r,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.750
such that if the
numbers 1 through N--

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.810
so throughout this course, I'm
going to use this bracket N

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.510
to denote integers up to N--

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:02.210
so if these numbers are
colored using our colors,

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:09.890
then necessarily, there exists
a monochromatic solution

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.490
to the equation x
plus y equals to z,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:22.690
where x, y, and z are in the
set that is being colored.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.970
So it looks very similar to
the first version I stated.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.560
But now, there are
some more quantifiers.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.800
So for every r,
there exists an N.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.290
So why are these two versions
equivalent to each other?

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.400
So it's not too hard to
deduce their equivalence.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.520
So let me do that now.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.260
The fact that the
finitary version

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.190
implies the infinitary
version claims

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.170
should be fairly obvious.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.820
So once you know the
finitary version,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.060
if you give me a coloring of
the positive integers, well

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.740
I just have to look
far enough up to this N

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.930
and I get the conclusion I want.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.986
But now, in the
other direction--

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.790
so in the other direction--

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.670
suppose I fix to this r.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.483
So, OK, so I assume
the infinitary version.

00:07:19.483 --> 00:07:21.150
I wanted to deduce
the finitary version.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.610
So I start with this r.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.160
And let's suppose the
conclusion were false.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.390
So supposed the
conclusion were false,

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:43.480
namely for every N there
exists some coloring--

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.426
so for every N there
exists some coloring--

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.100
which we will call
phi sub N, that

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:10.240
avoids monochromatic solutions
to x plus y equals to z.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.810
So I'm going to use this Chi
for shorthand for monochromatic.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.710
So suppose there
exists such a coloring.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.130
And now, I want to take
this collection of colorings

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:27.060
and produce for you a coloring
of the positive integers.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.620
And you can do this basically
by a standard diagonalization

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.150
trick.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:46.070
Namely, we see that by taking
an infinite subsequent,

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.450
such that--

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.410
so let me call this infinite
sub-sequence phi of--

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:59.660
phi sub-- well, so it's infinite
sub-sequence of this phi sub N,

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:09.330
such that phi sub N
of k stabilizes along

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:15.100
the sub-sequence for every k.

00:09:34.744 --> 00:09:39.140
OK, so you can do this simply
by diagonalization trick.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:48.540
And then, we see that
along the sub-sequence phi

00:09:48.540 --> 00:10:06.470
N converges point-wise to some
coloring of the entire set

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.460
of positive integers.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:17.910
And this coloring avoids
monochromatic solutions

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.080
to x plus y equals to
z, because if there

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.260
were monochromatic
solutions in this coloring

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.550
of the entire integers,
then I can look back

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.293
to where that came from.

00:10:29.293 --> 00:10:31.710
And that would have been the
monochromatic solution in one

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.850
of my phi N's.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.980
So this is an
argument that shows

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.350
the equivalence between the
finitary form and infinitary

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.370
form.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.710
But now, when we look
at the finitary form,

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.380
you can ask additional
questions, such as,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:52.165
how big does this N have
to be as a function of r.

00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:55.280
It turns out those kind
of questions in general

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.540
are very difficult. And
we know some things.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.140
For this type of questions,
we know some bounds usually.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.630
But the truth is
usually unknown.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.070
And there are
major open problems

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.130
in combinatorics of this type.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.330
So there's still a lot
that we do not understand.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.500
OK, so now we have Schur's
Theorem in this form.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:24.350
Let me show you how to deduce
his conclusion about ruling out

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.360
this approach to proving
Fermat's Last theorem.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.630
The claim is the following that
if you have a positive integer

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:12.700
n, then for all
sufficiently large primes p,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:19.120
there exists x, y,
and z, all belonging

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:28.180
to integers up to p minus 1,
such that their n-th powers

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.310
add up like this.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.850
So it's a solution to
Fermat's equation mod p.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.520
All right, so how
can we deduce this

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.450
from what we said
about coloring?

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.380
So what is the coloring?

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.680
OK, so here's what Schur
did, so proof assuming

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.750
for now Schur's theorem.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.240
So let's look at the
multiplicative group

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.850
of non-zero residues, mod p.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.220
So we know it's a cyclic group
because there's a generator.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.860
So there's a primitive
root generator.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:23.435
Let H denote the
subgroup of n-th powers.

00:13:32.152 --> 00:13:36.040
Well, H is a pretty
big subgroup.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.650
So what's the index of H in
this multiplicative group?

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.210
It's at most M.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.930
So think about representing
this as a cyclic group using

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:55.960
a generator.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:01.230
So H then would be all the
elements whose exponent

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.970
is divisible by M. So
this the index is at most

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.180
M. It could be smaller.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.880
But it's at most M.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.790
And so in particular,
I can use the H cosets

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:23.687
to partition the multiplicative
group of non-zero residues.

00:14:23.687 --> 00:14:24.520
And this is a color.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.740
Virtual partition is the
same thing as a coloring.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.140
There is a bounded
number of colors.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.480
But I let peek at large.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:49.150
So by Schur's theorem if
p is sufficiently large,

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:57.540
then one of my cosets
should contain a solution

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.200
to x plus y equals to z.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.980
What does that look like?

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:13.970
So that one coset, one H coset,
course that contains x, y, z,

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:21.760
such that x plus y
equals to z as integers.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.800
They belong to the same coset.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:39.390
So x, y, and z belong
to some coset of H,

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:47.040
which means then that x equals
to a times n-th power with a y

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.040
equals to a times some
n-th power and little z

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.760
equals to a times
some n-th power.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.380
You have this equation.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.130
Put them together.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.090
So that is true.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.600
So now mod p, I
can cancel the a's.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.090
And this produces a
non-trivial solution

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.460
to Fermat's equation, mod p.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.770
OK, so this was the
proof of this claim

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.430
that this method does
not work for solving

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.160
Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.190
But, you know, we assumed
this claim of Schur's theorem

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.060
that every finite coloring
of the positive integers

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.290
contains a monochromatic
solution to x plus y

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:44.800
equals to z.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.660
So we still need to
prove that claim.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.302
So we still need to prove
this combinatorial claim.

00:16:49.302 --> 00:16:51.010
And so that's what
we're going to do now.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.359
This is where graph
theory comes in.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.359
So let me state a very
similar-looking theorem

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.280
about graphs.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.793
And this is known
as Ramsey's theorem,

00:17:27.793 --> 00:17:29.960
although Ramsay's theorem
actually historically came

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.590
after Schur's theorem, but
Ramsey's theorem, here, we're

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.230
going to use it specifically
in the case for triangles.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.620
So what does it say?

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.460
That if you give me an
r, the number of colors,

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.920
then there exists
some large N such

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:13.043
that if the edges of the
complete graph, K sub N,

00:18:13.043 --> 00:18:26.870
along N vertices are
colored using r colors,

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:32.990
then there exists a
monochromatic triangle

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.907
somewhere.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.371
Any questions so far about
any of these statements?

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.260
So let's see how Ramsay's
theorem for triangles

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:54.760
is proved.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.890
By the way, I want to give you
a historical note about Frank

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.010
Ramsey.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:17.830
So he's someone who made
significant contributions

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.770
to many different areas,
not just in mathematics.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.010
So he contributed to seminal
works in mathematical logic

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.280
where this theorem came
from, but also to philosophy

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.230
and to economics before his
untimely death at the age of 26

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.520
from liver-related problems.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.670
So he's someone whose very short
life contributed tremendously

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.870
to academics.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.590
So let's see how Ramsay's
theorem, in this case,

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.780
is proved.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.830
We'll do induction on
r, the number of colors.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.580
So for every r, I need
to show you some N,

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.430
such that the statement is true.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:07.040
In the first case, when r equals
to 1, there's not much to do.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.080
Just one color, if I
just have three vertices,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.830
that already is OK.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.220
Three vertices, that's already
a monochromatic triangle.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.390
So from now on, let
r be at least 2.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:35.480
And suppose the claim
holds for r minus 1 colors,

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:42.440
with N prime being the
corresponding number

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.280
of vertices with
r minus 1 colors.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.185
So now let me pick
an arbitrary vertex.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.290
So pick an arbitrary vertex
v and look what happens.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.810
So here's v.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.620
And let me look at
the outgoing edges.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:16.930
So we'll show that
N being r crimes

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.650
N prime minus 1 plus 2 works.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.260
So now, we have a lot
of outgoing edges.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.120
In particular, we
have r times N prime

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.530
minus 1 plus 1 outgoing edges.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:45.820
So by the pigeonhole
principle, some color--

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:56.180
so there exists at least
N prime outgoing edges

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:05.110
with the same color,
let's say, yellow.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.370
So suppose yellow is
the outgoing color.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.420
And let me call
the set of vertices

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.460
on the other end
of these edges v0.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.736
So now let's think about
what happens in v0.

00:22:24.736 --> 00:22:41.020
So in v0, either v0 contains
a yellow edge, in which case

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.880
you get a yellow triangle.

00:22:53.002 --> 00:22:56.163
Or we lose the color inside v0.

00:22:56.163 --> 00:22:57.580
So the number of
colors goes down.

00:23:00.835 --> 00:23:11.680
Else v0 has at most
r minus 1 colors.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:22.090
And v0 has at least N
prime number of vertices.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:32.600
So by induction, v0 has
a monochromatic triangle

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.030
in the remaining colors.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.880
So that completes the proof of
Ramsay's theorem, in this case,

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.860
for triangles.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.337
And if you wish to find out
what is the bound that comes out

00:23:49.337 --> 00:23:51.420
of this argument, well,
you can chase to the proof

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.212
and get some bound.

00:23:55.098 --> 00:23:57.140
The remaining question
now is, what does this all

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.990
have to do with Schur's theorem?

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.760
So so far, we've talked
about some number theory.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.320
We've talked about
some graph theory

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.350
and how to link these
two things together.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.850
And I think this
is a great example.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.520
It's a fairly simple
example, which

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.240
I'm about to show you of how to
link these two ideas together.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.985
And this connection,
we'll see many times

00:24:16.985 --> 00:24:18.110
in the rest of this course.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.650
I don't want to erase
Schur's theorem.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.390
So let me--

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.510
So let's prove Schur's theorem.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.190
So let's start with a coloring.

00:25:10.174 --> 00:25:14.130
So let's start with the
coloring of 1 through N.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.510
And I want to form
a graph with colors

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.090
on the edges that
are somehow derived

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.210
from this coloring
on these integers.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.070
And here's what I'm going to do.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.110
So let's color the
complete graph-- let's

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:46.320
color the edges of the complete
graph on the vertex set

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.470
having N plus 1 vertices,
labeled at integers

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:54.160
up to positive integers
up to N plus 1.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:08.060
But by the Ramsey result we just
proved, if N is large enough,

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.910
then there exists a
monochromatic triangle.

00:26:21.867 --> 00:26:22.950
So what does it look like?

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:30.900
So let me draw for you a
monochromatic triangle.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.280
Suppose it-- so I haven't told
you what the coloring is yet.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.290
So the coloring
is that I'm going

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:43.090
to color the edge
between i and j,

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:48.460
using the color derived by
applying phi to the number

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.150
j minus i, namely the
length of that segment

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.800
if I lay out all the
vertices on the number line.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.550
So now have an r coloring
of this complete graph.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.010
So Ramsey tells us
that there exists

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.260
a monochromatic triangle.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:10.510
The triangle sits on
vertices i, j, and k.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:18.670
And the rule tells us that the
colors are phi of k minus i,

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:23.470
phi of j minus i,
and phi of k minus j.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.660
So these three numbers,
they have the same coloring.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:41.060
But, look, if I set these
numbers to be x, y, and z--

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.540
so x being j minus
i, for instance--

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.970
then x plus y equals to z.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:53.960
And they all have
the same color.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.420
So this monochromatic
triangle gives us

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.990
a monochromatic
equation, 2x plus y

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:11.810
equals to z, thereby concluding
the proof of Schur's theorem.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.660
OK, so this rounds out the
discussion for now of--

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:21.090
well, we started with some
statement about number theory.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:25.960
And then we took this
detour to graph theory,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.920
looking at Ramsay's theorems
of monochromatic triangles,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.140
and then go back
to number theory

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:36.140
and proved the result
that Schur did.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.260
So how does go to graphs help?

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.940
So why was this advantageous?

00:28:45.642 --> 00:28:46.600
What do you guys think?

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:58.530
So I claim that by
going to graphs,

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:04.710
we added some extra flexibility
to what we can play with.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.620
For example, we started
out with a problem

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.370
where there were only
N things being colored.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.670
And then we moved to
graphs where about--

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:19.510
well, N choose 2 or N squared
objects are being colored.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.840
And then we did an
induction argument.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.570
So remember in the proof of
Ramsey's theorem up there,

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.900
there was an induction
argument taking all vertices.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.340
And that argument doesn't
make that much sense

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.155
if you stayed
within the numbers.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.620
Somehow moving to
graphs gave you

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.310
that extra flexibility
allow you to do more things.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.440
And this is one
of the advantages

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.480
of moving from
problem about numbers

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.430
to a problem about graphs.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.030
And we'll see this
connection later on as well.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.090
Yeah?

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.590
AUDIENCE: Sort of
related to that.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.590
Are there better bounds
known for this specific,

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.340
like Schur's result
of that power on e,

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.590
because the N's here
would be pretty bad.

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:10.317
YUFEI ZHAO: Right, so Ashwan
asked, so what about bounds?

00:30:10.317 --> 00:30:11.650
So what do we know about bounds?

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:14.298
So I don't know off the
top of my head the answers

00:30:14.298 --> 00:30:15.090
to those questions.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.940
But in general,
they're quite open.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.880
So there are exponential gaps
between lower and upper bounds

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.122
on our knowledge of what
is the optimal N you

00:30:23.122 --> 00:30:24.080
can put in the theorem.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.057
Any more questions?

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.280
All right so, I think this is
a good point for us to-- so

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.770
usually when I give
90-minute lectures,

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.920
I like to take a short
2-minute break in between.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.880
So I want to do that.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.350
And then in the
second half, I want

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:47.940
to take you through a tour
of additive combinatorics.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.020
So tell you about some of
the modern developments.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.720
Now, this is an exciting
field where it started out,

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.500
I think, roughly with Schur's
theorem that we just discussed.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.300
That started about
100 years ago.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.510
But a lot has taken place
in the past century.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.720
And there's still a lot of
ongoing exciting research

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.470
developments.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.280
So in the second
half of this lecture,

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.110
I want to give you a tour
through those developments

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.970
and show you some
of the highlights

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.428
from additive combinatorics.

00:31:16.428 --> 00:31:17.970
So let's take a
quick 2-minute break.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:22.506
And feel free to ask
questions in the meantime.

00:31:22.506 --> 00:31:24.280
So another part of
the writing assignment

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.970
in addition to course
notes is a contribution

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:32.198
to Wikipedia, which is, you
know, nowadays, of course,

00:31:32.198 --> 00:31:34.115
you know, if you hear
some word like Szemeredi

00:31:34.115 --> 00:31:36.280
's regularity lemma
the first thing you do

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.570
is type into Google.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.760
And more often than not the
first link that comes up

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.610
is Wikipedia.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.260
And, you know, some
of the articles,

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.940
they are all right, and some of
them are really not all right.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.480
And it would be fantastic
for future students

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:56.100
and also for yourselves
if there were better entry

00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.540
points to this area by having
higher quality Wikipedia

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.330
articles or articles
that are simply

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.530
missing about specific topics.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.145
So one of the assignments--

00:32:07.145 --> 00:32:08.520
again, this can
be collaborative.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.895
So I'll give you
more information

00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:11.010
how to do that later--

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:14.340
is to contribute to
Wikipedia and roughly

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.500
contribute one high
quality article

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.540
or edit some
existing articles so

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.280
that they become high quality.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:21.780
Yep.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.986
AUDIENCE: Can we
something similar to LMDB

00:32:24.986 --> 00:32:27.880
with creating a website
that has all the information

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.007
needed in combinatorics?

00:32:30.007 --> 00:32:31.590
YUFEI ZHAO: So we
can talk about that.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.770
So if there are other
ideas about how to do this,

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.363
we can definitely open
the chatting about that.

00:32:37.363 --> 00:32:38.780
So the other thing
is that instead

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.680
of holding the usual office
hours, what I like to do is--

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.170
so this class ends at 4:00 PM.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.330
So after 4:00, I'll go
up to the Math Common

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:49.090
Room, which is
just right upstairs

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.360
and hang out there for a bit.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.340
If you have questions, you
want to chat, come talk to me.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.050
I'd be happy to chat about
anything related or not related

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:58.030
to the course.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.290
And before homeworks
are due, I will

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.890
try to set up some special
office hours for you

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.215
in case you want to ask
about homework problems.

00:33:06.215 --> 00:33:08.090
And if you want to meet
with me individually,

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.970
please just send me an email.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:11.720
Oh, one more thing
about the course notes.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.290
So because I want to
do quality control,

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:19.910
so here is the process that will
happen with the course notes.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.890
So the first lecture
is already online.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:22.940
So you can already see.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.790
So I've written up the lecture
notes for the first lecture.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.620
And you can use
that as an example

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.210
of what I'm looking for.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.098
So I'm looking for
people to sign up

00:33:32.098 --> 00:33:33.640
starting from the
next lecture, and I

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.470
will send out a link tonight.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:41.040
For future lectures, so
whoever writes the lecture,

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.290
I'll the lecture, and
then within one day, so

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:48.250
by the end of the day
after the lecture,

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:51.080
it will be good if
they were already

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.065
at least some sketch,
some rough draft at least

00:33:53.065 --> 00:33:54.440
containing the
theorem statements

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.390
and whatnot from
the day's lecture.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:01.100
So that the next person can
start writing afterwards.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.290
But once you are
done, once you feel

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.740
that you have a polished version
of the lecture, write up,

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.810
ideally within four
days of the lecture--

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.230
so that in terms of
expectations and timelines,

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.480
again all of this
information is online--

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.150
so you're finished with
polishing your lecture notes,

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.120
within four days send me an
email, so both co-authors

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.310
if there are two of
you, and I will schedule

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:25.100
an appointment,
about half an hour,

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.600
where I will sit
down with you to go

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.630
through what you've written
and tell you some comments.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.790
So you can go back
and polish it further.

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.699
And hopefully, that will
just be a one round thing.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:37.670
If more rounds are needed,
well, it's not ideal,

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:42.199
but we'll make it happen until
the notes are ready to use

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.429
for future generations.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:50.150
OK, any questions about any
of the course logistics?

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.699
All right, so in the second
half of today's lecture,

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.630
I want to take you through
a tour of modern additive

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.830
combinatorics.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.320
And this is an area
of research which

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.000
I am actively involved in.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.130
And it's something that
I am quite excited about.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.010
And part of the reason
why I teach this course--

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:10.980
this course is something that
I developed a couple years ago

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.810
when I taught for
the first time then--

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.730
because I want to
introduce you guys

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:20.370
to this very active and
exciting area of research.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:25.040
Now, what is added
combinatorics?

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.360
The term itself is
actually fairly new.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.450
So the term, additive
combinatorics, I believe

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:35.190
was coined by Terry Tao back
in the early 2000s as somewhat

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:39.990
of a rebranding of an area that
already existed, but then got

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.390
a lot of exciting developments
in the early 2000s.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:47.460
It's a deep and far reaching
subject with many connections

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.600
to areas like graph theory,
harmonic analysis, or Fourier

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.730
analysis, ergodic theory,
discrete geometry, logic

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:00.540
and model theory, and has many
connections all over the place,

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.000
and also has many deep theorems.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.880
So let me take you through a
tour historically of, I think,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.700
some of the major
milestones and landmarks

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.702
in additive combinatorics.

00:36:12.702 --> 00:36:15.060
So after Schur's theorem,
which we discussed

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:19.370
in the first half
of today's lecture,

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:24.640
the next big result I would say
is Van der Waerden's theorem,

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.210
which was 1927.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:36.390
Van der Waerden's theorem
says that every coloring

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:49.610
of the positive integers
using finite many colors

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:55.029
contains arbitrarily long
arithmetic progressions.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.050
So we'll see arithmetic
progressions come up a lot.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.730
So from now on we'll
abbreviate this word by AP.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:17.420
So AP stands for
Arithmetic Progressions.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.450
So instead of Schur's
theorem where you just

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:22.070
find a single solution
to x plus y equals to z,

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:26.020
so now, we're finding a
much bigger structure.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.750
Keep in mind, so a
novice mistake people

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.440
make is to confuse arbitrarily
long arithmetic progressions

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.580
with infinitely long.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.562
So these are definitely
not the same.

00:37:35.562 --> 00:37:36.520
So you can think about.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.310
I'll leave it to you as
an exercise, well, also

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:43.270
homework exercise, that you can
color the integers with just

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.820
two colors in a
way that destroys

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.570
all possible infinitely long
monochromatic arithmetic

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.130
progressions.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.980
So arbitrarily long is very
different from infinitely long.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:38:00.100
Now, so this was a great result,
but it provokes more questions.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:12.020
So Erdos-Turan in the
'30s, they asked--

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:16.490
well, they conjectured
that the true reason in Van

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.970
der Waerden's theorem of having
long arithmetic progressions,

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.340
it's not so much
that you're coloring.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.550
It's just because if you
use finitely many colors,

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:30.110
then one of the color classes
must have fairly high density.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.800
So one of the classes if you use
r colors has density at least 1

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.940
over r.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:43.000
And they conjectured
that every subset

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:54.400
of the positive integers, or the
integers with positive density,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:02.040
contains long--

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.827
so arbitrarily long
arithmetic progressions.

00:39:08.373 --> 00:39:10.040
You may ask, what
does it mean, density?

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.910
So you can define density
in many different ways.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.770
And it doesn't
actually really matter

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.450
that much which
definition you use.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.280
But let me write
down one definition.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.100
So you can define given
a subset of integers

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.100
the upper density, or
rather, let me just

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:38.680
say that it has positive
upper density, if when we take

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:44.450
the lim sup as n goes to
infinity and look at we'll

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:48.980
take a scaling window and look
at what fraction of that window

00:39:48.980 --> 00:40:02.700
is a, then this number,
this limit sup is positive.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.340
So that's one definition
of positive density.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.075
There are many other
definitions, sometimes known

00:40:08.075 --> 00:40:09.470
as the Banach density.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:11.830
And you can take variations.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.680
I mean, for the purpose
of this discussion,

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.350
they're all roughly equivalent.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:19.230
So let's not worry too
much about which definition

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:22.150
of density we use here.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.550
All right, so Erdos
and Turan conjectured

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:26.820
that the true reason for
Van der Waerden's theorem

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.480
is that one of the color
classes has positive density.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.530
And this turned out to be an
amazingly prescient question

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.120
and that one had to
wait several decades.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.710
So this conjecture was
made in the '30s, in 1936.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.350
So you had to wait several
decades before finding out

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.100
what the answer is.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:52.870
So in a foundational
theorem, in the subject

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.330
known as Roth's theorem--

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:58.278
so Roth proved it in the '50s.

00:40:58.278 --> 00:40:58.820
I think '53--

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.520
Roth proved that, I
think, '53, in the '50s--

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.590
that k equals to 3 is true.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:25.330
So if I say that it
contains k term, arithmetic

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.610
progressions for every k.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.180
And Roth proved that
every positive density

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.340
subset contains a 3-term
arithmetic progression.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:37.160
And already, Roth introduced
very important ideas

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.427
that we will see in this
course in two different forms.

00:41:40.427 --> 00:41:42.010
So in the first half
the course, we'll

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.860
see a graph theoretic
proof that was found later

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.433
in the '70s of Roth's theorem.

00:41:47.433 --> 00:41:48.850
And then in the
second half, we'll

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:52.800
see Roth's original proof
that used Fourier analysis.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.220
So Fourier analysis
in number theory

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.620
is also known as the
Hardy-Littlewood circle method.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.230
It's a powerful method in
analytic number theory.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:04.730
But there are very interesting
new ideas introduced by Roth as

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:10.900
well in developing this result.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.615
The full conjecture was
settled by Szemeredi.

00:42:17.663 --> 00:42:19.080
It took another
couple of decades.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:29.980
So in the late '70s, Szemeredi
proved his landmark theorem

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:34.330
that confirmed the
Erdos-Turan conjecture.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:36.600
Szemeredi's theorem
is a deep theorem.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.090
So this theorem
is the proof, what

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:43.500
the original combinatorial
proof is a tour de force.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.290
And you can look
at the introduction

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:51.600
of his paper, where there is
an enormously complex diagram--

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.490
so you can see this
in the course notes--

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.270
that lays out the logical
dependencies of all the lemmas

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.040
and propositions in his paper.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.280
And even if you assume every
single statement is true,

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.650
looking at that diagram,
it's not immediately clear

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:07.170
what is going on because
the logical dependencies are

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:08.740
so involved.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:14.320
So this was a really
complex proof.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.910
But not only that, Szemeredi's
theorem actually motivated

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.030
a lot of subsequent research.

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.700
So later on, researchers
from other areas

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.720
came in and found also
sophisticated proofs

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.230
of Szemeredi's theorem
from other areas

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.470
and using other
tools, including--

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.140
and here are some of the
most important perspectives,

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.180
later perspectives, of
Szemeredi's theorem.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:44.630
So there was a proof
using ergodic theory

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:48.120
that followed fairly
shortly after Szemeredi's

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.810
original proof.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.170
This is due to Furstenberg.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.890
And initially, it wasn't clear,
because all of these proofs

00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:59.010
were so involved.

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:03.890
It wasn't clear if the ergodic
theoretic proof was genuinely

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:08.390
something new, or it was a
rephrasing of Szemeredi's

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.250
combinatorial proof.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.050
But then very quickly
it was realized

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:15.830
that there were extensions
of Szemeredi's theorem,

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:19.280
other combinatorial results
that the ergodic theorists could

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.450
establish using their methods,
so using the same methods

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:25.220
or extensions of
the same methods

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:29.440
that combinatorialists
did not know how to do.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.420
And to this date,
there are still

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.690
theorems for which
the only known proofs

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.812
use ergodic theory,
so extensions

00:44:37.812 --> 00:44:38.770
of Szemeredi's theorem.

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:40.600
And I will mention
one later on today.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:47.020
So that's one of
the perspectives.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:50.710
The other perspective that
was also quite influential

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.750
there is something known
as higher order Fourier

00:44:52.750 --> 00:45:07.000
analysis, which was pioneered
by Tim Gowers' in around 2000.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.840
So Gowers won the
Fields Medal, party

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.850
for his work on
Banach spaces but also

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:15.910
party for this development.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.520
So higher order Fourier
analysis is in some sense

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.800
an extension of Roth's theorem.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.140
So anyway, Roth also
won a Fields Medal,

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.330
although this is not
his most famous term.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:27.700
I'll say his second
most famous theorem.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.450
So Roth used this
Fourier analysis

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:36.000
in the sense of Hardy-Littlewood
to control 3-term arithmetic

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.140
progressions.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.240
But it turns out
that that method

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.820
for very good
fundamental reasons

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:45.930
completely fails for 4-term
arithmetic progressions.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.600
So we'll see later in the
course why that's the case,

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.080
why is it that you cannot do
Fourier analysis to control

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.640
4-term APs.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.970
But Gowers managed to find a
way to overcome that difficulty.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:58.800
And he came up
with an extension,

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.810
with a generalization
of Fourier analysis,

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.360
very powerful, very
difficult to use, actually.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.380
But that allows you to
understand longer arithmetic

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:11.570
progressions.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:15.410
Another very
influential approach

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:17.599
is called hypergraph regularity.

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:26.130
So the hypergraph
regularity method

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:36.190
was also discovered in the early
2000s independently by a team

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:40.830
led by Rodl and also by Gowers.

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:47.220
So the hypergraph
regularity method

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.130
is an extension of what's known
as Szemeredi's regularity,

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:53.740
Szemeredi's graph
regularity method.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.360
And this is the
method that will be

00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.100
a central topic in the
first half of this course.

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:04.120
And it's a method that is
quite central, or at least some

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.680
of the ideas quite central,
to Szemeredi's method.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.900
And he gave an
alternative proof.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.970
He and Ruzsa gave an alternative
proof of Roth's theorem

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.030
using graph theory.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:17.210
And for a long time,
people realized

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.630
that one could extend some of
those ideas to hypergraphs.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:23.570
But working out how
that proof goes actually

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.730
took an enormous amount
of time and effort

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:31.030
and resulted in this amazing
theorem on hypergraph.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.380
Let me mention these are
not the only methods that

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.630
were used to extend
Szemeredi's theorem

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:38.040
or give alternate proofs.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.790
There are many others.

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.850
For example, you may
have heard of something

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:44.110
called the polymath project.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.530
Raise your hand if you heard
of the polymath project.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:47.070
OK, great.

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.920
So maybe about half of you.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:54.030
So this is an online
collaborative project

00:47:54.030 --> 00:48:00.150
started by Tim Gowers and also
famous people like Terry Tao.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:04.170
And they were all quite involved
in various polymath projects.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.800
And the first successful
polymath project

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.670
produced a combinatorial
proof of something

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.860
known as the density
Hales-Jewett theorem.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:22.840
So I won't explain
what it this here.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:26.120
So it's something which
is related to tic tac toe.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.770
But let me not go into that.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:32.260
So it's a deep combinatorial
theorem that had they

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.480
known earlier using
ergodic theoretic methods,

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.350
but they gave a new
combinatorial proof,

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:41.200
in particular gave some
concrete bounds on this theorem

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.760
and that in particular also
implies Szemeredi's theorem.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.500
So this gave a new proof.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.140
And as a result, they--

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.020
it's an online
collaborative project--

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:55.840
so they published this paper
under the pseudonym DHJ

00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:03.452
Polymath, where DHJ stands
for Density Hales Jewett.

00:49:03.452 --> 00:49:04.910
And they kept the
same name for all

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:06.740
of the subsequent
papers published

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.440
by the polymath project.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.180
So as you see through
all of these examples

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.750
that there a lot of
work that were motivated

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:19.370
by Szemeredi's theorem.

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:21.460
This is truly a
foundational result,

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.190
a foundational
theorem that gave way

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.770
to a lot of important research.

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:32.540
And Szemeredi himself
received an Apple Prize

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.162
for his seminal contributions
to combinatorics and also

00:49:36.162 --> 00:49:37.370
theoretical computer science.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.980
We still don't
understand in some sense

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.960
completely what
Szemeredi's theorem--

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.410
you know, for example, we do
understand the optimal bounds.

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.660
And also more importantly,
conceptually, we

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.720
don't really understand
how these methods are

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.740
related to each other.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.680
So there's some vague
sense that they all

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.100
have some common things.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:06.340
But there is a lot of mystery as
to what do these methods coming

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.460
from very different areas--

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.278
ergodic theory,
harmonic analysis, you

00:50:10.278 --> 00:50:12.070
what do they all have
to do with each other

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.260
but there is central theme.

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:20.110
And this is also going to be
a theme in this course, which

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:21.220
goes under the name--

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:24.520
and I believe Terry Tao is the
one who popularized this name--

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:35.420
the dichotomy between structure
and randomness, structure

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.387
and pseudo randomness.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:46.930
Somehow it's a really fancy way
of saying signal versus noise.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:51.640
So I give you some object, I
give you some complex object,

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.740
and there is some
mathematical way

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:59.980
to separate the structure
from some noisy aspects, which

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.690
behave random-like.

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.760
So there will be many
places in this course

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:09.210
where this dichotomy will
play an important role.

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.010
Any questions at this point?

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:24.020
I want to take you through some
generalizations and extensions

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.630
of Szemeredi's theorem.

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:28.940
So first, let's
look at what happens

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.100
if we go to higher dimensions.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:39.100
Suppose we have a
subset in D dimensions,

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.190
d-dimensional lattice.

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:44.250
So we can also define
some notion of density.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.200
Again, it doesn't
matter precisely what

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.680
is the notion you use.

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:57.520
For example, we can say that
it has a positive upper density

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:12.882
if this lim sup is positive.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.460
So Szemeredi's theorem
in one dimension

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.335
tells us that if you have some
sort of positive density, then

00:52:22.335 --> 00:52:26.550
I can find arbitrarily long
arithmetic progressions.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:28.860
So what should the
corresponding generalization

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.760
in higher dimensions?

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.350
Well, here's a notion
that I can define, namely

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:55.030
that we say that a contains
arbitrary constellations

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:57.972
to mean that--

00:52:57.972 --> 00:52:58.930
so what does that mean?

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:00.555
So a constellation,
you can think of it

00:53:00.555 --> 00:53:04.920
as some finite pattern, so a
set of stars in the sky, so

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:05.500
some pattern.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:09.970
And I want to find that
pattern somewhere in a, where

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:11.360
I'm allowed to dilate.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.970
So I'm allowed to do to
multiply pattern by some number

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:18.206
and also translate.

00:53:18.206 --> 00:53:20.320
So on the finite pattern--

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:27.150
so what I mean precisely is
that for every finite subset

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:40.420
of the grid, there exists some
translation and some dilation,

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:47.200
such that once I apply this
dilation and translation

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:56.490
to my pattern F, meaning I'm
looking at the image of this F

00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:00.730
under this transformation,
then this set lies inside a.

00:54:03.901 --> 00:54:07.030
So you see that
arithmetic progressions

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:11.040
is the constellation,
just numbers 1 through k.

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.822
So that's a definition.

00:54:15.822 --> 00:54:17.780
And the multi-dimensional
Szemeredi's theorem--

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.910
so the multi-dimensional
generalization

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:37.500
of Szemeredi's theorem says
that for every subset--

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:43.980
so every subset of the
d-dimensional lattice

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:54.350
of possible density contains
arbitrary constellations.

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:06.540
You give me a pattern,
and I can find

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:11.180
this pattern inside a, provided
that a has positive density.

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:21.010
So in particular, if I want to
find a 10 by 10 square grid,

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:26.910
so meaning suppose I want to
find a pattern which consists

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:35.380
of something like that, a
10 by 10 square grid, where

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.710
all of these lengths
are equal, but I

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.000
don't specify what they are.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.450
But as long as they are equal,
then the theorem tells me

00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:46.810
that as long as a
has positive density,

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:51.100
then I can find such
a pattern inside a.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:55.300
So this theorem was proved
by Furstenberg and Ketsen.

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:03.530
So you see that it is a
generalization of Szemeredi's.

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:06.530
So the one-dimensional case is
precisely Szemeredi's theorem.

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:13.580
So Furstenberg and Ketsen,
using ergodic theory

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:18.510
showed that one can
generalize Szemeredi's theorem

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.740
to the multi-dimensional
setting.

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:23.610
However, the
combinatorial approaches

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:26.680
employed by Szemeredi did
not easily generalize.

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:30.600
So it took another couple
of decades at least

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.840
for people to find a
combinatorial proof

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.780
of this result. And
namely that happened

00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:40.750
with the hypergraph
regularity method.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:44.305
So this was one of the
motivations of this project.

00:56:44.305 --> 00:56:45.680
And you say, OK,
what's the point

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.805
of having different proofs?

00:56:46.805 --> 00:56:50.540
Well, for one thing it's nice
to know different perspectives

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.820
to important theorem.

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:56.610
But there's also
concrete objective.

00:56:56.610 --> 00:57:00.150
In particular, it turns out
that if you prove something

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:04.100
using ergodic theory, because--

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:06.690
we will not discuss ergodic
theory in this course.

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:10.550
But roughly, one of the
early steps in such a proof

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:13.330
applies compactness.

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:16.150
And that already
destroys any chance

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:18.940
of getting concrete
quantitative bounds.

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:23.920
So you can ask if I want
to find a 10 by 10 pattern

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:32.090
and I have density 1%, how
large do I need to look?

00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:34.980
How far do I have to look in
order to find that pattern?

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.710
So that's a
quantitative question

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:39.790
that is actually not at all
addressed by ergodic theory.

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:44.500
So the later methods using
combinatorial methods

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.410
gave you concrete bounds.

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:49.310
And so there are some
concrete differences

00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:50.380
between these methods.

00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:57.040
So this theorem
reminds me of the scene

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.400
from the movie a
Beautiful Mind, which

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.700
is one of the greatest
mathematical movies

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:04.450
in some sense.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:08.020
And so there's a scene
there where Russell Crowe

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:11.640
playing John Nash--

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.730
so there were at
this fancy party.

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:17.780
And Nash was with his
soon to be wife, Alicia.

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.670
And he points to the sky
and tells her, pick a shape.

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:24.683
Pick a shape and I can find
for you among the stars.

00:58:24.683 --> 00:58:26.850
And so this is what the
theorem allows you to do it.

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.540
So give me a shape
and I can find

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:35.230
that constellation inside a.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.464
Let's look at other
generalizations.

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:47.120
So far, we are looking
at linear patterns.

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.070
So we're looking at linear
dilations and translations.

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:53.040
But what about
polynomial patterns?

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.450
So here's a question.

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:58.230
Suppose I give you a dense
subset, a positive density

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:00.240
subset of integers.

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:06.590
Can you find two numbers whose
difference is a perfect square?

00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:08.470
So this question
was asked by Lovasz.

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:14.310
And a positive answer was given
in the late '70s by Furstenberg

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:16.749
and Sarkozy independently.

00:59:28.485 --> 00:59:33.460
So Furstenberg and Sarkozy,
they showed using different

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:37.280
methods-- so one ergodic
theoretic and the other is more

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.340
harmonic analytic--

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:47.110
that every subset of the
integers, so every subset

00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:56.460
of positive integers,
with positive density

00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:04.530
contains two numbers
differing by a perfect square.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.800
So in other words,
we can always find

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.340
the pattern x plus y squared.

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:24.670
So what about other
polynomial patterns?

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:27.130
Instead of this y
squared, suppose you just

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:30.820
give me some other
polynomial or maybe

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.500
a collection of polynomials.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.960
So what can I say?

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.110
Well, there are some things
for which this is not true.

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.210
Can you give me an
example where if I

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:42.852
putting the wrong
polynomial it's not true?

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.100
What if the polynomial
is the constant 1?

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:55.880
If you take the even
numbers, has density 1/2,

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.520
but it doesn't contain any
patterns of x and x plus 1.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.610
So I need to say some hypotheses
about these polynomials.

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:07.200
So a vast generalization
of this result,

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:17.420
so known as polynomial
Szemeredi theorem,

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:30.340
says that if A is a subset of
integers with positive density,

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:38.860
and if we have these
polynomials, P1 through Pk

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:51.460
with integer coefficients
and zero constant terms,

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.520
then I can always
find a pattern.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:02.200
So there exists some x
and positive integer y

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:10.140
such that this pattern, x
plus P1 of y, x plus P2 of y,

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:18.530
and so on x, plus Pk of
y, they all lie in A.

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:22.630
So in other words, succinctly,
every subset of integers

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:25.885
with positive density contains
arbitrary polynomial patterns.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.628
So this was proved--

01:02:30.628 --> 01:02:32.170
so this was an
important result proof

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:41.090
by Bergelson and Liebman
using ergodic theory.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:44.340
And so far for this
general statement,

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:49.382
the only known proof
uses ergodic theory.

01:02:49.382 --> 01:02:50.965
So there was some
recent developments,

01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:52.423
recent pretty
exciting developments

01:02:52.423 --> 01:02:55.280
that for some
specific cases where

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.460
if you have some additional
restrictions on the P's, then

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:01.130
there are other methods
coming from Fourier analytic,

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:04.372
harmonic analytic methods
that could give you

01:03:04.372 --> 01:03:06.580
a different proof that allows
you to get some bounds.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:11.260
Remember, the ergodic
proof gives you no bounds.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:14.150
But so far, in general,
the only method known

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:16.000
is ergodic theoretic.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.110
And actually,
Bergelson and Liebman

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:21.080
proved something which is more
general than what I've stated.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:26.278
So this is also true in a
multidimensional setting.

01:03:26.278 --> 01:03:28.820
I won't state that precisely,
but you can imagine what it is.

01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:39.347
Let me mention one more theorem
that many of you I imagine

01:03:39.347 --> 01:03:39.930
have heard of.

01:03:42.343 --> 01:03:43.760
And this is the
Green Tao theorem.

01:03:48.853 --> 01:03:54.390
So the Green Tao theorem
says that the primes

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:57.525
contain arbitrarily long
arithmetic progressions.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.210
So this is a famous theorem.

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:12.840
And it's one of the
most celebrated results

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.460
of the past couple of decades.

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.660
And it resolved some
longstanding folklore

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.350
conjectures in number theory.

01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:21.790
The Green Tao
theorem, well, you see

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:25.480
that in form it looks somewhat
like Szemeredi 's theorem.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.110
But it doesn't follow
from Szemeredi 's theorem.

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.555
Well, the primes, they
don't have positive density.

01:04:30.555 --> 01:04:31.930
The prime number
theorem tells us

01:04:31.930 --> 01:04:35.870
that density decays
like 1 over log n.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:39.200
So what about quantity versions
of Szemeredi 's theorem?

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.910
It is possible.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:43.580
Although we do not know how
to prove such statement,

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.370
it is possible that
a density of primes

01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:51.930
alone might guarantee the
Green Tao theorem in that it

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.030
is possible that
Szemeredi 's theorem

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:59.010
is true for any set
whose density decays

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:02.100
like the prime numbers,
like 1 over log n.

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.890
But no we're quite far from
proving such a statement.

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:08.330
And that's not what
Green and Tao did.

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:14.560
Instead, they took Szemeredi
's theorem as a black box

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.520
and applied it to some
variant of the primes

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.240
and showed that
inside this variant,

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.070
Szemeredi 's theorem
is also true,

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:28.890
and that the primes sit inside
this variant of the primes,

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:32.880
known as pseudo primes, as a set
of relatively positive density,

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.060
but somehow
transferring Szemeredi

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.940
's theorem from the dense
setting to a sparser setting.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.110
So this is a very
exciting technique.

01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:46.160
And as a result, Green-Tao
proved not just that the primes

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.340
contain arbitrarily long
arithmetic progressions,

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:56.480
but every relatively dense,
so relatively positive

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:05.120
density subset, of the
primes contains arbitrarily

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.053
long arithmetic progressions.

01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:13.240
To prove this theorem
they incorporated

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.850
many different ideas coming
from many different areas

01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:20.790
of mathematics, including
harmonic analysis,

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:24.870
some ideas coming from
combinatorics, and number

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:25.690
theory as well.

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:28.710
So there were some innovations
at the time in number theory

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:31.180
that were employed
in this result.

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.350
So this is certainly
a landmark theorem.

01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:38.520
And although we will
not discuss a full proof

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.680
of the Green-Tao theorem, we
will go into some of the ideas

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.780
through this course.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.725
And I will show
you bits and pieces

01:06:44.725 --> 01:06:46.350
that we will see
throughout the course.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:53.740
So this is meant to be
a very fast tour of what

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.550
happened in the last 100 years
in additive combinatorics,

01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:00.280
taking you from Schur's
theorem, which was really

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.680
about 100 years
ago, to something

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.710
that is much more modern.

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:08.680
But now, instead of
being up in the stars,

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.250
let's come back down to Earth.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:13.940
And I want to talk about
what we'll do next.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.720
So what are some of the
things that we can actually

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:23.200
prove that doesn't
involve taking up 50 pages

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.070
using a complex logical diagram,
as Szemeredi did in his paper.

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:29.700
So what are some of the simple
things that we can start with?

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:33.440
Well, so first, let's go
back to Roth's theorem.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.670
So Roth's theorem, we
stated it up there.

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:39.385
But let me restate it
in a finitary form.

01:07:43.256 --> 01:07:45.580
So Roth's theorem
is the statement

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:52.960
that every subset of
integers 1 through n that

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.630
avoids 3-term
arithmetic progressions

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:05.380
must have size little
o of N. So earlier we

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.110
gave an infinitary
statement that if you

01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:10.470
have a positive density
subset of the integers

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:12.340
that it contains
a three AP, this

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:16.359
is an equivalent
finitary statement.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:19.930
Roth's original proof
used Fourier analysis.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:24.220
And a different proof was
given in the '70s by Rusza

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.460
and Szemeredi using
graph theoretic methods.

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:31.270
So how does graph theory
have to do with this result?

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:34.060
And this shouldn't be
surprising to this point, given

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:38.830
that we already saw how we
used Ramsay's theorem, graph

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:40.750
theoretic result, to
prove Schur's theorem,

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.800
which is something that
is number theoretic.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:46.029
So something similar happens.

01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:50.120
But now, the question is what
is the graph theoretic problem

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.029
that we need to look at?

01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:56.000
So for Schur's theorem it was
Ramsey's theorem for triangles.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.750
But what about for
Roth's theorem?

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:02.930
A naive guess is the following.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.050
So what's the question
that we should ask?

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.930
Here's a somewhat naive
guess, which turns out

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.670
not to be the right
question, but still

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:15.649
an interesting
question, which is

01:09:15.649 --> 01:09:30.662
what is the maximum number of
edges in a triangle-free graph

01:09:30.662 --> 01:09:31.659
on n vertices?

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:39.109
Now, this is not
totally a stupid guess,

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:44.569
because as you imagine from what
we said with Schur's theorem,

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:47.600
somehow you want to
set up a graph so

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.760
that the triangles correspond
to the 3-term arithmetic

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.100
progressions.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.930
And you want to set
it up in such a way

01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:57.890
that this question about what's
the maximum size subset of 1

01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:00.350
through n without
3 APs translates

01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:03.350
into some question about what's
the maximum number of edges

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:07.155
in a graph that
has some property?

01:10:07.155 --> 01:10:09.220
So what is that property?

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.120
So this is not a
totally stupid guess.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:16.320
But it turns out this
question is relatively easy.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.540
Still it has a name.

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:23.570
So this was found by
Mantel about 100 years ago,

01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:24.790
so known as Mantel's theorem.

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:32.432
And the answer, well,
we'll see a proof.

01:10:32.432 --> 01:10:34.390
So the first thing we'll
do in the next lecture

01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:39.210
is prove Mantel's theorem, but
I do want to hold suspense.

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:40.900
I mean the answer,
it turns out to be

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.490
fairly simple to describe.

01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:45.130
Namely that you split
the vertices into two

01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:46.930
basically equal halves.

01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:52.900
And you join all the possible
edges between the two halves.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:58.290
So this complete bipartide graph
with two equal-sized parts.

01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:01.438
And it turns out this graph,
you see this triangle-free

01:11:01.438 --> 01:11:03.730
and also turns out to have
the maximum number of edges.

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:04.945
Yeah, question.

01:11:04.945 --> 01:11:07.735
AUDIENCE: What are asymptotics
for three arithmetic

01:11:07.735 --> 01:11:08.458
progression of--

01:11:08.458 --> 01:11:10.250
YUFEI ZHAO: Let me get
to that in a second.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:14.186
OK, so I'll talk about
asymptotics in a second.

01:11:14.186 --> 01:11:16.910
So it turns that this is not the
right graph theoretic question

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:17.410
to ask.

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:21.298
So what is the right graph
theoretic question to ask?

01:11:21.298 --> 01:11:22.340
I'll tell you what it is.

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:25.210
I mean it shouldn't be
clear to you at this point.

01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:28.450
It still seems like an
interesting question,

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:32.720
but it's also somewhat bizarre
to think about if you've never

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.170
seen this before.

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:39.750
So what is the maximum
number of edges

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:53.290
in an n vertex graph, where
every edge lies in exactly one

01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:53.790
triangle?

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:06.050
So I want a graph with
lots and lots of edges

01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:10.140
where every edge sits
in exactly one triangle.

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.530
Now, you might have
some difficulty even

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:15.110
coming up with good graphs
that have this property.

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.890
And that's OK.

01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:19.290
These are very strange
things to think about.

01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:21.820
But we'll see many
examples of it later on.

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:27.120
We'll also see
how Roth's theorem

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.730
is connected to this
graph theoretic question.

01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:32.500
Just to give you
a hint, you know,

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.050
where does exactly one
triangle come from,

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:39.370
it's because even if you avoid
3-term arithmetic progressions,

01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:41.770
there are still these
trivial 3-term arithmetic

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:45.910
progressions, where you keep
the same number three times.

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:47.330
And in graph
theoretic world, that

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:51.961
comes to the unique triangle
that every edge sits on.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:01.450
So to address the question
about quantitative bounds,

01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:06.080
for Roth's theorem, it
turns out that we have

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.880
upper bounds and lower bounds.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.160
And it is still a
wide open question

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.310
as to what these
things should be.

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:16.820
And roughly speaking,
the best lower bound

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.860
comes from a construction,
which we'll see later

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:25.810
in this course, the higher size
around n divided by e to the c

01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:28.210
root log n.

01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:40.745
And the best upper bound is of
the form roughly n over log n.

01:13:40.745 --> 01:13:42.370
That's maybe a little
bit hard to think

01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:44.480
about how these numbers behave.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.590
So if you raise both
sides to-- the denominator

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:50.970
to e to the something, then
it's maybe easier to compare.

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:52.320
But it's still a pretty far gap.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.470
So still a pretty big gap.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.590
There's a famous conjecture
of Erdos some of you

01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:00.430
might have heard
of, that if you have

01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:02.290
a subset of the
positive integers

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:05.440
with divergent
harmonic series, then

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:10.090
it contains arbitrarily
long automatic progressions.

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:11.830
That's a very
attractive statement.

01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:14.440
But somehow I don't like
the statement so much,

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.140
because it seems to
make a too pretty.

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.940
And the statement
really is about what

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:24.430
is the bounds on Roth's theorem
and on Szemeredi 's theorem.

01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:27.610
And having divergent
harmonic series

01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:34.030
is roughly the same as trying
to prove Roth's theorem slightly

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:36.490
better than the bound
that we currently have,

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:38.500
somehow breaking this
logarithmic barrier.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.950
So that conjecture, that having
divergent harmonic series,

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:45.548
implies 3-term
APs is still open.

01:14:45.548 --> 01:14:46.340
That is still open.

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.940
So where the bound's very
close to what we can prove,

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:51.160
but it is still open.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.710
For this question, we will
see later in this course,

01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:59.380
once we've developed Szemeredi
's regularity lemma that we

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:07.310
can prove an upper bound of o
to the n squared, so little n.

01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:11.916
And that will suffice for
proving Roth's theorem.

01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:13.450
It turns out that
we don't know what

01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:14.680
the right answer should be.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.180
We don't know what is
the best such graph.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.790
And it turns out the
best construction

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:25.590
for this graph there comes from
over here, the best lower bound

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:28.710
construction of a
set, of a large set

01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:31.090
without 3-term
arithmetic progressions.

01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:34.350
So I'm giving you
a preview of more

01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:37.050
of these connections between
additive combinatorics on one

01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:40.370
hand and graph theory
on the other hand

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:42.750
that we'll see
throughout this course.

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:48.020
Any questions?

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:48.560
OK.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.610
So just to tell you what's
going to happen next,

01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:52.820
so the next thing that
we're going to discuss

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:55.480
is basically extremal
graph theory.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.360
And in particular, if you
forbid some structure,

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.900
such as a triangle, maybe a four
cycle, maybe some other graph,

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.020
what can you say about the
maximum number of edges?

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:11.207
And there are still a lot of
interesting open problems,

01:16:11.207 --> 01:16:11.790
even for that.

01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:15.940
I forbid some H. What's the
maximum number of edges?

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:20.360
So the next few lectures
will be on that topic.

MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: My
name is Michael Holzwarth,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.980
as Philip said.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.440
First and foremost, I'd like
to thank you guys in advance

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.040
for giving me the opportunity
to, for lack of better terms,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.300
drone on about drones for
about a half hour here.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.390
Today, I'll briefly be covering
the part 107 guidelines,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.060
the differences
between hobby flying

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.970
and 107 commercial flying,
different policies, procedures,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.870
and my experience thus
far in the industry.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.210
At any time, if you
guys have any questions,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.090
feel free to interrupt.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.003
I don't mind.

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.420
And I'm going to leave some
time at the end for questions.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.970
And if any of you guys want to
come up and check out the bird

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.330
up here, please feel free.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.465
All right.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:54.840
This first slide
is going to talk

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
a little bit about my journey
thus far in the UAV industry,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.460
or UAS.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.280
Bought my first drone in 2014
to take with me on a trip

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.920
to Hawaii, edited
up some footage,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.860
posted my content to
YouTube, and got a little bit

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.540
of semi-viral success--

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.390
about 50,000 views.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.300
And then a licensing company
actually reached out to me

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.910
and said, hey, we want to
utilize some of your footage.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.780
We want to sell it.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.062
We like it.

00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:22.020
And I just said, man, I
just made this for fun.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.950
I can make money doing this.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.670
This is great.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.790
And saw a little side
revenue stream there.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.975
After I started making
a little bit of money,

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:32.850
I was kind of hooked.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.000
And when the first
round of 107 exams

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.100
took place roughly
two years ago,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.570
I told my father
at East Coast, I

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.410
want to be the very first person
in the state to take that exam.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.040
I passed.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.680
I was the first person in
the state of Massachusetts

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.000
to hold the 107.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.263
That reign of terror
lasted roughly five minutes

00:01:50.263 --> 00:01:51.930
till the kid next to
me passed his test.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.320
And then there was two.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.140
I then had some local success.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.980
Next, I made a video, as
Phillip was alluding to,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.330
on Cape Cod over at Wellfleet.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.360
If any of you are familiar
with the Beachcomber.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.220
I absolutely love that place.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.889
Went and flew my drone
there, posted a video.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.200
All the local news
channels picked it up.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.440
And about two weeks later,
I received a nice $1,500

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.250
fine from the ranger
station in Cape Cod.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.440
They fined me for--

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.700
what was it-- some kind of Piper
Plover Puffin bird out there.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.110
I was flying over a sanctuary.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.640
They were not happy with that.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.200
And I was operating a
UAS over a national park.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.450
I want to stress, though,
the FAA didn't fine me.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.680
It was the ranger service
that gave me the fine.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.200
I kind of chuckled at it,
because I made about $4,800

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.080
off the footage, and that made
the fine kind of worth it.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.470
In the fall of 2016, I
basically hit some viral gold.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.920
I took my drone up to
the Kancamagus Highway

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.070
during the fall, made a
nice little foliage video.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.260
Couple licensing
companies picked it up.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.310
And that very next day, it
ran on Good Morning America.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.270
I got some national attention
to the tune of about 4.7

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.340
million views on the video.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.440
Still counting-- people
still watching that thing

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.990
all the time.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.500
Especially in the fall,
it gets a lot of play.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.980
You might be wondering,
what does 4.7 million views

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.440
equate to in dollars?

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.400
I'll admit, it's not that much.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.440
I wish it was $1 a view,
but, unfortunately, is not.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.160
I think I made about
$10,000 off that.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.740
But something I was
just doing for fun,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.370
and I had no intention of
it going viral or getting

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.270
that kind of success.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.390
So it was definitely a plus.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.390
After I got that
national attention,

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.070
a local production
company called

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.582
Above Summit, here in
Somerville, contacted me.

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:47.790
Where you been all our lives?

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.140
Come work for us.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.500
And now I'm a production
coordinator and Lead Drone Op

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.090
over at Above Summit.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.020
Next slide.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.720
This slide, basically
just provide you

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.750
with some links to the full text
of regulations, introduction

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.660
material, and any other
relevant documents.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.770
You guys can take a look
at this on your own time.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.270
All right.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.730
Next, we're going to talk
a little bit about hobby

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.530
[? versus ?] 107.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.240
Let's talk about the difference.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.649
Hobby operation is
just how it sounds.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.160
You want to go out and take
some pictures of your kids

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.410
or do whatever, that's
on your own time.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.543
That's hobby.

00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:25.710
But if your intended use
is for anything commercial,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.010
you are required
to obtain a 107.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.700
Some examples-- real estate
photos, aerial surveying,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.452
thermal imaging,
search and rescue,

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:38.910
industrial pipeline inspection,
things of that nature even.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.820
If you're working for
or with a non-profit,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.147
you still have to
obtain your 107.

00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:47.480
PHILIP GREENSPUN: What are
the asterisks there, Michael?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.938
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
We'll get to it.

00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:49.980
We're getting there.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.020
So some basic
operating rules are

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.050
shared by both hobby
and 107 operators.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.700
You have to keep
visual line of site,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.650
must follow basic
safety guidelines,

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.018
maintain altitude of
400 feet or below.

00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:03.810
Something to note, like
Phillip was saying,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.770
you'll see these asterisk bullet
points on the right-hand side

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.350
under "107."

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.245
You can get waivers and
exceptions from the FAA

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:15.490
to kind of break these rules.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.490
We're going to talk a
little bit more about that

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.220
as the slides continue here.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.550
We'll circle back to that.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.840
Slide 4 talks about
multi-person crew.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.730
They don't tell
you that you have

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.110
to have a multi-person crew.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.910
Sometimes it's
really not needed.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.270
If you're working for, let's
say, a real estate company

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.687
and they want you to take some
photos of a residential house,

00:05:40.687 --> 00:05:42.520
you're standing right
in front of the house.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.440
You don't really need
a visual observer--

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.330
someone looking for obstructions
or things of that nature.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.670
You can pull it off yourself.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.930
But in more of a professional
setting, or depending

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.340
on the scope of your job that
you're using your UAS for,

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.090
having a visual observer
is definitely helpful.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.730
I have some buddies that work
in the industrial sector,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.120
inspecting pipeline
that's 30, 40 miles long.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.340
They actually use
10 visual observers.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.620
And they stage them with
radios and binoculars

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.430
along the pipeline,
just for added safety.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.930
And then they have
the operator kind

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.520
of cruising, walking with the
drone, if you will, sometimes.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.760
But my personal experience
on movie sets and things

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.700
of that nature, we operate
with a three-man crew.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.400
We have a visual observer,
a camera operator,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.690
and then someone behind the
wheel of this thing right here.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.490
You will notice
this camera on here

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.443
can be independently operated
by its own set of controls.

00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:41.860
And then the drone
can be operated

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.430
by its set of controls,
which allows you to get

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.500
more dynamic range of shots.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.730
Drone can be going this way.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.920
Camera can be panning
the other way.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.070
Drone can be rising up
as camera goes down.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.150
So it really brings
some versatility

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.860
to your shots and
things of that nature.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.570
The last bullet
point here mentions

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.390
that the drone operator
need not be certified,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.500
but a 107 operator
must be on-site.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.230
You might be wondering when
this would come into play.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.620
I get a lot of requests
from wedding people--

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.260
wedding people,
videographers, photographers,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.520
things of that nature.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.930
They look at the drone as kind
of another tool in their bag

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.420
to utilize when they're
doing their gigs

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.680
and things of that nature.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.080
They don't want to get a 107.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.150
They don't want the hassle.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.218
For them, it's easier
to pay me $100 just

00:07:33.218 --> 00:07:35.260
to show up and make sure
they're doing everything

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.840
on the up-and-up
and supervising.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.640
It always amazes
me, too, at weddings

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.250
why someone would want
this loud spinning machine

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.580
over their ceremony.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.580
While they're giving their
"I dos," all you hear

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.850
is [IMITATING DRONE].

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.790
Some people actually
want it for the video,

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.380
though, and want it for
prosperity, I guess.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.000
All right.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.470
Human factors in
decision-making-- alcohol

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.610
and drugs.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.650
Obviously, don't operate
under the influence,

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.737
no matter how tempting it is.

00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:06.820
Have a couple of beers,
want to fly on the beach--

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.155
not a smart idea.

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:10.780
Let's see here.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.018
Crew resource management--
this basically

00:08:13.018 --> 00:08:14.560
stated, the more
people you can bring

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.000
into the operation, the better.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.820
Nothing wrong with
an extra set of eyes.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.240
Fatigue and stress-- obviously,
not a good time to operate.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.960
Here's one of my favorites,
talking about attitudes.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.510
The FAA, they list
five attitudes--

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.830
anti-authority, macho,
impulsivity and vulnerability,

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.630
and resignation.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.610
The one I see the
most out there is

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.370
anti-authority, all the time.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.679
People want to fly where
they're not supposed to.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.900
They want to fly longer
than they should.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.510
They want to fly
in no-fly zones,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.810
800 feet by Logan,
right by the runway.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.170
That's just not
beneficial for the hobby,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.900
not beneficial for anybody.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.370
That Logan example--

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.460
Logan is actually currently
doing something about it.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.980
The company DJI, which
Philip mentioned earlier,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.900
they're actually the leader
in commercial drone systems.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.950
They recently came up with this
product called DJI Aeroscope.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.350
And what Aeroscope does,
whether it's a DJI drone or not,

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.770
if you fly into Logan airspace,
it will ping your bird.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.680
And it will tell them your
location and serial number.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.050
The serial number is going
to go right back to you.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.820
You're going to lose your 107.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.270
And you're going to
get some hefty fines.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.570
It's just not smart to fly in
Logan airspace or any airport

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.415
airspace, for that example.

00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:39.790
Why do you want to mess around
with the manned aircrafts?

00:09:42.712 --> 00:09:44.173
Let's see here.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.100
Next, we're going to get into
performance you'll basically

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.940
find the same performance issues
that you do with fixed wings,

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.860
but the drone,
obviously, is going to be

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.230
more sensitive to these issues.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.630
Things like high-density
altitude, humidity, weight,

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.340
high winds are all
examples of items

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.840
that are going to
negatively impact

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.450
the performance of your UAS.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.320
So definitely be
cautious of that.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:17.110
Loading-- I always like
talking about this.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.000
There is no book yet about how
to properly load these things.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.490
Now, this drone
that I brought in,

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.310
this only has a limited amount
of camera and imaging systems

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.800
that you can mount
here onto the drone.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.390
So this camera
actually comes off.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.490
This whole entire
three-axis gimbal system

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.750
here can mount off.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.400
And you can put
interchangeable--

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.312
if you wanted to put
thermal, let's say--

00:10:38.312 --> 00:10:40.020
let's say the police
call me, and they've

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.812
got somebody missing
or somebody kidnapped.

00:10:41.812 --> 00:10:43.600
And they think
they're in this area.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.300
I can do grid patterns
with thermal imaging

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.060
to find these guys.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.728
So that's this type of drone.

00:10:50.728 --> 00:10:53.020
But when we're on movie sets
and things of that nature,

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.700
we're using what-- the term we
call it is a heavy lift drone.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.310
We have a drone that has a
wing span of about 10 feet

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.510
from prop to prop.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.830
It's massive.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:08.680
It can hold up about 40 to 50
pounds on its own stabilizer.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.460
And the problem
is, is that there's

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.350
so many different
kinds of cameras

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.970
that this thing could mount.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.370
You could mount
an Arr Alexa Mini.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.340
You could mount
a Canon, a Sony,.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.590
Cameras that you see people
walking around the common,

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.410
taking pictures with, you can
mount on these types of drones.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.330
The issue is, they're
all different sizes.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.538
They're all different shapes.

00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:29.880
They're all different weights.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.560
And there's no real book on how
to properly mount these things.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.920
So what we do is
test, test, test.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.430
We go out to wide open fields.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.390
Here's a good example.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.390
Last month we did a
movie called Knives Out.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.450
If any of you have
seen James Bond, 007--

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.220
that actor, Daniel Craig.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.980
We were doing a movie for that.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.170
And they wanted
this about $100,000

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.470
camera mounted onto
the drone for the job.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.228
If that's not nerve-wracking
enough, flying $100,000--

00:12:03.228 --> 00:12:04.270
but then we were nervous.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.645
We were like, look, we've
never flown that camera before.

00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:08.730
We've never tested it on
this heavy-lift drone.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.060
So we actually made the studio
give us the camera for a week.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.010
We took it to a wide open field.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.630
We played around
with it for a while.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.983
And we got it
dialed in perfectly.

00:12:17.983 --> 00:12:19.650
The last thing you
want to do is show up

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.173
to a job and kind of
"wing it" with six figures

00:12:23.173 --> 00:12:25.590
worth of equipment, where
you're working around a guy that

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.270
gets paid $20 million a movie.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.490
It's just a recipe for disaster.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.680
So make sure you're
always testing

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.360
all the time,
especially if you're

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.632
loading different things.

00:12:36.632 --> 00:12:39.090
You could definitely have fun
with loading these things up,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.590
too.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.820
I was telling Philip
a story the other day.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.670
About five years ago, when
I had my first DJI Phantom,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.890
I mounted some Roman
candles on the landing gear,

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.220
chased my buddies around.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.220
So you could definitely
have some fun there.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.970
There's nothing in
the book about that.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.030
Moving on, drones at night--

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.010
you do need a waiver
to fly at night.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.770
And we'll get more into how
to apply for these waivers

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.776
and what portals you have
to go through with the FAA.

00:13:04.776 --> 00:13:07.600
The DroneZone is actually
for flying at night,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.690
and, again, I'll
get more into that.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.110
You can, however, operate-- we
like using the term golden hour

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.593
or civil twilight, if you will.

00:13:15.593 --> 00:13:17.010
The only rule is,
you have to have

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.160
a small strobe or
anti-collision lights on there.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.040
We always like to mount
on this drone right there,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.580
just to make sure we're not
getting anything in the camera

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.080
image.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.890
Or we don't want the footage
to show the strobe, obviously,

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.010
but we want to play it safe.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.290
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Michael, hold on a sec.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.890
So is there an official
mounting spot for a light here?

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.890
Or you just have to--

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.750
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Velcro.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.042
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Velcro it on?

00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:42.650
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Gorilla tape.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.083
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Interesting.

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:46.500
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
Let's see here.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.430
Regulatory fine print-- don't
be careless or reckless.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.290
Don't drop stuff.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.140
If you crash and it causes
significant damage, which

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.760
I believe the FAA considers
$500, you do have to report it.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.340
Luckily, I've never run into
that issue, which is nice.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.560
Pre-flight-- pre-flight is huge.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.830
Just like fixed wing, you
want to do pre-flight.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:13.080
You can see all the pre-flight
requirements here on the slide.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.140
In my personal
experience, I've seen

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.490
situations go very bad because
pre-flight has not happened.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.920
Literally, three weeks
ago, I had a buddy who

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.850
bought this same exact drone.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.780
Actually, it was a
version before this.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.450
This is a DJI Inspire 2.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.790
He had a DJI Inspire 1.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.710
It was very cold outside.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:37.250
And he just fired it up
and took off right away,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.410
did not pay attention
to his battery voltage.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:40.910
About eight minutes
into his flight,

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.770
his bird dropped like a rock.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.920
And that was about a $5,000
loss, just going out,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.300
having fun with your buddies.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.880
So pre-flight is
definitely something

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.310
that you want to
pay attention to.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.865
Personally, I double and
triple-check before taking off.

00:14:55.865 --> 00:14:56.990
A lot of times, what I do--

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.220
I'll do my walk around the drone
to make sure everything's good,

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.880
make sure connection
links are fine.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.513
And then what I'll
do, when I take off,

00:15:06.513 --> 00:15:08.930
I'll let it sit for about 30
seconds right in front of me,

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.220
five feet off the ground.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.582
I'll watch the controls.

00:15:11.582 --> 00:15:13.790
I'll watch everything, make
sure my gauges are right,

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.100
make sure I have good
connection to satellites,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.790
make sure it's GPS locked, make
sure my Return-to-Home button

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:24.470
is readily available and marked.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.350
These are expensive.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.623
This setup right here,
you're looking at $10,000

00:15:29.623 --> 00:15:30.290
into this thing.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.350
So a little extra
time pre-flight

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.320
is definitely worth it.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.080
Also, remember, pre-flight just
doesn't include only the drone,

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.580
as well.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.010
If you're working
with a multi-crew,

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.260
double-check your comm systems.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.700
Double-check your batteries.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.830
Double-check the props.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:49.080
Make sure they're not chipped--
things of that nature.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.590
This reminds me of one story.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.890
I actually did have a crash
once about three years ago.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.140
You guys know what stand-up
paddle-boarding is, right?

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.320
People stand up on the paddle
board, and they do this thing.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.900
I had a company ask me to film
them at night in Marblehead.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.740
And it was this big, open
bay with a ton of boats.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.390
So we had, like, 40
yards of open water

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.970
and then nothing but
a boat parking lot.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.330
And these guys at night were
going to put LED strip lights

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.410
all over them.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.290
They had these spotlights to go
under the water on the board.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.800
And they were going to do some
nighttime black light yoga

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.070
session out there in the water.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:31.830
Sure.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.510
If your check clears,
I'll go film it.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.580
No problem.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.080
So I say to myself, all right--

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.425
I'm looking at the situation.

00:16:38.425 --> 00:16:40.800
And I say, all right, there's
a bunch of boats out there.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.120
I do not want to hit them.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.320
It is going to be night.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.120
I will not see them
when I'm flying.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.320
What can I do?

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.630
So I walked up to where I
was going to launch from,

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.070
dip my piggies in the water
right there, and said,

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.330
all right, I'm going to fly the
drone out to the first boat.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.160
And I'm going to look
at my control set-up,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.840
and I'm going to note how
far away I am from the boats.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.650
I think I was 90 feet away.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.349
So I told myself mentally,
when it comes time

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.200
to film this at night, I
will not go past 90 feet,

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.690
or I'm going to hit a boat.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.910
What do you think the
problem with that is, anyone?

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.680
Anyone know what the problem
with that assessment is?

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.525
What else moves?

00:17:17.525 --> 00:17:18.150
AUDIENCE: Tide.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.358
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Thank you.

00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:20.280
The tide.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.660
I was a bonehead.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.760
I did not consider the tide.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.400
So about two hours later when
it came time to do the job,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.380
I put my piggies in the
same water right there.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.672
But guess where that water was?

00:17:29.672 --> 00:17:31.410
About 20 feet out.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.338
So I'm thinking to myself,
I got 90 feet to play with.

00:17:35.338 --> 00:17:35.880
I don't know.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.830
I want to say, one
of my last shots

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.312
I wanted to get, I had them
all lined up, all the lights.

00:17:41.312 --> 00:17:42.270
Everything looked cool.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.860
They're all doing a "yay."

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.720
And I wanted to
orbit around them.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.170
And halfway around my orbit,
I hear "crunch," "splash."

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.180
I hit a boat mast.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.400
Luckily-- very luckily--

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.870
the drone hit the mast.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.970
The battery came out
of the compartment.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.820
The battery is what
I heard splashing.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.570
The physical drone--
and more importantly,

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.950
the memory card
with my footage--

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.690
landed on the boat,
which one of the guys

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.690
ended up getting for me.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.997
So that was good.

00:18:05.997 --> 00:18:07.080
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Michael?

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.530
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Yes.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.947
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Quick question--

00:18:08.947 --> 00:18:13.443
I thought these drones had sonar
anti-collision systems like--

00:18:13.443 --> 00:18:14.610
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: These do.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:15.450
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, so why--

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.200
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
They most certainly do.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.750
And quite frankly, between--

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.000
I don't want to endorse this.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.640
You should always fly with
your obstacle avoidance on

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.980
and your vision positioning
sensors and things

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.270
of that nature.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.390
For me, personally, it
blows my shots all the time,

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.190
so I turn them off.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:32.190
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I see.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.290
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: If
this is a tip of a house

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.210
and I want to go over the house
and reveal what's behind it,

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.190
but I want to make
it look cinematic

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.920
and I want to clip that
roof real close and then

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.387
reveal what I'm
revealing, too many times

00:18:46.387 --> 00:18:47.470
I'd try to clip it close--

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:48.660
I'd hear "beep, beep, beep."

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.380
No, you can't.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.440
Your shot's now blown.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.160
So personally, I turn them off.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.320
For beginners, I'd recommend,
do not turn them off.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.850
Fly with them on
until you're very

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.248
comfortable with these things.

00:18:58.248 --> 00:18:59.290
Again, they're not cheap.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.870
They're expensive.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.260
PHILIP GREENSPUN: So a consumer
in that boat situation,

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.470
the drone wouldn't
have hit the boat,

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.330
because the anti-collision
system would have--

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.122
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: If
I had it on, correct.

00:19:08.122 --> 00:19:09.230
If I had it on, correct.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.370
You'll notice on the drone,
this is obstacle avoidance.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.180
This is obstacle
avoidance right there.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.700
It's got visioning
position system

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.500
on the back and an obstacle
avoidance on the back, as well.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.500
So they like to say
they're idiot-proof,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.900
unless you turn everything off.

00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:31.800
Next slide, we're going
to talk a little bit

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.280
about operating locally
here in the Boston area.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.710
In order to fly commercially
in the Boston area,

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.270
you have to be a 107.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.050
And you must obey, we
call it, the grid that ATC

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.570
at KBOS created.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.290
And let's just take a
look at the grid here.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.160
So you'll notice on this grid,
this is the local Boston area.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.260
Every little square
there has a number.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.000
That number
represents the height

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.540
that you can achieve if
you obtain the waiver.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.300
And you also have to
be 107-certified to fly

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.400
in this grid.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.583
You can do hobby
flights if you--

00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:16.000
theoretically, you're supposed
to call the tower if you're

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.962
doing a hobby flight
and make them aware

00:20:18.962 --> 00:20:20.920
that you're going to be
flying in the airspace.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.920
In my personal
experience, every time

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.990
I've called, no one picks up.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.880
You leave a voicemail.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.520
But if you are
flying commercially

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.650
and you are
107-certified, you do

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.190
need to pay specific
attention to this grid.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.680
For example, if I wanted
to fly in Boston Common,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.720
you can see right in that
area, there's 100 box there.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.030
So without a waiver,
since I'm 107-certified,

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:49.600
I am allowed to fly
100 feet in the Common

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.970
if I hold the
authorization to do so.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.367
And we're going to
get more into when

00:20:54.367 --> 00:20:56.950
do you go through the DroneZone
and when you go through LAANC.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.420
And we'll talk about
that in a second here.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.690
Any questions about the grid?

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:02.470
Anyone?

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.970
All right.

00:21:06.187 --> 00:21:07.360
AUDIENCE: I have a--

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.360
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Sure.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.552
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:10.552 --> 00:21:11.760
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Excuse me?

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.590
AUDIENCE: If I'm doing a
hobby flight, [INAUDIBLE]----

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.990
are they the same?

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.170
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: No,
it's kind of backwards,

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.087
to be honest with you.

00:21:19.087 --> 00:21:21.010
Theoretically, if
you're a hobby flyer,

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.920
they tell you you have
to be 400 feet or below.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.080
So in theory, if you
called Logan and said,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.912
hey, I'm flying in
the Common today

00:21:28.912 --> 00:21:30.370
and I just wanted
to let you know--

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.130
I'm just doing it for
fun and messing around--

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.110
theoretically, you
could fly 400 feet.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.832
Is that smart?

00:21:35.832 --> 00:21:37.540
No, because what's
going on around there?

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.270
Med flights, helicopters,
things of that nature.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.250
Ton of people underneath.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.980
I see it all the time.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.855
I'll walk down the public
garden or whatever.

00:21:46.855 --> 00:21:48.647
And I'll see people
taking off their drone,

00:21:48.647 --> 00:21:50.920
flying around like an idiot,
having a grand old time.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.940
And I'm just thinking
to myself, all

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.710
it's going to take is
for you to hit someone,

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.918
and you're going to be on
every news station tonight.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:59.450
All right.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:02.130
Let's get into a little
bit of the waiver process.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.390
There's two portals for
waivers and authorizations.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.750
One's called the DroneZone,
and one's called LAANC.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.750
The DroneZone is used
for night flights,

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.820
wide-area authorizations,
and exceptions,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.220
such as those asterisked
items that we were looking

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.590
at earlier, like
flying over people,

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.340
flying from a moving vehicle,
flying over 400 feet,

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.400
flying at night,
things of that nature.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.210
And also, the DroneZone is meant
for wide-area authorization.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.570
So I hold a bunch of
wide-area authorizations.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.610
That whole grid that
you saw, I basically

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.770
applied for the entire grid.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.690
So I applied through
the DroneZone,

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.425
said, hey, FAA, I work
commercial in the area.

00:22:41.425 --> 00:22:42.800
I don't want the
pain in the butt

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.467
of having to go through
the LAANC system

00:22:44.467 --> 00:22:45.560
every time I get a job.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.700
Just give me the entire grid.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.240
And that's good for two years.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.530
Now, the difference is, LAANC
is same-day authorization.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.710
So let's say I get
a job in Chicago,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.920
where I'm not always
operating out of.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.070
And I notice that the address
they gave me in Chicago

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.480
has a little box around it.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.860
It's class D airspace.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.200
And they say I can
only go 200 feet.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.510
Well, if I don't hold
a waiver for Chicago,

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.700
then I would use the
LAANC system just

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.830
to get authorization
for that one box

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.460
that I'm operating in for
that specific day and time.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.280
They will give that to
you within 24 hours.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.040
Now, for the wide-area
authorizations,

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.043
or if you wanted to fly at
night or over the grid box--

00:23:28.043 --> 00:23:30.210
if they say, hey, you can
only fly 100, but you say,

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.200
hey, the building I want
to film is over 200.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.570
I need 300 feet or
something of that nature.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.190
You have to go
through the DroneZone.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.130
Now, the problem
with the DroneZone

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.040
is that it's a two to
four-month waiting time.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.420
So it always behooves
you, especially if you're

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.160
going to work in
your local market,

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.785
to get these
authorizations beforehand.

00:23:49.785 --> 00:23:51.660
I don't know anyone
that's going to offer you

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.040
a job four months in advance.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.020
Hey, in four months, I want you
to film this down the street

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.650
here.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.930
Usually, these things
happen pretty fast.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.440
So it always behooves yourselves
to get all your authorizations

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.570
and get all your
waivers kind of in line.

00:24:09.422 --> 00:24:11.880
Next slide here, we're going
to talk about the certificate.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.100
Basically stated--
read the regs.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:14.680
Study up.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.443
Take the test.

00:24:17.443 --> 00:24:19.860
Personally, with my affiliation
with East Coast Aero Club,

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.540
they have a great
testing center,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.540
great people over there.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.780
So please make sure you
go East Coast Aero Club.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:30.910
Slide 16, certification
for traditional pilots--

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.080
take an online course.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.190
Apply through IACRA and
you're off and running,

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.530
or flying, as they say.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.240
Slide 17-- for you
guys in this class,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.550
you do have a couple options.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.750
Any private pilot
license holders out here?

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.310
Anyone?

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.810
Hey.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:47.560
All right.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.800
Private pilot's license--
no exams really required.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.960
If you do not hold a
private pilot's license,

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.980
you must schedule your 107 exam
at your local testing center.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.610
Slide 18, we're getting
back to the hobby and 107.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.370
We highlighted some of
these asterisked areas here.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.555
I can talk about these
a little bit more.

00:25:09.555 --> 00:25:11.305
This is all about the
power of the waiver.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.070
For example, about six months
back, the Discovery Channel

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.970
was down here.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.290
And they asked us to do--

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.580
they had a restored Viking ship.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.880
And they were taking that
Viking ship from Nova Scotia

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.560
and sailing it down
the East Coast.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.960
And the Discovery Channel was
doing this big documentary

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.480
show about it and
how the journey went

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.390
and the problems
that they ran into.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.940
But for me, the problem
I was running into

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.730
is, I have to fly from a boat,
which is a moving vehicle.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.410
I had to be over 400 feet.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.080
And they wanted some of
those shots at night.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.607
Luckily, we had all
these waivers in place.

00:25:49.607 --> 00:25:51.440
If not, we would have
had to tell them, hey,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.390
it's going to take
two to four months

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:53.815
for us to get these waivers.

00:25:53.815 --> 00:25:55.690
And they would have went
to the next company.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:26:00.210
So it always pays to have these
waivers and authorizations

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:00.710
in place.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.360
This is embarrassing.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.810
Slide 19 is some of the recent
accomplishments and projects

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.460
that I've been working on.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.965
Few A-list names up there.

00:26:17.965 --> 00:26:19.590
What I can say,
locally in this market,

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:23.340
is, we have seen a major spike
in TV and movie productions

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:27.660
being made in New England,
specifically in Massachusetts.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.730
It's been great for
us, which is fantastic.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.460
Keeps us extremely
busy, which is great.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.280
Hiring gigs are fun.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.590
They are lucrative, as well.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:43.070
The problem is, there
is a lot of pressure.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:47.195
When I was doing the Equalizer
2 movie, we're flying--

00:26:47.195 --> 00:26:48.820
we actually used this
drone right here.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.490
And they wanted me to fly the
thing over Denzel Washington's

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.630
shoulder.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.420
And I'm saying to myself, man,
one gust of wind or mistake,

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.700
I could slice this
guy's face open.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.870
So there is a lot of
pressure associated with it.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.140
Directors and DPs--

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.330
Directors of
Photography-- they want

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.990
things done the first time.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.540
Time is money.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.560
Imagine if you were--

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.640
there's one time where I
was chasing a motorcycle,

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.530
and there were some
explosions going off.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.810
It took six hours to
rig those explosions.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:22.310
They're only going
to go off once.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.310
If you mess the shot up,
it's going to cost them

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.440
another $6,000 to rig up.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.842
It's going to take half a
day of time to do it again.

00:27:27.842 --> 00:27:29.300
So there's a lot
of pressure to get

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.340
it done right the first time.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.230
But generally, these jobs
are few and far between.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.940
The primary jobs
that we usually do--

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.750
marketing and
promotional videos,

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.400
documentaries, things
of that nature--

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.835
can be a little less pressure.

00:27:44.835 --> 00:27:46.460
But once you get into
the upper epsilon

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.370
of doing feature films
and things of that nature,

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.330
be on your A-game.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.080
All right.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.780
A little bit about life on set.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.630
Higher end productions,
you can expect about $2,000

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.835
a day per operator,
which is lovely.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.160
Even the visual
observer, making sure

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.892
that we're not hitting power
lines or things of that nature,

00:28:10.892 --> 00:28:12.850
the guy's just looking
up and paying attention.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.090
He's making a great
day's pay there.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.490
But again, there is
a lot of pressure.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.510
That $2,000 per day--

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.440
I need to note, too--

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.660
that's not including gear
rental insurance and media

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.827
rental and everything else
that comes along with it.

00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:26.790
So I work for a company
called Above Summit,

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.270
as I mentioned,
here in Somerville.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.950
They're usually charging
$20,000, $30,000 a day

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.300
when we're on a movie.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.480
That's just a little piece
of what the operators see.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.500
We generally work
in a three-man crew.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.320
When you're on TV and movies,
it can be extremely humbling,

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.440
as well.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.827
A lot of times
we'll nail a shot.

00:28:46.827 --> 00:28:47.910
The director will love it.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.020
Everyone will say,
oh, that's great.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.340
You did such a great job.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.923
Then the TV show
comes out, and you're

00:28:51.923 --> 00:28:53.190
like, where's my footage?

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.050
They don't use it sometimes.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.520
And you get kind of
bummed out about it.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.260
So it can be a
humbling experience.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.920
You could spend weeks
and hours on set,

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.100
flying, creating footage,
getting them content,

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.130
and barely any of
it will be used.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.740
I was talking earlier
about the Equalizer movie

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.420
with Denzel that I did.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.090
Seven days on set-- got
them roughly two hours

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.020
of raw footage.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.440
And about seven seconds
made the final movie.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.000
I love the seven
seconds, but wish

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.100
there was a little bit more.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.350
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Michael,
what was the 12 days on set

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.940
to 12 seconds in the final cut?

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.020
Which movie was that?

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.130
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
Oh, I think-- yeah,

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.255
that was the Equalizer one.

00:29:33.255 --> 00:29:35.160
Maybe it was 12
seconds, not seven.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.810
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
And why bring a book?

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:37.490
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
I'm getting there.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.070
PHILIP GREENSPUN: OK,
you're getting there.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.903
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: I'm
getting there, buddy.

00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:42.420
The bring-a-book
thing-- don't literally

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.930
bring a book, because you'd
just look pretty silly.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.760
The main point of the
bring-a-book thing

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.700
is, it can be extremely boring.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.200
You got to remember,
the whole movie

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.060
is not made with this thing.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.600
They're generally doing action
sequence with the drone,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.248
tracking shots, establishing
shots, top-down,

00:30:01.248 --> 00:30:02.790
where you're high
up and the camera's

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.380
pointed straight down--
things of that nature.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.270
But there's about 30
other camera equipment

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.070
and people out
there that are also

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.780
getting their shots--
their ground shots

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.155
and things of that
nature-- which

00:30:14.155 --> 00:30:17.220
does take up the bulk of the
movie or TV show or whatever.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.290
So I have found
there have been times

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.840
that I've been on
set 12, 14 hours,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.880
and I've only flown this
thing maybe 10, 20 minutes.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:31.050
So there is a ton of downtime,
hence the Bring-a-book

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.870
And sometimes it can
be disappointing.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:40.470
Last year we did a pilot TV
show for NBC called Suspicion.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:41.970
It was a very fun shoot.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.550
They had a stunt
guy getting dragged

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.920
on the back of a
Cadillac Escalade.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.630
And we got to track
it and film it.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:53.010
And we just got some incredible
footage, some incredible shots.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.780
Everyone was super happy.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.600
The show wrapped.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.300
The first couple
episodes of the pilot--

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.920
it gets sent off to NBC.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.420
A bunch of guys in
suits were there.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.837
And they said,
yeah, we hate this,

00:31:01.837 --> 00:31:03.550
and it just got
scrapped altogether.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.550
And the good part is,
their check still cleared,

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.560
but we're not seeing
any of that work.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.770
That's about it for me.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.490
How do I click this
link to get it to work?

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.685
Phil asked me to string
together some footage

00:31:19.685 --> 00:31:21.810
that I've taken personally,
so you guys can kind of

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.743
see the drone in action.

00:31:23.743 --> 00:31:25.410
All the footage you're
going to see here

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.190
actually was not
done with this drone.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.732
This is more of a
professional drone.

00:31:28.732 --> 00:31:31.080
This was all done
with a DJI Phantom.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.170
This is a drone that you
could literally pick up

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.010
at Best Buy for, like, $1,000.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.990
I like having it,
just because you

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.550
can throw it in the back of
your car and have around.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.480
If you ever see something
fun to go out and film,

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.950
you have it there.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:48.740
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Questions, questions?

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.100
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Yeah, guys.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.880
Hit me with some questions
while this thing is playing.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.255
Anybody got any
questions for me?

00:31:52.255 --> 00:31:54.690
If anyone wants to come up
and play with this thing

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.190
or take a look at it, feel free.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.350
What's going on, man?

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.860
AUDIENCE: What is the
endurance of the drone?

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.610
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
This drone right here--

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.040
dual battery system.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.090
So you'll notice, it's got two.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.910
Cool thing about this
particular system--

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.680
self-induced heating
batteries, which

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.830
is great in the wintertime.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.270
Cold equals bad battery voltage.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.580
So with these things, heating
and going, that's great.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.880
In regards to range, if
you're wondering about range,

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.060
this can go a mile up
and four miles out.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.360
Do I want to do that?

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:28.860
No.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] time?

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:31.770
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Time?

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:36.300
Estimated time, 22 minutes
to 24, depending on load

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.450
and how aggressive
you're flying it.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.897
This thing has something
called Sport mode or Ludicrous

00:32:41.897 --> 00:32:43.980
mode-- whatever you want
to call it-- that you can

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.750
get this thing up to, like, 80.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.420
And it's going to suck the juice
out of the batteries real quick

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.060
if you're thrusting full
throttle for a while.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:55.830
But if you're just hovering,
it could get 25, 26 minutes.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.540
Back to the range
thing, yes, this thing

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.190
can go a mile up
and four miles out.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.660
I never like to do that.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.355
I look at this thing
as a big bag of money.

00:33:03.355 --> 00:33:04.730
You want your
money close to you,

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:08.425
or you want it four miles where
you can't have your eyes on it?

00:33:08.425 --> 00:33:09.550
You'd be surprised, though.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.760
A lot of people do
like doing that.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.990
They call it "range testing."

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.760
I call it stupidity.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.160
Let's see how far we can
send the thing before it

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.300
has a battery failure or
before it auto lands--

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.120
not something I like to screw
around with, personally.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.588
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Should be up now.

00:33:26.588 --> 00:33:27.880
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Anyone else?

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.030
Sir.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.780
AUDIENCE: I actually
work in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.300
And this fall, we
had our first drone.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.440
Should we require a
107 pilot for this?

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.653
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: For what?

00:33:37.653 --> 00:33:39.070
AUDIENCE: For
wedding photography?

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.280
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
Wedding photography?

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:40.730
Yes.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.105
Anything you're going to make
money or promote yourself--

00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:43.820
107.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.308
Just think to yourself, if
I'm just out having fun,

00:33:46.308 --> 00:33:47.100
I don't need a 107.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.850
AUDIENCE: We have
photographers coming in.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.335
We have a $50 fee to use
[INAUDIBLE] photography.

00:33:51.335 --> 00:33:54.660
And you try to tell
them [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.170
So the photographers don't
want to pay [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.920
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
They do need to be 107,

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.490
or a 107 operator has to--
you can hire a guy like me

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.740
to just be there and say,
hey, you're doing everything

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.560
on the up-and-up.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.060
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Make sure to read

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.560
back the question, because--

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.250
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.850
PHILIP GREENSPUN: For the video.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:08.510
Yeah, no, it's fine.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.593
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Got it.

00:34:09.593 --> 00:34:11.580
Anybody else?

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.469
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that you often

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.531
don't see most of your
footage in the final cut.

00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:16.989
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
Sometimes, yeah.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.995
AUDIENCE: Are you allowed at
all to publish that footage?

00:34:21.995 --> 00:34:23.526
Like, hey, this
is what we didn't

00:34:23.526 --> 00:34:25.020
use in this movie [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.728
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: So
this is what we do.

00:34:26.728 --> 00:34:30.520
So in a lot of our contracts,
when we get initially

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.280
approached by Columbia Pictures
or Lionsgate or something

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.915
of that nature, they'll send
us a volume of their contract

00:34:36.915 --> 00:34:39.040
and what we're allowed to
do with the footage, what

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.885
we're not.

00:34:39.885 --> 00:34:41.260
It's almost like
an NDA, as well.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.980
You can't post
behind-the-scenes stuff.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.670
You can't blow yourself up
on social media or things

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.380
of that nature.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.655
Sometimes we put verbiage in
there that says, hey, after--

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.030
we say we want to
use the footage

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.380
for our own personal promotion.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.922
What they generally
come back and say

00:34:54.922 --> 00:34:57.695
is, you can do that after
the movie's come out.

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.320
They don't want you
promoting something

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.608
that they don't get first
dibs at promoting first.

00:35:01.608 --> 00:35:03.400
So after the movie is
released, usually you

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.230
give it a month grace period--

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.453
that in-between period before
it's on Netflix or DVD,

00:35:07.453 --> 00:35:08.620
but it's out of the theater.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.470
Then we usually feel comfortable
to kind of self-promote

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.270
with that footage.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.586
Anybody else?

00:35:16.586 --> 00:35:18.870
Are you guys all mesmerized
by the drone footage?

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:19.953
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Come on.

00:35:19.953 --> 00:35:21.510
[INAUDIBLE] video.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.290
Look at that.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:24.080
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: That was
actually Big Island, Hawaii

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:24.800
right there.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.370
That's local.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.825
That's in West Boylston.

00:35:26.825 --> 00:35:28.700
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I tell
people that my dream

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.750
is to get as good footage
out of a $400,000 helicopter

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.018
as a person can get
out of a $400 drone.

00:35:36.018 --> 00:35:38.060
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: The
helicopter guys absolutely

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.610
hate us.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:45.200
We are stealing their
market share exponentially.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.570
Are the movie studios--

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.000
they have to hire the
photographer, the pilot,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.430
the fuel, the time,
the cost, all that,

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.523
or they want to hire us
at a third of a cost.

00:35:54.523 --> 00:35:56.690
And we're going to get
better, more dynamic footage.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:36:00.215
So doing it out of helicopters
is going to the wayside.

00:36:00.215 --> 00:36:02.410
And everyone's kind of
going to these machines now.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.827
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Yeah, so Michael

00:36:03.827 --> 00:36:06.510
said this was about $10,000,
including the camera.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.990
There is just a
piece of metal that's

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.480
FAA certified through a
supplemental type certificate

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.040
called the Tyler Mount.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.915
And you just connect
this to your helicopter,

00:36:14.915 --> 00:36:17.240
I think, landing gear
or something and then

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.330
put the camera on
this piece of metal.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:21.500
And I think that
piece of metal--

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.575
the cheapest ones I've ever
seen are about $12,000.

00:36:24.575 --> 00:36:28.220
So just a piece of metal that
has been through the approval

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.790
process and all the
paperwork costs more

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.320
than the entire drone system.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.380
And the camera balls can be
in the $400,000 or $500,000,

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.220
$600,000 range that go
underneath helicopters.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.130
Robinson actually makes
a cool news copter.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.640
It's all FAA certified
right from the factory.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.410
I think it's in the
million-dollar range that

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:51.080
has the ball and the
camera and the transmitter

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.640
back to the TV station.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.610
But as Michael
said, do we really

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:56.940
need those in the drone age?

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:57.940
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Yeah.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.472
No.

00:37:00.472 --> 00:37:02.180
AUDIENCE: For the
engineers [INAUDIBLE],,

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.722
what sort of features
or capabilities

00:37:03.722 --> 00:37:06.048
would you like to see in the
next generation of drones?

00:37:06.048 --> 00:37:08.090
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: The
next generation of drones,

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.270
what capabilities
would I like to see?

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.150
I'm currently, right now,
talking to a bunch of people--

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.610
I guess not capability,
but they're doing a lot

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.075
with augmented reality.

00:37:18.075 --> 00:37:20.450
And I think you're going to
see a lot of that coming out.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.770
I'm sure you guys
have heard of--

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:23.520
and I'm going to sound
really nerdy here--

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.740
but Pokemon Go on
your cell phone.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.770
And you can see the little
Pokemon guys running around.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.400
Now, imagine if I
wanted to train somebody

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.410
on how to properly fly a drone.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:36.668
Then I could put these
rings or circles or maybe

00:37:36.668 --> 00:37:38.210
directions on the
screen when they're

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:42.440
flying to go through the hoop
and make a figure 8 or things

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:42.960
like that.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.740
So I think we're going to see
a lot of augmented reality

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.610
stuff coming in and
things of that nature.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.330
Also, they're
making them smaller.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.370
That's another big thing.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.940
And they're making them more
diverse with image systems.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.440
What you can mount--

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.660
being able to mount something
smaller, more powerful.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.780
They have cameras now that
have hundred-time zoom

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.965
on one end of the camera.

00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:05.840
And then on the other
end, they have thermal.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.840
So you can switch back
and forth between the two

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.050
on the same drone.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.050
So things of that nature-- kind
of making them more efficient.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.305
And battery time, as
well-- that's a big thing.

00:38:14.305 --> 00:38:15.680
People want drones
that are going

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.517
to fly for hours, not minutes.

00:38:18.517 --> 00:38:20.600
So I think you're going
to see a big push in that.

00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:24.962
Sir, go ahead.

00:38:24.962 --> 00:38:26.420
AUDIENCE: Sort of
in the same vein,

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.840
in terms of controlability
and autonomy,

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.030
what does the standard
control look like?

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.040
Is it just two sticks?

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.915
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Yeah,
sticks [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:34.915 --> 00:38:36.980
I've got a couple right up here.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.630
This is it.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:39.687
These are controllers.

00:38:39.687 --> 00:38:40.520
I'll level with you.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.853
If any of you guys have ever
played first-person shooter

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:44.640
games on Playstation,
it's about the same.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.827
One remote for the pilot,
one remote for cam op.

00:38:50.827 --> 00:38:52.910
PHILIP GREENSPUN: It's the
same remote, basically?

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.200
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
It's the same principle

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.593
if you're playing a first-person
shooter, left and right

00:38:56.593 --> 00:38:57.260
on the joystick.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.290
PHILIP GREENSPUN: But camera
operator and drone operator

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:01.700
get the same physical remote?

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.140
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Correct.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:02.820
PHILIP GREENSPUN: OK.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.945
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Correct.

00:39:06.798 --> 00:39:08.473
Does that answer the
question for you?

00:39:08.473 --> 00:39:10.265
AUDIENCE: Well, the
follow-on question was,

00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:14.102
in terms of where do you see
things going or capabilities

00:39:14.102 --> 00:39:17.123
wanted by customer, in terms of
autonomy, would it be better--

00:39:17.123 --> 00:39:18.290
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: So thank.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:19.280
You thank you for reminding me.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.613
The keyword there is "autonomy."

00:39:20.613 --> 00:39:22.365
So there are different programs.

00:39:22.365 --> 00:39:23.990
Now, I don't use them
personally a lot,

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.930
because my application is
more cinematic and doing

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:30.320
things of that nature, which
I like to fly manually.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.840
There's more feathering and
kind of finesse to that.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.000
But a lot of people that
are doing industrial,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.830
like surveying and
things of that nature--

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.843
this thing is as
powerful as it gets.

00:39:42.843 --> 00:39:44.510
There's a program
called Litchi that you

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.900
can attach to this drone that
you can run off their operating

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:48.770
platform.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:51.650
You can put waypoints
in and say, all right,

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.180
go to point A at 50 feet.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.050
Snap a photo.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:55.100
Then go 20 feet up.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.220
Go to the right 100 feet.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.190
Then take a video,
and then go down.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.087
So you can pre-program
these things.

00:40:00.087 --> 00:40:01.170
A lot of my buddies do it.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.210
They make great money.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.870
And all they do is, they
program the grid into the drone,

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.370
they hit Go, and
then they sit back,

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:09.802
and they watch the thing
do the job for them.

00:40:09.802 --> 00:40:12.260
And there is-- there's great
money in the industrial sector

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.490
with these things--

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.920
with autonomous flights
and things of that nature.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.460
The only time I've ever used
waypoints is to do something

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.448
called a hyperlapse, if anyone
knows about photo or video.

00:40:23.448 --> 00:40:25.490
A time lapse is something
where you take a photo,

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:27.823
then you move the camera,
take a photo, move the camera,

00:40:27.823 --> 00:40:28.680
take a photo.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:33.050
A hyperlapse is when you include
motion in something like that.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.490
Waypoint feature is great.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:37.990
We put a waypoint
at point A. And then

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.610
300 feet away, we
put point B. And we

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:43.160
say, every two seconds
from A to B, take a photo

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.368
and go to this straight line.

00:40:44.368 --> 00:40:45.993
Then we string all
the photos together,

00:40:45.993 --> 00:40:48.020
and you get a cool,
little hyperlapse effect.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.050
So sometimes we
use the autonomy.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.110
Honestly, the enjoyment,
for me, is flying manually.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.210
I don't want to just
enter in a bunch of data

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.770
and say, OK, go do your job.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:01.410
I'd rather be on the controls
and having fun with it.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.250
So hope that answers
your question.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:03.750
Sir.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
going to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:09.787 --> 00:41:11.870
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Some
guys in the studio, again,

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.750
who do the industrial kind of
stuff-- yes, they'll utilize

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.340
the functions for autonomy.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.312
But again, personally,
I just don't.

00:41:19.312 --> 00:41:20.270
I like flying manually.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.860
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Over here, Michael.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.100
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Sir.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.590
AUDIENCE: How much flying
experience do you need

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:29.780
to [INAUDIBLE] and do the
close shots that you--

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.280
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
That's up to you.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.610
That literally is how
comfortable you are with it.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.990
Some people I know never take
the obstacle avoidance off.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:38.710
They think it's
there for a reason.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.730
They don't need to get that
really tight, close-in shot.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.772
A lot of people just do
what we call high and wide.

00:41:44.772 --> 00:41:46.230
You just fly the
thing up 300 feet.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.772
You get a nice landscape view
or whatever you're looking for,

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:51.010
and you have the collision
on for that or whatever.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:54.600
But again, you probably saw
some of those close shots

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.000
I had in that video.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.910
You can't obtain that with
the avoidance system on.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.680
Me, personally, I think within
three weeks I turned them off,

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.180
man.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.560
I was like, this is not for me.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.000
I just wanted to
jam on the thing

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.125
and get some great footage.

00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:11.677
So the safety was impeding
it a little bit for me.

00:42:11.677 --> 00:42:12.885
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Behind you.

00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:14.843
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
some more clarification

00:42:14.843 --> 00:42:16.980
about [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.840
You said 400 feet was
the maximum height

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.372
that I can fly [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:22.830
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
Well, not that--

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:24.960
it can fly well over 400 feet.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.500
But you're only allowed
to fly up to 400 feet.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.990
AUDIENCE: Can I be flying in
my neighborhood's backyard?

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.070
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Sure.

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.990
The funny thing is, why
do you want to, though?

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.990
Why do you want to be
three feet off the ground,

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.940
risking your couple
thousand-dollar piece

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.148
of equipment when you can
just take a handheld camera

00:42:41.148 --> 00:42:43.057
and walk?

00:42:43.057 --> 00:42:45.503
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:45.503 --> 00:42:46.670
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Oh, yeah.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:47.260
Oh, yeah.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.910
You saw in some of
the shots there.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:52.240
I'm skimming waves at a foot
off the waves, skimming them.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.010
So yeah, you can fly really low.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:57.760
Again, you have to have your
sensors off for that, though.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.783
The sensor systems that
are on these things

00:42:59.783 --> 00:43:01.450
will say, what are
you doing, you idiot?

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.460
Don't fly me like this.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.482
So in order to achieve it,
you have to shut them off.

00:43:07.482 --> 00:43:12.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] So
if you're three feet off

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.870
the ground in your
neighbor's backyard,

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.780
is that considered your
neighbor's property?

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.720
Are they allowed
to not let you--

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:24.110
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Yeah, that's
a slippery, slippery slope--

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.530
the privacy laws and
things of that nature.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.260
A lot of the bad press
that drones get--

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.690
like, oh, I was
sunbathing in my backyard,

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:34.210
and I saw a drone
way up in the sky.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.237
And they're invading my privacy.

00:43:36.237 --> 00:43:38.320
And it's just like, well,
really think about that.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.640
You look like a little ant.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.170
How much privacy am
I really invading?

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:45.193
Hand-held cameras
with telescopic lens

00:43:45.193 --> 00:43:47.360
are going to invade more
privacy than this thing is.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.140
PHILIP GREENSPUN: So I think
it's an evolving legal area.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:53.980
The classical law has
been that the airspace

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.420
belongs to the public.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.590
Only the FAA can regulate it.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.840
But that's been eroded.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.195
I think a few states have
been passing anti-drone laws--

00:44:02.195 --> 00:44:03.820
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
They've been trying.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:04.730
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
--of various kinds.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:05.980
So I don't think it's a--

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.480
I think it's an
untested legal area.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.150
There was a question over here.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:13.130
AUDIENCE: So the main aviation
has the ADS-B by 2020.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.097
Did drones have the
upgrade [INAUDIBLE]??

00:44:15.097 --> 00:44:16.930
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
They're talking about it.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.940
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Repeat
the question, please.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:19.990
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: I
don't know the acronym.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.610
What's the acronym again?

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.820
PHILIP GREENSPUN: ADSB.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.350
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
Yeah, fixed wing

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:26.380
has to have ADSB
installed by 2020.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.800
So the question was, are drones
going to have to have them?

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.388
The problem with
it right now is,

00:44:31.388 --> 00:44:33.430
they don't make them
lightweight and small enough

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.662
to equip on these things.

00:44:34.662 --> 00:44:36.370
When they do and the
technology is there,

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.120
I'm willing to bet
you're going to see it.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.190
Yep, absolutely.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:41.290
The problem is the weight.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:42.790
You can't throw
that extra weight in

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:45.820
and get any kind of viable
performance out of it with them

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.570
right now.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:48.040
But as the technology
gets better

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.660
and they make those
things smaller,

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.452
I'm willing to bet
you're going to see them

00:44:51.452 --> 00:44:52.360
on every single one.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:52.946
Yep.

00:44:52.946 --> 00:44:55.154
AUDIENCE: The guy sitting
to your right [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:56.793 --> 00:44:59.210
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH: Can you do
that [INAUDIBLE] really slow

00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.710
for me?

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.470
Anybody else?

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.985
Sir.

00:45:05.985 --> 00:45:07.985
AUDIENCE: When you're
piloting, how much are you

00:45:07.985 --> 00:45:09.993
looking out at the
drone versus looking--

00:45:09.993 --> 00:45:11.410
MICHAEL HOLZWARTH:
Great question.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.250
Great question.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:16.210
I've seen so many people crash
their drone because they are--

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:19.600
I call them screen warriors.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.360
They got their control here,
and they got their iPad mounted.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.527
And they can see everything.

00:45:23.527 --> 00:45:25.810
And they're, oh, my
god, this is so great.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.767
Boom, they hit a tree.

00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:29.850
Why did they hit the tree?

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:31.477
Because the camera--
now, this drone

00:45:31.477 --> 00:45:32.560
is a little bit different.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.110
When this drone takes off,
this landing gear actually

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.360
raises up above the body here.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.295
So this camera down
here can spin 360

00:45:40.295 --> 00:45:41.920
without getting the
legs in the footage

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.640
or anything of that nature.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.892
But your general
consumer drone, when

00:45:46.892 --> 00:45:48.850
you're looking at your
iPad when you're flying,

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.230
you're seeing what the
camera sees, which is great.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.530
But what you're not
seeing is your peripheral.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.837
You're not seeing that your
props are out this far.

00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:59.170
And if you're just sitting
there, looking at the screen,

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:00.740
you'll end up
clipping something.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.990
You'll end up doing something.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:04.650
My general rule of thumb,
if I'm flying by myself--

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:05.620
I set up a shot.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:06.790
I look at the screen.

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:08.832
A lot of times, though--
and this just comes with

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:09.850
experience--

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.885
I can look at the drone and
know what the camera's seeing.

00:46:12.885 --> 00:46:14.260
In a professional
setting, that's

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.390
why you have a
multi-person crew, why

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.990
you have a visual observer,
because a lot of the times when

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:22.240
you're getting paid and
you're under pressure and time

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.830
crunched to get
the shot, your head

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:25.810
needs to be dug
into that screen.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.000
And that's why you need
radio communication

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.160
with a visual observer to
say, hey, you're clear.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.720
No obstruction 25 yards.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.370
Have at it or whatever
the case may be.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:38.230
But flying for fun by
yourself, my advice would be,

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.330
look up at your bird
every now and again.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.880
I've also had people that
have flown and then been

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.378
like, well, wait, where is it?

00:46:45.378 --> 00:46:47.920
Because, again, these things
can go a mile up and a mile out.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.920
And all the sudden, they're
like, wait a second,

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.400
where'd my drone go?

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.060
Now, luckily, for
lack of better terms--

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.170
and excuse my language--

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:57.503
I call it the "oh, shit" button.

00:46:57.503 --> 00:46:59.680
But there's a button right here.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.140
So when I turn the drone
on, what it does is,

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.610
it communicates to satellites.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:06.370
It marks a GPS home point.

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:10.527
Now, if I'm being an idiot and
I'm sending it out a mile away,

00:47:10.527 --> 00:47:12.110
the drone is smart
enough to say, hey,

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.960
I only have enough
battery percentage

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.670
to get back to your home point.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.810
And it will kick me off
the controls altogether,

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:20.800
and it will fly itself back and
land right where you took off.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.050
Same function as,
where'd my drone go?

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:23.770
I can't find it.

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.300
If I really needed to,
you hit that button,

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.890
and the thing will
fly itself back.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:30.040
Now, if you utilize
that function--

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.050
this is getting back to
the sensors and things

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.350
of that nature.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.530
If you have your
sensors turned off,

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:38.710
you're in trouble, because
what the drone is going to do

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:43.240
is take its most direct path
back to your home point.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.070
If there is a
building in the way,

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.650
it will hit the building
if your sensors are off.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.150
Now, if your sensors are on--

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.650
I actually have
this set up to where

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:55.630
if Return-to-Home function
kicks in, the sensors turn on.

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.340
And then I also have
it set up to where

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.230
if it meets an
obstruction-- let's say

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:00.275
there's a building here.

00:48:00.275 --> 00:48:01.900
Oh, no, I don't know
where my drone is.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.570
I hit Return-to-Home, and it
comes towards the building.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:07.630
It will sense it, and
it will raise altitude

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:08.620
until it clears it.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.600
And then it will clear
it and continue on back

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.890
to the home point.

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:16.180
I never like to rely on
Return-to-Home, though.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.110
Never.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:18.500
I don't feel
comfortable with it.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.580
I like knowing-- again, using
the bag of money situation,

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.800
I like knowing where
my bag of money is at.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.737
I don't want it to
get away from me.

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.570
You guys can come up
and pick this thing up.

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.040
It has some weight to it.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.990
If this thing fell 400
feet and hit somebody,

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.900
they're in trouble.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.130
You're in trouble.

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:37.100
So it behooves you to always
have a set of eyes on it

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.860
and pay attention to
everything you're doing there.

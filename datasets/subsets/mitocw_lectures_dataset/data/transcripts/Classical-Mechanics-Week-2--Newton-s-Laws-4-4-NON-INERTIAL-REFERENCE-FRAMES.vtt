00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.300
Now that we've seen how
coordinates are related

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.150
between two inertial
frames, I want

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.290
to consider a slightly
more advanced example

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.390
for a moment, which is supposed
that capital V, the vector

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.840
velocity of frame S prime
relative to inertial frame S,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.250
is not a constant.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.810
So in this case, suppose
that frame S prime has

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.950
an acceleration, capital
A, relative to S.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.720
We now say that as prime is a
non-inertial frame, because it

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.630
is accelerated relative
to frame S. Now

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.490
we saw that in inertial
frames, one always

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.250
measures the same acceleration
for the same object,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.710
even though you'll measure
different velocities

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.570
in different
positions in general.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.020
That's not going to true
in a non-inertial frame.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.360
In a non-inertial frame,
the acceleration, A prime,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.550
is equal to the acceleration
of frame S minus capital

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.330
A, the acceleration of frame S
prime relative to S. Remember,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.370
capital A is 0 for S prime
being an inertial frame,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.110
when capital V is a constant.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.940
But if capital V
is not a constant,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.120
then capital A is not 0.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.060
So you will measure
different accelerations

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.250
in these different frames.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.760
Now what that tells us is
that Newton's laws are going

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.810
to look a little different.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.539
And let's see how that works.

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.440
So now, the force measured
in frame S prime-- I'll

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.360
call that F prime-- we expect
that from Newton's second law

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.394
to be the mass times the
acceleration A prime.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.350
But that is the mass times
the acceleration measured

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:53.300
in frame S minus m capital A,
the acceleration of frame S

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.400
prime relative to frame S.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.260
Now I can rewrite
this as two terms.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.920
One I'll call F physical, which
represents the physical forces

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.945
acting on the object.

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:14.520
And the second term,
I'm going to call

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.880
F fictitious for reasons
that we'll see in a moment.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.460
So what this means
is the following

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.280
is that an observer in
frame S prime in order

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.180
to explain the motion of the
object using Newton's laws

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.240
will have to invoke not just
the physical forces interacting

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.230
on the object, which
might be due to gravity

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.960
or rope pulling or
an engine pushing

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.380
or a hand acting on
something, but will also

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.470
have to both an apparent force,
which I'll call F fictitious,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.700
that acts on everything.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:03:00.180
And in this case, F fictitious
is equal to minus m capital A.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.990
But that force will not
be associated, will not

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.250
be identifiable with any actual,
real physical interaction.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.880
It's an artifact of the
choice of coordinate system.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.840
It's an artifact of the
non-inertial coordinate system

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.280
that frame S prime is in.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.030
For that reason, we call
it a fictitious force.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.090
And it's to be distinguished
from real, physical forces

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.350
of the type that we've been
talking about up until now.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.290
So you may have
seen earlier that

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.820
for the motion of an object in a
circle around some center point

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.650
implies the presence of
an inward acceleration

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.750
toward the center of the circle.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.810
So as a consequence of that,
a rotating reference frame,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.430
for example, a
reference frame that

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.510
rotates with the
Earth's rotation,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.050
is accelerated relative
to an inertial frame.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.170
This results in a
fictitious force

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.600
that has two terms, a
centrifugal term and a Coriolis

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.100
term.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.640
You may have come across
this Coriolis force

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.200
and centrifugal force before.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.600
These are examples
of fictitious forces

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.120
because they arise from the
choice of coordinate system.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.100
They're an artificial force.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.680
They don't correspond to
actual, physical interactions,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.410
but are an artifact of
the rotating, non-inertial

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.140
coordinate system.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.810
Now, in this course we
will confine ourselves

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.180
to inertial reference frames.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.920
And therefore, we'll
only be considering

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.200
real, physical forces
and interactions.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.810
However, there are
advanced applications

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.980
where the use of a non-inertial
frame has certain advantages.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.790
And you may encounter
those as you

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.180
go to more advanced courses.

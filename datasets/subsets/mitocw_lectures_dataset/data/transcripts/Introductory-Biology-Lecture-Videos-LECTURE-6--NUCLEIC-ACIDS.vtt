WEBVTT

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.480
BARBARA IMPERIALI: So
we are moving along.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.300
Lecture 6 is the last of
the biochemistry lectures.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.880
We're going to be talking about
nucleotides and nucleic acids.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.320
And you'll understand
these terms in a moment.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.350
I'll clarify them for you.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.830
But this is a tremendous
stepping stone

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.405
to the next portion
of the class.

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:38.710
So I show you a few images here.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.070
I'm going to reshow you
some of these in a moment

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.750
when we talk about
addressing understanding

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.720
the noncovalent
structure of DNA, which

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720
is so critical to
understanding information

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.600
storage and
information transfer.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.590
But for now, let's just
have a quick peek forward.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.700
After this section, I'm going to
be covering molecular biology,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.780
so how to go from DNA
to RNA to protein.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690
And then Professor
Martin will take

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.080
over with the basic structures
and functions of cells

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.360
and then genetics.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.090
But for all of this, we're
going to need nucleic acids.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.980
And I'll explain
to you why here.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.910
So nucleic acids form
fundamental units

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:33.840
for information
storage, storage.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.810
And that is the DNA
that is in our nucleus

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.205
and in our mitochondria, and
then information transfer.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.440
And if I get a little
bit of time at the end,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.282
I have three or
four quick slides

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:53.740
that you don't have
on your handout

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.190
because it's sort of a floating
topic on the use of DNA

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.500
and DNA-based
computing, because it's

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.230
a nanoscale structure
that one can

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.250
program to do different things.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.010
And I think you
might enjoy that.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.340
So in this picture
of the components

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.310
and what's known as
the central dogma,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.600
that is how DNA is converted
into messenger RNA,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.530
which, through the help of
transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.240
we get proteins.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.950
The key elements on this
slide are DNA, messenger RNA,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.980
ribosomal RNA, and transfer RNA.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.400
And those are all
made up of nucleotides

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.410
being brought
together into polymers

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.250
that are nucleic acids.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.990
So obviously, we really need to
crack the structures of these

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.550
and understand how the
structure informs function.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.650
Remember, we did
that for proteins.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.780
We've done that
for phospholipids.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.750
We thought about it very
briefly for carbohydrates.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.700
But the thing that I
really want to stress

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.850
to you with the fourth
of these macromolecules

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.500
is looking at how the last
component of the biomolecule's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.570
structure really
informs function.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.970
And it's really cool to
think about how it's done.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.130
So how is that chemical
molecular structure something

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.450
that we can understand from
the perspective of function?

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.990
So what we need to
do, first of all,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.740
is think about what
nucleotides are and understand

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.380
their structure so that
we can move forward

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.780
to understand how
they come together

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.540
to build these macromolecules.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.100
They're so pivotal
and essential in life

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.330
for programming the
biosynthesis of our proteins.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.810
And now we're understanding
more and more about not

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.300
only that, but also
how RNA, not DNA, is

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.810
involved in a large number
of regulatory processes.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.050
So it's not just DNA,
double-stranded DNA

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.330
goes to a messenger, and so on.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.120
Also, a lot of
regulation occurs because

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.025
of a lot of the other nucleic
acids that are within the cell.

00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:13.400
So I'm going to
go here because I

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.829
want to describe the composite
components of nucleotides

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.030
so we understand their
structure and their properties.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.140
So what are nucleotides?

00:04:30.198 --> 00:04:32.240
And you look at these
structures up on the board.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.900
They look kind of complicated.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.550
So let me deconstruct
them for you.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.460
It'll make life a lot easier.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:53.370
So they're two familiar
building blocks and one new one.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.510
So the familiar building
blocks are, first of all,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.890
carbohydrates.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.320
So the key carbohydrate
in nucleic acid

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:24.640
is a five-carbon pentose
sugar, which looks like this.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.080
You can count the carbons,
1, 2, 4, 5, and 5.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.930
And you can reassure
yourselves everything is there

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.080
with respect to the
carbons by translating

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.660
this line-angle drawing
into a drawing where

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.470
you put all the hydrogens on and
you know where everything is.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.920
There are two types of
five-carbon pentoses

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.510
that are used in
the nucleic acid.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.290
They are ribose,
which is shown here

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.390
with all OHs on all
of those carbons,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:11.310
and two deoxyribose, which
is a building block of DNA,

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.850
whereas ribose is a
building block of RNA.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.680
What else do I need to tell you?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.780
You'll see this later on.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.310
That ribose sugar ends up
being connected to what

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.825
are known as nucleobases.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.960
You do not necessarily
need to draw those,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.320
because you've got them on your
handout to put sketches on.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.322
So I put them on
the board for so I

00:06:39.322 --> 00:06:41.280
don't have to stand here
and draw them for you.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.470
And I want to explain
certain things.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.650
So the nucleobases in
the numbering system--

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.250
and I'm going to keep on
reiterating this so you'll

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.080
get familiar with it--

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:59.370
number the carbons 1 through
whatever it is, or rather,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.400
the atom numbers when you're
walking around the ring.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.810
So when we talk about
the ribose component,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.600
they have what's known as
a prime numbering system

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.240
to differentiate it
from the numbering

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.130
system in the riboses.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.310
So this would be 1 prime,
2 prime, 3 prime, 4 prime,

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.350
and 5 prime.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.820
Why is that?

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.840
This becomes
incredibly important

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.190
when we talk about putting
together polymers of DNA

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.300
and the direction in which DNA
is assembled in life, and also,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.432
even when we describe
2-deoxyribose,

00:07:34.432 --> 00:07:40.230
or a ribose, because this would
be called 2 prime deoxyribose

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.940
in the nucleic acid.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.250
So I'm going to bore you
with that numbering system

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.950
because I'll start to
use it very commonly.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.820
And it will make a lot of sense
as we start to assemble the DNA

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.610
macromolecule when we
talk about the way it's

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.410
built and drawn and written.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.930
The numbering system
will be important

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.030
because we'll constantly
refer to 5 prime and 3 prime.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.790
That's just a little
preview for later.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.820
The next component of the
nucleic acid is a phosphate.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.865
Phosphorus looks like this.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.170
But in nucleic, in
the nucleotides,

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:29.540
these are joined to other
units as phosphoesters.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.490
But you want to remember
that in phosphorus, you

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.789
have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
bonds to phosphorus,

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.650
and you commonly have a negative
charge on one of those oxygens.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.590
And in the structure
of DNA, you actually

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.385
have phosphates occurring
as phosphodiesters.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.570
And you, once again,
you will see that when

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.150
we see the intact
structure of DNA.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.530
So what are nucleotides?

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:13.680
Nucleotides are a
combination of a carbohydrate

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.040
or a sugar, a phosphate
and a nucleobase.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.870
That's the third
component, the one

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.520
we're going to learn about now.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.650
So the nucleobases
look like this.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.450
There are two families,
two flavors of nucleobase.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.880
There is one flavor--

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.460
let's get this cleaned
up a little bit here--

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.710
that has two rings.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.520
And it has the
shorter name, purine.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.980
And there's a different
family or flavor

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.920
of nucleobases
that has one ring,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.660
and it has the bigger name.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.700
And that, to this
day, is the way

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.730
I remember purines
and pyrimidines.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.870
Small name, big structure;
big name, small structure.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.780
If that's helpful
to you, go for it.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.280
Use it.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.000
I haven't patented
it or anything.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.860
So in nucleic acids, there
are two different purines.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.950
They are known as
adenine and guanine.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.260
You do not need to
know these structures.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.920
I actually only know my
favorite three of the five

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.817
to draw easily.

00:10:14.817 --> 00:10:17.150
And the other two, I'm always
stumbling around the ring.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.700
So don't worry about that.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.150
We all get to know the ones
we work with every day.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.030
For me, it's uracil,
it's adenine,

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.970
and it's cytosine,
but not the others.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.920
But what you do
need to understand

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.080
is a little bit about
their structures.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.920
Because when we start to talk
about the noncovalent structure

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.230
of nucleic acids, principally,
the double-stranded helix

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.790
of DNA, we need to know where
the hydrogen bond donors

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.890
and acceptors are
in these structures.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.370
So if you want to
indulge me, you

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.530
can take a look at
these structures.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.700
This hydrogen would be a donor.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.740
You can see that it's a
hydrogen on a nitrogen.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.590
This nitrogen is interesting.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.530
It has 1, 2, 3
bonds to nitrogen,

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.750
which means there are a
lone pair of electrons

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.760
also on that ring system.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.340
So that would be a
hydrogen bond acceptor.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.020
And the adenine nucleobase
can accept and give

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.850
a pair of hydrogen bonds.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.460
And you can work that out
for all of the others.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:34.576
So in guanine, there is an
acceptor, another acceptor,

00:11:34.576 --> 00:11:36.880
and a donor, and so on.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.860
So those rings in
the nucleobases

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.630
are very important
because they have places

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.730
that you can hydrogen bond to.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.998
Now, is everyone feeling
comfortable about this?

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:48.540
Does anyone want to
ask me a question

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.052
that might help clarify,
because it's quite--

00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:52.260
yeah, do you have a question?

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] What
does uracil [INAUDIBLE]??

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.930
BARBARA IMPERIALI: What does--

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.422
sorry?

00:11:59.422 --> 00:12:00.130
AUDIENCE: Uracil.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.100
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Uracil.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.290
These are all-- sorry.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.650
All these nucleobases
have fancy names.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.920
So, so far, I've shown you the
structure of adenine, guanine,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.700
cytosine, and thymine.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.410
Uracil, which is not
drawn on the board,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.870
is very similar to thymine,
except this methyl group

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.070
is a hydrogen.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.680
Knowing the names
is also complicated.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.670
I really care that
you understand

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.480
the hydrogen-bonding
patterns; not to draw

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.490
the whole structures,
but to identify

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.600
hydrogen-bonding patterns;
not to remember fancy names,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.600
because there's no
logic to those names;

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.890
but really, to remember
ribose, deoxyribose, phosphate

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.820
and phosphodiesters,
purines and pyrimidines,

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.980
just the sizes of
them to pick them out.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.100
Does that make sense,
what I want you to know,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.520
and what you can remember if
you think it's interesting?

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:10.280
Now, in nature, we use the
nucleotide building blocks

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.320
or the nucleotides in
many different ways.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.850
It's not just in DNA and RNA.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.820
And so here, I'm showing
you some really important

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.965
nucleotides that
are found in nature.

00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:23.840
And I'll give you a
little bit of information

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.370
about their signaling.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.560
So here are the components
that you can pick out.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.220
There is, in this
case, a ribose sugar.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.690
In this case, it's phosphate,
but it's a phosphate triester.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.030
So it's got three
phosphates in a row.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.330
And here's a nucleobase,
which is a purine.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.970
And this is adenosine
triphosphate.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.420
So it's one of the bases,
one of the nucleotides used

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.040
in energy, energy transfer.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.550
In a lot of metabolic
processes, we

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:01.320
use ATP as a molecule that has
energy that can be unlocked

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.440
for chemical processes.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.660
There's another
one of these, which

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:11.190
is guanosine triphosphate, where
the nucleobase is different.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.720
They're both purines, but they
have different structures.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.220
You can see them there.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.830
And then finally,
the last one I show

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.750
you here is a nucleotide
that has a cyclic phosphate.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:29.270
But it still has a nucleobase,
a ribose, and a phosphate.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.700
And this is cyclic AMP.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.660
And when come back after
Professor Martin has talked,

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.300
we'll talk about the
role of cyclic AMP

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.110
as a second messenger.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.590
So these two
molecules, in addition

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.770
to being building
blocks for DNA and RNA,

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.680
also are forms of
energy where you

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.190
can use ATP or GTP
as a form of energy

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.770
in a lot of metabolic processes.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.060
And in fact, though, when we
start constructing proteins

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.520
using the ribosomal
system, you'll

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.300
notice we use GTP as a
form of energy, not ATP.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.580
It's interesting how
nature chooses to do that.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.720
Any questions about this?

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.410
One tiny wrinkle
left to deal with,

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.870
and that's a little bit
more about those building

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.780
blocks for the nucleic
acid, and one more

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.840
item that it's useful to
understand the name of.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.840
So here are the five
nucleobases, two purines,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.630
and three pyrimidines.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:40.310
In DNA, we have AT, G
and C, so A, T, G, and c.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.590
So we have different
building blocks.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.860
Three are common
to both polymers.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.480
One is different.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:56.270
Uracil and thymine are exchanged
when you go from DNA to RNA.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.760
The pyrimidines are cytosine,
uracil, and thymine.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.590
And in RNA, you
have a AU, G and C.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.850
So there are reasons
for these differences,

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.540
and I'll nudge into some of
those chemical differences

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.630
in a moment.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.130
So the information up there
is the same information

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.600
that I have on this board.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.100
The next thing I
need to talk to you

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:35.230
is we very commonly use the
term, or two terms, nucleoside

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.260
and the nucleotide.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.240
How irritating is that?

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:56.900
The nucleoside is just the
ribose plus the nucleobase,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.840
but no phosphates.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:07.200
As soon as you
put on phosphates,

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.109
they become nucleotides.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:25.319
So for example, nucleobase,
ribose, and in this case,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.640
a phosphate on it.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.500
And that becomes a nucleotide.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.140
No matter how many
phosphates they are,

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.000
it's called a nucleotide.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.360
I'm less concerned that you
will remember that nomenclature,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.100
more that you know
what it's all about,

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.080
because otherwise, it might
become a little bit confusing.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.350
So just remember, if
you can remember that.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.630
But I think I've tried
to define the things I

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.310
would like you to remember--

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.610
the building blocks,
the numbering system,

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.360
the phosphodiester linkages,
and the nucleobases,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.050
as far as understanding where
donors and acceptors are

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:59.190
for hydrogen bonding.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.550
And there's one thing.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.890
So we call that a nucleoside,
whereas we call it a

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.780
nucleotide when it
includes the phosphates.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.060
And there's one thing
that you want to notice,

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.610
is that the bond from the
nucleobase to the ribose

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:23.050
is a glycoside bond.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.360
It's a bond to a carbohydrate.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.850
So that's why it's
called a glycoside bond.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.810
There are glycosidases that
cleave the bond from the base

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:32.830
to the sugar.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.730
Those are very important when
we have mutations in our DNA,

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.450
and we want to cut out
the sugar to fix it

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:45.160
so it doesn't get misread
in the biosynthesis of DNA,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.370
in the biosynthesis
of messenger RNA.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.040
So that bond is important.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.350
We may often talk
about it, but only

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:58.510
when we get to learning about
how DNA sequences are corrected

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.850
if there are mistakes
in those sequences.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.400
And that will be later on.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.100
So let's start to now
look at the polymers.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.300
Now, I want to tell you
that by the early 1900s,

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.970
people pretty much
knew the structure,

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.760
the noncovalent
structure of DNA.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.560
And I'll describe it to you now.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.920
DNA is made up of nucleotides.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.630
And this is its basic structure,
where you have a phosphodiester

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:31.290
backbone linking riboses,
and each of those ribosomes

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:35.490
is modified with a
purine or a pyrimidine.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:39.520
And that is the basic structure
of a nucleic acid polymer,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.240
only it's very, very,
very, very long.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.790
So let's take a look
at the components here.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.960
Look at the bonds.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.450
And maybe on your notes,
just highlight the bonds

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.380
and some of the things
I'll talk about.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.520
So first of all, the
numbering system here,

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.400
we always talk about
a nucleic acid.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.740
And we describe the sequence
of the nucleic acid based on

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.560
from 5 prime to 3 prime.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.520
Because the phosphodiester
bonds join the 5 prime--

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.950
there should be a number
there-- and the 3 prime sites.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.690
So the linkage would be
here, would be 5 prime and 3

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:21.260
prime joining to the
ribose molecules.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.260
So the architecture of that
nucleic acid is a polymer that

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.880
includes a phosphodiester
backbone linked by phosphate

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.510
esters-- that's 1 phosphate
ester; that's the other one--

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.260
on two of the OHs
of the ribose sugar.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.760
When this is DNA, there's no
OH group on that carbon site.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.380
That would be the 2-prime site.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.640
You can see-- you can pick
straight out that this is DNA.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.250
The sequence is then defined by
what the identity of the base

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.100
is here.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.150
So this would be
guanine, adenine, thymine

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.590
on that sequence.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:16.910
Now, by convention, if we
write out this sequence,

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:22.985
the way the sequences
are written,

00:21:22.985 --> 00:21:27.850
are 5 prime to 3
prime direction.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:36.810
So if I look at that, I would
be able to name it as an A, G, T

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.110
sequence, because we always
write the sequences 5

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.670
prime to 3 prime.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.910
We can remember that later on
because we actually also build

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.790
sequences 5 prime to 3 prime.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.040
So there are some conventions
in biology and biochemistry.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:08.730
You want to remember that by
convention, we write peptides N

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.720
terminal to C terminal.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:20.540
But we also build
them N to C. So that's

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.513
why the convention is strong,
and it's good to remember,

00:22:23.513 --> 00:22:25.430
because it can get you
out of a lot of trouble

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.350
if you remember those things.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:33.650
Now, when we are building a DNA
polymer, we grow that sequence.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.830
You'll see the biochemistry
for all of that polymerization

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.910
in the next class.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.570
It's amazingly cool
how the entire contents

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:45.590
of a cell, the DNA, can be
replicated in amazing time

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:49.430
frames, but all through growing
those chains from 5 prime

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.780
to 3 prime.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.960
So when we add another
building block on,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.730
we remove a molecule of water.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:00.230
So that's a
condensation reaction.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.690
And we form a new
phosphodiester bond.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.920
So in the biosynthesis
of DNA, you

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:12.200
keep on adding new nucleotides
to the 3 prime end.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.620
There's a chemical
reason for that.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.060
When we build DNA, we don't just
cram the two groups together.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.260
We, rather, come in
with a triphosphate

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.750
and use that
activated triphosphate

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.920
as the new building block.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.930
And you kick out triphosphate.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.080
And you'll see that when we
talk about DNA synthesis.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.030
But what I want you
to remember here

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.260
is this is another
condensation reaction.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.270
We talked about them
when making peptides.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.050
We talked about them when
making carbohydrate polymers.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:49.100
And now we're seeing, once
again, a condensation reaction

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.980
to make a nucleic acid polymer.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:58.480
Now, the last term that's
kind of worth mentioning

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.140
is the word nucleic acid.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.330
What's that about?

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.850
I don't see any
carboxylic acids.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.550
It turns out the
polymers of DNA are

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:18.970
very acidic because the OH
group on those phosphodiester

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.620
backbones is very acidic.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.370
So you give up H plus.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.830
And this is in its most
stable form as O minus.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:28.330
So when

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:35.290
DNA was first isolated, it was
isolated from white blood cells

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.030
by isolating the nucleus.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:41.170
And it was found that it was
a very acidic material packed

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:42.460
into the nucleus.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.990
That's why it was called nucleic
acid, acids in the nucleus.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.710
Before people even understood
anything about the composition,

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.950
it garnered that
name, nucleic acid.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.640
So we talk about
polymers of nucleotides,

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.065
we call them nucleic acids.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.610
Then with respect to
writing our sequences,

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.230
we could write them in this way.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.900
So pdGATC.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.320
That would be that structure.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.530
What do all the little
extra Ps and Ds stand for?

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:22.790
The P stands for whether
there's a phosphate at this end.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.750
The D stands for whether it's
a deoxy sugar as a building

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.380
block.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.100
Going all the way
to the other end,

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.140
there's no little
p at the other end.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.930
So it means that OH is free.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:38.000
Does everyone understand
that shorthand writing?

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.280
There's another way I
could know this was DNA

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.870
without needing to put deoxy
on each of the building blocks.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.450
Does anyone know how
I know immediately

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.570
it's a stretch of DNA?

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.077
Yeah?

00:25:50.077 --> 00:25:50.910
AUDIENCE: No uracil?

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:51.880
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
Yeah, there's no uracil,

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.300
and there's thymine instead.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.050
So in principle, as long
as there's a T in there,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.160
you know it's DNA.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.235
As long as a U in there,
you know it's RNA.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.200
Now, let's talk about the
noncovalent structure,

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.320
because I really
feel that that's

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:22.340
the most exciting part
of this entire endeavor

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.440
because the covalent
structure really

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.810
doesn't allow us to understand
how DNA stores information

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.550
for building proteins.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.830
It doesn't tell us
that much about it.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.470
It looks like a cool
polymer, but we can't really

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.795
understand the details by
not looking at the covalence

00:26:39.795 --> 00:26:42.350
of the noncovalent structure.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.900
So there was one key
piece of information,

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.440
and it's called Chargaff's data.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.200
And this piece of
scientific information

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.560
ran around the scientific
community in the early '50s

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.230
because it seemed
incredibly important.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.620
And what Chargaff's data
was, he collected all kinds

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.370
of organisms, and then their
nuclei, and then measured--

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.660
or their DNA--

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.870
and then measured the
ratio between the purines

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.670
and the pyrimidines.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.880
He measured the ratio
of the large ones

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.490
and the small ones
of the nucleobases.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.630
So how many of these relative
to how many of those?

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.560
And what he found by
looking all across organisms

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.740
from all domains of life is
that there was a one to one

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.660
ratio of purine to pyrimidine.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.870
So that became very
interesting, because what

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.020
it suggested was
that in some way,

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:57.380
the noncovalent structure
of nucleic acids

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.830
had some correlation between
the number of the purines

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.690
and the number of
the pyrimidines.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.050
And what you can imagine is
it sounds like we're always

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.220
pairing a small one with a large
one by looking at that number.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.200
So this is really,
really important

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.030
because it's like
the light bulb that

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.440
went on with respect to
understanding the structure

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.860
of double-stranded DNA.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.140
So despite all
kinds of variations,

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.900
some organisms have
a lot more GCs.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.820
Some have more ATs.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.420
But no matter what, the
ratio is always one to one.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.080
And this ultimately
led to understanding

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.950
the noncovalent structure
of double-stranded DNA

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.980
because it provided
clues to how there could

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.920
be some way that
information was coded,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.290
but then could be replicated.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.690
Now, the next thing
that became the clue

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.240
to the structure of
double-stranded DNA

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:57.510
came from a very talented
researcher, Rosalind Franklin,

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:02.390
who sadly died way before
her time of ovarian cancer,

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.880
really, in large part
because she spent

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.370
a lot of time near X-ray beams.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.360
So that would have caused
mutations to her DNA.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.950
And she developed a way to
make fibrils of DNA that

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:20.870
were ordered enough to collect
electron diffraction data.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.300
And that diffraction
data actually

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.330
gave a clue to some
of the dimensions

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.820
of the double-stranded
DNA structure.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.890
And it actually
was the clue that

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.460
told the spacing between
the strands of DNA.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.890
So it really was a
piece of information

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.110
that you simply
couldn't do without.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.300
With Chargaff's
data and with this,

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.870
what was called Photograph 51,
it really gave you the clue.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.860
And it was really
during those years

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.910
that Watson and Crick
were desperately

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.520
model building to
try to understand

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.010
the noncovalent
structure of DNA.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.610
And once they had those
two pieces of information,

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:02.840
they could actually put
together hand-built models.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.030
This looks kind of
clunky, but I know

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:08.720
the room they took this photo
in from my years at Caltech.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.000
In fact, I can
recognize the room.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.480
They built not just little
tiny molecular models,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.920
but big molecular models so they
could make measurements to say,

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.740
the diffraction data told me
this was so many nanometers

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.520
apart.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.770
And they were able
to piece together

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:26.930
the structure of
double-stranded DNA.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.270
But I still haven't
shown you how those two

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:31.460
strands come together.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.480
It's really intriguing, because
at that very same time, Linus

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.010
Pauling, had been--

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:38.990
done very well
with the structure

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.080
of the alpha helix
and proteins, also

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.730
was trying to figure out
the structure of DNA.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.730
But he came up with a
sort of a crazy structure

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:55.690
where he thought that it was a
triple-stranded structure where

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:02.020
the bases actually
stuck out, and somehow,

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.637
this triple-stranded structure
coded for replication of DNA.

00:31:06.637 --> 00:31:08.470
Now, there's a ton of
things that are really

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.880
awful about this structure.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.770
First of all, it's
a triple-stranded.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.960
But the other terrible
thing is there's

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.350
so many phosphates
in the backbone

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.500
there would have been massive
electrostatic repulsion.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.480
Those sequences
would want to blow

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.710
themselves apart because
you can't cram that much

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.820
negative all in one place.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.995
But it was really an intriguing
sort of sociological phenomena

00:31:32.995 --> 00:31:34.180
of the time.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.020
Pauling was a major pacifist,
and he was really, really

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.150
active in nuclear disarmament.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.540
And they said that his mind just
wasn't on some of this stuff

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.970
and that this model
came out of him really

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.620
worrying about
other things and not

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.850
focusing on the DNA structure.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:55.000
So let's try to
explain Chargaff's data

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.490
by looking at the nucleobases
and thinking about how

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.090
they might come together.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.300
So here I show
you the structures

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.920
of the four nucleobases in DNA.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.930
Wherever I have an R, you
can assume that's part.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.530
That's a ribose that is part
of the phosphodiester backbone.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.100
What we want to understand
is, how do the nucleobases

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.520
come together to form
some kind of pair that

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.690
could be useful to
programming their resynthesis?

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.330
So I've drawn them all here,
but it's not quite intuitive.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.510
I need to do a little bit of
flipping around to line things

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.820
up better.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.400
And the other thing I
need to do is get things

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.270
at the right angles
so you can start

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.780
seeing how those bases
might come together,

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.990
because Chargaff's
data dictates that you

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:48.170
have a purine and a
pyrimidine, purine pyrimidine.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.980
You have pairing
between the nucleobases

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.850
in your double-stranded
DNA in a structure

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.125
that looks more like this.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.350
And in each case, you've paired
a purine and a pyrimidine.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.570
So what I want you
to do is take a look.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.690
I've shown you now where
donors and acceptors are.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.000
You can go back and do this
for all the nucleobases.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.400
But I'm going to do
this for you right now,

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.340
by showing you the donors
and acceptors of hydrogen

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.250
bonds within those
structures, what I've done

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.320
is I've lined them
up beautifully

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.660
so they look straight
at each other,

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.750
so you can tell that
there is a complementarity

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.180
between a purine
and a pyrimidine

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.030
that makes very nice
hydrogen bonding, which

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.120
is the noncovalent force
that's very important.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.740
Between G and C, I can set
up three hydrogen bonds.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:55.070
Between A and T, I can only
set up two hydrogen bonds.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:58.390
So the one purine is
complementary to one

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.350
of the pyrimidines.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:04.150
One purine is complementary to
one of the other pyrimidines.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:08.590
And then we can draw those
hydrogen bonds in place.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:11.110
That totally explains
the measurement

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:15.010
from the Franklin data of
the distance, the width

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.050
of the double-stranded
helix, because it's

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:21.330
identical for both of
those base pair options.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.830
And that gives you
the structure that

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.280
forms the noncovalent
structure of DNA, which

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.510
is a series of interactions
where the solid line is

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.780
the phosphodiester
backbone, but sticking out

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.960
like steps on a spiral
staircase are the bases,

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:43.090
where each base is complementary
to a specific additional base.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.150
So it predicts the
Chargaff ratio,

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.469
and it also predicts
the distances.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:52.360
Now, within all
the model building,

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.480
it became quite clear
that the structure,

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.240
the noncovalent
structure of DNA,

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.890
was afforded by antiparallel
strands, where one strand went

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:07.060
in one direction,
5 prime to 3 prime,

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:11.080
and the other strand went in
the opposite direction, 5 prime

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.520
to 3 prime.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.130
When we start
replicating DNA, we're

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.390
going to see that that's
pretty convenient.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:21.920
But thermodynamically, it is
also the favored orientation.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.950
So let's just look
at the orientation.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:31.090
Where you would draw one strand
of DNA, 5 prime to 3 prime,

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.620
now I've taken this all
down to cartoon level.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:38.020
These are the phosphate
diesters, the riboses, the 3

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:41.530
prime end, and the 5 prime
end and the bases that

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.900
come off at the 1 prime carbon.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.480
And then when you pair
it with another strand,

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.680
one strand goes
in one direction.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.000
5 prime-- whoa, I don't know why
this is misbehaving, 5 prime,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.710
whoops--

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.700
5 prime to 3 prime.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.960
The other strand goes in
the other direction, 5 prime

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.200
to 3 prime.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.710
And when asked this
question a few years ago,

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.990
I couldn't really
explain it very well.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.870
I just said it had to be
because it always has been.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.270
But what's really
cool is people have

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:18.420
been able to solve the crystal
structure of a parallel pair

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.340
of DNA strands.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.180
So this is canonical DNA,
the beautiful antiparallel

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.960
structure.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.960
And it's very regular,
very, very even.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.970
It turns out,
though, when you try

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.780
to pair the two strands
in a parallel orientation,

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.480
they're very uncomfortable,
and it's much less stable.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.750
So the antiparallel
orientation is

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:43.350
very important for the
thermodynamic stability

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:47.430
and the optimum hydrogen bonding
interaction of all those bases

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.450
that are pairing.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.700
So it's actually
what nature favors

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.410
because it is more stable.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.240
Any questions?

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.310
And this, it's on your slides.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:05.090
But you can see just how
regular DNA looks so organized,

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.690
whereas the antiparallel one,
the one, the parallel one,

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.080
really does not afford
you good hydrogen bonding

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.990
interactions at all.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:18.080
So let us now--

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.060
so what we've done
now is we understand

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.720
the structure of DNA, the
noncovalent and covalent

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.100
structure of DNA.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.680
We understand it's antiparallel.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.450
What we'll do in
the next class is

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:34.280
show how you can peel apart
those antiparallel structures

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.410
to make unpaired structures.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:40.460
And you can use each of them as
the template for the synthesis

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.350
of a new strand of DNA.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:45.020
So you can get two
daughter double strands

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.120
from a single parent
double strand.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.880
And that all comes from
understanding the structure.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.540
Now, what I want to do is
move you just very briefly

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.980
to the structure of RNA and
comparing the DNA and RNA

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:01.140
structures, because there
are some differences.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.460
So let's just work through
what the differences are.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.660
I have this written down.

00:38:08.648 --> 00:38:10.910
And the differences
are very important

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:14.570
for the functional properties.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.410
So DNA, RNA.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:29.760
First of all, obviously,
deoxyribose, ribose.

00:38:32.762 --> 00:38:37.320
And you may go, why, why,
why is nature so complicated?

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.280
Why do I have this extra
factoid to remember

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.920
about RNA versus DNA?

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.620
And it's really amazing
that the difference

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:50.090
between having that hydroxyl on
the 2 prime position versus not

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:54.350
happening, not having it,
makes enormous differences

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.810
to the stability of the polymer.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:00.050
RNAs breakdown
very, very readily.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.730
DNAs are stable for
the lifetime of a cell,

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.680
all perfect in the nucleus
or at mitochondria.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.490
They stay intact.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:13.160
So there's a
stability difference

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.930
between the two sugars.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.390
Because DNA has to
be the place where

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:21.680
you store your genetic
material, it's got to stay good,

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.690
whereas RNA is the message
that you make transiently

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.000
to program a protein
being made, and then you

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.810
want to get rid of it.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.260
So we need the
differences in stability

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:37.610
that originate from
that small feature.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:41.912
ATGC-- there's the difference--

00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:47.720
AUGC in the bases.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:54.830
The most common DNA is
double-stranded DNA,

00:39:54.830 --> 00:40:02.310
whereas RNA forms
various structures, so

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:06.420
much more irregular structures
than the DNA, probably in part

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.390
because the ribose is
substituted differently.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:13.710
So that continuous strand
of double-stranded material

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.230
is not quite so stable in RNA.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:20.420
We find DNA principally
as double-stranded DNA.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:28.260
But the RNA we find as
transfer RNA, messenger RNA,

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:32.640
ribosomal RNA-- it
does go on forever--

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.410
short interfering RNA.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.610
So various RNA is used
for a lot of purposes,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:45.660
whereas DNA principally stays
as the double-stranded DNA.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.060
There's a little
double-stranded RNA,

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:52.710
but it is a precursor to some
of these other forms of RNA.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.950
So this slide just summarizes
some of that for you,

00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:00.240
the differences
comparing DNA and RNA.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.440
And so what we'll see later
is how RNA lends itself

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.710
to these interesting structures
where you still have some base

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.410
pairing, but you have a
lot of loops and turns

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.300
and diversity of structure.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.960
And that's really kind of
the origin of this RNA world,

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.390
where RNA structures were not--

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:22.950
could have variety of
form that might contribute

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.280
to different functions
beyond just as a message,

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.040
as a place to store
a DNA message.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.350
So there are a lot
of things that one

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:35.400
can understand about DNA by
knowing its hydrogen bonding

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.330
patterns.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.930
So can you guys guess
which of these strands

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.940
would have a
complementary strand

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.270
and be the most stable
double-stranded DNA?

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:47.250
So this would be one strand.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.640
You could draw for each of
them it complementary strand.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.130
Can you guess the
clues to figuring out

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.100
which would have a most
stable organization

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.140
of the antiparallel
double-stranded DNA?

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.330
What would I be looking for?

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:01.830
Yeah?

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:05.880
AUDIENCE: More Gs
and Cs [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.440
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
So number one,

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.300
higher GC content because Gs and
Cs form three hydrogen bonds.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.160
As and Ts only form two.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.620
And what's the other
determinant, just looking

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.432
at those structures?

00:42:18.432 --> 00:42:19.374
Yeah?

00:42:19.374 --> 00:42:21.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:23.650
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
Yeah, you are doing--

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:24.350
no.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:27.280
It's actually even more silly.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.022
It's more simple than that.

00:42:30.022 --> 00:42:30.730
AUDIENCE: Length?

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:31.813
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Length.

00:42:31.813 --> 00:42:33.830
So all you do is you
go along and say,

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:38.500
I can make three hydrogen bonds,
two, three, two, two, three,

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.730
two, two, two.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:44.810
So you truly just count hydrogen
bonds in its partner sequence,

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.410
and you can guess
which is going to be

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:51.940
the more stable because it
has the most hydrogen bonds.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.260
So we might ask you that.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.760
Which one will come apart?

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.780
Now, the intriguing thing
about DNA is you can peel it.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.930
You can heat it, and
it'll come apart.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.270
But it doesn't denature
the way proteins do.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.630
If you just cool it down,
it comes back together.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:18.280
So another feature of DNA is
that you can heat, denature,

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:25.260
and then reanneal exactly how
it was in the first place.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.290
It doesn't denature to something
that's not very useful.

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:35.450
And now the question, can you
draw the complementary strand?

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:39.200
I always find, of
this top strand

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.780
here, which of these is
the complementary strand?

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.490
Frankly, the best
way to do it is

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:45.980
sketch out the
complementary stand.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.110
You can see it
kind of upside down

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.680
because it's really hard to
draw things 5 prime to 3 prime

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.300
when you're also trying to
figure out base pairing.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.970
So draw it upside down.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:59.090
Make sure you know the 5
prime and the 3 prime end.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.980
And then you can
guess the right answer

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.920
for these types of questions
about complementary strands.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.870
Now, one last
question, the stability

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:10.290
of double-stranded DNA.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:14.150
I've made a whole big deal
about hydrogen bonding.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:15.830
That's what holds it together.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:18.470
What other forces
could be at play

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.300
in double-stranded
DNA that might

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.920
contribute to its stability?

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.110
Any thoughts?

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.360
What else?

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.430
Well, it certainly
doesn't look like it's

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:32.400
charged, because the
predominant charge is negative.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.360
There's not an-- you've probably
got metal ions there, kind

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.490
of neutralizing that charge.

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:44.320
What would be the other force,
and how would I describe it?

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.300
It's a tricky one.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.340
So we've got these bases, and
they're pretty hydrophobic.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.120
They're planes.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.300
They have electron
density on both sides.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.540
So it turns out there
is some stability

00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:00.440
gained between the packing
of the steps of DNA

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.180
between each base pair with
the next, with the next.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.690
So there are hydrophobic forces.

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:09.830
And researchers at Scripps have
actually proved this paradigm

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:14.030
by making extra DNA bases that
don't have hydrogen bonding

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.330
partnerships, but just
provide the stuff that's

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:21.470
the flat hydrophobic entity
with the right size that

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:25.840
can slip into DNA sequences
and make stable [INAUDIBLE],,

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.720
make stable not really base
pairs anymore, but just

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.260
be stable in that
polymeric structure.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.250
Are people understanding
and following that?

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.400
So finally, when we look
at the structure of DNA,

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.970
there are some trenches
where things can bind to,

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:50.090
proteins can bind, and we
talk about the major groove

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:51.170
and the minor groove.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:52.850
But I will talk
about those later

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.340
on when we talk about
transcription factors.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.630
Now, I just want to, in
really triple-fast time,

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:02.900
and I'll put this
on the website,

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.480
there's tremendous
interest in using

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.900
the building blocks
of DNA for information

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.700
storage in computing.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:14.430
So if you look up DNA-based
computing on Wikipedia,

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.520
you'll learn a
whole lot about it.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.400
Because what's so
exciting about it is it's

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:23.000
an organized nanoscale
material that

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.540
can be programmed to base pair
and form certain structures.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:30.470
So in the sort of range
of different sizes,

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.050
there's been a lot
of interest in DNA

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:35.210
as a material for
information storage,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.510
not for your genetic material,
but for plain old information

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:39.380
storage.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.980
So people have learned how
to build structures of DNA

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:46.610
where they can construct these
sort of cruciform structures

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:48.170
by base pairing.

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:51.080
They can make the arms of
these structures a little bit

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.010
extended.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.860
So you could start joining
those things together

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:59.510
to make very defined
three-dimensional entities.

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.790
They went kind of nuts
doing this sort of stuff

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:04.460
because you can build
sort of tetrahedra

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.170
and other sort of
shapes and sizes,

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.220
all by strands that
base pair, that

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.370
are about 10 base pairs
long, that are stable,

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:16.170
and only complement
certain other base pairs.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:18.230
So you could literally
build up-- they often

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:21.830
called it DNA origami
because you can build up

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:27.440
macroscopic structures just by
the assembly of strands of DNA

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.250
that will ultimately fold to
form the best complementary DNA

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:32.810
to form the structures.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:35.000
And it's also been found--

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.750
as I said, they went completely
nuts-- smiley faces and stars

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.280
and stripes and so on.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.700
But the most valuable
thing you can-- as I said,

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.650
you can read more about this--

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:49.990
is to use DNA as logic
gates to define and,

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:53.780
or, or not, so the
sort of three options,

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.980
and actually use them to
program certain puzzles where

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:01.340
the DNA will spit out the
answer to a particular puzzle

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.620
through a logic diagram.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:06.650
So those of you who are
interested in computing

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:10.130
and these kinds of
logic puzzles may

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:12.200
want to read a little
bit more, because DNA

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.800
is such a reliable
noncovalent structure,

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.100
where those base pairs are
incredibly reliable, that you

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.580
can start envisioning not just
building double-stranded DNA,

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:26.240
but building all kinds of
architectures or programming

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.730
things with the sequence of DNA.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:30.500
And that's it for today.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.460
And that's the end of
the biochemistry section.

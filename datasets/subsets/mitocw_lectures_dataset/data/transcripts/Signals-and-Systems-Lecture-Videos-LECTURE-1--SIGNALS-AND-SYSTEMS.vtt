00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:28.710
DENNIS FREEMAN: Everybody would
like to believe that they just

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.279
simply sort of think about
the subject a little bit,

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.320
and it will come to them.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.160
It's kind of like the
osmosis theory of learning.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.350
But in fact, the way you
get good at something

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.550
is practicing.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.840
It's the same for music.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.980
It's the same for sports.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.315
It's the same for academics.

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:44.940
So the way you get
good in this subject

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.640
is to work on the homework.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.650
We'll give two
kinds of homework.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.320
There will be conventional
kinds of problems followed

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.680
by engineering design problems.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.110
The conventional
kinds of problems

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.350
are intended to be
the kinds of problems

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.390
that have simple, unambiguous,
easily checkable answers--

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.860
so well-defined problem,
single, unambiguous answer,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.930
the kinds of problems that
you might be expecting

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.080
to see on an exam, for example.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.874
But then we'll also have
engineering design problems.

00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:27.540
Engineering design
problems are intended

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.710
to be a little more
ambitious, a little more

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.690
fun, a little harder, perhaps,
perhaps not completely

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.310
well-specified, sort of more
like the kind of a problem

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.700
that your boss might give
you after you've graduated.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.670
So part of the exercise
will be figuring out

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.240
exactly how to convince
somebody that you've

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.260
got the right answer.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.880
So those kinds of
problems are often--

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.970
it will often be the case
that numerics will help you

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.600
in making an argument.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.630
So it often will be
the case that we'll

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.370
ask you to plot something.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.880
Or maybe you just decide that a
plot is the most effective way

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.140
to communicate your result.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.830
We are completely ambivalent
about what programming

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.750
language that you use.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.170
Since 6.01 and 6.02
are prerequisites,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.120
we assume you all know Python.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.780
So all the examples that
I give in lecture handouts

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.080
or in homework solutions
will be in Python.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.170
But if you'd rather use
Matlab, I just don't care.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.260
OK, we're completely ambivalent
about what programming language

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.940
you use.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.560
But it will be important
that in some of the problems

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.540
you'll find that useful
to be able to generate

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.200
a numerical kind of solution.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.074
These are very different
kinds of problems.

00:02:50.074 --> 00:02:51.490
And to help you
with both of them,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.220
we have a different
idea about each.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.170
So to help you with the
conventional problems, the kind

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.520
that have precise,
easy-to-check answers,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.340
we've developed for the first
time ever over the summer

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.450
a tutor-type
environment for 6.003.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.850
So this was intended to be
like the tutor environment

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.500
that we use in 6.01.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.147
It's one of the more
popular aspects of 6.01,

00:03:16.147 --> 00:03:17.730
the fact that you
can put in an answer

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.460
and hit the button
that says Check.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.160
OK, so we're going
to have one of those.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.510
So the idea is going to be that
in the case that we ask you

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.380
a simple question that
has a precise answer,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.290
we'll use a tutor environment
to let you check your answer

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.480
to see if you got
the right answer.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.610
In the case of the
engineering design problems,

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.570
that won't be the case.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.360
It will not be the case
that it's very easy at all

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.974
to think about a computer
program that would check you.

00:03:45.974 --> 00:03:47.890
So the alternative is
going to be that we will

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.847
have extended office hours.

00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:53.180
So we're going to have something
that I think of as open

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.390
or block office hours.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.380
Monday and Tuesday
afternoon and early evening,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.010
we've reserved the
basement of Stata, 32-044,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.250
for use of this class,
the idea being that that's

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.750
a nice space you
can just come there

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.570
to work any time you want to

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.720
hopefully because it's nice,
and hopefully because you all

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.310
know that there will be
other 6.003 people there,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.070
you'll just decide that's
a good place to work.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.680
And that's convenient because
in these engineering design

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.050
problems, if you run
into something that's

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.970
unclear to you, we
don't really want

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.660
you to spend an hour pondering
what was being asked.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.950
So we want to make it
easy for you to get help.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.330
And you can get help from
peers, from other students who

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.150
are there, but
we'll also make sure

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.730
that there is at least one
6.003 staff member there all

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.306
the time.

00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:50.390
OK, so the homeworks
will be due on Wednesday.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.930
That's the strategic value
of Mondays and Tuesdays.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.150
So you can use that time
to get ready for turning

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.604
in the homework on Wednesday.

00:05:00.604 --> 00:05:01.520
Questions or comments?

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.280
OK, we're required
to say something

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.640
about what we mean by
a collaboration policy.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.522
So in this course, we would
like you to talk to each other

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.480
and help each other figure
out what's going on.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.730
At the same time, we'd
like to reward you

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.860
for being on the honest side,
by which I'm going to mean,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.250
if you sign your name to
something, you actually did it.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.950
So we'd like to believe that
the homework that you turn in

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.040
under your name, you did.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.570
You're perfectly welcome
to talk to each other,

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.900
to talk to the staff,
to talk to friends who

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.490
took this course previously.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.990
Get all the help
you like in trying

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.327
to understand the concepts.

00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:49.410
But when it comes down to
writing up your homework

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.860
and turning it in, we expect
that what you signed your name

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.590
to is something you did.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.410
If you got especially
large amount of help

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.490
at the conceptual level, we'd
like you to acknowledge that.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.250
You don't need to acknowledge
that the TAs helped you.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.919
We expect that.

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.460
But if you collaborated
with somebody

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.530
to understand what
the problem was,

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.050
we'd like you to tell us that.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.390
Just write at the top,
collaborated on figuring out

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.260
the concepts with so-and-so.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.110
But we'd like you to have
written your homework.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.810
So for example, we would
like you not to say,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.780
I copied so-and-so's is
homework word for word

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.510
even though that's an honest
statement, that's not something

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.580
that we're actually looking for.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.841
OK, is that clear?

00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:34.340
We want you to work
together, but we

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.470
would like you to write
up your own solutions.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:44.130
OK, we have firm deadlines.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.300
The homeworks will always
be due on Wednesday.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.010
You'll be able to slip
on one without penalty.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.770
So if you turn in one
late, it won't change--

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.360
it won't have any effect
on your grade whatever.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.910
If you do twice, that
could have an effect.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.060
Unless you're excused by
a dean or an instructor

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.295
or a medical person,
that submission

00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:10.170
will count half what it
would normally count.

00:07:12.654 --> 00:07:15.070
I should have mentioned when
I was talking about homework,

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.690
homework 1 is already posted.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.604
It will be due next Wednesday.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:27.060
The online submission part
is almost ready to be posted

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.110
and will be posted
later this afternoon.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.070
So right now, you can
see all the problems.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.997
But the online will become
available this afternoon.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.840
OK, here is 003 at a glance.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.500
It's not too unlike what
you might have expected.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.280
Just a couple of things to
point out, the order of coverage

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.900
is not the same as
the order of coverage

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.370
in Oppenheim and Willsky.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.350
The reason for doing that
is that having taught

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.090
this class for 15
years, I just think

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:05.120
there's some subjects that
are easier starting points

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.150
than others.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.160
So I'm doing what I
think is the easiest

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.340
entry to this
material with the idea

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.620
that after you've got the
easy stuff under your belt,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.860
it's easier to move on to
the more difficult material.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.630
So the order is not
precisely the same

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.940
as that in Oppenheim
and Willsky.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.360
But there is a map on the
website that gives you

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.320
a week-by-week breakdown of what
part of Oppenheim and Willsky

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.120
are we working on right now.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.870
So Oppenheim and Willsky
is the recommended text.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.600
But it's not quite
in the regular order

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.641
of Oppenheim and Willsky.

00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:42.250
See We will eventually cover
exactly the same material that

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.669
is in--

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.130
Oppenheim and Willsky was
written for this class.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.220
We'll cover the
same material, just

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.720
not quite in the same order.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.630
Another thing to
notice is exams.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.960
We'll have three midterm
exams and a final.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.035
The midterm exams are all
evening exams, 7:30 to 9:30

00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:02.910
on Wednesday evening.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.300
The idea is that
there's intended

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.700
to be a gentle ramp
through the exams.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.200
Exam 1 is worth 10%.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.240
Exam 2 is worth 15%.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.400
Exam 3 is worth 20%.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.390
The final exam is worth 40%

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.789
so the idea is that if you
have a mismatch on the way--

00:09:24.789 --> 00:09:26.330
if you don't quite
understand the way

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.440
we're going to be
asking questions

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.210
and so forth, there's
not a big penalty

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.160
for screwing up the first exam.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.890
That's the idea.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.940
So there's intended
to be a gentle ramp

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.672
in how much of the exams count.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.510
OK, and finally,
I'd like feedback

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.350
on what you think is happening.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.960
So I would like to ask
for a few volunteers--

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.640
few is four or fewer--

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.420
who would be interested
to meet with me

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.730
once a week just to
tell me what you think.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.030
Ideally, those people
would be kind of outgoing

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.241
and tell me things that
other people think too.

00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:08.740
But if you're
completely introverted

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.520
and want to only tell me what
you think, that's fine too.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.540
So this is an
opportunity for you

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.241
to tell the staff,
to give us feedback

00:10:20.241 --> 00:10:21.240
on how things are going.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.115
We're going too slow.

00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:23.050
We're going too fast.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.008
We're going too boring.

00:10:24.008 --> 00:10:26.565
We're intensely too
interesting, that kind of stuff.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:35.350
And it's an opportunity for you
to understand our perspective.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.370
Well, the reason we
did that was blah.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.180
And you can tell us, yeah,
but that's not important.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:46.170
So it's an opportunity
for you to convey to us

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.420
how you think things are
going and how you think

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.740
things should be different.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.410
It's also an opportunity for
you to learn about teaching.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.020
So if you think about
teaching as a career,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.970
it's a good thing to do--

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.730
completely voluntary,
has absolutely no effect

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.110
on your grade.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.420
If you think you
might be interested,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.271
it's probably going to meet on--

00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:08.020
we'll probably meet
on Thursday afternoon.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.085
But that's negotiable since
it's only four people.

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:13.210
And if you are interested,
please send me an email.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.100
And the first four people
who ask, they're there.

00:11:19.168 --> 00:11:21.976
OK?

00:11:21.976 --> 00:11:25.892
That's it on administration.

00:11:25.892 --> 00:11:27.350
Are there things
you'd like to know

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.891
about course
administration before we

00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:30.200
go on to technical things?

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.460
Wonderful.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.570
OK, this course
is about systems.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.990
This is not the first course
you've had about systems.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.697
You've had lots of
courses in systems.

00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:50.030
Every physics course you've
ever taken is about systems.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.030
What's different
about this course

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.280
is the way we think
about systems.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.500
We think about systems
in a particular way that

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.610
turns out to be extraordinarily
powerful, useful,

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.850
shows up all the time.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.980
And that's what the
focus of the course is.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.480
That

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.130
The abstraction that
we're going to use

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:16.620
is we think about a
system as a thing that

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.610
has an input and an output.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:24.100
Given the input and the system,
you can compute the output.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.430
Systems have one
input and one output.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.660
It's a very special
way of thinking

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:36.670
about a system that turns out
to be surprisingly powerful.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.000
It's so powerful that that's
really the thing that we

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.280
will focus on in this class.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:53.860
So it's the thing that I will
call the 6.003 abstraction.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.610
That's going to be the
theme in everything we do,

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.190
that representation.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.020
And the best way to
get across, I think,

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.180
how that's different from
other representations

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.890
that you're already
quite familiar with

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.330
is to just look at an example.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.040
So here's a system that I'm
sure you all know all about.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.705
Right?

00:13:12.705 --> 00:13:14.080
This is not the
first time you've

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.204
seen this kind of a system.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.530
So you all know how to do this.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.945
Free-body diagrams,
F equals ma--

00:13:22.945 --> 00:13:25.120
there's an enormous
number of ways

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.700
that you can analyze
such a system.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.550
We're going to take a
very special approach

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.340
where we think about
the system as having

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.400
an input and an output.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.960
OK, that's a little
bit arbitrary.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.400
We'll say a little more in
a minute about how arbitrary

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.180
it is.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.200
But the idea is going
to be that this system,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.260
the mass-spring system,
the anvil with a spring,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.060
there's an input, and
there's an output.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.810
So for example, for
some particular purpose,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.730
I might want to think
that the input is

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.070
the position of my hand.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.160
One reason I might want
to think about that is it

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.120
is under my control.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.890
So it might be
reasonable to think

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.140
about my hand being the input.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.350
So for example, my
hand can do this.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.390
Right?

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.600
So I might think about
the position of my hand

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.670
being the input.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.410
So if I did that,
then what I could do

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.325
is characterize the input
by some waveform, a signal.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.330
In order to use the
abstraction, I also

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.550
have to say what the output is.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.630
I might be interested,
for example,

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.310
in knowing the
position of the mass.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.740
Then the output would be the
displacement of the mass.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.990
That assignment of input and
output is somewhat arbitrary.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.420
I get to choose that to
make the problem that I'm

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.300
interested in as
easy as possible.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.810
So for example, if I'm thinking
about this mass and spring

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.770
system here, using
my hand as the input,

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.690
that seems kind of
natural because that's

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.650
the thing I control.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.900
Thinking about the position
of the mass as the output,

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.690
that seems reasonable
because that's

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.800
the thing you can
take a picture of.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.110
It's the thing you can observe
from where you are now.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.640
But it's not unique.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.580
I might have wanted to
think about the force

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:32.010
that I'm putting into
it as in the input.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.830
I might have wanted to
think about the output being

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.950
the acceleration of the mass.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.780
Maybe there's some limit
to how much acceleration

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.190
some mass can take.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.270
So you get to choose the
input and the output.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.120
But you have to choose
an input and an output.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.190
That's part of the abstraction.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.420
And that's part of the power.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.570
We'll see later that part of
the power of doing it this way

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:01.780
is that you draw attention
to the things of interest

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.090
and push into the background the
parts that are not of interest,

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.920
at least not now.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.910
This kind of an abstraction
is an extremely versatile.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:17.000
Here's a completely
different kind of problem.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.120
Imagine water
flowing into a tank.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.980
The tank is leaky,
so it flows out.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.027
There's a second tank.

00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:26.360
OK, what on earth could this be?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.500
This could be--
maybe this is the--

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.660
it's appropriate today.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.870
It's raining, or it was raining.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.500
It was pouring.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.720
Rain When I came
in, it was pouring.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:46.770
Maybe this is nature
delivering rain.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.390
This is the Woburn
reservoir from which

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.929
we get water in Boston.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.970
Maybe this is the Fresh
Pond reservoir from which

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.630
we get water in Cambridge.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.900
Maybe this is the
rate at which water

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.940
goes from Woburn to Fresh Pond.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.730
Maybe this is the rate at
which water leaves Fresh Pond

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.490
and goes into consumers' houses.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.460
The point is that
there's some abstraction.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.260
There's some
physical-- actually,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.460
I didn't say that right.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.200
There's a physical thing--

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:26.660
rain, Woburn, Woburn reservoir,
Fresh Pond reservoir,

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.314
consumers' houses.

00:17:28.314 --> 00:17:29.480
There's some physical thing.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.180
There's some laws of
physics that dictate things.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:37.040
But we ignore-- or ignore
is not quite the right way

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.150
to think about it.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.850
We think about those
rules of physics

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.840
as rules that govern the
input-output relationship.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.440
So we think about then
the entire system.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.950
Rather than thinking about it
as reservoirs and rain and water

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.630
and flow and all
that sort of thing,

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:59.780
we think about it as
there's a signal in, rain,

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.830
and there's a signal
out, water usage.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.290
And we take all the
details of the system

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.400
and bury it in this box.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.480
It's an abstraction.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.150
It's a way to suppress some
details to highlight others.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.710
OK, and we use this in a
huge variety of situations.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.820
We can think about a third
example here, our cell phone.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.070
Cell phone is an enormously
complicated system.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.470
But for the purpose of
understanding the input-output

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:35.720
characteristics, if what I
really want to know is how good

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.700
is the quality of the audio--

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.250
not that that's even a little
bit important for cell phones.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.000
Right?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.754
Cell phones are important for
texting and taking pictures

00:18:43.754 --> 00:18:45.170
and have nothing
to do with voice.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.960
But in the old days, cell
phones had to do with voice.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.150
And I made this slide back
when that was still true.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.560
So I apologize it's out of date.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.970
So here, the important thing
of the cell phone system

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.540
was the sound in
and the sound out.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.750
And the idea was to represent
the cell phone system

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.300
by the transformation between
how the sound comes in

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.140
and how the sound comes out.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.170
OK, so we do this for an
enormous number of reasons.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.870
One is that it's
widely applicable.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.680
You can do this kind of a
characterization for systems

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.680
from electrical systems,
mechanical systems,

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.000
optical systems, acoustic
systems, biological systems,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.250
financial systems,
all over the place.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.380
That means that this
kind of an approach

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.920
is very powerful because
it's so widely applicable.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.860
It also means that, for example,
every engineering discipline

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.910
everywhere has some
course like this.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.690
It's just too
powerful not to do it.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.190
So regardless of what
department you were in,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.090
in the School of
Engineering, for example,

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.820
there is something like this.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.470
Another reason
this is interesting

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:03.070
is that it provides a layer
of abstraction that lets

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.760
you focus on certain things.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.280
So for example, let's expand
on the cell phone network.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.670
Imagine that sound
comes into a cell phone.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:15.990
Well, the job of the phone
is to communicate to a tower.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:21.090
And that communication is via
some electromagnetic signal.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.200
Then the job of the tower is to
communicate with another tower.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.629
That happens in
all kinds of ways.

00:20:27.629 --> 00:20:28.920
It could be a fiber optic link.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.940
It could be a satellite link.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.170
It could be electromagnetism.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.040
It could be lots of
different things.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.550
There's a lot of different
technologies for getting towers

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.290
to talk to towers.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.630
Then towers talk
back to cell phones

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.780
via electromagnetic
signals just like these.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.340
And the cell phone eventually
generates an acoustical output.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.000
The idea is that by thinking
about the signals and systems

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.580
approach, we have abstracted
away everything other

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.800
than the flow of information.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.780
It makes it easy to
concentrate, to follow

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.170
the flow of information
through a complex system.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:12.250
Because we have
pushed every element

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.150
into the same framework--

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.510
every element has an
input and an output--

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:21.610
regardless of the
underlying substrate,

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.400
the analysis is similar.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.250
That means that
components that are

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.320
characterized using
this abstraction

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.320
are easily combined.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.060
So we refer to this as--

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.330
we say that these systems
are combinational.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.000
Their combinational in
the same sense that Python

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.860
was combinational in 6.01.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:47.500
If you represent things
by Python functions,

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.850
it's very easy to combine the
functions to have a bigger

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:57.150
function whose purpose and
details can be understood

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:02.610
without knowing what was inside
every individual function.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.730
Similarly here, by knowing
the input behavior--

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.290
the input-output
behavior of the cell

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.590
phone, the input-output
behavior of the tower,

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.270
the input-output
behavior of this tower,

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.650
it's easy to compose then.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.680
And in fact, we'll spend a
fair amount of time thinking

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.472
through the rules
of combination.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:28.430
So that's kind of an overview of
the most important thing we're

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.310
going to talk about in this
class, which is the 6.003

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.860
abstraction, the
idea of representing

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.050
a system by the
way it transforms

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:42.520
an input into an output.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.520
So with that kind of
overview, what I want to do

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.140
next is say a little more
about what are signals

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.610
and what are systems.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.010
It's the signals and
systems abstraction.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.010
We're going to need to know
some more details about what is

00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:01.190
a signal and what is a system.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.390
So basically, a signal is
just a mathematical function.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.407
In all the examples I
talked about so far,

00:23:08.407 --> 00:23:09.990
and in many of the
examples that we'll

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.530
talk about throughout
the term, the function

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.630
is a function of time.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.730
And the signal can have
many different dimensions.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:23.620
So for example, the
mass-spring system

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.520
evolved as a function of time.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.520
The tank system, the
leaky tank system

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.420
evolved as a function of time.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.450
The cell phone system
had acoustic signals

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.760
that were functions of time.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.220
Time was the same in each case.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.780
But the dependent variable
can be a variety of things.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.670
Here it was position.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:50.280
So here it was flow rates,
meter cubed per second of water.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.900
Here it was perhaps pascals,
some unit of pressure

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.260
to characterize the
acoustic waveform.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:05.210
So the point is that signals
are generally functions.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.260
We'll see that just like
functions in mathematics,

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.147
there's a lot more to functions
than dependent variables

00:24:12.147 --> 00:24:13.230
and independent variables.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.104
And in fact, that's
going to be a key feature

00:24:15.104 --> 00:24:17.630
of our analysis of signals.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.470
But that's to come.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.760
So for the time being, the
simplest and complete model

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.910
for what a signal is is
it's just a function.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.940
The function doesn't have to
be a one-dimensional function.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.360
In fact, a lot of the
interesting applications

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.950
of signals and
systems is to look

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.760
at multi-dimensioned functions.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.020
So for example, my
research is in hearing.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.640
I'm interested to study
how do the cells respond

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:49.490
to sound so that we can
understand how broken ears work

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.970
differently.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.190
When you have a hearing
deficit, like I do,

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.680
when you have a
hearing deficit, what

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.220
is the manifestation of that
at a signal-processing level?

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.440
How do the cells
respond differently

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.710
to people who have impaired
hearing from people

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.500
who have normal hearing?

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.330
In order to study
that problem, we

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:16.650
take video pictures of the
cells at large magnifications

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:21.740
and watch them wiggle
when sounds hit them.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.890
So that's a
picture-processing example.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:30.200
So the signals, the independent
variable is not just time.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.190
It's a picture.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:34.174
So it might have x and y.

00:25:34.174 --> 00:25:36.340
In fact, the pictures we
take are three dimensional.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.537
So it has x, y, and z.

00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:40.620
And in fact, they're four
dimensional because they

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.440
change with time.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.750
We apply this kind
of a technique

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.350
on 4D signals-- x, y, z, time.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.920
But it's still the property.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.940
It still has a property
that the signals of interest

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.870
are functions.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.420
We will be especially
interested in this class

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.550
in two distinct
representations of signals.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.030
We will call them CT
signals and DT signals.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.280
CT is continuous time.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.190
DT is discrete time.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.850
We're very interested in
that because we're engineers.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:27.170
A lot of physics lives
in continuous time.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.540
OK, the
mass-spring-dashpot system,

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.670
the signals were
functions of time.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:37.375
Time was a continuously
varying independent variable.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.710
So the leaky tank,
the cell phones, those

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:48.650
were all systems whose
signals evolve in time.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.450
So they're all continuous.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.582
You can start with a
second and break it in half

00:26:52.582 --> 00:26:55.040
and get a half a second and a
half, and a half, and a half.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.850
And there's no limit to how
many halves you can take.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:04.490
By contrast, a lot of the
systems that we will look at

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:10.530
are things that evolve
in discrete time.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.500
What's your bank account?

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.970
Well it only gets
computed once a day.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.370
So it doesn't make sense to
talk about your bank account

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.140
at 9 AM and 2 PM.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.140
Right?

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.470
The bank updates your
account once a day.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.050
So it's something that
happens in discrete time.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:33.240
It's something that happens
in all computational systems.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.030
So computational
systems generally

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:42.950
operate on signals that are
functions of discrete time.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.520
What was the state at time zero?

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.410
What was the state at time one?

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.480
What was the state at time two?

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.890
So the system is something that
eats a discrete time signal

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:01.020
and generates a discrete
time output signal.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.120
And a unique part
of this class will

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.190
be converting between
the two representations.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.530
Because as engineers,
we often want

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:12.150
to build something that
operates in the physical world--

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.650
masses and springs
and reservoirs

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.710
and that kind of stuff--

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.430
and do the processing
computationally.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.080
Ever since the advent
of digital electronics,

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.980
it's just much easier.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.740
Digital one, it's
just much easier

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:33.120
to process signals in
the digital domain.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.630
So we will often
be interested in,

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.620
how do you represent
a signal who

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.350
naturally lives in
the physical world,

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.150
and is therefore a part--

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:48.470
whose signals are continuous
in nature, continuous time,

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.720
how do you convert it into
a discrete representation

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.130
so you can crunch
it on a computer?

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.480
And in fact, how do you go back?

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.290
So for example, if
we were thinking

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.200
about processing
audio signals, we

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.910
might want to think
about how we would

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.980
take a signal of
continuous time and turn it

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.740
into a discrete
time representation.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.650
That's precisely what
we do when we want

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.530
to record something in MP3.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.060
MP3 represents a sound.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.500
A sound is something
that I think

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.370
of as a signal in
continuous time.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:23.830
It's pascals as a
function of seconds.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.490
But we want to represent
it by a sequence of numbers

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.340
because it's a sequence of
numbers that's easy to store,

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.520
to communicate, et cetera.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.890
We do the same sort
of thing with images.

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:39.580
The images of the ear that I
talked about in my research

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.610
are things that I think about
happening at continuous space.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.920
Every time we look at a
smaller and smaller dimension,

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.410
we get a different
answer because the image

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:53.030
has no quantization in space.

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.470
But when I crunch
it, I don't want

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.800
to work in something
in continuous space.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.950
I want to work in a sampled
version like a JPEG version.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.900
Similarly we want
to convert back.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.860
I mean it would be useless
for the case of the cell phone

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.750
to convert it into a
discrete representation

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.880
and then not be able to hear it.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.090
So we'll think about
the inverse process,

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.470
which is reconstruction.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.930
If you had a discrete
representation of a signal,

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.620
how would you turn it into
a continuous representation?

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.240
And there's lots of ways people
do that here's a way that we

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.110
call zero-order hold
where you convert

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:35.460
every sample into a
corresponding voltage

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.910
and just hold that voltage until
the next sample comes along.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.100
This is the representation
that is most commonly

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.225
used in things like MP3.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.320
By contrast, we might
do something cleverer.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.380
We might literally
extrapolate between samples.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.590
That is commonly done
in picture processing.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.960
The reason we use the
two different schemes is

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.580
that psychophysically,
the things that

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.700
are important to your
eyes and the things that

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.420
are important to your
ears are different.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.900
So you would hear
the errors more

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.760
if you did the
linear interpolation.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.280
And you would see
the errors more

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.320
if you did the
other interpolation.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.945
And we'll do lots of examples
later on in the course

00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:21.070
so you see why that's true.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.140
OK, too much talking,
not enough thinking--

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.920
so I've told you a
lot about signals.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.530
Now, I'd like you to
think about some signals.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.920
And so a common thing I'm
going to do in this class

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.230
is ask you to think
about a question,

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.530
talk to your neighbor, come
to a consensus, and then vote.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.640
So that's what we're
going to do here.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.890
I'm going to play some sounds.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.290
You're going to try to
figure out what signals were

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.120
represented by those sounds.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.290
But I would like you to have an
opinion before we communicate

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.750
the answer because you
can prove that people

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.550
get more out of it when
there's something at stake.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.770
So I would like you to
work with a partner.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.880
So in order to work with a
partner, everybody stand up.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.557
Introduce yourself
to your neighbor.

00:32:08.557 --> 00:32:09.640
Figure out a good partner.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.764
Figure out where they live.

00:32:10.764 --> 00:32:12.404
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.820
OK, so what I'm going
to do now is play

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.380
a computer-generated sound.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.260
This is a computer-generated
speech sound

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.500
made by Bob Donovan who did
his PhD thesis figuring out

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.230
how to do
computer-generated speech.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:17.320
And then I'm going to play four
transformations of that sound.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.770
And your task is
to identify what's

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.050
the mathematical representation
of the transformations

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.570
that I'm telling you.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.160
OK, so first, the original.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:32.283
First is the signal
that Bob Donovan made.

00:33:32.283 --> 00:33:34.074
COMPUTER-GENERATED
SPEECH: I must apologize

00:33:34.074 --> 00:33:35.541
for speaking [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:37.986
But you see, I have no brain.

00:33:40.754 --> 00:33:42.170
DENNIS FREEMAN:
And now, I'm going

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:46.400
to play a sequence of
four transformations--

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.230
one, two, three, four.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.210
And the question
is going to be is

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:55.160
this the correct mathematical
representation for this sound.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.910
The sound you just
heard was f of t.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:03.290
Is the following sound,
which by definition is f1,

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:04.630
the same as f of 2t?

00:34:07.985 --> 00:34:09.610
COMPUTER-GENERATED
SPEECH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:15.145 --> 00:34:16.888
DENNIS FREEMAN: You're
allowed to talk.

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:18.864
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:34:58.845 --> 00:35:01.530
OK, remember that answer.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:05.923
Now, is the following
sound minus f of t.

00:35:05.923 --> 00:35:07.547
COMPUTER-GENERATED
SPEECH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.008
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.150
DENNIS FREEMAN: OK,
remember that answer.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:46.185
Is the following sound f of 2t?

00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:47.809
COMPUTER-GENERATED
SPEECH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:57.062 --> 00:36:02.505
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:36:02.505 --> 00:36:05.940
DENNIS FREEMAN: And finally,
is the following signal

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.110
one third of f of t?

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.901

for speaking [INAUDIBLE].

But you see, I have no brain.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.290
DENNIS FREEMAN: OK,
confer with your partner.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.090
Figure out how many are true.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.820
Because in 30 seconds, I'm going
to ask you to raise your hand.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.808
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:36:44.381 --> 00:36:44.880
Question or?

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.122
AUDIENCE: Question,
f of t [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:49.080
DENNIS FREEMAN: f of t
was the original signal.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.075
AUDIENCE: I know,
but like [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:53.075 --> 00:36:55.380
DENNIS FREEMAN: Ah,
pressure, pressure

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.059
in the acoustic waveform.

00:36:57.059 --> 00:36:59.404
AUDIENCE: If you were
to have minus f of t,

00:36:59.404 --> 00:37:01.504
your ear wouldn't [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:01.504 --> 00:37:02.670
DENNIS FREEMAN: That's true.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.010
OK, how many of those
statements are true?

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.740
Raise your hand with some number
of fingers, keeping in mind

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.710
that you're voting having
collaborated with your partner.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.620
So it's not your
fault. You have a--

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.370
right, anyway.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.626
OK, so how many?

00:37:18.626 --> 00:37:19.750
Everybody raise your hands.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:20.333
I want to see.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.820
OK, it's about 90%--

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.910
no, less than that
about 85% correct.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:34.773
OK, so first one,
was that f of 2t?

00:37:34.773 --> 00:37:35.587
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:37.170
DENNIS FREEMAN: Why
do you think that?

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:40.320
Everybody seems
to be saying yes.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:40.990
It was fast.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:41.850
It sounded faster.

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.824
So what's faster mean from
a signal point of view?

00:37:44.824 --> 00:37:47.167
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:47.167 --> 00:37:48.750
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Change the time scale.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.583
That's a very good way
of thinking about it.

00:37:50.583 --> 00:37:52.530
So if we thought about--

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.380
if we made a simple
representation for f--

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.630
ignore what it really is.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.470
Let's say it's that.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.890
What would f1 look like in
order to make it sound faster?

00:38:07.675 --> 00:38:09.944
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:09.944 --> 00:38:11.860
DENNIS FREEMAN: OK, we
have people doing this.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.110
And we have people doing this.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.530
And I'm not quite
sure what that means.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:18.580
So could somebody be a
little more descriptive?

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.620
Hand gestures are fine.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.360
Yes.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.502
AUDIENCE: Squished.

00:38:22.502 --> 00:38:24.620
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Squished, exactly right.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:29.920
So what we want to have happen,
in order to sound faster,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.320
we want to have it
come out faster.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.420
So we would like
that to happen to it.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.100
So it's all over in one
second if the original

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.550
was all over in two seconds.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.050
Right?

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.910
That's what faster means.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:44.830
So we would like
that to be true.

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.682
Is that what's going
on in that function?

00:38:47.682 --> 00:38:49.490
Yeah.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.490
OK, so that's right.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.380
Secondly-- yes.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.957
AUDIENCE: Is that the reason
also why it was higher pitched?

00:38:56.957 --> 00:38:59.040
DENNIS FREEMAN: That also
makes it higher pitched.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.210
In fact, we will talk
a lot about this later.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:06.260
But pitch has to do with a
related kind of waveform.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:11.870
If I thought about a waveform
that was a single tone,

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:15.070
that might look like this.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:20.800
So if you were to play an oboe
and play just a C constantly,

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.130
you'd get some
periodic waveform.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:27.610
If I did the same transformation
on that periodic waveform,

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.800
what would happen
to that waveform?

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:35.940
What would happen to this
if I did transformation one?

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:40.030
Squish, what's squish mean?

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.171
More higher frequency,
more cycles per second.

00:39:43.171 --> 00:39:43.670
Yeah.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.205
AUDIENCE: So how can you make
the same waveform go twice as

00:39:46.205 --> 00:39:48.445
fast, but have the
same pitch [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:48.445 --> 00:39:49.910
DENNIS FREEMAN:
That's very hard.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:53.390
In fact, I worked on that
as a research project.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.540
So one of the
techniques that we used

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.505
to try to fix people's ears--

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:01.990
it turns out that
people who have

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.640
hearing disorders like mine
can more easily understand

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.920
male speech than female
speech just because

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.270
of the shift in frequencies.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:14.050
Male speech is primarily
about an octave lower

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.330
on average than female speech.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.090
So we tried to
convert every female

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.970
into a male speaker
and every male

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.470
into the Jolly Green Giant.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.760
And it worked.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.340
Males sounded like
the Jolly Green Giant.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.440
And females sounded like males.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.420
And it didn't help
hearing at all.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:38.195
And that's primarily
because it's a hard problem.

00:40:38.195 --> 00:40:40.820
But we will say more about that
as we go on through the course.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.560
That is a hard problem
because you end up

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.860
having to do other
than just squish.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.930
OK, second one, is this is
the right transformation?

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.628
No, why not?

00:40:55.628 --> 00:40:58.025
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
so most of the speech

00:40:58.025 --> 00:40:59.524
is measured in the
frequency domain.

00:40:59.524 --> 00:41:01.954
But if you just flip
over the amplitude,

00:41:01.954 --> 00:41:03.495
it shouldn't really
make a difference

00:41:03.495 --> 00:41:06.060
DENNIS FREEMAN: If you
flipped over the amplitude--

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.070
so flip over the
amplitude, you're

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.900
saying that didn't do it.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.700
What was the transformation?

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.370
If it wasn't flip over
the amplitude, what is it?

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:15.865
Yeah.

00:41:15.865 --> 00:41:17.325
AUDIENCE: f of minus t.

00:41:17.325 --> 00:41:18.580
DENNIS FREEMAN: f of minus t--

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.280
it was flipped this way.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.420
Right, flipping this way
is largely inaudible.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.030
If you had a pressure waveform
versus a rarefaction waveform,

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.982
positive pressures versus
negative pressures,

00:41:29.982 --> 00:41:30.940
it's very hard to tell.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.879
Not impossible, if you're one
of those audio types like me,

00:41:34.879 --> 00:41:36.420
you can probably
hear the difference.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.580
But it's very hard.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.510
Hearing this, not hard.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.020
OK, how about this one?

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.740
Obviously wrong because
this one was right.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.960
OK, how about this one?

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.950
Yeah.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:57.760
So the idea was that there
were two that were correct.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.124
So the 85% of you or so
who got two, presumably

00:42:01.124 --> 00:42:02.040
you got the right two.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:02.550
Right?

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.110
But I won't ask.

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:09.600
OK, here's an image
processing question.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.740
Think about this
picture of Stata.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.050
I know it's hard to think
about pictures of Stata.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.034
That's OK.

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:18.450
Think about this
picture is Stata.

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:21.470
I have indexed x and y.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.260
And I've written that
as f, a signal that

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:29.480
depends on two independent
variables, x and y.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.170
And I've got three
transformations--

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.660
the f1 transformation,
the f2, and the f3.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.510
The question is, is this
the right mathematical

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:47.520
representation for transforming
that picture into this one?

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.075
Is this the one for that one?

00:42:49.075 --> 00:42:51.810
And is this a
representation for this one?

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.790
Is this the representation
for that one?

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.070
Take 30 seconds,
talk to your partner,

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.348
and figure out how many of those
transformations are correct.

00:42:59.348 --> 00:43:01.344
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:44:17.765 --> 00:44:19.890
OK, so how many of the
transformations are correct?

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.782
Raise your hand.

00:44:22.782 --> 00:44:23.865
Everybody raise your hand.

00:44:28.209 --> 00:44:30.310
That's a zero or a three?

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.770
OK, just checking.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.980
OK, about 85% correct again.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.400
OK, probably a different 85%.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.300
So how do you think
about this problem?

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:45.640
So there's a variety of ways
you could think about it.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.560
Let me show you a
way that focuses

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.930
on an idea called
mapping because I

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.950
think it's a very powerful way.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:55.900
So if you think about
a map, how does the t

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.910
variable in the
first problem map

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:00.880
to the t variable in
the second problem?

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.320
So a way you can
think about this

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:08.500
is if this is true for
all x and y, it's true

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.690
for a particular x.

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:12.800
So let's ask is it
true for x equals 0.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:19.710
So how does the point x equals
0 map from one image to another?

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:24.240
So if you substituted x
equals 0, then f1 of 0--

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:28.360
so if you look at
this transformation,

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:35.860
the claim would be that f1
of 0 is the same as f of 0.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.490
Is that true?

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:47.090
So f1 of 0 bisects Stata.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.990
f of 0 bisects Stata.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.120
So yeah, that's the right thing.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.900
Everybody see that?

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:02.650
Is the statement true
for x equals 250?

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:05.971
Well, f1 of 250--

00:46:05.971 --> 00:46:11.980
so f1 of 250 is through
the right-hand side

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:18.860
of Stata sort of where the steel
and the bricks come together.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.940
Is that the same as
substituting in here, if x is

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:26.000
250, then f of 500--

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.780
f of 500 is off the screen.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.370
So is that transformation hold
at the point x equals 250?

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:35.240
No.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.990
OK, it can't be right.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.910
OK?

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.550
One bad sample
proves that it can't

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:43.430
be the general transformation.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:46.250
OK, everybody see that?

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.230
Similarly, for the
second transformation,

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:50.480
let's just try some points.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:57.050
If we try the point x equals 0,
this says that f2 at location 0

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:00.804
should be f at
location minus 250.

00:47:00.804 --> 00:47:01.470
Is that correct?

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:13.560
So f of 0, well, that's the
left-hand side of Stata.

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.310
And so f2 of 0, that's the
left-hand side of Stata. f

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:23.470
of 2 times 0 minus 250
is f of 250 minus 250,

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:26.230
that's also the left of Stata.

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:28.220
OK, so by using
that reasoning, you

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:33.860
can go through and see
if certain points map

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:36.420
to the corresponding place
where they were supposed to go.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.060
That's the idea of mapping.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:45.650
And in this particular case,
if we traced two points,

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:50.150
and the map 2x minus
250 is a linear function

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:54.520
of x, so two points
determine a straight line.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.720
So after you've determined
two points, you're done.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.840
Seem right?

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.170
So similarly, you can figure
out that the particular points

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:04.980
didn't work here.

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.460
And so the answer is that only
one of those transformations

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:07.960
was right.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.790
OK, so I spent a fair
amount of time on signals.

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.040
In the last minute,
oh, minute, no,

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.524
I'm not going to
do that am I. OK,

00:48:20.524 --> 00:48:22.690
I spent a fair amount of
time talking about signals.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:28.210
Next time, we'll talk about
similar ways of thinking

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.540
about simple systems.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.560
So have a good weekend.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.870
PROFESSOR: I have
a tiring day today.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.350
Just 10 minutes ago, I finished
chairing the first part

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.160
of a meeting of the
COA advisory committee.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.580
And I gave a talk to them.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.570
And right after the
lecture, I have to go back.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.820
So while they have a lunch
break, I have to teach.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.640
But that's OK.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.370
That's life on the faculty.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.130
Yes.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.210
We're talking about applications
of the spontaneous light force.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.230
We have used optical
block recreations and such

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.480
to learn about the spontaneous
force, the stimulated force,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.100
in general.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.850
And this is our expression for
the spontaneous light force.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.260
It's pretty much, the
momentum of photons

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.100
is transferred to the atom
times to scattering rate.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.040
And what we started last class,
and we want to finish today,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.790
is we want to discuss
applications of this force

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.320
to three situations which are
of experimental importance.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.800
One can actually say that
slow beams, more or less,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.690
in the magneto-optical trap
are the key techniques which

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.460
triggered a revolution
in atomic physics.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.680
This is really the
enabling technology

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.700
into ultracold atom science.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.110
So I discussed with you, in
the last class, molasses.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.040
And we discussed
what happens when

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.600
we have two
counterpropagating beams.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.460
Maybe the key figure to
remember is this one.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.890
When we have to
counterpropagating beams,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.860
by just adding up the
spontaneous light force

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.820
of the two beams, we get the red
curve, force versus velocity.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.130
And the expert eye immediately
sees there is a linear slope.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.190
And that's a viscous force.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.782
This is the viscosity of
light interacting with atoms.

00:02:24.782 --> 00:02:27.990
Of course, you'd better
pick the detuning correctly.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.040
If you use the wrong
detuning, everything

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.630
is flipped upside down.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.915
And instead of a damping force,
you have an anti-damping force.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.470
We then discussed
the cooling limit.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.335
Any cooling limit is the balance
between heating and cooling.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:54.810
And by just setting the heating
rate equal to the cooling rate,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.600
this describes a steady state.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.650
We found the famous
Doppler limit.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.540
OK.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.110
So that's where I
want to continue.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.710
But do you have any
questions about molasses,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.320
the Doppler limit, and what we
discussed in the last class?

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.490
Well, I know we had discussions
about to take two beams which

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.390
form a standing wave, and
take it apart, and calculate

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.250
the force for each beam.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.810
Well, sorry, this is
what molasses is about.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.590
Molasses is about two beams.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.290
And if you want to treat
two interfering laser

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.100
beams in the full
generality, there

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.560
are a lot of other effects.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.310
Some of them, we
will be uncovering

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.620
in the next few lectures.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.400
But I'm happy now, when
I discuss beam slowing,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.870
to give you when there
is only one single laser

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.070
beam decelerating atoms.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.590
That is the only
situation I know

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.080
about where you have an
exact analytic solution.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.525
So I want to present
it to you know.

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:07.020
Actually, for a number of years,
I presented the exact solution

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.720
with one laser beam before
I presented molasses,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.260
where I have to
make approximations.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.420
But I always felt that beam
slowing is more complicated,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.829
because you have to go
to a decelerating frame

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.690
and have to add
fictitious forces.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.720
So some of the
intuition is lost.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.250
So that's why I first
presented you with molasses,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.540
with two beams, for which I
need to make approximations.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.720
Because the interference
pattern between two laser beams

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.380
has richness and complexity.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.590
But now I discuss
beam slowing with you.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.830
So this curve here
could be the result

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.110
of the very early beginnings
of laser cooling in

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.400
the late '70s, early '80s.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.050
And this is when people had an
atomic beam with a Boltzmann

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.960
distribution, and they had one
laser been counterpropagating.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.390
But the laser beam
had a fixed frequency.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.410
And what is this
laser beam doing?

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.450
Well, it resonantly
interacts with the atoms

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.920
which just have the
correct Doppler shift

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.310
to be in resonance.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.770
Those atoms are pushed--
scattered photons-- are pushed

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.110
to lower frequencies--
to lower velocities.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.040
But they are pushed
out of resonance.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.610
And eventually, the slowing
becomes slower and slower.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.810
And eventually, things come,
almost, to a standstill.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.500
So a laser beam which
has a fixed frequency

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.790
would modify the
velocity distribution

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.360
of an atomic beam in that way.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.980
People called it,
already, cooling.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.950
And I think some
pioneers in Russia

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.760
who did those experiments were
disappointed that they were not

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.120
honored with a Nobel
Prize in laser cooling.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.260
This was the first cooling.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.830
Because this distribution
here is considerably narrower

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.580
than here.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.605
And temperature is nothing
else than a measure

00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:02.640
of the reach of the
velocity distribution.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.060
But one can say that
those experiments did not

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.830
trigger a revolution
in atomic physics.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.460
The revolution came when
people eventually figured out

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.800
how they can narrow down this
peak from maybe a hundred

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.410
or tens of kelvins down
to a million microkelvin.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.790
So it's clear what is needed.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.380
If you want to do
more slowing, you

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.150
have to make sure
that you are talking

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.400
to the other velocities,
and that you eventually

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.420
sweep many velocities into one
peak-- clear out the velocity

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.670
distribution, collect
all the atoms,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.850
and put them at a
monochromatic velocity.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.200
So for that, you can say, well,
if you use a comb of frequency,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.550
or a broad spectrum
of frequencies,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.430
you could clean
out a larger area.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.140
And, indeed, there
are techniques

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.640
like this-- white light slowing
or diffuse light slowing.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.220
But since those
techniques are not

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.430
anymore of practical importance,
I don't want to discuss them.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.110
Let me talk about the
simplest technique-- at least,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.950
conceptionally-- which
is chirped slowing.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.390
And this works like follows.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.620
You start with a laser
beam which is initially

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.750
in resonance with
the velocity group.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.710
And as the atoms slow down,
you change the detuning

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.810
of the laser that the
laser stays in resonance

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.670
with the atoms.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.870
So it is a pulsed
technique where

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.180
you have a continuous
atomic beam.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.570
You start with a laser and
say, now I start slowing.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.055
And the laser is
following a group of atoms

00:07:46.055 --> 00:07:47.305
as they are decelerated.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.940
So you can say it is like the
atoms are riding the surf.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.140
The laser is always
following the atoms

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.540
as they change their velocity.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.020
And what is, of course,
necessary for that to happen

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.590
is that the chirp and the
deceleration of the atoms

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.895
are synchronized.

00:08:04.895 --> 00:08:06.960
You will see that
in a moment, when

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.170
I put this idea into equations.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.440
There is another technique
which is used in many labs--

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.350
actually, in all my labs
and Martin Zwierlein's lab.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.000
It's called Zeeman slowing.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.690
And this is discussed
in your homework.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.320
It is a CW version
of chirped slowing.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.040
And a lot of you
know what I mean.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.080
The physics which goes on
there is almost identical.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.390
But for conceptional
reasons, it's

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.200
easier not to use
magnetic fields and such.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.710
Let's just keep it simple.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.720
Let's have one laser beam
talking to a two-level atom.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.660
And the only other ingredient
is the Doppler shift.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.320
Any questions about--
so I've surveyed,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.820
for you, beam slowing.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.160
And now I want to give
you the exact description

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
for one typical example
of a slowing technique.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.734
And a lot of the results
we find in chirped slowing

00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:06.150
apply to other
slowing techniques.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.740
OK.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.870
I know I've taught
it several times.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:19.770
And there is the
conceptional point

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.630
that you can only describe
chirped slowing well

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.920
when you go to the decelerating
frame of the atoms.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.600
You want to describe it in
the frame of the atoms which

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.260
are continuously
being decelerated.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.970
So the way I can introduce
it is the following.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.800
I take the maximum-- I take
the spontaneous light force.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.240
This is exactly
the expression we

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.360
have discussed several times.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.930
And now I'm saying
we decide that we

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.700
want to decelerate atoms
with a deceleration, a, which

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.240
is negative, because
we slow them down.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.810
Of course, if you pick a too
large that it would require

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.850
more than the maximum
spontaneous light force,

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.350
you will not find a solution.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:12.450
But let's simply assume we
want to decelerate atoms

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.090
with a deceleration a.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.810
Well, what happens is
this deceleration, a,

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.640
requires a certain force.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.280
If the intensity of the laser
would provide more force

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.630
on resonance then it's
not going to work.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.790
Because we want to decelerate
the atoms at this deceleration.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.820
So therefore, the atoms,
if they are decelerated,

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.420
have to be at a detuning,
delta prime, in such a way

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.680
that the spontaneous
light force is exactly

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.860
providing the
acceleration we decided

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.700
we want to have for our atoms.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.580
In other words, this detuning--
in the frame of the atom,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.140
the atoms are on resonance
when the light force is exactly

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.330
providing the force to give
you the acceleration a.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.520
But if you have more laser
power than absolutely necessary,

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.770
in the frame of the
atoms, the atoms

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.670
have to be detuned in
such a way that the force,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.260
with the detuning,
is exactly providing

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.930
the acceleration we want.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.650
So that's the easiest
way to explain it.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.110
We have to set the stage.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.310
We have to introduce
this nominal detuning.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.810
OK.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:37.150
So you can say that this
detuning is just a definition.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.850
And now we want to describe
the slowing process.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:47.210
So we have said we want
to start with atoms

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.290
at an initial velocity-- which
we'll actually cancel out

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.490
in a moment.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.450
But let's do it in
a systematic way--

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.640
and afterwards, we want the
velocity to decrease, linearly,

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.440
in time.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.180
I simply defined this
parameter, delta prime,

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.940
to be a solution
of this equation.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.430
So this is a well
defined quantity.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.740
And the laser detuning--
which, I've broken my laser

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.470
to change its detuning
as a function of time--

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.790
is now this nominal detuning
minus the Doppler shift

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.400
due to the velocity
of the atoms.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.150
I'm really solving the
problem backwards for you.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:32.040
I first decide which should
be the velocity trajectory

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.650
of the atoms-- how should
the atoms slow down.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.090
And then, I define what
is the detuning which

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.910
will result in that.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.290
That's the easier
way to understand it.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.890
Of course, if you
pick this detuning,

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.790
the atoms will exactly do that.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:49.900
OK.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.660
But now what we're
doing is the following.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:01.200
This is sort of the
acceleration and the velocity

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.810
we want the atom to have.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.820
But there may be some
atoms in the beam which

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.760
do not have this velocity.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.210
They deviate from this
velocity with v prime.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.810
So the goal of
cooling would now be

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:20.750
to reduce v prime to 0 to
make all the atoms follow

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.700
the trajectory we have
designed for them.

00:13:25.551 --> 00:13:26.050
OK.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.730
Many words, many definitions.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.267
Now we can simply
substitute what

00:13:31.267 --> 00:13:32.870
we have defined
into the equation.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.120
And we get a wonderful result.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.040
So we take equation
one, which was

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.270
the equation for
the light force.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.210
And we put all
those definitions,

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:56.290
which I went to great lengths
to explain to you, into it.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:01.040
And we get this result.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.690
It's just that the detuning has
been expressed by delta prime,

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.970
and the velocity by this
difference velocity v prime.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.426
It's pure mathematical
substitution.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.962
But now comes the
important point

00:14:16.962 --> 00:14:20.410
that we want to describe
everything, now,

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.170
in the decelerating frame.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.550
The atoms are meant to
decelerate with a deceleration

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.446
a.

00:14:27.446 --> 00:14:29.070
And you know, from
classical mechanics,

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.340
if you describe something
in a decelerating frame,

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.890
you have to add a
fictitious force.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:39.250
This fictitious force, since
the acceleration is constant,

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.335
is a constant force.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.440
But I'm expressing it, now,
by the other parameters.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.490
We've chosen our acceleration.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.520
We've chosen the
detuning, delta prime,

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.180
that-- everything is
sort of connected.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.170
And this is just a way to
use the correct-- the most

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:03.600
easiest units, or the
correct parametrization,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.010
for this constant force.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.660
So I have done-- and the
important thing for you

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.160
is, this equation is exact.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.000
It's exact for an arbitrary
velocity v prime of the atoms.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.310
So let me just summarize.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.440
I've taken the
spontaneous light force.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.650
I've given you a
bunch of definitions,

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.200
what delta prime is.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.780
That's how you
program your laser.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.090
But then, in the
decelerating frame,

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.900
we need a fictitious force.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.150
And this is nothing else than
a mathematically exact rewrite

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.840
of the spontaneous light force
in the decelerating frame.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:55.620
But now what happens is--
we had a decelerating--

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.990
we had a light force where,
because we assume the laser is

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.180
counterpropagating,
there's a minus sign.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.960
The fictitious force
has a plus sign.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.480
And that means that we
can-- and if v prime is 0,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.060
the force is 0.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.970
So we can now make a Taylor
expansion for small v prime.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:22.980
So we have, again, a viscous
force, a friction force.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.990
And it turns out that
this friction coefficient

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.810
for beam deceleration is
exactly 1/2 what we got before,

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.270
for molasses.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.320
But it's clear we
have one laser beam.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.800
Whereas in molasses,
we had two laser beams.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.740
If you ask, what is
the heating, well,

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.340
if you have one laser beam
and not two laser beams,

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.940
the heating described by the
momentum diffusion coefficient

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.280
is also just 1/2.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:53.090
One beam heats exactly half
of what we got for two beams.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.060
And therefore, the
temperature, which

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.660
characterizes the width of
the velocity distribution

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.900
in the frame of the
decelerating atoms

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.849
is exactly the Doppler
temperature we had before.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:08.089
Because the two
factors of 1/2 cancel.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.420
So now I have given
you-- and I hope

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.390
you take some pleasure
in it-- an example where

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.670
the laser cooling for
a two-level system

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.210
is exactly described.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.829
There's only a single beam.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:30.250
And the Doppler limit
is the exact solution.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.720
I've not made any
approximation other

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.860
than assuming I have a
two-level system for which

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.900
the spontaneous light force has
the expression we've derived.

00:17:41.551 --> 00:17:42.050
OK.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.520
I know, even with
my explanation,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.680
you have to read through
it once or twice.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.720
Because I made a
few substitutions.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.560
And you really have to
digest them at your own pace.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.860
So let me give you a summary of
what we have done graphically.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.080
One laser beam scatters light.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.280
And it is this Lorentzian.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.499
And it's a negative
Lorentzian because we

00:18:06.499 --> 00:18:07.790
have a counterpropagating beam.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.000
We push the atoms into
the negative direction,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.810
they fly in the
positive direction.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.550
But by going-- by
chirping the laser,

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:23.040
by going into the
decelerating frame,

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.960
the force doesn't go to 0.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.260
I had to add an offset.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.240
And this offset is
the fictitious force

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.540
due to the transformation
of the decelerating frame.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:40.500
And now you realize
that this force-- and it

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.230
is the correct force in the
decelerating frame-- has two 0

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.700
crossings.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.330
One is a stable point, and
one is an unstable point.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.790
And the stable point says, if
an atom happens to be too fast,

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.400
it gets a correcting force.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.410
And this is like a lock point.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.230
It has a stable lock point.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:06.790
All the atoms which did not have
the correct velocity we wanted

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.660
them to have, they are sort of
sucked into this lock point,

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.130
and eventually, will
pile up at a huge peak

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.940
at this nominal velocity.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.950
And the width of
this peak is simply

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.560
described by the Doppler limit.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.310
Before I take your
questions, let

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:31.175
me show you what happens
in the two frames.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.350
This is v prime.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:46.340
This is the velocity in
the decelerating frame.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:52.190
And let's say our
initial velocity is this.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:58.460
So what happens now is all
the atoms within the atoms

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:04.810
are decelerated towards
v prime equals 0.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.030
The friction force puts
them to v prime equals 0.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.950
But since we are in
a decelerating frame,

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.310
in the absence of the laser,
the whole Maxwell-Boltzmann

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.960
distribution is
just shifted-- not

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.800
because the velocity
of the atoms

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.460
changed-- because we are
in a decelerating frame

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.230
and we are accelerating
away from the atoms.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.660
And what I just described for
you is the following-- that,

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.650
at v prime equals 0, we
have our friction force.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.460
And the atomic
distribution in this frame

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.210
is now pushed through.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.420
And everything which goes
through this resonant region

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.130
is sort of collected.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:50.230
And you have a peak which is
piling up at v prime equals 0.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:55.630
Probably, it's easier--
but mathematically,

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.490
I needed the
decelerating frame--

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.750
if you use the
following picture.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.710
And just think of this beam
slowing I explained to you.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.740
If you just switched
on a laser here,

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.315
you would just burn a hole
into the velocity distribution

00:21:08.315 --> 00:21:10.160
and pile up the atoms.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.700
But now you sweep.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.820
And when you sweep, you take
the peak, push it further.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.180
It gets a bigger peak here.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.380
Push it further.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.750
So eventually, what
you're doing is,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.550
by chirping the laser
in the correct way

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.060
with the correct laser
power and all that,

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.020
you're just pushing
the atoms all out.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.690
And eventually,
they are piled up

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.840
in a narrow distribution which
is defined by the time when you

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.280
just switch off your laser beam.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.360
So one chirp of the laser,
from an initial detuning

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.430
in the lab frame to a final
detuning in the lab frame,

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.950
will just sweep out the whole
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.400
And if you suddenly
switch off the laser,

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.580
you have frozen in a velocity
distribution which is exactly

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.535
described by the Doppler limit.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.290
So what is easier to
understand-- molasses

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:12.050
with two beams, or beam
slowing with a single beam?

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.140
I think molasses is
easier, because everything

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.330
happens in the lab frame.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.670
But think about it.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:23.275
It's a nice example for which no
approximations have to be made.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:23.775
Questions?

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.310
Yes, Nancy.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.980
AUDIENCE: It's not
really obvious to me

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.450
how, in this mathematics,
we are choosing

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.324
a time-dependent
detuning as opposed

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:41.719
to a time-dependent
deceleration.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.900
PROFESSOR: The way I
presented it logically, we

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.950
said we want a certain
acceleration to happen.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:23:00.250
And then, we provide our laser
that k/kv is the Doppler shift.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.620
ka is how the Doppler shift
changes as a function of time.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.330
And we chirp our laser
exactly in frequency

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.840
with a chirp which is ka.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.950
So in other words, I started
to define a constant a.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.890
And that would require
that the laser is now

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.100
chirped in a linear way.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.500
I could have started the
other around and said, hey,

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.220
let's assume we chirp the
laser in a linear way.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.740
And then, we do
corresponding substitutions.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.260
And the result
would be the same.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.715
AUDIENCE: No, actually,
like if we did not

00:23:35.715 --> 00:23:39.760
want to have a detuning
which was time-dependent,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.670
would we have gotten--
we still have a force.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.657
And that force would
have been just changing.

00:23:44.657 --> 00:23:46.740
PROFESSOR: Well then, it's
more complicated, yeah.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.480
Then, you have to integrate
a differential equation.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.200
But what happened
is the following.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.300
What I've done is, by defining
the acceleration and then

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:02.570
the chirp, I have the situation
that, in the reference

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.800
frame of the decelerating
atoms, the detuning is constant.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.020
So usually, you go to
a decelerating frame

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.100
if something else simplifies.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.670
And what simplifies is that,
in the frame of the atom,

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.910
the laser detuning is constant.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.770
So you can also say the frame
in which the atoms decelerate is

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:27.900
exactly the frame in which
the chirp has disappeared.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.870
Because the decelerating
frame compensates

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.810
the chirp with a
linearly varying,

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.600
time varying Doppler shift.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.020
OK.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.860
But the physics, I
think, is really--

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.160
the moment you have a force
which has a 0 crossing,

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.380
it's a lock point.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.020
You determine the slope.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.260
And alpha, together with
the momentum diffusion,

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.650
gives you the final temperature.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.520
So I hope you enjoy that it's
actually the same physics--

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.910
exactly the same
physics-- we discussed,

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.700
with some approximation
for molasses.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:09.560
OK.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.230
We had a discussion last time
about, we have the force,

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.720
we find exactly what
happens to the atoms.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.850
But we may have to think
about it in different ways

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:26.020
to figure out where the
kinetic energy goes from.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.700
And I think we mentioned it
already, in the last class,

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.960
that what happens is you have
a red-detuned laser, which is,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.130
the photons are absorbed.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.200
But the atom is scattering
light in all directions.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.000
And so if you go
at 90 degrees, you

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.920
don't have a linear
Doppler shift.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.080
If you go forward-backward
with the same probability--

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.890
a symmetric pattern-- the
Doppler shift averages to 0.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.810
So on average, you emit
photons which are on resonance.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.880
And therefore, every time
you scatter a photon,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.270
you radiate away
the energy which

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.530
is equal to the Doppler shift.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.000
That means, initially, when
the Doppler shift is huge,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.480
each photon transports
away a lot of energy.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.910
And the slower the atoms
are, the less a photon

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.570
transports away.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:23.870
But that makes sense.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.800
If you have a huge
velocity and you

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.570
subtract h bar k, the
momentum of the photon,

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:33.380
the kinetic energy is
quadratic in velocity.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.300
You know, h bar k, the
momentum transfer of a photon,

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.260
takes out more kinetic
energy the faster

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.550
the velocity of the atoms is.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.445
So everything makes
sense and is consistent.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:53.140
OK.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:58.570
Let's go from the-- we
started with two beams.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.080
We just discussed one
beam, chirped slowing.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.360
And let's go now to what most
of you use in the laboratory--

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.440
namely, six beams.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.210
You want to cool in x, y, z.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.670
So you have
one-dimensional molasses

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.130
with two beams times 3.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.610
So in the limit that
the intensity is low,

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:26.140
you just add up all the forces.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.710
You say each beam has a
spontaneous light force.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.618
And you add the six
spontaneous light forces up.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.110
At low intensity-- and you
have to take my word for it--

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.150
you can ignore all the
interference effect

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.280
between the beams.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.760
They can actually lead to
very interesting effects.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.530
I will give you at least a taste
of what will happen-- actually,

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:55.610
a pretty good taste-- what
happens at higher power.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.495
We need the traced atom picture.

00:27:57.495 --> 00:28:01.155
And we'll discuss how
the stimulated force

00:28:01.155 --> 00:28:02.155
can be used for cooling.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.180
But if you don't have
a two-level system,

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.450
you have sigma plus
sigma minus transitions

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:17.270
and the beams interfere, you get
spatially varying polarizations

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.350
of your interference
patterns, and then you

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.240
have much [INAUDIBLE] physics.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.120
But in the simplest case
of a two-level system,

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.150
there is a regime
at low intensity

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:32.510
where you can simply take the
equations we got for molasses

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.715
and apply them to XYZ.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:41.660
I put, on the website, a nice
handout, a review paper by Bill

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:46.560
Phillips, who is discussing 1D
molasses versus 3D molasses,

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.480
and if you enjoy
it, you can read

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.400
how numerical factors
of 1 or 2 or 3

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.920
now appear in the
friction coefficient,

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.650
in the heating
coefficient, and how

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.860
they affect the
final temperature.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.510
But you got the full [INAUDIBLE]
concepts and the correct idea

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.930
for one dimension molasses.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:22.310
Now, let me give you
an outlook for what

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.250
we will be doing next week.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:28.790
Next week, we want to
understand the following-- what

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.170
happens to the
friction coefficient

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.070
when you increase the power?

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.190
Well, you remember when
we have red-detuned light,

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:43.670
then we had one Lorentzian,
another Lorentzian.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.770
The slope was
negative, and negative

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.480
means positive
friction, we cool.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.840
And if you put
more power into it,

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.140
the linear slope increases,
and for low power,

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.620
the friction coefficient is
proportional to the laser

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.540
intensity.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.850
But now look what happens.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:10.330
If you approach saturation,
then the friction

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:16.680
is not only saturating, it
suddenly changes the sign,

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.230
and this is qualitatively new.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.050
And you should a little
bit wonder about it.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.280
Wasn't the reason why we
have cooling that you have

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.140
a laser which is red-detuned?

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.440
And the photon which is
spontaneously emitted

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.800
is on resonance, and this
is the energy difference.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.470
But now I'm telling
you, at high intensity,

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.210
it's not the red-detuned
laser which cools,

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.020
it's the blue-detuned laser.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.660
So you should wonder about it.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.040
There is really something
new to be learned.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.440
So I want to motivate you to
follow me today and next week

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.940
through an alternative
description

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.700
of what light does to atoms
using the dressed atom picture,

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.550
and in the dressed
atom picture, we

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.040
will very naturally
understand why

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.180
now blue-detuned light
provides cooling.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.770
But right now, for you,
this should be a mystery,

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.260
but it should be something
where you say, hey,

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.000
still something
qualitative is missing

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.175
in our understanding
of light forces.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.240
OK, I will not be
able to explain

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.200
it [? physically ?] to you.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.350
I first have to introduce
the dressed atom picture,

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:33.780
and I will do that it
in 10 minutes or so.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.190
But what I want to do
here is if I'm telling you

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.350
something goes terribly
wrong and we completely

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.690
miss even the sign of the
force, blue-detuned light is now

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.710
cooling, not red-detuned
light, I at least

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.370
want to tell you
what went wrong.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:52.720
Because haven't we done
an almost exact discussion

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.380
of light forces?

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.484
We used the gradient of d dot e.

00:31:57.484 --> 00:32:01.090
We used for d the steady state
solution of the optical Bloch

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:01.660
equations.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.170
Haven't we done
everything right?

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:09.790
Well, we did approximations.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:13.910
And what happens is,
and this is the reason

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:18.240
for those qualitatively
different things, that we

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.980
should, in order to get
those effects, not use,

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.960
for the dipole moment, for the
off-diagonal matrix elements

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.930
of the density matrix,
the steady state solution

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.070
for optical Bloch vector.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:37.910
We have to acknowledge that
it always takes a finite time

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.420
to reach steady state.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:46.090
For instance, if he takes, let's
say, a spontaneous emission

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:49.730
time, if the atom goes
through a standing wave,

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.830
it goes from high
intensity to low intensity,

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.630
it takes about one
spontaneous emission time.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.850
When you are highly
excited, but now you

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.120
go through a node of
the standing wave,

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.030
the steady state
solution is [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.450
At the node of the standing
wave, there is no light.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.090
The steady state
solution with no light

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.960
is you better go back
to the ground state,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.200
but that takes
something on the order

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.480
of the spontaneous
emission time.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.680
So therefore, when I
am excited because I'm

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.110
in the middle of the
[? pied ?] laser beam

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.820
and I go fast into
the dark region,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.060
I'm still excited because
I didn't have time

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.310
to get rid of my excitation.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:29.340
In other words, the
internal degree of freedom,

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.040
the population of
grounded excited state,

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.580
will lag behind the
steady state solution

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.940
by a lag time which is a
spontaneous emission time.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.730
And that would mean if I
multiply with the velocity,

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.820
it's pretty much that there
is a spacial displacement.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:59.770
I'm always a certain distance
away from the steady state

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.200
solution.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:09.880
And actually, this point,
to introduce the lag time,

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.130
we with do it in a
wonderful, physical way when

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:14.830
we have the dressed
atom picture,

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.620
but it can be done with
optical Bloch equation.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.770
It's just a real pain because
the optical Bloch equation

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:24.469
is sort of like a
matrix the equation.

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:27.239
It's completely
obscure, how it is done,

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.480
but in order that you
convince yourself,

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.580
I posted the original paper
from Gordon and Ashkin

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.900
where this was done.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.080
You read the math.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.710
You understand the
result, but you

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:40.710
don't understand the derivation,
the physical picture behind it.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.300
The dressed atom picture will
give us a lucid explanation

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.340
for exactly what a
lag time does and why

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.159
this results in colling.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:53.645
But anyway, this is the
physics we have done wrong.

00:34:53.645 --> 00:34:55.570
At low power, it's OK.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.620
At high power, we really
have to take care of effect.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:05.210
And if we would take care
of effect-- And as I said,

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.320
we don't need the
dressed atom picture,

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.960
we can fully do it within the
framework of the optical Bloch

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.120
equation, but it's messy.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.710
--we would actually get out, and
you see that in the references,

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.230
the result that the friction
coefficient in a standing wave

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:23.820
at weak power is exactly two
times the friction coefficient

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:29.880
for a travelling wave, and
that justifies that we describe

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.120
molasses by the spontaneous
light force of two travelling

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.070
waves, completely ignoring
the standing wave.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:39.250
But the same treatment of
the optical Bloch equation

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.690
will then, eventually,
give us the result

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.810
that alpha changes
sign at high intensity.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.400
But as I said, I
want to describe

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.460
that after we have introduced
the dressed atom picture.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.180
Questions?

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.040
OK, we have done molasses
in one dimension.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.840
We have done beam slowing.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.160
We just did a short
discussion about molasses

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.140
in arbitrary dimensions.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.010
The one technique
which is missing now

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.890
is the magneto-optic trap.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:22.430
Let me just spend five
minutes to discuss

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.650
the background behind
the magneto-optic trap

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.610
because for many of you,
I think you were just

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:32.910
born when the magneto-optic
trap was invented.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:39.880
Well, I joined
the field in 1990,

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.620
and that was three years
after the magneto-optic trap

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.520
has been invented.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:52.490
And many people say if there is
one most singular development

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.420
in laser cooling and
such, it's molasses

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.860
and the magneto-optical trap.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.200
So let me tell you why,
the magneto-optical trap,

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.760
you shouldn't take
it for granted.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:11.610
It was actually in
1983 that Ashkin--

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:12.610
Was it Gordon or Ashkin?

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:14.130
I think Ashkin, Art Ashkin.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:17.670
--that he presented an
Optical Earnshaw theorem,

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.970
and it is nicely described
in Bill Phillips' Varenna

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.670
notes which I have
posted on the website.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:30.530
And it's pretty much a proof
that you cannot build a trap

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:32.720
using the spontaneous
light force.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.110
So in other words,
this is a proof

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.881
which people took
as a correct proof

00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:40.630
that something like
the magneto-optic trap

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.750
could not exist.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.200
So what this is proof like?

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.870
Well, and that
sort of teaches you

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:52.115
what was the mental concept
or the mental barrier people

00:37:52.115 --> 00:37:54.180
had to break through
before they invented

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.580
the magneto-optic trap.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.280
The proof is the following.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.400
If you think that you
have beams-- I mean,

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.600
a model for the spontaneous
light force is you have photons

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.900
and the photons are
sand blasting the atom.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.580
Each photon is like
a grain of sand,

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.040
and the atom is in scattering
descent in all directions.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.470
You can really make this
completely classical picture

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:19.890
of the spontaneous light force.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:23.070
Almost.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:31.310
If you do with that you would
say the spontaneous light force

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:35.840
is proportional to
the stream of photons

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.480
which is described by
the Poynting vector.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.480
But now, you have
in electromagnetism

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.460
a continuity equation which says
the divergence of the Poynting

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:52.360
vector plus the change of energy
density in a certain volume

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.160
has to be 0.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.060
So if you are in
steady state-- If you

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.790
have an arrangement
of laser beams

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:03.500
and the energy density of
the electromagnetic field

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.260
is at steady state,
that tells you

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:10.620
that the divergence of the
Poynting vector has to be 0.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.340
Well, if the divergence
of the Poynting vector

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.806
is 0, using this
equation that says

00:39:15.806 --> 00:39:17.680
the divergence of the
spontaneous light force

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.750
has to be 0.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:21.830
But if the divergence
of the force

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:25.610
has to be 0, that means you
can not have a force which

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:29.540
is inward from all directions
because such a force,

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.670
a trap needs a force
which is inward.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:34.255
A trap requires a
negative divergence.

00:39:38.506 --> 00:39:43.520
Do you see the wrong
assumption in this proof,

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.190
or did I convince you that
the magneto-optic trap is not

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:52.750
possible because this
proof would say you can not

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.270
make a trap out of the
spontaneous light force?

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.806
AUDIENCE: Well, you through out
the change in energy density,

00:40:02.806 --> 00:40:04.090
so that's--

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.200
PROFESSOR: But that's
OK because if you switch

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:12.470
on a laser beam, light
travels at the speed of light,

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.380
and in 10 to the minus 10
seconds, in picoseconds,

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.200
you reach steady state.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.180
And you know when
you operate the MOT,

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:24.400
you're not switching on and
off your lasers at picoseconds.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.072
It's not that.

00:40:27.072 --> 00:40:27.780
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.636
AUDIENCE: --the
spacial variation of c.

00:40:30.636 --> 00:40:34.450
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:39.220
The force is not just
proportional to the Poynting

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:39.930
vector.

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:45.020
This would be true if
I had grains of sand,

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.000
but photons have to fill
a resonance condition.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.860
You can maybe
assume I'm an atom,

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:59.100
but I have an spatially varying
magnetic field around me.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.990
At the one magnetic
field, I feel the force

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.060
of the laser beam
because I am resonant.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.250
At another magnetic
field, the laser beam

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.950
just goes through me because
I'm not in resonance.

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:12.880
So therefore, the
proportionality

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.950
between the Poynting
vector of the laser

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:18.430
beam and the light force
ignores that the light force

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.360
is resonant, that the
light force depends

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.401
on polarization and such.

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:34.590
So the solution
is the divergence

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:39.390
of-- If the c parameter
is spatially dependent,

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:43.260
then we can have a divergence,
and then, we can do trapping.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:49.250
And it was actually Dave
Pritchard in '85 or in '86

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.820
who wrote a really
influential paper.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.850
He said the Optical Earnshaw
theorem can be circumvented.

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:58.800
We can have a spatially
dependent factor,

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.840
and what can be spatially
dependent is saturation.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.230
If you focus a laser beam,
you have a spatially varying

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.850
saturation parameter.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:08.700
There can be some
optical pumping.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.710
There can be light--

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.900
So he discussed
several possibilities

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.750
how the Optical Earnshaw
theorem was circumvented.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.010
At this point in 1986,
he didn't realize

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.350
that it can be done with
a magnetic field gradient.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:28.570
When he talked about possible
ways of circumventing

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:32.630
the Optical Earnshaw theorem,
Jean Dalibard, who many of who

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.830
know, who's a famous
researcher in our field,

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.530
had the idea that applying
a magnetic field gradient

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:38.730
could work.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.760
But nobody thought,
at this time,

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.110
that it would work
in three dimensions,

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.040
so the fact that it
works in three dimensions

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.180
is almost a miracle.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.190
So when the idea was born,
all those schemes, and also

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:54.710
the original idea of applying
a magnetic field gradient,

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.970
were conceived as
one dimension scheme.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.950
Most of the schemes can
not be easily generalized

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:05.100
to three dimension,
but the MOT scheme

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.830
works as well in three dimension
as it works in one dimension.

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:12.370
Anyway, so this is
sort of the background.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:17.170
Since I was a postdoc
when there were only two

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:20.400
or three groups who were
operating a magneto-optic trap,

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.140
I put together,
with my own hands,

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.525
the first magneto-optic trap
which was ever used at MIT.

00:43:24.525 --> 00:43:28.480
I mean, it's ancient
history, so I

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.500
wanted to share a little
bit this history to you.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.890
But let me now simply
describe to you

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.710
how the magneto-optic
trap works.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:45.524
Let me describe it
for an atom which

00:43:45.524 --> 00:43:46.690
we are not using in the lab.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.030
We all usually use atoms which
have hyperfine structure.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.700
But let me just for
pedagogical simplicity

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.930
assume that we have an atom
which has an s to p transition,

00:43:55.930 --> 00:44:01.390
and in the p transition,
we have the three different

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:02.980
magnetic [? quantum ?] numbers.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.610
So it's a simplified model.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.990
And what we're
doing right now is

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:13.650
we are applying molasses, two
beams which act as molasses,

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.470
but there is one difference now.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.750
They have different
polarizations, sigma plus

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:21.080
and sigma minus,
and in addition, we

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.530
apply a linear magnetic
field gradient.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:26.670
So what happens now
is the following.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:28.820
The linear magnetic
field gradient

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.030
does Zeeman shifts in
the opposite direction

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:35.400
to the n plus 1 and
n minus 1 level.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:40.290
Now, the transition to m minus
1 is done by sigma plus light.

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:44.470
The transition to m plus 1
is done by sigma minus light.

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:48.730
So what happens now
is if you have an atom

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:52.050
and it moves away
from the origin,

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.350
it will eventually come
closer and closer in resonance

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:58.410
with the sigma plus light,
but the sigma plus light

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:02.550
comes from the left side so
the atom will be pushed back.

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.580
If the atom moves out hear, it
moves further and further away,

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.670
in resonance, from
the sigma plus light,

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:11.760
but it moves now, in resonance,
over the sigma minus light,

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.920
and the sigma minus light
is pushing the atoms back.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:21.230
So this geometry has an inward
force from both directions

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.298
and therefore, works as a trap.

00:45:31.914 --> 00:45:33.580
So let me now describe
it mathematically

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.400
which is very, very simple.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.940
What we have to do is we
just have, like in molasses,

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.090
two laser beams two
times the expression

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:44.960
for the spontaneous light force.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.860
And you'll remember we
got the molasses equation

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.820
by taking the two laser beams
and putting in the Doppler

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.710
shift which is a
velocity dependent shift.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:58.580
Well, all we have to do is,
for those two laser beams,

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:03.260
we have to put now a spatially
dependent Zeeman shift which

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:06.960
varies linearly with position.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:14.620
So therefore, all we have to
do is we sum up the total force

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.720
as the spontaneous
force for the right

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.350
and for the left laser
beam, and in addition

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:24.570
to the molasses effect, we put
now in the spatial dependence.

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.840
So we don't have to
do the math again.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.840
We did already a
Taylor expansion in v,

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.565
but let's now just
do a Taylor expansion

00:46:31.565 --> 00:46:33.390
in the blue expression.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.830
And then, we find that there
is a linearly restoring force

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:42.360
both in velocity space and
in configuration space which

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.180
actually tells you
something interesting.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:50.410
The more friction you have, the
larger is the restoring force.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:54.670
So the trapping and the
cooling are really connected,

00:46:54.670 --> 00:47:00.730
at least in the simple model
of the spontaneous light force.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:04.800
OK, so if we have
this kind of force,

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.130
a linear force in velocity,
a linear force in position,

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.380
this is the equation of
motion of a damped harmonic

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.470
oscillator.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:15.600
You have a spatial
force constant, k,

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.440
this linear force which
is linear in displacement.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.330
So this is a damped
harmonic oscillator.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:24.560
Usually, you don't
see atoms sloshing

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.820
in your magneto-optic trap
like in an harmonic oscillator

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.720
because if you look through
the [? typical ?] numbers

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.830
and by just doing
the Taylor expansion

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.040
of the spontaneous light
force, you can immediately

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.540
get an alluded expressions
for those numbers.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.270
In almost all cases,
the harmonic oscillator

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:42.040
is overdamped.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.050
So that's how the
magneto-optic trap works.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:48:00.820
However, the magneto-optic
trap is not so simple.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.520
I would actually
say nobody fully

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.600
understands the
magneto-optic trap

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.230
because we have
multi-level structure.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.510
We don't have just
one count level.

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:17.360
A sodium and a
rubidium atom has--

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.450
f equals one and f equals two--
has eight different hyperfine

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:22.220
levels.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.650
So there is not one level
and we can excite the atoms.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:27.260
There are eight
different levels.

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.290
And those laser beams to optical
pumping among those eight

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.640
levels, and you have to
solve a rate equation

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.560
for eight different levels.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.280
And the amazing thing
is it still works.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.470
It still works
pretty much, at least

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:43.060
qualitatively, as well as
I just described to you.

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.160
So it's a combination of optical
pumping and Zeeman shifts.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.640
It even works better
than advertised

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.520
because as I will tell
you in the next few weeks,

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.170
you can reach
temperatures-- Because

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.260
of the multi-level
structure, you

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.030
reach temperatures which are
much colder than the Doppler

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.080
limit.

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.890
It's called polarization
gradient cooling.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.740
It's just if you
have laser beams

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.573
and you have atoms with
hyperfine structure,

00:49:07.573 --> 00:49:09.620
they are colder than
the Doppler limit.

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.270
First, nobody understood
it, and then, Bill Phillips

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.180
figured it out.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.450
And that he figured
out why atoms

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:24.380
get colder that
was the main point

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:25.840
emphasized by the
Nobel Committee

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.990
when he got the Nobel
Prize for laser cooling.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:30.510
Of course, he had already
invented Zeeman slowing before,

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:33.330
so he had a few other
things under his belt.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:36.820
But anyway, the fact
that the MOT works

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.220
even better than advertised
is another miracle,

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.200
and this is related to
the hyperfine structure.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:50.490
And finally, the fact that
you can simply extended it

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:54.570
to three dimension, is-- I said
the first, the second --maybe

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:55.680
the third miracle.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.030
It also works.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.110
Because when you
look at the field

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:04.390
of two coils, a so-called
Anti-Helmholtz field,

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:11.110
there are some directions
where the magnetic field is not

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:12.250
radially outward.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.650
This is a much more
complicated magnetic field.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.720
It goes outward
here, outward here,

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:21.090
but in between the quadrupolar
field, it sort of curves.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:25.060
There are some directions
where the magnetic field is not

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:28.404
radial, and you would say, hey,
the one dimensional scheme is

00:50:28.404 --> 00:50:29.320
[INAUDIBLE] [? set. ?]

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.710
Actually, before the
magneto-optic trap

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.590
was demonstrated, Dave
Pritchard's student,

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:38.650
Eric [? Rob ?] did
calculations what

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:42.770
happens in these
diagonal directions which

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.630
have no resemblance to
the one dimension scheme.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:47.992
The solution is in
those directions,

00:50:47.992 --> 00:50:49.700
the trapping form is
a little bit weaker,

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.200
but the big picture
is it doesn't matter.

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.940
So there was an idea
conceived in one dimension

00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.180
for a simple atom structure,
and this idea worked even better

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.250
for real atoms and
in three dimensions.

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.260
OK, in your homework
assignment, you

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.860
will put in some
numbers which show

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:19.740
what happens if you take
a vapor, an alkali vapor

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.420
at a very low density of 10
to the 8 per cubic centimeter,

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.840
pressure of, typically, 10
to the minus 8 [? Tor, ?]

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.740
and you arrange six
laser beams around it.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:35.140
Well, those laser beams have
a restoring force in velocity.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.250
That means they cool and
increase the phase space

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:43.010
density over your sample
by 8 orders of magnitude.

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:45.900
Those laser beams have
also a restoring force

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.730
in the spatial dimension.

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:50.540
Therefore, you get
a cloud which has

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.440
3 orders of magnitude
higher density.

00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:01.130
So the temperature goes down
by 8 orders of magnitude

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.600
which means the phase
space density is enhanced

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.910
by 12 orders of magnitude.

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:08.550
So if you're talking
about the goal of reaching

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:12.010
Bose-Einstein condensation
which requires a phase space

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:16.450
density of 1, just
having a dilute vapor

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:20.530
and these six laser beams with
a little bit of magnetic field,

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.190
increases your
phase space density

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:26.250
by 15 orders of magnitude.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:32.720
So this is why molasses and
the MOT were a real milestone.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.570
Now, with 15 orders
of magnitude,

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:38.400
you are just 4 or 5
orders of magnitude

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.520
from Bose-Einstein
condensation, and we

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.400
will discuss, in
a week and a half,

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.100
what techniques were
needed to bridge

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:51.570
the gap between those
temperatures and densities

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:53.226
and quantum
degeneracy of gasses.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:04.710
So that's the story of
the magneto-optic trap.

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:07.010
I'm also telling
you that because I'm

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:10.310
proud that a lot of the
pioneering work in this regard

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:11.145
happened at MIT.

00:53:11.145 --> 00:53:13.940
It was Dave Pritchard who
realized at the Optical

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.530
Earnshaw theorem
can be circumvented,

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:21.340
and it was him, in a
collaboration with Steve Chu,

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:26.210
that they together realized
the first magneto-optic trap,

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:29.151
and this was in 1987.

00:53:29.151 --> 00:53:29.650
Questions?

00:53:40.965 --> 00:53:44.670
OK, I think simple applications
of the spontaneous light force.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:54.150
So we have time to talk
about the dressed atom.

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.700
Now, I was waiting
until this point

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.570
to introduce the dressed
atom picture for you

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:07.760
because the dressed atom picture
is the natural picture you want

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.500
to think about, for instance,
for the Mollow triplet,

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.630
and we had already some
discussion about it.

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.310
But it is also the
natural picture

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:17.140
you want to think about
it when you describe

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.690
the stimulated light force.

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:23.660
And I mentioned already, it is
the dressed atom picture which

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:29.240
will help me to give you the
physical picture behind if you

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.580
have strong laser beams,
why blue-detuned light cools

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.360
and not red-detuned light.

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.230
So you should be motivated now
to learn about the dressed atom

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.040
picture.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.910
But first, I have
to say it's not

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:44.530
anything new, what
I'm teaching you.

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.180
It has exactly the
same physics in it

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.940
as the optical Bloch equations.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:56.620
It's just that the optical
Bloch equations are

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.070
often more complicated,
and they don't

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:00.880
provide the clear insight.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.305
And the reason is the following.

00:55:03.305 --> 00:55:05.690
Often when you describe
a physical phenomenon,

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:09.850
you can choose one basis set, or
you can use another basis set.

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:11.950
But if you're in
the wrong basis,

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:15.180
you get the correct results,
but in the wrong basis,

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.900
you just can't describe
the physics easily.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:21.010
So in other words, with
the dressed atom picture,

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:25.430
I want to introduce dressed
atom states for you which

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:29.160
are no longer the ground
state and the excited state.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.310
I want to treat the
atoms dressed up

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:36.360
by the laser beam,
which is one mode

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.370
of the electromagnetic field.

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:41.690
So the atoms, together
with this one laser beam,

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:44.980
will be partially excited,
partially in the ground state.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.730
And this partially
excited atoms, this

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:49.980
is the dressed atom basis.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:54.990
But if you think in
terms of those states,

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:57.180
you have a much easier
way to formulate

00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.560
certain physical processes,
exactly processes

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.080
where you have high laser power.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.120
At low laser power,
the dress states

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:06.280
are identical to
the naked states

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.730
to the ground and
excited states.

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:11.810
But at high laser power,
at infinite laser power,

00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:16.240
the two dressed states are the
symmetric and anti-symmetric

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.330
equal superposition of
grounded and excited state.

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:22.600
So that's what we
want to describe now.

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:27.180
So the difference to the
Optical Bloch Equation

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.290
is that we are
now really looking

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:31.360
for the combined
state of the atom

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.530
in the electromagnetic field.

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:43.130
So what we want to do is--
this is sort of our picture

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:44.310
that we have.

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:46.680
This is our Hamiltonian.

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:50.310
We have the atom
interacting with the vacuum

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:52.560
through spontaneous
emission with a reservoir

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.340
of empty modes.

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:58.110
But now, it also interacts
with the laser beam.

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:00.820
And you remember when we
did the master equation,

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.530
we looked sort of at this.

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:05.070
We derived a master
equation for this.

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:07.740
And then we added
in the unitary time

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:09.830
evolution due to laser beam.

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:12.030
But what we want to
do now is we want

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:16.790
to first take care of the
atom and the laser beam

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:19.820
almost exactly in an
exact diagonalization.

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.170
And once we have
re-diagonalized that,

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:26.030
we have now eigenstates which
we call the dressed states.

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:29.640
Then we allow not the
ground and excited state.

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.457
We then allow the dressed
states to emit into the vacuum.

00:57:33.457 --> 00:57:35.540
And this is the formulation
we want to obtain now.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.430
Let me make one
comment before I go

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:54.930
through a few simple equation,
and that's the following.

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:59.190
If I want to treat this
system almost exactly,

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:02.290
I have two choices.

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:04.650
I use a strong laser beam.

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:08.190
So I could, as we have
discussed several times,

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:11.990
simply use the time dependent
external electric field.

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:15.550
The laser beam is E0
times cosine omega t.

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:18.780
And I just introduced
that in the Hamiltonian.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.870
And you can get
everything I describe now

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:23.500
for you out of this Hamiltonian.

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:28.860
However, there is
an alternative way.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:34.980
And this one is I simply
assume that the laser beam is

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:37.240
described by the
fully quantized field.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.070
And I use the fog state.

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:42.530
I just assume N, the number
of photons, is very big.

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.720
And this is, at least
for that purpose,

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.880
a valid description
of the laser beam.

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.810
So what happens is you really
want to look through that.

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.380
I've really learned
a lot by comparing

00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.860
the purely classical
treatment of the laser beam

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.590
and the fully quantized
description of the laser beam.

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:04.700
The results are the same.

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:07.150
They are Absolutely identical.

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:10.570
And what you will see is, by
a bunch of approximations,

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:13.880
we reduce the total
Hamiltonian to-- I've

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.260
seen it many times--
a two by two matrix.

00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.330
And whether you start
with the classical field

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:20.540
or whether you start with
the fully quantized field,

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.520
if you make the
right approximation,

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.010
you get the same
two by two matrix.

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:26.920
But there's a difference.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.720
This Hamiltonian is
time independent.

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.870
a dagger a, time
independent Hamiltonian.

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:38.430
If you take a classical field,
which is cosine omega lt,

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:41.130
you don't have a time
independent Hamiltonian.

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:43.520
You have a driven system,
and your wave function

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.830
has an external time dependence.

00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:49.040
The laser beam is driving
the wave function.

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:51.390
So in other words,
you have two choices

00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:53.870
when you want to describe
how an atom interacts

00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.180
with a strong laser beam.

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:58.545
You can use the fully quantized
field, which is conceptionally

00:59:58.545 --> 01:00:00.610
a little bit more
complicated, because we've

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:02.290
quantized the
electromagnetic field.

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:04.780
But then everything
is time independent,

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.880
and everything I do
here is really easy.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.600
I can go over it
now in five minutes,

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.120
and you understand everything.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.330
Well, in your
homework, I've already

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:18.340
asked you at an early homework
to look at simply the two level

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.630
system driven by
classical field.

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:25.300
And in your next homework,
number 10, your last homework,

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.820
I'm asking you now to
interpret the solution

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.620
with the classical field.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.810
And it's actually a
little bit a challenge

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:35.350
to take the time
dependent wave function

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:38.647
and read the physics out of this
time dependent wave function,

01:00:38.647 --> 01:00:41.230
which corresponds to the physics
we derive in the dressed atom

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:43.620
picture.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.760
But you have two ways.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.550
One is the classical field.

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:49.214
Then the wave function, the
Hamiltonian, is time dependent.

01:00:49.214 --> 01:00:50.880
And the wave function
is time dependent.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.220
Or here, I start with
the quantum field

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.250
and everything is
time independent.

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.100
But the solutions are identical.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.470
Well, one is a time
dependent wave function.

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:01.610
One is time independent.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.570
But if you interpret
the solution

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:06.030
in terms of what happens
to the physical system,

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:09.120
you will find exactly the same.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.990
So in other words, I decided
I do the easy part here,

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:13.980
which is a fully quantized part.

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.460
And this is probably what
will get stuck in your head.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.592
But since I think it's an
important pedagogical exercise,

01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:21.050
you have to go
through the homework

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:23.960
and do the time dependent part.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:30.240
OK, so we want to
know exactly-- well

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.230
not-- we want to do the
correct approximations.

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:35.450
And after some
approximations, exactly

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:38.390
solve what the atom does
with one laser beam.

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:45.530
So the laser beam is described
by the standard Hamiltonian

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:46.880
for single mode light.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.150
The atom is described by, well,
excitation energy omega 0.

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.860
And b is the excited state.

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.990
So if you don't have any
light atom interaction,

01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:02.740
the eigenstates are just product
states, an atom in the excited

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.160
or the ground state.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.520
And N is the photon number.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.810
[? Collin? ?]

01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:10.320
AUDIENCE: You said that
it's usually easier

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.480
to understand physics
in a dressed atom

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.454
picture versus optical
block equations.

01:02:14.454 --> 01:02:15.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.165
AUDIENCE: Can you think
of-- is that a general rule?

01:02:20.165 --> 01:02:24.595
Or is this just like it's only
applicable in certain areas?

01:02:24.595 --> 01:02:25.095
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.750
PROFESSOR: You're really
asking an expert question.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:42.800
And I talked to Jean Dalibard
and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji,

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.210
who invented the dressed
atom picture, when

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:47.510
I wanted to understand
what happens when

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:49.030
we have a blue detuned lattice.

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:52.300
And I used the dressed atom
picture and I got confused.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.540
So what happened
is the following.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:59.340
If you pick your right bases,
the description is simple.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.770
But simple means
if all the physics

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.605
is your atom is in
one dressed state

01:03:04.605 --> 01:03:06.730
or the other dressed state,
and it does transitions

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:09.270
between the dressed
states and that is easy,

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:12.280
and this happens in the
limit of large detuning.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.190
But if you're in
the regime where

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:17.130
coherences between the
dressed states matter.

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:20.300
In other words, the density
matrix in the dressed state

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.780
basis has now off
diagonal matrix element.

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.340
The physics becomes
complicated again.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.140
So in other words, what
I'm telling you is you

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:33.170
are the best description
happens when we have a two level

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:35.410
system, we always need
a two by two matrix.

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:39.020
But if you pick the description
where the solution is diagonal,

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.300
if you have to deal with
coherence, using coherence

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:43.830
is coupled to population,
it's complicated.

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:47.210
And there's some cases-- one is
the blue detuned lattice, which

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:50.190
I encounter where you have to
consider the coherences to get

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:51.530
the correct answer.

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:55.730
And usually, also when
the laser beams are weak

01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:58.530
and on resonance, the
dressed atom picture

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:01.340
is not providing any advantages.

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:05.640
So you want to use the bare
picture for weak excitations.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.990
And yes, in the resonance
case, the dressed atom picture,

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:11.900
if you're very
close to resonance,

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.380
the dressed atom picture
gets more complicated.

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:18.420
But to give you the answer in
something we have discussed,

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.330
you know already that when
you drive an atom with a laser

01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:24.350
beam, you get the
Mollow triplet.

01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:28.120
And the Mollow
triplet shows you--

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.010
I hope we can finish that
today-- shows you the energy

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:33.980
splitting between the
dressed energy levels,

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.520
between the dressed
energy levels.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.500
But if the Mollow
triplet is not resolved

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.940
because the generalized
Rabi frequency is small,

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:45.280
then you're not resolving
your dressed atom levels.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.882
And then the dressed
atom level is not

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:47.965
providing a big advantage.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.470
For certain problems,
the dressed atom picture

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:57.450
will not help you.

01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:59.167
But I can reassure
you, and this is

01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:01.000
what I learned from
Jean Dalibard and Claude

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.330
Cohen-Tannoudji,
if you really look

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:06.060
at the full matrix with the
off diagonal matrix append

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:09.590
and everything, you will always
find exactly the same solution.

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.870
Anyway, we were
just writing down

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:22.720
product states of the atoms
and the eigenfunctions

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.900
of the Hamiltonian
for the light, which

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:28.600
are fog states, number
states with N, L N plus 1.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.540
But the important thing
is now the following.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:35.535
In the limit of small
detuning, the ground state

01:05:35.535 --> 01:05:39.720
with N plus 1 photon is almost
degenerate with the excited

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.190
state with N photons.

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:44.720
And we call these two
states a manifold.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.550
The manifold E of N. And
N is the photon number

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:49.630
in the excited state.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.140
So what happens is, if you
look at all those states,

01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:01.740
they are grouped into manifolds.

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:05.080
And the energy separation
between two manifolds

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:12.320
is, of course, I go from N to N
plus 1, the energy of a photon.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.550
So now I introduce the
atom laser coupling

01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:19.050
in the usual dipole
approximation.

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:23.600
And what happens is, this
dipole approximation,

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.530
this dipole light atom coupling
will couple, of course,

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:31.020
ground and excited state.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.400
And it will, of course,
have a big effect

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.220
when the energy
splitting is small.

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.150
Well, you will see
that in the next line.

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:45.230
But we have the co and
counter rotating terms.

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:49.910
This dipole Hamiltonian will
also couple the ground state

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:53.040
to the excited state
in the other manifold.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:58.150
This is the off resonant
term, which will be neglect.

01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:59.760
So here are the
equations for that.

01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:06.530
Our electric field is, of
course, a plus a dagger.

01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:09.530
The dipole operator is that.

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:15.210
And if you take what is in
front of the electric field

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:19.390
and define this as the
coupling constant, g,

01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:24.950
we have what I just told
you, that within a manifold,

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:26.980
the ground state
with N plus 1 photons

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:31.800
is coupled to the excited
state with N photons.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.560
g is simply the
coupling constant,

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:37.770
which all parameters have
been included in that.

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:41.000
But then, because of the matrix
element of a or a dagger,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.980
we have the square
root of N plus 1.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:50.440
OK, so what we are now doing is
we are going with this coupling

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.020
within a manifold, which
is strong because the two

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:54.760
levels are energetically close.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:58.270
And we will neglect the
non-resonant couplings

01:07:58.270 --> 01:07:59.810
to the other manifolds.

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:02.027
And that's just another
way of doing, again,

01:08:02.027 --> 01:08:03.360
the rotating wave approximation.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.920
Now, when we describe an atom
in the laser field and the atom

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.420
scatters light, or
we have a laser beam,

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:19.340
and I have to tell you,
when we have a laser beam,

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:23.069
we don't provide exactly
N atom, N photons.

01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:25.279
The laser beam is
in a coherent state.

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:27.890
And there are
Poissonian fluctuations.

01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:31.600
But now, we do the next
approximation, namely we

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.670
say when N is
large, then delta N

01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:38.450
can be neglected
with regard to N.

01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:41.770
Then at least for the
range of important photon

01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:45.819
numbers for the problem, this
coupling becomes independent

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:50.550
of N. And we simply take the
average number of photons

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:58.090
in our laser beam and define
now an electric field, which

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:01.859
is independent of N.

01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:03.920
And the product with
the dipole operator

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.930
of the atom, that's what
we call the Rabi frequency.

01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:12.380
So at that point, we introduce
a classical electric field

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:15.210
through this definition, and
therefore, the dressed atom

01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:15.779
picture.

01:09:15.779 --> 01:09:19.660
Also, we start with the fully
quantized Hamiltonian is now

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:24.160
identical to the classical
field with this electric field

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:24.660
amplitude.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.960
But what we have gained is
we could discuss everything

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.640
in a time independent picture.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.670
And now, I promised you,
we'll go back to a two

01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:42.120
by two matrix, which you
have seen many times.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.569
It's a two level system.

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:47.720
We have the detuning.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:50.450
We are in the rotating frame.

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:55.400
So that means the ground and
excited state with N and N

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.070
minus 1 photons have
the same energy.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:02.410
But if we have a detuning,
there is a difference

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.400
whether we excite the
atom or whether we

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.060
put a photon in the laser field.

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.210
But you have seen
that many, many times.

01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:10.240
And the coupling
is now described

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.130
by the Rabi frequency.

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:17.590
So that's kind of
our typical two level

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:20.680
system where the two levels
[INAUDIBLE] the rotating frame,

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.410
everything is time independent.

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:28.860
The two levels are split,
and they are coupled.

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:32.760
And well, how many times have
you seen the solution of two

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.210
by two matrix?

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:38.820
The solution is that
the coupling is now

01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.450
increasing the splitting.

01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:42.100
The splitting between
the two levels

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.000
is, again, the generalized
Rabi frequency,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.830
which you have seen
many, many times.

01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:51.410
But now we want to really
get the wave function.

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:54.920
We want to get something out
of the dressed atom picture.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.830
And that's the following.

01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:01.760
We started out with the
bare states-- ground

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.700
state with N plus 1, excited
state with N photons.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:09.880
And the two by two matrix
after the diagonalization

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.260
is now a linear
combination of those.

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.870
And it's convenient to use
sine theta, cosine theta,

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:18.920
because then the states are
automatically normalized.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.780
If I introduce the
solution is now

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:24.790
that the angle theta is
given by this equation,

01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:28.290
that's just the solution
for the two by two matrix.

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:32.530
And the physical picture,
which we have obtained,

01:11:32.530 --> 01:11:33.285
is the following.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:43.190
If this here is the energy
of the excited state with N

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:49.720
photons, I've just sort of drawn
this as a reference parallel.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.800
But now I want to draw it
as a function of the laser

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.660
frequency.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.560
Well, the ground state
with N plus 1 photons

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.050
has exactly the same
energy on resonance.

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.980
But if the photon is more
energetic then this state,

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.870
because it has N plus 1
photons versus n photons

01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:11.480
if the photon is more energetic
than a resonant photon,

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.850
this state has higher energy.

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:15.160
And here, it has lower energy.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.610
In other words, we
have now a level

01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:21.300
crossing between
the two bare states.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.500
But a level crossing
with interaction

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.510
turns into an avoided crossing.

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:27.450
And the solution which
we have just derived

01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:29.850
are the blue curves.

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:32.830
And if I go far
away from resonance,

01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:37.240
this behavior here,
which is perturbative,

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.970
is nothing else than
the AC Stark shift.

01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:43.820
So this is exactly what we
have discussed at this point.

01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:51.380
Now, let's get some
mileage out of it.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.862
And we will talk
about light forces.

01:12:54.862 --> 01:12:55.945
That's really interesting.

01:12:55.945 --> 01:12:58.820
And I hope it's another
highlight of this course

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.650
to describe light forces in
the dressed atom picture.

01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:03.840
But what I want to
do here is already

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.480
in preparation for that.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.080
I want to not yet
introduce forces, simply

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.690
figure out what happens in
the dressed atom picture

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:16.590
when the atoms scatter light.

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:18.520
And you know already
the solution.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.740
The solution is
the Mollow triplet.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:25.710
And we have discussed with
the Optical Bloch Equations

01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:28.260
that at low laser power,
the Mollow triplet

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:34.160
has three curves.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.930
It has three broadened curves.

01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:39.010
And they have
different broadening.

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:41.860
And I didn't prove it to
you, but I mentioned to you,

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:47.112
at low laser power there is--
perturbative laser power,

01:13:47.112 --> 01:13:49.570
we discussed at great length
that there's a delta function.

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:52.870
And at low laser power,
the delta function remains.

01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:55.720
So this is sort of the
spectrum we get out of it.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.670
And what I want
to show you now is

01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:04.350
how this spectrum is described
in the dressed atom picture.

01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:07.210
Atom photon interaction
has a wonderful discussion

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:08.580
of all the details.

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:11.260
I will share with
you a few highlights.

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:14.990
But we will go much further in
the description of the Mollow

01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:17.760
triplet then we've gone before.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.460
But I will not go into
all excruciating details.

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:27.310
So let's discuss first.

01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:29.100
That's something we
hadn't done so far.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:32.050
What are the intensities
in this Mollow triplet?

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:45.430
So the way how we obtain
it is the following.

01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:51.080
We have the manifold, the
manifold with N minus 1

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.200
and the manifold with N photons.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.140
And this is the detuning.

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.160
And if we allow for the
atom laser coupling,

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.520
the splitting here is a
generalized Rabi frequency.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:06.160
And well, you immediately see
that in this picture, if you

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.250
allow spontaneous emission from
the upper manifold to the lower

01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:13.620
manifold, you have four
different combinations.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:16.520
One is the long photon
is the blue sideband.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.367
This is the red sideband.

01:15:18.367 --> 01:15:19.450
This is the blue sideband.

01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:20.500
This is the red sideband.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.210
And those two are the carriers.

01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:25.480
But now, we can
do the following.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.610
I've just written down for
you the solution of the wave

01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:30.530
function with sine
and cosine theta.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.950
If we want to emit the blue
sideband, we go from the top

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:43.930
to the bottom.

01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:47.320
But that means, since a
photon in the rotating wave

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:53.980
approximation can only be
emitted when we go from b to a,

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:57.890
we find that the
matrix element for that

01:15:57.890 --> 01:16:02.240
involves cosine theta
times sine theta.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.480
However, if you want
to emit the carrier,

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.300
you go from here to there.

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:11.970
Well, we always have to find
the excited state to begin with.

01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:21.000
And we go-- I must
have made a mistake.

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:24.850
Sorry.

01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:26.660
When I went to emit
the blue side, when

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:28.880
I go from all the way
up to all the way down,

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.650
and I always have to find
an excited state which

01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:33.070
connects to the ground state.

01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:37.865
And this gives me a term,
which is cosine square.

01:16:37.865 --> 01:16:41.290
The red detuned sideband
gives me sine squared.

01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:46.600
And if I want to get
the carrier, this one,

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.410
I go from here to here.

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:51.090
I get cosine theta sine theta.

01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:53.570
So in other words,
we can immediately

01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:56.640
read off the matrix elements.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.240
And since the intensity,
Fermi's Golden Rule,

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.290
is the matrix
element squared, we

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:05.410
find immediately that the upper
lower sideband and the carrier

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:09.340
involve terms cosine to the
4 theta, sine to the 4 theta,

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:11.510
cosine square sine square.

01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:13.670
So we got the matrix element.

01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:15.560
And the only thing
we have to know now

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:22.530
is that the width or the rate
is given by the matrix element.

01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:30.290
The rate is given by the
matrix element square.

01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:34.330
But now, what is the
intensity of the line?

01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:38.720
Well, the upper
sideband is emitted

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.580
by the upper dressed
state, because you

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.270
have to go from the
upper dressed state

01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:45.430
to the lower dressed state to
get the blue detuned photon.

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:48.050
So therefore, the
intensity for this sideband

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:51.380
is this rate times
the population

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.260
in the upper dressed state.

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.560
So what is missing
at this point,

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.100
and we need that urgently
for next week, what

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:04.740
is the population in the
upper and the lower sideband?

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:08.320
Well, we know the
transition rates

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.510
between the upper and
the lower sidebands--

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:13.840
well, between the upper
and lower dressed state.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:18.572
We know we've just
found here the rate.

01:18:18.572 --> 01:18:19.280
What is the rate?

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.970
What is the matrix element
squared when you go from one

01:18:23.970 --> 01:18:27.820
is the upper, two is the
lower state of the manifold.

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:30.140
So we have just
gotten those rates.

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:34.110
And rate equation says,
the change of population

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:38.370
in the upper dressed
state is given

01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:41.040
by the departure
from the upper state

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.970
and what arrives
from the lower state.

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:49.110
So since we are interested
in the steady state solution,

01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:52.940
we can just set the
left side to zero.

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:56.190
And then, the rate
equations simply

01:18:56.190 --> 01:19:00.250
give us the population
in terms of the rates.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:03.750
So in other words, if you
ask, what is the steady state

01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:06.370
solution in the upper
or lower dressed state,

01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:10.510
it's given by a ratio of
those rate coefficients.

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:12.450
But we just got those
rate coefficients.

01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:18.030
And this gives us another bunch
of sine and cosine functions.

01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:20.350
So in other words,
we know now what

01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:23.450
is the population of
the dressed states.

01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:26.700
I mean, everything is expressed
by one non-trivial parameter

01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:27.520
theta.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.260
And all we get is sine square,
cosine square, sine to the 4th,

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:33.110
we just get those
trigonometric functions.

01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:38.720
Yes.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.230
I think we can finish that.

01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:42.730
Good.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.550
So this is the steady
state solution.

01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:53.190
But now, we can go back
to the rate equation

01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:58.940
and say the time derivative
of the rate equation

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:03.380
has to relax to
the steady state.

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:07.410
This is nothing else than
rewriting the equation above.

01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:12.480
But by rewriting the
equation above in that way,

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:17.210
we find now the
prefactor in front of-- I

01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:20.470
mean, here, what you have is
the time derivative is given

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:22.440
by the difference
from steady state.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.630
And this is the
relaxation coefficient.

01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:28.100
And the relaxation coefficient
is-- that's the solution.

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.240
You just have to do the
substitutions yourself.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.790
The relaxation coefficient,
how populations

01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:36.530
relax to steady
state, is now given

01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:38.960
by the sum of the two rates.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:42.230
One is going from the
upper to the lower

01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:44.260
and from the lower
to the upper state.

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.330
And each of those rates
has been expressed

01:20:46.330 --> 01:20:47.860
by sine square and
cosine squares.

01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:52.990
I'm not doing it here,
because it's a little bit more

01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:53.920
complicated.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.620
But you can also rewrite for
the dressed atom picture what

01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:01.745
happens-- you can rewrite those
equations in a way what happens

01:21:01.745 --> 01:21:06.140
not to the population, but
what happens to the coherences,

01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:09.100
to the off diagram
matrix element formulated

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.530
in the dressed state basis.

01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:15.630
And what you find is, you find
a correlation time, a relaxation

01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:18.880
time, for the coherences.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:22.090
Remember, for the naked
state, population's

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.900
relaxed with gamma.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:26.110
Coherence is relaxed
with gamma over 2.

01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:27.880
This is for the Optical
Bloch Equations.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:31.960
But now we have reformulated
the physics in the dressed atom

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.640
picture.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:38.110
And what the solution
is the following.

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.000
This is sort of a
weak laser power.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.790
But in the most general
case, what you will find

01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:58.180
is that the width
of the central peak

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:01.790
reflects the relaxation
time for the population.

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:04.890
And the width for the sidebands
is the relaxation time

01:22:04.890 --> 01:22:08.880
for the coherences in
the dressed atom picture.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.440
So we had before with the
Optical Bloch Equations,

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.420
I showed you different cases.

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.780
We had a three quarter gamma.

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:21.890
I need two more minutes and
I'm finished with my unit.

01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:24.930
So we had weird factors
of three quarters.

01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:28.520
And I showed you how they
come from the eigenvalues

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.670
of the matrix of the
Optical Bloch Equation.

01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:34.080
But now we understand
them physically,

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.260
namely the central
feature has a peak,

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.410
which is the relaxation
time for the populations

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:40.820
in the dressed atom picture.

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:42.740
And the sidebands
have a width, which

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.750
is the relaxation time
for the coherences.

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.960
They no longer differ
by a factor of two,

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:55.375
as in the naked bases in which
we formulated the Optical Bloch

01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:55.875
Equations.

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:04.120
By the way, I know
a lot of you may

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.170
be curious about
the coherent peak.

01:23:07.170 --> 01:23:09.220
You can read about it in API.

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:12.860
It's 10 pages about
correlation function.

01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:19.810
But in the end, the rate
of the delta function

01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:23.700
can be, again, described by
values we have just calculated.

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.340
We have just calculated
steady state populations

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.370
and transition rates.

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:32.160
So this rate is nothing else
than another combination

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.820
of sine square and cosine
squares of this angle theta.

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.910
So everything is wonderfully
and simply described

01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:41.790
the full physics of
that by just this angle

01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:44.970
theta in the dressed
atom picture.

01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:56.890
OK So with that, we are done.

01:23:56.890 --> 01:24:02.750
And I think I'll discuss the
last page with you on Monday.

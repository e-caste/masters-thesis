00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.030
PROFESSOR: Last time I
told you about oncogenes.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.430
Oncogenes-- we discussed the
fact that these were gain

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.150
of function mutations that
occur in cancer cells--

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.480
that occur in normal cells as
they develop into cancer cells,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.060
and then occur in cancer cells.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.210
And we discussed the fact that
these are dominant mutations.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.240
And this was exemplified by the
Weinberg experiment in which he

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.920
transferred a dominant oncogene
into a "normal cell' and caused

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.620
that cell to become transformed
despite the fact that it had

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.950
normal copies of the
same gene in its genome--

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.590
definition of a
dominant mutation.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.760
We also talked about
tumor suppressor genes.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.230
And tumor suppressor
genes importantly,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.010
carry within them loss
of function mutations

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.930
in the context of cancer.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.800
Loss of function mutations,
as such, these mutations

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:45.260
are recessive mutations
at the cellular level.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.680
It's necessary to inactivate
both copies of a tumor

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.930
suppressor gene in
order to give rise

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.990
to a cell that's lacking
that function altogether.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.830
And that's a cell that is on its
way to becoming a cancer cell.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.605
And these loss of function
mutations can be various.

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:09.030
You might find
nonsense mutations

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.339
in a tumor suppressor gene--

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.880
blocks the production
of the protein.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:18.450
You might find a deletion.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.590
It takes out the entire gene,
or a big portion of the gene.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.520
You might find a frame
shift mutation-- again,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.370
that blocks the ability to make
any protein, or much protein.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.870
And I also told you about
chromosome loss events.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.666
The loss of the
chromosome that carries

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:44.290
the normal copy of
the tumor suppressor

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.970
gene as a frequent second event
to lose the remaining wild type

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.659
copy of the gene.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.450
OK, so this is just a
little bit of review.

00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:57.270
Now, I framed the discussion
about oncogenes and tumor

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.240
suppressor genes from the
point of view of cell division

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.730
control and the
production of more cells

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.620
through the action
of these mutations.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.070
And indeed, cancer is a product
of inappropriate cell division.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.400
And the two genes that we
discussed in some detail

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.390
regulate this process.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.890
The RAS gene and
the product oncogene

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.350
stimulate cell division.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.010
The RB tumor suppressor
gene inhibits cell division.

00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:49.490
When we consider the kinds
of mutations that we have

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.790
in these genes that regulate
the cell division process--

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.460
in the case of the RAS gene,
we find activating mutations.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.740
And in the case of the
tumor suppressor gene RB,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.870
we find inactivating mutations.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.710
RAS is in oncogene.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.920
RB is a tumor suppressor gene.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.410
Activating mutations
in the oncogene.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.860
Inactivating mutations in
the tumor suppressor gene.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.899
But cancer isn't only
about cell division.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.480
It's really about cell number--
inappropriate cell number.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.130
And there's another
important process

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.465
to remember in this context.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.470
Apoptosis-- program
cell death, which

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.680
I've referred to many times
in many different contexts.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.370
Apoptosis, which
results in dead cells.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.840
And failure to undergo
apoptosis properly

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.230
will likewise result in
too many cells, which

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.605
again can be cancer causing.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.990
We have genes that
regulate this process.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.640
For example, the P53
gene, which we'll

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.800
discuss in some more detail,
positively regulates apoptosis.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.750
And another gene
called BCL-2, which

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.200
negatively regulates apoptosis.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.950
Is P53 an oncogene or a
tumor suppressor gene?

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.930
Oncogene?

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.280
Tumor suppressor gene?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.360
Good.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.320
P53 is a very important
tumor suppressor gene.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.100
It is inactivated in
the context of cancer

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.770
because you want to
get rid of apoptosis

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.860
as you are developing
cancer cell.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.860
Is BCL-2 an oncogene or
a tumor suppressor gene?

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.470
It's an oncogene.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.160
We find gain of function
mutations in BCL-2,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.710
producing more of this
inhibitor of apoptosis

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.010
in the context of
cancer to block

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.890
apoptosis leading to an
increased number of developing

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.390
cancer cells.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.850
OK, so oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.520
can regulate these two
processes differently.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.240
As you can see, inhibitors
in this case, stimulator's

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.960
in this case, in the context
of tumor suppressor genes.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.760
All right, a little
bit more about P53,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.690
which is probably the most
important cancer gene of all.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.490
It's mutated in at least
50% of all human tumors.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.980
And P53 is known to function as
a molecular policeman of sorts.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.790
It's sensitive to various
perturbations within the cell.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.140
For example, DNA damage.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:54.420
DNA damage will feed into
the P53 regulated pathway,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.100
as will a fascinating process,
which is still incompletely

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.400
understood, where the cell
can recognize that it's

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.500
dividing inappropriately.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.600
Abnormal proliferation-- cells
dividing when it shouldn't.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.260
This gets detected,
and this, too,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.350
can feed into the P53 pathway.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.210
And this leads to an increase in
the levels of the P53 protein.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.670
P53 is a transcription factor.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.390
It regulates the
expression of other genes.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:38.440
And the genes that it regulates
fall into two broad categories,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.900
some of which cause the cell
to undergo cell cycle arrest.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.730
When the P53
pathway is activated

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.805
under certain circumstances, the
cells are instructed to arrest.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.700
During which time,
whatever the damage is

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.580
can be fixed before the
cell continues to cycle.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.540
If there's DNA damage, the cell
might arrest, fix the damage,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.580
and then continue on.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.730
In addition, P53
regulates apoptosis,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:18.160
as I mentioned a few moments
ago, causing the cells to die.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.885
Causing the damaged
cells to die--

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.120
and that's good because
dead cells make no tumors.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.480
This is a sacrifice by
the individual cell who

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.710
has been damaged, basically
saying, I'm in trouble,

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.799
killing itself, and allowing
the organism to survive.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.990
OK, and this is a very important
process in cancer prevention

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.890
we now know.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.690
And I'll tell you
some examples of how

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.840
we know that momentarily.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.660
OK, so I've introduced you to
a couple of different oncogenes

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.835
and a couple of different
tumor suppressor genes.

00:08:59.835 --> 00:09:01.210
I want to focus
a little bit more

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.085
on the tumor suppressor
genes in one respect.

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:08.605
We touched on this last
time, but very briefly.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.380
Tumor suppressor genes is
sporadically occurring cancers.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:31.040
And sporadic means
that the individual

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.280
has no family history of
that particular cancer type--

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.350
sort of a chance event.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:41.930
And tumor suppressor
genes in sporadic cancers

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.100
require two mutational events.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.620
And I described these as hits.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.550
And we typically
do describe them

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.990
as hits in the context of tumor
suppressor gene inactivation.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.120
Sometimes it's mutations.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.880
Sometimes it's mutations
coupled with chromosome loss

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.470
as the second hit.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.740
But regardless,
two mutations are

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.500
necessary to get rid of both
copies of the tumor suppressor

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.320
gene.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.100
And I also briefly
introduced you to the fact

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:20.420
that tumor suppressor genes
are often-- not always-- but

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.880
for the most part, familial
cancer syndromes, where

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.340
the individuals have a
predisposition to developing

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.300
a particular type of cancer are
caused by inherited mutations

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.530
in tumor suppressor genes.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.530
So one of the hits,
one of the mutations,

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.930
is inherited from one parent.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.140
Meaning that every cell
in that person's body

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.130
carries one of the
mutations already.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.630
Meaning that only one
hit, one mutation,

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.280
is required somatically.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.170
That is in the individual's
own cells in their body.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.916
And this is why
these individuals

00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:16.290
are cancer prone,
because they're

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.200
one step away from lacking
the tumor suppressor

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.350
gene altogether,
whereas in most people

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.740
two mutational events are
necessary, and it's rare--

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.780
not never, but rare--

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.300
to get those two mutations.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:37.450
And I showed you briefly
this pedigree, which

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.050
is a pedigree of
familial retinoblastoma,

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.710
where the individuals inherit a
defective copy of the RB gene,

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.870
and as such are predisposed
to the development

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.160
of this tumor of the eye.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.800
And in fact, they will
develop the tumor typically

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.020
in both the eyes, and typically
multiple foci of tumor.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.810
So they inherit a defective
copy of the gene from one parent

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:04.880
and they go on to develop the
disease at high frequency.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.730
When you look at this
pedigree, remembering back

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:28.604
to your lessons in
disease genetics,

00:12:28.604 --> 00:12:30.520
this looks like an
autosomal dominant disease.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.810
If you inherit the
disease allele,

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.570
you have a very high likelihood
of developing the disease

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.720
regardless of who
your other parent was.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.710
It looks like an
autosomal dominant disease

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.170
with actually incomplete
penetrance, as we can see here.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.660
And we'll talk more
about this in a second.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:13:01.350
An autosomal dominate disease,
but interestingly, we've

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:07.980
been talking about the fact
that the mutations are actually

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.250
recessive.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.010
So this seems confusing.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.510
So who can explain it?

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.770
How do we have a recessive
mutation at the cellular level

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.980
causing what appears to be an
autosomal dominant disease?

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.455
Who can answer that question?

00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:24.910
Yeah?

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.305
AUDIENCE: Predisposition
is the dominant.

00:13:28.305 --> 00:13:30.250
It only needs one mutation.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.180
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.960
Exactly.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.150
You are predisposed.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.950
And there's a very
high likelihood

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.980
that in some or in fact,
many of your cells,

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.540
this second event will occur.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.610
It's almost guaranteed.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.590
And since it's
almost guaranteed,

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.930
if you inherit
just one mutation,

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.420
you will develop the
disease, and therefore it

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.090
appears to be at the
organismal level--

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.750
autosomal dominant-- because
your predisposition nearly

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.170
always guarantees that you
will develop the disease even

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:05.050
though the mutations at the
cellular level are recessive.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:09.070
And so with that in mind, as
we consider a pedigree similar

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.800
to the one I just showed
you, where one parent is

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.940
heterozygous for the mutation--
the loss of function mutation--

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.160
passes that onto the next
generation and beyond,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.130
in this individual, as well
as the other ones shown

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.210
with the dark symbols
where a tumor did develop,

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.640
what is a necessary
second event?

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.340
The loss of the
wild type of allele,

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.240
either by a second mutation,
or a chromosome loss event.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.469
And that happens at
very high frequency.

00:14:40.469 --> 00:14:42.260
In the case of
retinoblastoma, it typically

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.870
happens in a dozen cells
in the developing retina--

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.510
leading to an average of
a dozen independent tumors

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.460
in those kids.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.470
OK, but now let's think
about this individual

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.180
here who did inherit the
defective allele because he

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.480
actually passed it on to
his three sons, but he

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.970
himself did not
develop retinoblastoma.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.030
How can we explain that?

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.645
Why was he spared?

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.670
Well, there are two
general explanations.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.720
First, he was incredibly lucky.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.650
Although it's highly likely
that some cell or cells

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.420
in the developing
retina will mutate

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.910
the normal copy of the gene.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.200
In him, it just didn't happen.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:30.880
He got lucky.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.990
None of his cells mutated
the normal copy of the gene.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.972
His eyes developed normally.

00:15:36.972 --> 00:15:38.680
And after that point,
actually, the cells

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.450
are much less
sensitive to mutation,

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.410
and therefore after about
three or five years of age,

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.540
you typically wouldn't
develop the tumor.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.370
So he might be incredibly lucky.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:53.740
Or it might be that in him,
because of some other inherited

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.920
allele of some other
gene, even if he

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.980
were to lose the wild
type alleled of RB gene

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.800
it wouldn't matter, because
he's got some other gene that's

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.040
functioning maybe in the
place of the RB gene,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.630
leading to him to be protected.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.430
And these two
possibilities exist,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.560
and we have examples of
how both can be important.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.240
OK, final question
on this slide--

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.430
what would happen if
an individual inherited

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.770
a mutation from both
parents and was therefore

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.159
homozygous for a mutation
in a tumor suppressor gene.

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:24.450
What do you think would happen?

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.440
The answer was they
would be stillborn

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.350
or they wouldn't make
it out of embryogenesis.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.850
And that's usually the case.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.040
And we know that not so much
from the study of people who

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.800
are homozygous for
these mutations,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.280
because it's actually quite
rare to find people who are

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.640
heterozygous who have children--
so the number of such examples

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.140
is few--

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.655
but we know it from
knock-out mice.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.590
All of these tumor
suppressor genes

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:04.390
exist within the
mouse genome as well.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.089
And my group and
others have made mice

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.190
with mutations in these genes.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.119
And actually we know that, in
fact, for many of the tumor

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.030
suppressor genes
that we care about,

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.760
like the RB tumor
suppressor gene,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.750
if one creates a
homozygous mutant mouse,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.319
or the APC tumor
suppressor gene, which

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.770
is important in colon
cancer prevention,

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.330
or the BRCA1 tumor
suppressor gene,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.020
which is important in breast
and ovarian cancer prevention--

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:48.640
in all of these cases,
the embryos don't survive.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.390
And they die at different points
along the way of embryogenesis.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.780
And it's actually not because
they develop lots of cancer

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.680
as embryos.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.930
Although, you might have
thought that was true.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.700
They die because these
genes are actually

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.040
important in normal development.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.950
They're not there just to
protect against cancer.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.570
They're there because
they play a role

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:11.170
in regulating normal cell
division processes, normal cell

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.890
death processes,
normal physiology,

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.070
such that when they're missing,
the embryo can't survive.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.064
There's actually one
exception to this.

00:18:21.064 --> 00:18:22.480
Well, I shouldn't
say it that way.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.979
There are a few
exceptions to this--

00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:25.870
but one notable
exception to this.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.410
And that happens to be the
P53 tumor suppressor gene

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.240
that I've introduced you to.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:37.120
My group and others have made
animals that are mutant for P53

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.930
either heterozygous
for the mutation.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.109
What would you expect the
phenotype of these mice to be?

00:18:50.109 --> 00:18:52.400
Are they going to be totally
normal mice, do you think?

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.420
They are, in fact, cancer prone.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.020
They look like those people
with inherited predisposition

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.490
to cancer.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.060
They carry one mutant copy
of a tumor suppressor gene.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.860
And they're one
mutational event away

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.470
from lacking the tumor
suppressor gene altogether.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.590
And that happens at some
frequency in their cells.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:24.460
And the mice will go on to
develop cancer and die early

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.200
for that reason.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.500
We cross these mice
together with an expectation

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.940
that again, they would
not survive embryogenesis.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.290
But in fact to our
surprise, you can

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.632
make a fully P53 null mouse.

00:19:42.632 --> 00:19:44.840
And what do you think the
phenotype of that mouse is?

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.790
It's very cancer prone.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.750
Because this is a
mouse, that in all

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.510
of its cells, this very
important tumor suppressor gene

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.990
is lacking.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.920
Normal mice will live about
2 and 1/2 to three years.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.470
These mice will live
about 1 and 1/2 years

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.740
and die from cancer
as a consequence.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.470
These mice will live
about four to six months

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.700
and die from cancer.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.140
So P53 is actually not
important in normal development.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.510
It is a true tumor
suppressor gene.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.090
It probably evolved
to protect cells

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.230
against the kind of damage
that is inflicted on cells

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.690
in an individual's lifetime.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.970
And if that damage is
sufficiently great,

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.910
the cells are eliminated
or arrest permanently

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.770
so they will not develop
into cancer cells.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:45.250
It's a true tumor suppressor
gene in that case.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.425
OK, so I've told you about
oncogene and tumor suppressor

00:20:49.425 --> 00:20:49.925
genes.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.480
We are now entering an era
over the last couple of years

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:05.280
really, where many,
many more cancer

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.340
genes are being discovered
through the application

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.510
of genomic sequencing in
the context of cancer.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.290
Cancer genomics is all the
rage, including here at MIT,

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.630
for example in the
Broad Institute.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.100
And there are many
papers appearing

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.290
in the literature
like these looking

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.610
at the complexity of the
genome of individual cancers,

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.900
like this study out of the
Broad on prostate cancer,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.200
and this study out of the
Sanger Institute in England

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.150
on small cell lung cancer.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.150
All the genes or
the entire genomes

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.390
of lots of different cancers
are being sequenced and compared

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.330
to the normal DNA of
the same individual

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.790
to catalog all of
the mutations that

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.970
are present within
an individual tumor.

00:21:53.014 --> 00:21:54.430
And although there
are differences

00:21:54.430 --> 00:22:05.440
depending on the cancer type,
the average cancer genome

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:14.520
actually has 100's and sometimes
thousands of mutations.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.430
Small cell lung cancer, for
example, has tens of thousands

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.000
of mutations compared to
normal cells of the lung.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.930
Why?

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.420
Because they arise
following years of exposure

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.790
to cigarette smoke,
which carries

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.900
mutagens that bathe the
DNA in mutation causing

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.910
chemicals leading to mutations.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.440
Now, not all of the mutations
that you find in a cancer cell

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.220
are relevant to the
cancer phenotype.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.870
In fact, we think
that there's only

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.750
amongst all those mutations
that are found that there's

00:22:53.750 --> 00:23:06.340
only about 5 to 20 or so
mutations in oncogenes or tumor

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.250
suppressor genes.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.790
And we call these
mutations driver mutations.

00:23:17.374 --> 00:23:19.040
Driver mutations,
meaning, they actually

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.980
are participating in the
development of the tumor,

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.726
causing some aspect of
the cancer phenotype.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.030
And the remainder, we
call passenger mutations.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.070
Silent mutations-- mutations
that actually don't do anything

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.540
to the cancer
cell, but they just

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.450
happened to occur
at the same time,

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.120
or in the lifetime
of the cancer cell

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.140
when another important
mutation took place.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.190
So that clone of
cells that develops

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.950
carries those mutations too,
but they're not actually

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.990
contributing to the
cancer phenotype.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.240
So among the hundreds and
thousands of mutations,

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.730
some of them really
matter, and some of them

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.670
are just going
along for the ride.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.980
It makes the analysis
of the cancer genome

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.930
much more complicated,
actually, because it's

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.210
hard to tell what's a
passenger, and what's a driver.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:19.770
But increasingly recognizing
what are the important ones

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.820
and focusing our
attention on them.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.440
OK, that's all I'm going to
tell you about cancer genetics.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.310
And I want to now turn my
attention for the last 25

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.060
minutes-- and I may
run over a little bit,

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.270
so I ask for your patience
if I run over a little bit,

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.160
because I do want
to finish this--

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.190
to talk about cancer therapy.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:43.250
Before I make the switch
to cancer therapy,

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.480
I want to first introduce the
concept of cancer prevention.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.790
A lot of us work on cancer
genes and cancer genetics

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.004
to understand how to
treat cancer better.

00:25:00.004 --> 00:25:01.420
But in the future,
hopefully we'll

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.790
have many fewer
cancers to treat,

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.690
because we'll be
able to prevent them.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.540
If people would
stop smoking, we'd

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.290
have 80% fewer lung
cancers to treat.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.270
If you use sunblock and
stay out of the sun,

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.930
we'll have fewer skin cancers
to treat and so forth.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.540
Better diet and excess
exercise will prevent a lot

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.094
of other types of cancers.

00:25:21.094 --> 00:25:22.510
So there are
lifestyle things that

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.960
can lower the number of cancers
in the context of cancer

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.520
prevention.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.380
There's also ways to prevent
agents from producing cancer

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.430
in your body.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.790
And the best example
of that is Gardasil.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.360
Gardasil is an example of
cancer prevention involving

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.335
a particular virus--

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.630
human papillomavirus--
and specifically,

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.450
human papillomaviruses, which
are described as the high risk

00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:58.950
type.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:08.010
Human papillomaviruses or
HPV of the high risk type

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.500
can cause cervical cancer.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.830
They are the main reason that
women develop cervical cancer.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.930
And they're responsible
for other types of cancers

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.230
as well, including in men.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:29.060
And what we know is that in
a normal cell of the cervix,

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.020
when infected by the
human papilloma virus,

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:41.040
will at some frequency,
and after a period of time,

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.850
develop into cervical cancer.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:52.190
This suggests that the virus--

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.660
some genes of the virus--

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:00.120
are changing the cells
behavior in such a way

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.500
that it develops into cancer.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.315
Yes?

00:27:03.315 --> 00:27:05.790
AUDIENCE: I don't
know if you're talking

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.275
about our class
or something else,

00:27:07.275 --> 00:27:09.255
but it's very rude to talk.

00:27:09.255 --> 00:27:12.340
It makes so much noise
during the lecture.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.215
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.620
So something in the virus
is causing the cells

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.470
to divide abnormally
into a tumor.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.140
And this has been
studied at length.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.590
And we now know that
there are two genes, which

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:33.330
are responsible for causing
cervical cells to become cancer

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.560
cells--

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.610
two genes of the virus
called E6 and E7.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.640
And it's been learned
that these genes in fact

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.810
encode proteins that inhibit
cellular proteins that we're

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.310
actually quite familiar with.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.180
And we now believe we understand
why the virus causes cancer.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.150
E6 inhibits P53.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:59.200
And E7 inhibits RB.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.400
So the virus for its own
reasons of viral replication,

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.830
takes out these two
tumor suppressor genes.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.907
And as such, the cells
are lacking these two

00:28:09.907 --> 00:28:11.740
critical tumor suppressor
genes, and they're

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.720
well on their way to becoming
uncontrolled cancer cells.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.350
OK, so that's how HPV high
risk types cause cancer.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:32.020
And what was developed in the
context of Gardasil is an HPV

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:41.890
vaccine so that individuals
cannot be infected productively

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:50.450
with this class of viruses,
specifically it's a component

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:55.610
vaccine made of recombinant
proteins that are present

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.730
in the high risk types of HPV.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:04.240
As a component
vaccine, this vaccine

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.210
does not produce a
replicating virus.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.580
It's just pieces of the virus.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.830
So there's no risk of
a viral infection here.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.890
But an potent
antibody response can

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.460
be elicited, including
neutralizing antibodies that

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.320
will prevent an
individual from being

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.670
infected by the real
thing at a future time.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.800
OK, so that's an example
of cancer prevention,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.980
eliminating an ideological
agent that is responsible.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.820
There aren't many examples of
virus caused cancers in humans.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.160
So this is kind
of a special case.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.470
But HBV-- hepatitis B
virus induced liver cancer

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:52.780
will be another one
before too long.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.092
OK, so now let's talk
about cancer therapy.

00:29:57.092 --> 00:29:58.800
I'm going to talk to
you in a few minutes

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.500
about some new
cancer therapies that

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.380
are based on our
improved knowledge

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.810
of the genes in cancer cells.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:11.430
I'm going to tell you more
about anti HER-2 antibodies.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.710
I'm going to talk to you
more about a small molecule

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.690
inhibitor of this kinase.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.460
There are actually
many theorems that

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:22.705
are based on mutations that
we know occur in cancer cells.

00:30:22.705 --> 00:30:24.330
There are processes
that I've mentioned

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.450
to you, like angiogenesis,
the recruitment of new blood

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.750
vessels.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.990
These two have led to
new therapies for cancer

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:35.390
to block that process and
inhibit cancer development.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.180
In the case of tumor
suppressor genes,

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.570
individuals are trying
to develop gene therapy

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.260
to put the genes back.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.770
If the gene is lost
in a cancer cell,

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.710
perhaps you can restore its
function by gene therapy,

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.002
and normalize the growth
of the cancer cells.

00:30:51.002 --> 00:30:52.460
And although I
won't talk about it,

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.590
there's a lot of promise for
immunitherapy for cancer.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.930
Cancer cells acquire
a lot of mutations.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:01.450
As such, they produce
a lot of antigens.

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:02.950
In theory, your
immune system should

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:07.390
recognize those as foreign
and eliminate the cancer.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.787
But in general, the cancer
wins, the immune system fails.

00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:13.870
And we think that there's
ways the cancer actually

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.870
inhibits the immune system
from functioning properly.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.430
But that's being
figured out now,

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:22.310
so it's possible that we'll
be able to develop new cancer

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.850
therapeutics based
on the immune system.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.830
All right, but before I get
into the cool new stuff,

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.680
let me tell you just a little
bit about cancer therapy

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.835
more generally--

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.740
what we would consider to be
conventional cancer therapy.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.339
The most effective form of
cancer therapy is surgery.

00:31:57.339 --> 00:31:59.630
If you can get to the tumor
early before it has spread,

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.775
you cut it out, the
person is generally cured.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.630
Another very effective
form of cancer therapy

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.260
is radiation therapy.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.470
And this is good because
you can focus the radiation

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.360
beam directly on
the cancer cells

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.600
and eliminate them by causing
a lot of damage to those cells.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.300
And the third is chemotherapy.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.740
And chemotherapy
is used when you

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.810
think that the
cancer has spread,

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:29.570
so radiation can't work because
the cancer cells are somewhere

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:30.470
else--

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.170
and you need a drug that can
diffuse throughout the body

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:34.940
and hopefully kill
the cancer cells.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:43.990
Radiation and many
chemotherapies

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:45.670
act in the same general way.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.290
Adriamycin, which you
will have heard of,

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.050
cisplatin, which you
will have heard of--

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.710
these are well used
cancer therapeutics--

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:09.470
and many more function by
inducing in the cancer cell DNA

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.510
damage.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.370
And the damage can be
sufficiently severe

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.230
that the cell will die.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:19.320
And these therapies
can be effective.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.560
There's another
class of cancer drugs

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:34.490
for which Taxol
is the best known,

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.930
which are described
as mitosis inhibitors.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.770
These drugs actually bind
to microtubules, block

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.860
the formation of the
microtubular spindle,

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.400
and that way prevent
cells from dividing.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.470
And since cancer
cells divide a lot

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.120
and you want to
inhibit their division,

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.482
these drugs are used
and can be effective.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.580
In fact, they're used because
they were tested and shown

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:06.440
to be effective first in
cell-based studies, where one

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:13.730
looks at the growth or survival
of cells in a Petri dish,

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.010
scoring the number of cells
or the percentage of cells

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.440
that are alive at
any given time,

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:26.480
or in any given dose of drug
when the concentration of drug

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.790
is increasing in
this experiment.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:39.699
What we find is that for
certain normal cells,

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.949
they will survive to a
certain concentration of drug

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:44.489
and then start to die off.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:54.659
And for certain cancer
cells, the concentration

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.850
required to kill them is lower.

00:35:01.932 --> 00:35:04.140
And this difference is called
the therapeutic window.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.060
In theory, this looks
good, because it suggests

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.790
that the cancer cells are
more sensitive to the drug

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:16.230
than are normal cells.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.390
And that's why some
cancer therapeutics

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.712
work for some cancers.

00:35:20.712 --> 00:35:21.670
But there are problems.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:43.230
Some normal cells in your body,
unlike these normal cells,

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.870
are very sensitive to the
drug at low concentrations--

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.300
the DNA damaging
agents, for example.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.710
This results in side effects.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.930
And I suspect you are all
familiar with the side

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.060
effects of cancer chemotherapy.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.830
Your hair falls out.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.570
You get nauseous.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.070
You get anemic.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.950
This is because cells
in your hair follicles,

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:12.100
or your intestines,
or your blood system

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.430
are dying at low
concentrations of the drug.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.980
They're actually
dying by apoptosis.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.940
They're actually dying by
P53 dependent apoptosis.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.720
So that's why cancer drugs
cause many bad side effects,

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.880
because some cells in your
body are very sensitive

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.000
and will kill themselves in
response to low concentrations

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:31.500
of the drug.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:46.570
The second problem is that some,
in fact not a small percentage,

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.490
are very resistant to the
concentrations of the drug--

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.850
even high concentrations
of the drug.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:37:05.950
And one reason for that
is that many cancer cells

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:08.350
are lacking P53.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:11.800
I told you that P53 is
mutated in about 50% or more

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.570
of human cancers.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.840
I also told you that P53 was
required for cells to respond

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.600
to DNA damage and die.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.030
And these cells
lack that protein.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.550
And therefore, are very
resistant to dying.

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:26.770
So many therapeutics
don't work, because

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.570
this important
machinery is lacking.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.290
So we have problems
with standard therapies

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.630
based on both kinds of issues.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.090
So the goal then,
is to find drugs

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.640
that don't cause these
kinds of side effects

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.570
and can work even in a P53
deficient cell, which leads us

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:48.370
to developing new
types of therapy.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:52.020
OK, so I want to introduce
you specifically to two.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.650
And they are probably the best
known and highly effective

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:58.470
actually, great examples
of molecularly targeted

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.720
anti-cancer agents.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.140
The first is in the
context of breast cancer.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.780
And the gene in question
here is a gene called HER-2.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.010
In a normal breast cell,
there are two copies

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:23.950
of this HER-2 gene, as there are
in virtually all of your cells.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:26.710
And those produce
amounts of RNA that

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:29.920
produce amounts of
protein that lead

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.450
to the decoration on the
surface of these cells--

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:38.300
the certain number
of receptor molecules

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.870
called HER-2, which are a
growth factor receptors.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.850
They bind to specific
growth factors.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:51.080
And when they are engaged
with their growth factors,

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.150
they send a signal
into the cell.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.341
And the product of that signal
is for the cell to proliferate.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.740
And this is necessary in normal
development and in other times.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:07.780
So this is normal regulation,
normal signaling in response

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.280
to a growth factor in the
normal levels of a growth factor

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:10.780
receptor.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:35.670
30% of breast cancers
carry a mutation

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:41.770
that results in amplification
of the HER-2 gene.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.600
So we don't have two copies
anymore, we've got 10, or 20,

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.830
or 50, or 100 amplification.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:57.010
This is a mechanism by which
all good genes get activated.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:01.600
Too many genes,
too many proteins.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.510
This cell now has way too
much of that growth factor

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.850
receptor on its surface.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.910
And in the presence of the same
concentration of the growth

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:14.410
factor itself, we get a
much stronger signal--

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.960
much higher levels
of proliferation.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.510
This also affects the ability
of the cells to survive.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:37.050
It keeps them alive at times
when they shouldn't be.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.230
Too much proliferation,
too much survival.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.590
Given this situation,
a logical therapeutic

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.980
would be something that blocks
the function of this growth

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.850
factor receptor.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:51.660
And what a company called
Genentech discovered

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.240
was that they could
make an antibody.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.730
An anti-HER-2 antibody.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:06.660
And that led to a
drug called Herceptin,

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.150
which binds to the
growth factor receptor

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.640
and prevents it
from functioning.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.580
And in women who have this
alteration, and only in them,

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.650
the drug is actually
highly effective.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.660
In the metastatic
setting, it will

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.180
lead to multiple
additional years of life.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.970
But it is actually not
curative in that setting.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.850
Recently, individuals
are being typed

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.340
for this mutation at a much
earlier stage in their disease

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.510
course.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:35.640
And when women are
given the drug then,

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.950
it's leading to some cures.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:39.630
So this is a
targeted agent which

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:43.800
is highly effective in the
context of a specific mutation.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.720
And actually only then--
other breast cancer

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.814
patients given the same drug
have no benefit whatsoever.

00:41:52.701 --> 00:41:53.950
So this is what it looks like.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.971
This is actually
the drug package.

00:41:55.971 --> 00:41:57.720
And this is what I
just described to you--

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.580
normal cells, cancer cells,
Herceptin antibody binding to

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.570
and blocking the function of
this abnormal number of growth

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:09.540
factor receptors.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:14.550
OK, let me now turn to the
second classic example.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.350
And this comes in the context
of chronic myelogenous

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:23.250
leukemia, which is a
leukemia-- a blood cell tumor.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.700
It's a particular type of blood
cell-- the myeloid lineage

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.470
type of white blood cell.

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:32.500
You can diagnose this disease
by looking at blood smears

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.600
and you can see that
this is the normal blood

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.370
smear with a single of
these myeloid cells.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.010
And here is a cancer
situation where

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:43.640
we've got too many of these
white blood cells circulating.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.880
This is a disease that's been
studied for a very long time.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.140
And it's been discovered
that in the vast majority

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:56.960
of this type of cancer, there is
a specific chromosomal event--

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:02.600
a specific mutation caused by
a particular translocation.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:08.220
And that translocation
was actually

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.676
identified a long time ago
in the city of Philadelphia.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.750
And as such, it's called
the Philadelphia chromosome.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:21.390
It's the product of a
specific translocation--

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:33.600
chromosome 9, which
has a gene on it

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.550
called ABL, which
encodes a protein that

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:42.345
is a kinase involved in
phosphoralating other proteins.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:50.570
And chromosome 22, which has
another gene called BCR--

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:58.210
chromosome break
events occur here.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:00.970
Chromosome break
events occur here.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:07.750
And a translocation
results, which

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:09.580
produces a new chromosome--

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:20.730
the Philadelphia chromosome,
which has the BCR gene and ABL

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:23.820
gene inappropriately
fused to each other.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:36.635
This produces a fusion gene,
which encodes a fusion protein.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.210
And that fusion protein
is referred to as BCR ABL.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.070
And it was discovered
that the BCR ABL form

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.143
had increased kinase activity.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.990
And this resulted in
increased proliferation

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:10.240
within the cells that
carried that translocation.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:20.360
And so the question was, could
one develop an inhibitor?

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.900
An inhibitor that
blocked the kinase?

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.670
And this resulted
in the development

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.220
of a drug called Gleevec.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:34.775
Gleevec, which is
highly, highly effective.

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:43.110
This is the idea, here's
the BCR ABL fusion protein.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:47.670
It binds to ATP, which it needs
to transfer the phosphate group

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:52.760
onto a substrate protein
in this signaling cascade.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.910
The idea is that one could
make a small molecule drug that

00:45:55.910 --> 00:46:00.110
could fit into the ATP binding
site very specifically,

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:02.900
and block access of ATP,
therefore shutting off

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:03.930
the kinase.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.930
And if that were possible,
then the cancer cells

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:08.030
would be deprived
of this signal,

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.910
and may stop
proliferating, or even die.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:12.620
That was the idea.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.500
In fact, they were successful
in making a small molecule drug.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.294
And that may surprise
you, because you

00:46:17.294 --> 00:46:19.460
might think there are a lot
of kinases in this cell.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:21.200
They all bind to ATP.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.980
How could you ever find one that
was specific to this kinase?

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.390
But in fact, it was possible.

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:29.690
You can make kinase
inhibitors, because not all

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.759
the ATP binding
pockets look the same.

00:46:32.759 --> 00:46:34.550
And you can therefore
get some specificity.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.560
And when this drug
was used in patients,

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.908
it showed remarkable activity.

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.350
If we looked at white
blood cell number,

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.720
normal individuals would
have a certain low level.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.250
And in case of CML, the
level would be high.

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:08.970
And actually, it
goes higher still

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:14.430
as the disease progresses
through a phase called

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.930
blast crisis, where additional
alterations take place

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:21.610
and the cells begin to
divide even more abnormally.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:25.590
In this context, however,
if you give the drug

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:31.390
Gleevec, in the vast
majority of patients,

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.820
the numbers drop precipitously.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.920
And the drug is extremely well
tolerated-- has almost no side

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.420
effects.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.780
The patients take the pill
with their orange juice

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.590
in the morning every day,
keeping their cancer cells

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.800
at bay, leading to what is
called clinical remission.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.270
Clinical remission-- the
disease has gone into remission.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.030
And it can stay in remission
for a very long time.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.580
And it's sometimes curative.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.630
But sometimes the
disease cells come back.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:15.660
And this is a phase
we call relapse.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.720
And even though the drug is
present throughout this disease

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.740
course, the tumor cells
are dividing again.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.960
Can anybody tell me why?

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.460
Mutation.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:33.710
The cancer cells have
acquired additional mutations,

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.900
specifically within DCR ABL.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:50.300
If we imagine DCR ABL,
it can bind to Gleevec,

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.360
and be shut off.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.610
At some frequency,
however, mutations

00:48:54.610 --> 00:49:01.430
can occur, which change the
active site in such a way

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:05.180
that Gleevec can no longer bind.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.460
And this is still
an active kinase.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.040
So now the cells
begin to divide again.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:14.810
So the question now is
what can you do about it?

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:18.070
And the answer is, you
can make a new drug.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.410
And this has actually
been done successfully.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:25.930
A new drug that can
bind specifically

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:29.765
to the mutant form
of ABL kinase.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.020
And there's a drug called
SPRYCEL, which is now also

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:42.170
FDA approved for the treatment
of drug resistant forms of CML.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:50.140
So before you run away, this
is what I've just told you,

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.940
here's ABL kinase.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.830
This is where the drug binds.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:55.550
This is the structure
of the drug.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.720
But at some frequency,
mutations occur

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.310
within that ATP binding site.

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:07.980
And different mutations will
do this, as shown down here.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:11.742
And those mutations will
block the access of the drug.

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:13.200
And the good news
is that one could

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.350
make new drugs
that will overcome

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.800
that form of resistance.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.520
So this is a good news,
bad news, good news story.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.440
We'll stop there.

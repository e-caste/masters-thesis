WEBVTT

00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:16.610
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Great.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.277
Really great questions
during the break.

00:00:18.277 --> 00:00:19.160
So appreciate that.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.400
Thanks.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.790
So this morning we
started off with,

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.710
you know, how airplanes fly.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.790
And Phillip talked you
through the aircraft systems

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.250
and what's going on
inside an airplane that's

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.950
helping that airplane function.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.200
This afternoon we're really
going to focus on navigation.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.770
So we're going to talk
about charts and airspace.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.380
And we're going to talk
about the flight environment

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.570
and how you navigate through it.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.510
So let's get started
with charts and airspace.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.420
So aeronautical charts,
they kind of help you

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.940
out with where you're going.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.940
So there are actually a
number of electronic charts.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.610
So there are a
couple of websites.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.460
So skyvector.com
is a great website

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.650
that shows these charts.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.440
There's a search bar so
you can type in an airport,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.130
for example.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.810
And it'll zoom right
in to that chart.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.030
You can also get some apps.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
And I'm going to
pass around my iPad.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.080
There is a program
called Foreflight.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.450
So how many people have
used Foreflight before?

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.120
So just a handful of you.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.080
So there are a lot of
different software.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.350
And Garmin has
great software, too.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.090
I'm not really recommending
any over the other,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
but this just happens
to be on my iPad.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.660
I take this with me
when I go flying.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.340
And so I have the app pulled up.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.180
So you can basically move
around and look at the map.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.700
And then I have a physical map
that I will also pass around.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.160
Which this particular map
is a VFR sectional map.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.250
So VFR is for
visual flight rules,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.070
as opposed to IFR, which
is instrument flight rules.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.789
It will have a whole talk just
on instrument flight rules

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.420
later.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.980
But for now, when
you start flying

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.688
you start with visual
flight rules, which

00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:16.670
means that you can look
outside the airplane,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.040
there are no clouds
obscuring your view.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.870
And so this is a very
giant and unwieldy document

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.730
to have in your plane
while you're flying.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.070
And so this is why I don't
carry this in the plane

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.440
and I instead carry the iPad.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.280
But this sectional, there
are actually different parts

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.940
across the US where
there are very busy areas

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.140
with lots of airports.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.090
And so they have
these sectional maps.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.730
So a section of
the United States.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.400
And you can look at those.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.950
And so I'm going
to pass this around

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.450
as we talk through
the slides, which

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.000
zoom in to various parts of
this for you to take a look at.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.210
OK, so I think the
most important part

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.150
of the sectional
chart is the legend.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.810
And it basically answers
all the questions

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.900
that you're going to get on your
exam about it, which asks you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.970
what all of these
different do-hickies are.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.190
So we'll zoom in to
a particular part.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.660
So this is about an airport.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.960
So there's a lot of
different data contained.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.100
And it can be a little
bit overwhelming.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.750
So when you look at that
chunk of text and data,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.080
you really can just look at
a sectional chart's legend

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.715
to tell you what
all of that means.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.430
So this is the chunk of
text, numbers, and letters

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.230
that you would see
on a sectional chart.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.630
And then over here it
explains what they are.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.620
So you can see
what each thing is.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.610
So ATIS over here, which it's
nicely defined over here,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.350
so you don't have to
memorize anything--

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.320
Automatic Terminal
Information Service,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.590
the ATIS, which is what
provides weather information.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.260
We'll have a whole talk just
about weather information

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.300
and radar comms and
air traffic control.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.370
But you can see here that
there is a frequency, 123.8.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.870
So that's telling
you that in order

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.710
to get the weather information
for that particular airport,

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.170
you'd turn to the
frequency 123.8

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.570
and you can hear
what the weather is.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.510
There's a lot of
other data on here.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.480
So for example, it tells you
some Automated Surface Weather

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.110
or ASOS, 135.42.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.680
So you know that you can
contact that frequency

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.960
if you want to get the
Automated Weather Service.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.823
So a lot of this
data is listed there.

00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:53.240
So we won't go
through everything,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.450
because it is nicely
defined in the legend.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.190
Another area we'll
focus on are just

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.040
what do airports look like.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.790
So over here is the
part of the sectional

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.400
that has Boston Logan Airport.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.090
So you see all these lines
that are outlined in blue.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.780
So if you look
over at the legend,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.000
it describes exactly
what that means.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.320
So having these lines outlined
in blue, hard surfaced

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.160
runways greater than 8,000 feet.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.510
And so it just tells you exactly
what that information is.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.980
And smaller airports
with shorter runways

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.470
have these circles with lines.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.700
And the lines are generally
trying to depict the runway.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.930
And so the line
here will generally

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.807
be aligned with what the
direction of the runway is.

00:05:44.807 --> 00:05:46.640
And when there are two
lines, that generally

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.940
is representing two runways.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.490
So this down here in
the bottom right corner

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.010
is a hand scan of Bedford.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.520
And so you can see the two
crossing runways here depicted

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.020
here.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.000
So continuing along, there
are also abandoned airports.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.590
So the actual airport
has a X on it.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.830
And then you'll also see
this X through the circle

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.320
to represent that it's
an abandoned place.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.293
So it still might be a good
option if there's an emergency

00:06:22.293 --> 00:06:24.210
and you're really looking
for a place to land.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.280
But it's not a good idea
if you have the ability

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.590
to get to a functioning
open airport where

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.970
you know the runways clear.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.760
Other information that is
provided in these charts

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.910
and sectionals are whether
or not fuel is available

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.700
and what are the operating
times of the tower.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.610
Because all that information
changes very frequently,

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.920
those sectional charts
have to be updated.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.200
So that particular sectional
that I'm passing around

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.190
is out of date.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.180
They get out of
date very quickly.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.170
For Foreflight, you can
constantly download new maps.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.660
So before you fly, you
kind of download everything

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.510
and it refreshes, and then
you have it good to go.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.860
Another thing that a sectional
chart is really good for

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.410
is identifying obstacles.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.390
So these are the kind of
descriptions of a tower,

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:21.220
for example, or more than
one a group of obstructions.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.860
And so it kind of tells you
that there is an obstruction.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.650
So in the bottom
right corner, we

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:32.560
see there's an obstruction right
here with this little triangle.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.430
And then it has two numbers.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.220
So it has 796.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.190
And then it has (335).

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.010
Now, it explains in
words what that means.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.620
So the top number
is the elevation

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.490
above the mean sea level.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.690
And then the one in parentheses
is the height above ground.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.080
Now, the way I like to remember
it, it's a little bit morbid,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.580
but it really helps
you remember it,

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:01.240
is the number on top
is the altitude that

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.240
will be indicated
on your altimeter

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.513
if you hit the top
of the obstacle.

00:08:06.513 --> 00:08:07.930
And then the number
in parentheses

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.250
is how far you will
fall to hit the ground.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.170
So that's a good
way of remembering

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.500
what those two numbers are
and what's the difference.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.020
So any questions
about sectional charts

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.440
before I move on to airspace?

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.986
Yes?

00:08:24.986 --> 00:08:26.486
AUDIENCE: On the
previous slide, you

00:08:26.486 --> 00:08:28.382
were talking about
the blue outline.

00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:30.282
But then there
was a red outline.

00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:31.990
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yes,
so the question was

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.700
about blue versus red outlines.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.450
That's in fact answered directly
by different types of airspace.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.770
So it's a great transition.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.880
So I'll move straight into that.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.020
So there are different
types of airspace.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.570
And they're labeled
with these letters.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.560
So in aviation
speak, just to make

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.643
sure we're being clear instead
of saying B, we say bravo.

00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:56.185
Because we don't
want to get confused

00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:58.150
did you say B, or C, or D?

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.605
So you say Bravo.

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.480
So we have these different
types of airspace.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.920
So uncontrolled airspace
is Class G or Class Golf.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.770
And then you have the
controlled airspace.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.200
So Class A, Class Bravo,
Class Charlie, et cetera.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.380
And then there's some
special use airspace.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.650
So the short answer is
the different colors

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:22.510
of blue and purple represent
different types of airspace,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.940
as well as different
classes of airspace,

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.580
and can represent whether
you're close to certain types

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.940
of airports.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.140
So the way to think
about airspace--

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.820
now, there's a lot
going on in this map.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.070
I agree with you--
but there are a bunch

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.320
of circles that are going on.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.030
Well, one thing
to keep in mind is

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.810
that each circle is
actually operating

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.110
at a particular elevation.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.450
And so one way to think
about it is that airspace

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.060
is three dimensional
and a lot of people

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.400
think about it as
a wedding cake,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.913
as an upside down wedding cake.

00:09:56.913 --> 00:09:58.330
And the reason
they think about it

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.900
that way is that usually
around a particular airport,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.465
like Boston Logan Airport, there
is restricted airspace, right?

00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:07.090
They don't want you
to just fly through

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.820
because you could interfere
with commercial traffic that's

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.630
landing there.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.120
So they want you to have
certain restrictions when

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.968
you're close to an airport.

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:17.260
So the reason it looks like
an upside down wedding cake

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.160
is that when airplanes are
being sequenced to come in,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.012
they're usually at
pretty high altitudes

00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:24.970
because they've been
flying across the country.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.870
So the restrictions on the
airspace start high up.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:33.850
So you can actually fly
underneath the Class Bravo

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.780
airspace.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.220
So if you're flying
on this side,

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.180
so we show kind of
to the left, you

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.000
can be underneath the
Class Bravo airspace.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.520
And the restricted
space can be above you.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.920
But as you get closer
to the airport,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.990
the restricted airspace
goes all the way down

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.790
to the ground, right,
to the surface.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.512
So it touches the ground
around the airport

00:10:54.512 --> 00:10:56.470
because that's where the
airplanes are landing.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.510
So that's why it's like
a layer of the wedding

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.780
cake that is lower and lower
until it touches the ground.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.018
Does that makes sense?

00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:07.010
Great.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.760
OK, so here's a specific
answer to the question

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.810
you were talking about--

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.435
there are all kinds
of different lines.

00:11:12.435 --> 00:11:13.240
What do they mean?

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.930
So if you see a
solid blue line, that

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.330
represents Class Bravo airspace.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.360
So that's like the airspace
around Boston Logan Airport

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.650
is Class Bravo.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.300
So you'll see a solid blue line.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.840
And the solid magenta line
is Class Charlie airspace,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.510
which is for a usually
slightly less busy airport.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.070
We'll define it in a moment.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.140
But you might have
seen other lines,

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:41.590
which are kind of these big fat
kind of faded lines lower down.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.790
And so that really depends.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:49.560
It usually is denoting some
form of Class E airspace.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.570
And depending on
where it is, it is

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.200
in effect different altitudes.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.100
And we'll dive into those
minimums and descriptions

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.090
in just a moment.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.650
So let's start at the
top at Class A airspace.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.300
So this is very high up.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.710
Pretty much as a private pilot
in a single engine airplane,

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.320
you're never going to
encounter this Class

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.340
A airspace, because it
starts at 18,000 feet.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.570
So it's pretty high up.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.300
So pretty much only big
jets, commercial jets,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.480
fly at that altitude.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.350
In order to fly
into that altitude,

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.270
you actually have to have
your instrument flight rating.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.790
And we're going to have a
whole lecture devoted just

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.350
to instrument flight training.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.910
But really what it
means is that you

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.040
could be flying
through clouds where

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.870
you can't see
outside the airplane

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.000
to avoid other airplanes
and you're just

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.980
relying on your instruments.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.370
It requires also a
lot more precision.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.050
That when you say that
you're at 20,000 feet,

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.430
you have to be at 20,000 feet.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.010
You can't drift
off to 21,000 feet.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.270
You have to stay put.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.120
And the reason is that when
you're flying the instrument,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.000
you're relying on the
air traffic controllers

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.170
to sequence you.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.570
And so they have multiple
airplanes in the same space.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.490
And they're basically
depending that you'll

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.490
be able to hold the
altitude that they

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.340
give you and the heading
that they give you.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.810
And they might put another
airplane relatively

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.310
close to you, but
they know that you

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.590
can both fly very well and
accurately so you're not

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.640
going to hit each other.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.340
So they have all kinds of
airplanes up in the Class Alpha

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.885
or Class A airspace.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.760
In fact, the pro tip is
that most people just

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.610
call it Class A even though
you're supposed to say Alpha.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.770
Phillip talked a little bit
about the altimeter setting

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.740
and how the actual
altimeter setting

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.570
can vary from where you are.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.200
But since you have big jets
that are traveling very quickly

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.410
and they might cross multiple
places with different altimeter

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.890
settings, in Class A
airspace, you actually

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:55.050
have everybody using the exact
same altimeter setting, 29.92.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.610
And that way everybody is
viewing the same altitude

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.300
as the other person
at the same height

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.850
so that everyone can make
sure not to hit each other.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.320
And when anyone is
supposed to be at 18,000,

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.340
they're at the same altitude
as the people around them.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.120
OK, the next is Class Bravo.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.370
This is a lot more
relevant to something

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.235
that you might encounter.

00:14:19.235 --> 00:14:22.250
So over here, it's right
around Boston Logan Airport.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.250
We heard Meenakshi talk
about her time talking

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.880
to JFK at Kennedy Tower
right around New York.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.760
All of the busy airports
have Class Bravo.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.840
So the way to remember
Bravo is Bravo is busiest.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.670
So the busiest airports
are Class Bravo.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.090
You actually have to have an
explicit clearance to enter.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:44.247
Someone has to say you're
cleared through the Bravo.

00:14:44.247 --> 00:14:46.580
If they don't tell you you're
cleared through the Bravo,

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.425
you're not allowed to
enter that airspace.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.060
Even after you get your solo
and you're a student pilot,

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.370
you have to have a
specific endorsement.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.990
Again, endorsement is a
signature by your instructor

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:05.450
that says you're allowed to
enter that particular airspace.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.420
Your aircraft also requires
specific equipment.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.720
And in particular, it
needs a Mode C transponder,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.200
which basically helps to
identify more accurately where

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.190
the aircraft is.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.460
And then we talked about this
upside down wedding cake.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.362
So typically right in the
middle of the wedding cake,

00:15:23.362 --> 00:15:25.320
right around the airport,
it's from the surface

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.940
to 10,000 feet.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.790
But it goes out wider
starting at a higher altitude.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.270
So right here near
Logan Airport,

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.850
for example, there
are parts of it

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.040
where the Class Bravo doesn't
start until 3,000 feet.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.150
So if you fly at 2,500
feet, you can fly right

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.860
underneath the Class Bravo.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.770
You don't have to get
clearance to fly there.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.460
And if you accidentally
fly too high

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.020
and you go through that
3,000 foot barrier,

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.420
it's called busting the Bravo,
and you're in big trouble,

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.170
and don't do that.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.920
OK, so again, Boston Logan
Airport is right in the middle.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.710
And then the rings
going around it

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.330
show the different
rising altitudes.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.350
So how do you know
what the altitude is?

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:13.460
So right in the center,
it has a 70 and then

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.260
a line that says SFC.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.060
So SFC means surface.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.950
So right in the
center of the circle,

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.690
it goes down to the surface.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.630
And then you see now
the number change to 20.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.850
So you can go up to 2,000 feet.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.530
And out here, 30.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.160
So that means if
you're at 3,000 feet,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.130
up to 7,000 feet is
where the restriction is.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.820
Below 3,000 feet, you're OK.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.670
OK, so now is Class Charlie.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.580
So they are also busy airports,
but they're not quite as busy

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.060
as the Class Bravo airports.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.300
So for example, Manchester,
New Hampshire, Providence,

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.100
Rhode Island.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.220
Here you're required to
establish two-way radio

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.140
communication,
where they actually

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.930
know the tail number
of your aircraft.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.610
So every aircraft has a number.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.580
If it's a US aircraft, it
usually has an N or November

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.480
at the beginning.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.410
So you know, November 535,
you know, Alpha Bravo.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.660
And so you actually have to
say what your tail number is.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.690
So in this example,
808 Whiskey Tango.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.540
But if you just say
I'm an aircraft five

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.010
miles to the south, they haven't
identified you in particular.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.970
So that doesn't
count as establishing

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.400
the two-way communication.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.740
But once you have established
two-way communication

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.280
with the controller,
you can enter

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.825
without a specific clearance
to enter the Class Charlie

00:17:34.825 --> 00:17:35.325
airspace.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.330
So here's an example of that.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.900
So we have the
airport in the middle.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.740
And now we have magenta
lines instead of blue lines

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.855
because it's a Class Charlie
airspace instead of Class Bravo

00:17:48.855 --> 00:17:49.355
airspace.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.980
So Class Delta,
one of the airports

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.580
we've been talking about,
Hanscom, also known as Bedford,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.500
is a Class Delta airport.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.580
And so here you have to
establish two-way radio

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.930
communication as well.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.710
It's indicated by
a dashed blue line.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.310
So this is an example
of Worcester airport.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.760
And you can see the dash blue
circle around the airport.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.200
OK, now Class E airspace
is when you start

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.420
getting a little complicated.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.100
So it's not necessarily related
to a particular airport.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.480
And it really applies to just
other controlled airspace

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.650
around.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:46.170
And the reason that
they have this airspace

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.970
is to define certain
weather restrictions.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.960
So how close and far
you can be from clouds,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.060
what the visibility needs
to be in order for you

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.380
to fly in these environments.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.530
So it can be indicated in
a lot of different ways.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.890
It gets very confusing.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.890
So we have both magenta blurry
lines and blue blurry lines.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.870
And the legend, of
course, is your friend.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.460
It defines exactly what it means
and why it's a different color.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.040
And you can see
those throughout.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.790
So sometimes like when we
were flying to Bar Harbor

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.100
as we talked about earlier
along the coastline,

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.400
you might see those restrictions
or around a small airport.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.660
So now let's zoom back
out this big picture.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.490
You might see a
whole bunch of things

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:34.010
going on in the sectionals that
are coming around the room.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.750
It looks very complicated.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.600
But now you kind of know
what the little dots mean.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.670
You also see some yellow.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.870
The yellow indicates
a congested area.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.377
So there might be like
dense population over there.

00:19:48.377 --> 00:19:49.960
So that's relevant,
because you're not

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.150
supposed to fly low
over a congested area.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.370
But it's also helpful
when you're flying around

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.260
to identify where you
are, that, oh, OK, I'm

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.840
over a city versus I'm
over just some fields.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.830
There are also airways on
those sectionals and maps being

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.500
passed around,
which are indicated

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.560
by these kind of blue lines with
an arrow on it with a heading.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.940
So what I mean by heading is
like if it says 132 degrees.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:20.070
And so these airways are places
that sometimes an airplane gets

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.320
told to follow a
particular airway,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.590
might be the fastest way to
get from one place to another.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.140
So here's an example of an
airway on the sectional.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.825
You can see these blue lines
kind of cutting across.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.410
And then another relatively
confusing airspace

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.140
is this Class Gulf airspace.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.690
And it basically is
uncontrolled airspace.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.290
You can do whatever you want.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.018
You might see this
over a desert.

00:20:48.018 --> 00:20:49.810
You won't see any of
this in the Northeast.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.830
There are too many airports
and too many things going on.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.270
But in the middle of the
country or in certain places

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.830
that are not as
populated, you'll

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.780
see this uncontrolled airspace.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.390
And you can do
whatever you want.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.660
So the memory aid here
is Golf means go for it.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.830
So here's the summary.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.800
So Class Bravo is that
upside down wedding cake.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.090
And then you get the Class
Charlie, Class Delta.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:18.770
And then Class E is
kind of everywhere

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.690
that doesn't have
other restrictions.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.700
And then Class Golf
is unrestricted.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.980
Now each of those types
of airspace-- so A, B, C,

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.850
D-- they all have some specific
requirements associated

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.180
with them.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.800
So for example, we
talked about in Class

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.140
A airspace you have to
be instrument rated.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.510
In Class Bravo
airspace, you might

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.520
need to get a
special endorsement

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.250
to be able to fly there.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.870
Then the entry requirements.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.520
So Class Golf is go for it.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.102
You can fly in
Class Golf airspace

00:21:57.102 --> 00:21:58.810
without talking to
anyone about anything.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.770
You just take off and you fly.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.390
Whereas we talked
about, for example,

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.700
Class Bravo where you
need explicit clearance

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.890
to enter the airspace.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:11.050
And then come all of the
visibility or minimums,

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.260
as they talk about.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.540
These are prime candidates
for the FAA exam,

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:20.210
because they're just things
you basically have to remember.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.030
So Class A airspace,
you already have

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.920
to have an instrument
rating, which means,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.540
hey, there can be
instrument conditions,

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.270
which means it can be cloudy,
you could be flying in a cloud.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.888
So there's no specific
visibility requirement.

00:22:32.888 --> 00:22:35.180
There could be zero visibility
and you could be flying.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:42.590
So that's why it says N/A for
all of the Class A visibility.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.340
But on the other ones, there
are some more restrictions.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:51.740
And so for example, when
you're in Class Bravo airspace,

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.320
you have to remain
clear of clouds.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.520
The reason that they don't have
more stringent restriction,

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.543
you know, that you have to be
1,000 miles away from a cloud

00:23:01.543 --> 00:23:02.960
is because they're
really watching

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.300
everybody in that airspace
and moving them around.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.640
So they can generally
make sure that there

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.380
isn't an airplane
in a cloud that's

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.090
about to pop out and hit you.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.160
You're already aware of
all the other aircraft.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.562
Whereas when you
have less control

00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:18.020
and they're not air traffic
controllers necessarily talking

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.570
to everyone, they
want to make you

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.220
stay farther away from a cloud.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.530
Because if you're in a cloud,
if you're near a cloud,

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.060
you may not see
an aircraft that's

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.800
on the other side of the cloud.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.290
And then you could
have a collision.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:35.070
So there's also a fair amount
of special use airspace.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.820
So there's restricted areas.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.320
Oh, yes.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.695
Go ahead?

00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:43.422
AUDIENCE: How do you know how
far away you are from a cloud?

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.130
TINA SRIVASTAVA: That's
a great question,

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.005
how do you know how far
you are from a cloud?

00:23:47.005 --> 00:23:48.710
There's no good way to know.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.460
You're just supposed
to guesstimate really

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.000
by looking outside the window
and looking at the cloud.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.920
If you're near an
airport, then you

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.350
might know what the
runway length is.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.380
So you can use that to
kind of gauge distances.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.020
But there isn't a
hard and fast rule

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.420
of knowing how far
you are from a cloud.

00:24:09.228 --> 00:24:11.560
AUDIENCE: What do you mean?

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.810
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Well, clear
of clouds is really easy.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.633
You just don't go in the cloud.

00:24:16.633 --> 00:24:18.300
I would say there is
not a very good way

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.480
of knowing whether you're
1,000 feet or 2,000 feet away

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.410
from a cloud.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.660
In general, I use
those as guidance

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.603
that, OK, I should
basically stay as far away

00:24:26.603 --> 00:24:27.770
from the clouds as possible.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.768
So if there's a cloud near
me, I'll turn off course.

00:24:30.768 --> 00:24:32.310
Whereas if it's just
clear of clouds,

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.800
I'm willing to come right
underneath that cloud.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.530
Good question.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.950
OK, so restricted area.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.130
So some restricted
areas, restricted areas

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.400
are either hot or on, or they're
cold and they're not active.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.170
So you only have to avoid a
restricted area if it's hot.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.420
So if you're already in
communication with air traffic

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.600
control, you could just ask them
if a particular restricted area

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.020
is active or not.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.710
There are also some
prohibited areas,

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.560
like over president's houses.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.800
And then there are temporary
flight restrictions, or TFRs.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.010
And they can be
very complicated.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.960
We'll talk about a
couple in particular.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.123
So around the stadium, you're
not supposed to fly there.

00:25:17.123 --> 00:25:18.790
Around Disney World,
you're not supposed

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.190
to fly low over Disney World.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:25.090
And sometimes if the president
is traveling somewhere,

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.350
there will be a temporary
flight restriction.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.980
And it might not tell you
that it's the president.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.320
It might just say a
VIP is in the areas.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.797
So you're not allowed to fly.

00:25:35.797 --> 00:25:37.630
And then there's certain
areas that you just

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:41.020
have to proceed with caution,
but you're allowed to enter.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.020
So alert areas, military
operation areas,

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.460
and other warning areas.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.530
You just want to
be especially alert

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.060
when you're in those spaces.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.400
And then, again, you have
a whole bunch more blue

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.060
and magenta lines that mean
different things that basically

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.310
describe all of the different
types of environments

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.390
that we talked about.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.140
So I think the one you're
most likely to encounter

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.110
is this one that's very
close to Minuteman Airport.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.520
So this is really
just west of Hanscom.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.990
There's a small area there.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.080
It's not usually active.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.490
But if it is, it's one that
you want to keep an eye out.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.523
And then we talked about TFRs--

00:26:18.523 --> 00:26:19.940
the Temporary
Flight Restrictions.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.440
There are some that
are unpublished.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.100
So over stadiums or
over football games,

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.410
sometimes you won't see
those published in advance.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.230
But in general, it's a
good idea to be aware

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:35.370
when you're going over a stadium
not to be too low over it.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.620
There are a lot of different
resources to dive in.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.210
We already talked
about Sky Vector.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.312
There are a bunch of
different options here.

00:26:42.312 --> 00:26:43.770
And we're seeing
that going around.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.196
Just so I can see where
it is, who has the iPad?

00:26:47.196 --> 00:26:49.030
Oh, that made its
way pretty far.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.970
And then the sectional
I see over there.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.040
So we'll keep it passing
around all afternoon.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.560
So just a couple
practice questions

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.600
to keep us on our toes, which
statement about longitude

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.030
and latitude is true?

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.950
OK, so A, B, or C. Shout it out.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:33.180
B. All right, that's correct.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.700
One rule I have, a
thumb, that helps

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.460
me is that you think of
longitude versus latitude,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.360
which one goes in
which direction,

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.820
latitude is horizontal.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.740
And I think of
latitude, it sounds

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.056
like "fatitude" or being fat.

00:27:49.056 --> 00:27:52.710
And so your horizontal.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.450
So anyway, longitude
are the vertical lines.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.020
So they cross the
equator at right angles.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.180
So I'll leave this to
somebody that has a sectional

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.750
or has seen the sectional.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.110
Let's see if you can answer
this question referring

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.150
to one of those legends.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:15.280
AUDIENCE: So another one for
latitude is a bunch of ladders.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.620
It sounds like a ladder.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.037
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Oh, that's great.

00:28:18.037 --> 00:28:19.690
So in the back, we
got know another way

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.040
of remembering latitude.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.750
So you said latitude
sounds like a ladder.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.425
So it looks like
steps of a ladder.

00:28:25.425 --> 00:28:26.800
So that's why
they're horizontal.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.340
That's a great idea.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.190
Thanks.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.204
AUDIENCE: Also, longitude
goes the long way around.

00:28:32.204 --> 00:28:35.480
Latitude, at the
poles, is shorter.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.330
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah, so
that was that longitude

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.280
goes the long way around.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.000
Where as latitude, sometimes,
especially at the poles,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.890
is shorter.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:47.860
Very good ones.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:48.360
Thanks.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:04.110
So I'll ask, I guess,
the 30 or 40 or so

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:08.010
of you who have already
seen the sectional,

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.810
to be the ones to
guess this one.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.248
So A, B, or C?

00:29:13.248 --> 00:29:15.330
C. All right, good job.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.080
Very good.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.980
So these, if you take a look
at the legend on those maps,

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.660
for the rest of you,
as it comes around,

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.720
it should be more clear.

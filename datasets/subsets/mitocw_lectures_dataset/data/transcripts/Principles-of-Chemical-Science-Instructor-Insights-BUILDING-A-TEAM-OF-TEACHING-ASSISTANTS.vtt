CATHERINE DRENNAN: One
of the big challenges

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.920
of a large lecture is having the
graduate student TAs be really

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.270
an integral part of this.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.350
And I think if the grad
students TAs are not

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.710
that excited about this teaching
assignment, it's not so good.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.900
You want to have this sense
of enthusiasm and energy.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.210
So one of the problems
I had when I was first

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.230
starting with this is that
this TA assignment was not

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.240
the most popular.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.430
So when the grad students are
coming in in their first year,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.220
there are organic
chemistry grad students

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.430
and they want to teach
organic chemistry.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.220
And there are physical
chemistry students

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.310
who want to teach
thermo and kinetics.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.680
Biochem students want
to teach biochemistry,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260
and inorganic
chemistry students want

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.468
to teach inorganic chemistry.

00:00:49.468 --> 00:00:51.500
So who is there for
general chemistry?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.740
And so often, it would be
the booby prize assignment

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.190
to get stuck in that class,
and there might be a feeling

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.580
like, oh, I got stuck because
I wasn't the organic chemistry

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.000
professor's first choice.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.720
So I wanted to change
all that because to me,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.160
teaching freshmen in
freshman chemistry

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.640
is the most fun teaching ever.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.640
So I knew there
were grad students

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.034
out there that could engage
and agree with me that this

00:01:14.034 --> 00:01:15.200
is going to be a lot of fun.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.060
I admit, it's more work than
all of those other courses,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.712
but it also can be more fun.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.920
So I thought, we just need
to get the right people in

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.650
and I need to educate
them about what

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.370
this experience can be like.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.730
So I decided to once the
students were accepted

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.970
to come into MIT, I would
send them an information

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.050
packet about how they could be
part of this exciting teaching

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.610
opportunity, and I made
it glossy and pretty

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.890
and sent it to them
and asked them to apply

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.700
to be part of the class.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.830
And so we got some
wonderful applications.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.330
I got a great group of people
to be part of this class.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.660
So instead of being like,
oh no, I have to do this,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.740
they're like, yes,
freshman chemistry.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.380
And we brought them in early,
and I got to know the group.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.410
We had extra TA training
in the beginning.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.770
And t-shirts, and by
the time we started,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.940
everyone knew each other.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.530
And it was an opportunity,
also, for the TAs

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.199
to make friends because they're
first year graduate students

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.840
and so they get to know other
first year grad students

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.760
and they build a
sense of team as well.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.800
So for many years now when
we've been really doing this--

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.420
having this extra TA training
and applications to be part

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.670
of the class-- we've
started the semester

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.970
with a group of people
who are just ready to go

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.340
and really excited about
being part of that.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.390
And I think that has had such a
wonderful impact on the course

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.590
as well.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.200
They see this
whole teaching team

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.040
that really want
to be there and are

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.080
excited about this opportunity
and care about each

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.434
and every one of those students.

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:44.100
And the comments that
I've gotten later,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.950
both from the students and
also sometimes from parents,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.030
that their child in
their freshman year

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.290
really felt a connection
as part of this class

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.650
and had this TA just
checking in on them, not

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.840
just about this class, but about
how they were doing overall.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.870
And it was a support
system that went

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.520
beyond the teaching
of chemistry, which

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.980
made me really very happy.

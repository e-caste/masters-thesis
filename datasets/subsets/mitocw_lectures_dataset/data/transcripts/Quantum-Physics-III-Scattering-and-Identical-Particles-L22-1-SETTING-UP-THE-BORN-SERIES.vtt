00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.840
PROFESSOR: We are going to
recap some of the last results

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.130
we had on scattering and
then push them to the end

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.490
and complete our discussion
of this integral equation

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.960
and how we approximate
scattering with it.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.830
It's a pretty powerful method
of thinking about scattering

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.490
and gives you a
direct solution, which

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.680
is in a sense more intuitive
perhaps than when you're

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.360
dealing with partial waves.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.960
So let's see where
we were last time.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.030
So we set up our solution
of the Schrodinger equation

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.340
in a funny way.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.190
We had an incoming
wave plus a term that

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.290
still had an integral over
all of space of our Green's

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:13.400
function integrated
against a scaled version

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.120
of the potential.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.240
Remember that v
was defined to be

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.520
equal to the potential up
to some constants, h bar

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.750
squared over m.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.950
And we had this
integral equation

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.360
where one could show
that phi satisfies

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.080
the correct
Schrodinger equation.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.070
Now this function G plus
was our Green function

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.870
that we also discussed.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.640
And it was given by
the following formula.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.910
It just depends on the magnitude
of this vector argument

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.620
of the Green's
function, so 1 over 4 pi

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.100
e to the ik, magnitude
of that divided

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.560
by magnitude of that vector.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.730
So in most applications, we
look at the wave function.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.330
This should be phi of r.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.550
We look at the wave
function far away.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.800
And if the potential
is localized,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.730
this integral, since it
involves the potential,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.630
can only be non-zero, have
non-zero contributions

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.800
to the integral on the region
where the potential exists.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.550
So r prime, whenever
you're doing this integral,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.300
must be small compared to r.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.670
This we can draw here.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.610
So assume we have a potential.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.680
And you have an
observation point, r.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.580
We'll call the unit vector
in this direction n.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.430
This is the vector r.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.100
And an integration point
is a point, r prime here.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.710
And there is this
distance, this vector,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.930
in between r minus r prime.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.510
And finally, on this graph,
we could also have a direction

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.450
that we could call the
incident direction, perhaps

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.210
the z-direction.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.530
And that's the direction
which your wave is incident.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.190
This is the wave that
were represented here.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.060
So we did a little approximation
of this Green's function

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.930
for the case where r
prime where you're looking

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.570
is much smaller than r.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.690
In that case, the
distance, r minus r prime,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.920
is approximately
equal to r minus--

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.710
so that's the
distance, the vectors.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.230
When you don't put an
arrow, we mean the distance.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.575
So this is r minus
n dot r prime.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.870
To 0-th approximation, this
is the most important term.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.100
To next approximation
comes this term

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.060
because that term is
suppressed with respect

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.270
to the original term by a
factor of r prime over r.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.260
So if you factored, for
example, the r here,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.760
you would say 1 minus
n r prime over r.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.920
So you see that
this ratio enters

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.930
here, which says that the second
term is smaller by this factor.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.550
We could even include
more terms here.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.150
But those would not
be relevant unless k

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.220
is extremely high energy.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.260
So when k is very large,
it would make a difference.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.990
But it has to be
extremely large.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.990
And in general,
this approximation

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.930
isn't enough for any k
for sufficiently far away.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.780
So this is really good enough.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.080
And the approximation is
done on the Green's function

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.970
at two levels.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:02.360
You need to be mildly accurate
with respect to this quantity.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.770
But you need to be more accurate
with respect to this phase

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.890
because the phase can
change rather fast depending

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.240
on the wavelength of the object.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.800
So if you make an error in
the total distance of 1%,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.900
that's not big deal.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.850
But if you make an
error here, such that k

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.480
dot times this distance
is comparable to 1,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.340
the phase could
be totally wrong.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.490
So the phase is always
a more delicate thing.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.610
And therefore, with
this approximation,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:51.080
your G plus of r minus r prime
becomes minus 1 over 4 pi e

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.950
to the ikr over r.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:01.880
So we replace this
term by just r.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.130
And in this exponent,
the absolute value

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.720
is replaced by two terms.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.830
The first one is e
to the ikr, is here.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:20.290
The second one is e to
the minus ikn dot r prime.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:35.360
We also have here
the incident vector.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:49.130
You can write e to the ikz
as e to the ik incident

00:07:49.130 --> 00:08:01.770
dotted with r if k incident
is a vector, k, times the unit

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.690
vector in the z-direction.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.090
So that's a matter
of just notation.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.740
Might as well use a
vector for k incident

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.000
because that is
really the vector

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.950
momentum that is coming in.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.700
And it's sometimes useful to
have the flexibility, perhaps

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.780
some moment.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.910
You don't necessarily
want the wave

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.410
to come in the z-direction.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.610
There's another vector that
is kind of interesting.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.919
You're observing the wave in
the direction of the vector

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.610
r, the direction of
the unit vector n.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.560
So it's interesting
to call k an incident.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:58.410
I think people write it with
just i, so ki for incident, k.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.220
And then, well, we're
looking at the direction r.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.400
So we call the
scattering momentum

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.280
or the scattered momentum, kn.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.770
You're looking at that distance.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.470
So might as well
call it that way.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:23.080
So with these things,
we can rewrite

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.980
the top equation making
use of all the things

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.850
that we've learned.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.300
And it's going to be an
important equation, psi of r

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.630
is equal to e to the iki dot r.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.380
So we have to replace
the e to the ikz by this.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.160
Then we have the
Green's function

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.650
that has to be integrated.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.740
And you have to see,
we've decided already

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.660
to approximate the
Green's function.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.660
So it's integral over r prime.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.470
So the only term here that has
an r prime is this exponential.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.660
So all of this can go out.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.940
So the way I want to make it go
out, we will have the minus 1

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:10.510
over 4 pi here and the
integral d cubed r prime.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:16.390
And I'm going to have the rest
of the Green's function placed

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:21.910
in the standard position
we've used for scattering.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:27.450
So we're still redoing the
top integral, the G plus,

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.490
which includes some of G plus.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.780
We've taken care of
all of this part.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.900
And now we have
that other factor.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.330
So it's e to the minus ikn.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.460
I could call it
the scattering one.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.490
But I will still not do that.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.140
Then we have the u of r
prime and the psi of r prime.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:07.130
So this is our
simplified expression

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:14.130
when we make use of the fact
that we're looking far enough

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.860
and the Green's
function has simplified.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.550
So let's keep that
for a moment and try

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:39.070
to think how we could solve
this integral equation.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.820
Now there's no
very simple methods

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.850
of solving them exactly.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.770
You have to do
interesting things here.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.280
It's fairly nontrivial.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.650
But finding approximate
solutions of integral equations

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.450
is something that we can do.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.790
And it's relatively simple.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:06.030
So we will come back to
this because in a sense,

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.860
this is nice.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.390
But you must feel that somehow
the story is not complete.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.340
We want to know the
wave function far away.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:20.790
This has the form of this
function that when we wrote psi

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:27.780
is equal to e to the ikz
plus f of theta phi e

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.740
to the ikr over r.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.960
If we know this f
of theta phi, we

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.120
know everything
about the scattering.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.040
But it almost looks like
this is f of theta and phi.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.540
But we don't know psi.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.800
So have we made any progress?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.940
Well, the Born
approximation is the way

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.560
in which we see that
we could turn this

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.120
into something quite simple.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.870
So let's do Born approximation.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.940
So our first step is to
rewrite once more for us

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:25.250
this equation, psi
of r is equal to e

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:37.280
to the ikir plus
integral d q bar prime G

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:45.185
plus of r minus r prime u
of r prime psi of r prime.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.380
OK.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.210
We wrote it.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.080
Good.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:57.430
Now let's rewrite it
with instead of r,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.740
putting an r prime here.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.820
You'd say, why?

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.240
Well, bear with me a second.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:13.440
Rewrite with r
replaced by r prime.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.630
If we have an r
prime, replace it

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.840
with r double prime and so on.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.410
So let's rewrite this.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:29.150
So we have psi of r prime
is equal to e to the iki

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:35.190
r prime plus
integral of d cubed r

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:43.290
double prime G plus of r prime
minus r double prime u of r

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:49.360
double prime psi
of r double prime.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.930
So I shifted.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.830
Whenever I had an
r, put an r prime.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.495
Whenever I had an r prime,
put an r double prime.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:07.460
The reason we do this
is that technically, I

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:22.870
can now substitute this
quantity here into here

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.240
and see what I get.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.480
And I get something
quite interesting.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.140
I get the beginning
of an approximation

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:42.100
because I now get psi
of r is equal to e

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:57.030
to the ikir plus d cubed r prime
G plus of r minus r prime--

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:01.140
I'm still copying the first
equation-- u of r prime.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.110
And here is where the
first change happens.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.430
Instead of psi of
r prime, I'm going

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.230
to put this whole other thing.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.540
So I'll write two terms.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:20.085
The first is just having
here, e to the iki r prime.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.480
The second, I'll write
this another line.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.200
So integral d cubed
r prime G plus of r

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:39.130
minus r prime u of r prime.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.680
And then the second term
would be another integral,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.710
d cubed r double prime
G plus of r prime minus

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:56.480
r double prime u of r double
prime psi of r double prime.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.079
So look at it and see
what has happened.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:13.369
You have postponed the fact that
you had an integral equation

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.710
to a next term.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:21.920
If I would drop
here this term, this

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.859
would not be an integral
equation anymore.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:28.510
Psi is given to this
function that we know.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.660
Green's function we know.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.680
Potential we know.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.060
Function we know.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.980
It's a solution.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.620
But the equation is
still not really solved.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.960
We have this term here.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.440
And now you could go
on with this procedure

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.600
and replace this psi
of r double prime.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.580
You could replace it
by an e to the iki r

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.200
double prime plus
another integral d

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.690
r triple prime of G, like that.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:13.080
And then here you would have
an e to the ik r double prime

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:18.010
and then more terms
and more terms.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:22.410
So I can keep doing
this forever until I

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:29.340
have this integral, G
plus u incident wave.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.950
And here I have G plus u
G plus u incident wave.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.200
And then I will have G plus u,
G plus u, G plus u, incident

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.290
wave.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:44.100
And it would go
on and on and on.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.850
So this is called the
Born approximation

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:52.230
if you stop at some stage
and you ignore the last term.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:59.510
So for example, we could ignore
this term, in which we still

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:05.180
have an unknown psi, and
say, OK, we take it this way.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:10.050
And this would be the
first Born approximation.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.720
You just go up to here.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.070
The second Born
approximation would

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:19.620
be to include this term with psi
replaced by the incident wave.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.500
The third Born approximation
would be the next term

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.420
that would come here.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:30.790
So let me write the whole Born
approximation schematically,

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.920
whole Born approximation
schematically.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.700
I could write three terms
explicitly or four terms

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.390
if you wish.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:44.200
But I think the pattern
is more or less clear now.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.270
What do you have?

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:52.990
Psi of r equal e
to the ikir plus--

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.250
and now it becomes schematic--

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.650
integral-- so I
put just integral--

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:06.070
G plus u e to the ikr.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.980
Don't put labels or anything.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.720
But that's the first integral.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.960
And if you had to
put back the labels,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.520
you would know how to put them.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.580
You'd put an integral
over some variable.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.610
Cannot be r because that's
where you're looking at.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.450
So you do an r prime,
the G of r minus r prime,

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.660
the u at r prime, and
this function at r prime.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.300
That's how this integral
would make sense.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:41.980
The next term would be integral
G u of another integral of G u

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.000
e to the ikr.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.490
That's the next term.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:59.250
And the next term would be
just G u G u G u e to the ikr.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.390
And it goes on forever.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.752
That's the Born series.

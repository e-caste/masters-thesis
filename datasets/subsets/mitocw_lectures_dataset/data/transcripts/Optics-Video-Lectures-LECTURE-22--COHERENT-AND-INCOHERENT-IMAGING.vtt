00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.600
SE BAEK OH: So today's class,
we are going to talk about--

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.670
called coherence.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.310
And basically Fourier system
with incoherent imaging.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.490
So particularly, this
topic is very important

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.520
if you want to take our optics
course because We're dealing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.125
with coherence and incoherence.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.590
So far, we have dealt
with the Fourier system

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.350
with a coherent illumination.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.340
Basically, laser light
from a point source--

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.180
I mean, pinhole.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.360
So the coherent plane waves
illuminating the Fourier

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.480
system, and the frequency
content appears at the plane.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.830
And you can put the
[INAUDIBLE] mask

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.910
to play with the
spatial filtering,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.880
and you're going to get some
image at the alpha plane.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.730
But in everyday life, if
you use your digital camera,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.390
you're not using the
really laser illumination.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.190
You mostly use this ambient
light, or if it's too dark,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.460
then you're going to
use the flashlight.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.720
So today, we are going to talk
about more realistic case.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600
We use the incoherent light.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.290
By the way, the difference
between coherent and incoherent

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.530
is basically, you can
make the interference

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.060
with the coherent light.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.130
So if you're not
make interference--

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.190
you're using laser,
but in most case,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.690
like this white
light source, you're

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.910
not going to see interference.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.590
So we're going to first
define what coherence is.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.210
And actually,
there are two kinds

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.230
of coherence, temporal
coherence and spatial coherence.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.570
And the rest of the topic
is pretty straightforward.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.750
We will define incoherent point
spread function and its Fourier

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.300
transform which is
optical transfer function

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.370
and modulation transfer
function, which

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.850
is modulus of OTF.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.760
And we're going to
see what MTF means.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.250
And we want to
compare the difference

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.861
between spatially coherent
and incoherent images.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.400
So as I just described,
the coherence

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.090
is basically ability
to make interference.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.750
So if you have incoherent light,
you cannot make interference.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.850
And if you have
coherent light, then you

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.530
can make the interference.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.663
And I'm going to describe it
later, but mathematically--

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:57.080
actually, the
coherence is nothing

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.050
but the correlation of wave at
two time space points, which

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.090
means we have some light, and
you just sample two points.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.750
It could be different time
points, but you combine them.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.450
And if you see interference,
then you can say it's coherent.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.270
But if you don't
see interference,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.160
then it is incoherent.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.930
So first, let me
describe what's going

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.100
to happen if I use the
incoherent light in Michelson

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.730
interferometer.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.850
So here, we have the
Michelson interferometer.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.740
So from the point
source, the light--

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.240
oops-- is coming in this
direction, this direction.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.450
And at the beam splitter,
half of the light

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.090
just transmit the beam
splitter, but the other half

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.680
is reflected.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.470
So this path gets reflected
again at the mirror,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.090
and passed through
the beam splitter,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.010
and arrives at the detector.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.815
And the other path is
reflected again, and reflected

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:56.690
at the beam splitter.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.850
And again you get--

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.530
I mean, it arrives
at the detector.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.055
So let's just suppose that we
have the laser source here.

00:04:10.055 --> 00:04:11.930
Then what you're going
to see at the detector

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.940
is a nice sinusoidal pattern
if I move one of the mirror.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:23.990
Because I can tune the optical
path length that light travels.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.080
And if the distance
match, then I

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.550
get the constructive
interference.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.590
And if the phase delay pi, then
I get disruptive interference.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.690
So as I move the
one with the mirror,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.015
I get nice sinusoidal pattern
with the full contrast.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.400
And next, let's suppose
instead of the laser,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.350
I have incoherent
source, which means--

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.880
so the horizontal axis is
time, and the vertical axis

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.065
is amplitude.

00:04:56.065 --> 00:05:00.100
But the phase or amplitude
is varying randomly.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:10.510
So over time, the amplitudes
are varying randomly.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.730
And even though it's
random, this wave train

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.730
will travel through
the interferometer.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:28.570
So in this path, the
optical path length

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.380
is actually constant, which is--

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.680
I mean, these paths,
they're common in two path.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.510
So constants plus 2d1
over c, which is time--

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.110
speed of light.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.270
And in the second
path, I have the same--

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.780
this wave train also travels.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.530
But due to the difference
between d1 and d2,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.550
at the detector,
essentially, I'm

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.480
going to sample a
different time point.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.460
So even though it's
random, I basically

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.210
choose two time
points here and here,

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.600
and combine them
at the detector.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.720
So if the d1 and d2 are
same, then basically,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.340
identical two waves
are coming together,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.150
so I always get
constructive interference.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.300
But what if d1 and
d2 are not same?

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.860
And then basically, they
get different phase shift.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.720
And since it's random,
they kind of average out.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.830
So d1 and d2 are getting bigger.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.930
Then basically, the
degree of correlation

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.700
is getting decreased, which
means at the detector,

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.780
the contrast will
also get decreased.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.830
So if I plot the intensity
at the detector with respect

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.110
to d2 minus d1, which is the
distance difference of two

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.010
arms, then the intensity
is going to be like this.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:02.800
So remember that if I have the
laser at point source, then

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.180
I will get the sinusoidal
pattern with the full contrast.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.860
But since now I have the
randomly varying source,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.060
this envelop is getting
attenuated like this.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.490
So if I have the rapid
decay curve, which means

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.570
I have more incoherent light.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.390
And if I have the
slowly decaying envelop,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.550
then it's more coherent.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:35.290
And there is another
kind of coherence

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.760
which is spatial coherence.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.510
So basically, the
concept is the same,

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.240
but we only define the
correlation in space domain.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.060
So now I have the Young
interferometer, which

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.390
I have two pinholes, x1 and x2.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.850
And I put a detector at the
center of the two pinholes.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.350
So from this pinhole, we see--

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.830
I mean, the spherical wave
is going to be emanating,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:05.050
but since it is at the center,
these paths are exactly same.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.770
And first, let's suppose
we have laser illumination.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.650
So I have the plane
wave coming in.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.010
Then this spherical wave will
make the Young's interference.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.640
So I'm going to have
the sinusoidal pattern

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.250
with the full contrast
at this plane,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.530
but I'm just seeing
at one point.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:32.059
And again, if I have the
randomly varying wave here--

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:36.280
so in this case, this
horizontal axis amplitude

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.820
and vertical axis is
space instead of time.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:46.000
So this amplitude and phase are
randomly varying over space.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.450
Since I have two
pinholes, so I essentially

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.490
sample at two points here
and there, and combine them.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.140
So again, if these two
pinholes are very close,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.990
then these sampling points
are also very close.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:10.390
So the amplitude and phase
are more likely similar.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.550
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.620
But if I move these two pinholes
in the upward and downward

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.760
like this, then the spacing
between two pinholes

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.660
are getting bigger,
and basically, I

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.840
lose the correlation,
which means

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.780
the spatial coherence is getting
attenuated-- getting smaller.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.490
So again, if I
plot the intensity

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.900
at the detector with respect
to x2 minus x1, which

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.140
is the spacing
between two pinholes,

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:46.258
then intensity
varying like this.

00:09:46.258 --> 00:09:47.800
Again, remember, if
I have the laser,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.340
then it doesn't really matter.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.330
I mean, I always
get a full contrast.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.590
Even though those frequencies--

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.130
I mean, [INAUDIBLE] plane-- the
frequency of the interference

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.690
is changing.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.760
But I always get
the full contrast,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.980
but contrast getting smaller if
you have the incoherent source.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:20.800
So let me describe
mathematically

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.780
why this happens.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.600
It doesn't really
matter whether I

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.630
use the Michelson interferometer
or Young's interferometer.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:38.750
Basically, interferometer,
we have two waves.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.610
So a1, e to the pi 1,
and a2, d to the pi 2.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.450
Basically, we have two waves I
could sample in space or time

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:47.950
domain.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.000
But anyway, I'm going
to have two waves

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.880
and just add them together,
and take the magnitude

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.250
square, which is intensity.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.510
So Michelson
interferometer, this is--

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:06.090
I mean, these two waves came
from the different-- the path

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.940
length, d1 and d2.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.270
And Young's interferometer,
basically, they

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.050
came from the two different
pinholes, x1 and x2.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.750
But anyway, I can always
write the interference

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.940
of two waves like this.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.990
So wave one and wave
two, it's negative square

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:30.374
is going to be i0 and 1 plus m
cosine, the phase difference.

00:11:30.374 --> 00:11:32.834
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:32.834 --> 00:11:35.420
SE BAEK OH: We are assuming
monochromatic, yes.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.050
I mean, you can write--

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.210
[INAUDIBLE] we use
assuming monochromatic

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.040
because we're using
phase notation.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.510
So we write this
and we write phaser,

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.350
but actually, there is e
to the i or negative i.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.490
So yeah, we assume
it's monochromatic.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.100
But even though
it's not chromatic,

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.548
you can always write just
addition of two waves.

00:12:01.548 --> 00:12:02.590
It really doesn't matter.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.460
So interference is basically
the dc term which is i0.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.210
So i0 is actually a1
squared plus a2 squared,

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.800
which is intensity of wave
1 and intensity of wave 2.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.090
So dc term is just
addition of the intensity,

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.400
and we have some
cosine modulation term.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.890
So this is basically
interference.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:43.000
So if we have coherent light,
then we have some dc term,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.020
and have a sinusoidal
modulation.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:52.660
And as the phase
varies, we're going

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.640
to see the sinusoidal
pattern is changing.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.740
But remember that this optical
frequency is very fast--

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.850
like tens of
gigahertz [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.500
So actually, what we measure--

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.780
I mean, intensity is
time average of this guy.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:14.560
So we're going to take the
time average of intensity.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.680
And if you do the math--

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.580
actually, we have the
dc term and this kind

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.710
of modulation term, which
is time average of cosine

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.780
with a phase difference.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.380
But remember that if we
have incoherent light,

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.200
this phase difference is random.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.270
So what is the average of
cosine of random phase?

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:40.799
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.280
What is the average of
cosine or random phase?

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:56.940
AUDIENCE: Q.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.370
SE BAEK OH: Yeah, Q.
Cosine is oscillating

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.160
between plus 1 and to minus 1.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.720
So if you have random phase
and average, then you get 0.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.100
So if you have incoherent
light, then basically intensity

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.125
is just addition of--

00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:15.210
the intensity of 2
waves, and we don't

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.070
have any interference term.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.520
So that's the difference between
coherent and incoherent light.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.030
So coherent light, you always
have a modulation term.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.950
I mean, it could be 0
depending on phase difference.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:32.130
But in [INAUDIBLE],, you always
have just addition of dc term--

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.744
I mean addition of intensity.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.530
So if it's perfectly
incoherent, then we

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.570
have just addition of intensity.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.875
And actually, coherent
and incoherent is very--

00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:53.260
actually two opposite
extreme cases.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.197
So it's just like monochromatic.

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:58.780
In real case, we are
not going to have

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.080
really monochromatic source.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.070
Our source is always
finite bandwidth.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.570
It's not going to
be delta function.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.760
So it's same thing.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.670
We are not going to have the
perfectly coherent or perfectly

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:12.250
incoherent.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.190
Everything is
partially coherent.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.990
So if you want to deal with
it, then you have to apply

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:25.720
basically statistics to all
these Fresnel and [INAUDIBLE]----

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.770
I mean, this kind of
[INAUDIBLE] optics.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.950
So it's called
statistical optics,

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.980
and it's covered in 2.707.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.230
So if you want to
learn more about it,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.940
then you can take 2.7 or 1.7.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.760
But nevertheless, the
coherent and incoherent case

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.990
are enough to describe
many, many phenomena.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:53.506
So we are focused on coherent
and incoherent state detection.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.350
Going a little bit fast.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:07.728
So-- oops.

00:16:07.728 --> 00:16:08.228
Sorry.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.620
So since we have two
kinds of coherence-- so

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.310
temporal coherence
and spatial coherence.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.230
So actually, we have four
different combinations.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.320
So temporarily and
spatially coherent,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.030
and temporarily/spatially
incoherent.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.740
And temporal incoherent,
spatially coherent, temporarily

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.940
coherent, spatially incoherent.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.040
So the rule of thumb--

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.460
so temporal coherence is
related to the bandwidth

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.590
of your source--

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.300
basically, the color
of your source.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.930
So if you have one color in
monochromatic, then it's--

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:51.890
question?

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, where do
diode lasers go in that chart?

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.392
SE BAEK OH: Diode laser
is more like temporally

00:17:00.392 --> 00:17:01.350
and spatially coherent.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.520
So yeah, let me just continue.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.500
So temporal coherence
is related to color.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.760
So if you have laser, like
single-color monochromatic,

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.869
then it's more like coherent.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.710
But if you have white light,
like this fluorescent lamp

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.800
or halogen lamp,
then it's broadband,

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.349
so it's temporally incoherent.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:28.520
And spatial coherence is
related to actually the size

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.820
of the source and the distance.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.945
So everything coming
from the point source

00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:36.890
is spatially coherent
because they're basically

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.720
coming from the same point.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.550
But if your source
is extended like--

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.820
or you have the
filament in a bulb,

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.040
or this kind of
fluorescent light,

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.190
then it's spatially incoherent.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:53.240
So the monochromatic
laser source,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:59.630
laser is very monochromatic,
and the output is very small.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.870
So laser is typically very
temporarily and spatially

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.930
incoherent, and that's
why people use it

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.360
in interferometry.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.060
And white light source--

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.620
and if you are nearby
the white light source,

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:19.610
then it's more like temporally
and spatially incoherent.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.110
And actually, these two are
a little bit interesting.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.130
So temporally incoherent
or spatially coherent.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.020
So if you put a small pinhole
in front of the white light,

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.530
then it's temporally incoherent
because it's broadband,

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.500
but it's coming from a pinhole,
so it's spatially coherent.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:42.080
At the same reason, the sunlight
is very spatially coherent,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.730
but temporally incoherent.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.150
But the sun is very huge, but
also the distance is very huge.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:51.240
So if you see the
sun, then it looks--

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.000
sunlight is coming
from point source,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.854
so that's why it's
spatially coherent.

00:18:57.854 --> 00:19:00.500
And yeah, the light from--

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.948
yeah, press the button, please.

00:19:03.948 --> 00:19:04.860
It doesn't work?

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:12.110
But anyway, so one of the
things that [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.290
to measure coherence,
but what exactly

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.130
is coherent [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.300
SE BAEK OH: Yeah, that
is a good question.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.830
So actually, it's a little
bit lengthy to explain,

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.380
but what essentially the light--

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.620
I mean, this kind of light,
it excites some atoms.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.720
And when they are going
down, you get the energy.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.210
Basically, light
energy by e to the--

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.280
I mean energy is H mu.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.590
But it's not--

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.470
I mean, this kind of spontaneous
emission is not correlated.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.410
You have many, many atoms,
but they are not synchronized.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.020
They are emitting randomly.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.180
So basically, you
have some finite--

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.430
there are wave train.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.690
So in that wave train, you
get basically coherent.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.620
But you have many, many of
them with the random phase.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.490
That's why you
add them together,

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.870
then you get incoherent.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.370
So coherent length
is essentially

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.910
what is the length of
a finite wave train

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.120
that you can define
deterministic phase.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.870
So d1-- so in just imagine
the Michelson interferometer,

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:33.160
you have the optical
path first, d1 minus d2.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.760
But that difference is
within the distance,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.270
then you get interference.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.540
That's why you call the
coherence length and coherence

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.290
time.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:49.540
And yeah, essentially,
that's it.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.680
So remember that if we had--

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.923
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

00:20:59.923 --> 00:21:00.690
SE BAEK OH: Yep?

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.580
AUDIENCE: Here I also
will have one question.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.510
So I want to check whether
this understanding is correct.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.470
So let's say if the light
comes at a perfect parallel

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.350
direction, even though they
have different wavelengths,

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.210
it's considered
especially coherent.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.230
And even if light go into
different directions,

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.490
but [INAUDIBLE] perfect--

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.370
the single wavelength, they're
considered time coherent.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.260
Is this understanding correct?

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.590
SE BAEK OH: So actually,
if you have plain wave,

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.950
then you already assume your
wave is spatially coherent.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.410
Because plane wave, it doesn't
really matter where you sample.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.090
They have always same phase.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:41.880
So your assumption
is spatially coherent

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.610
if you assume spatially
coherent light.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.602
AUDIENCE: You mean even if they
have different wavelengths?

00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:52.310
SE BAEK OH: Yeah.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.270
Even though you have
different wavelengths,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.500
that's temporally incoherent.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.840
But in space domain, you
have spatially coherent.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.610
Another way to think
of spatially incoherent

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.150
is you have many, many
plane waves propagating

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.140
all the different directions,
but they are randomly--

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.060
they have random initial phase.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.570
So especially in coherent
light, you cannot really define

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.620
a unique propagation direction.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.870
But spatially
coherent light, you

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.090
can always define direction.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.970
Even though spherical wave
it has all the directions,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.740
but you can always say--

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.520
if you put-- if you define the
position, then that position,

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.390
you have a k vector.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.778
So you can define the direction.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.780
So let me just
finish this thing.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.740
So if d1 and d2 are within the
coherence length or coherence

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.700
time, then you get
some interference.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.872
But after that--
so basically, this

00:22:58.872 --> 00:23:00.330
is essentially the
coherence length

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.300
of this particular source.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.500
And remember that--

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.970
I mean, this always happens.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.220
So even though you
have a white light,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.000
you can get interference, but
within a very limited range.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.000
Where did I stop?

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.205
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:23:52.205 --> 00:23:53.048
Excuse me.

00:23:53.048 --> 00:23:54.590
So another interesting
thing is there

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:59.720
is a laser that has a broadband
which is [INAUDIBLE] laser.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.810
So it's spatially coherent,
but it's broadband,

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.050
so you have temporally
incoherence.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.600
And the other kind
of this combination

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.190
is temporally coherent, but
it's spatially incoherent.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:19.170
And it's typically referred
to as quasi-monochromatic--

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.390
temporally coherent and
spatially incoherent.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.400
So if you put a
rotating diffuser, which

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:31.400
is when you rotate the ground
glass or milky glass in front

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.500
of the laser, then basically,
it induces some random phase

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.950
to the laser beam where
we can say it destroyed

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.120
the correlation of the related.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.770
So it's monochromatic,
so it temporally coheres.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.270
But in space domain,
it is a random phase,

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:52.040
so you can have the
spatially incoherent light.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.750
So these are a list of
optical instruments using

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.416
spatial coherence on imaging.

00:25:02.416 --> 00:25:05.420
The Michelson stellar
interferometer and the radio

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.920
telescope, they are basically
measuring spatial coherence

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.260
of the light coming from a
distant star, or sun, or--

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.340
yeah, they're basically
for astronomy.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.845
So they can measure,
for example,

00:25:18.845 --> 00:25:22.860
the diameter of a distant star.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.330
Remember, the
spatial coherence is

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.410
related to the source
size and the distance.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.080
So if you properly measure
spatial coherence--

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.290
actually, the envelope
of the spatial coherence,

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.450
then you can estimate
the diameter of the star.

00:25:37.072 --> 00:25:39.030
I believe Michelson got
a Nobel Prize for this.

00:25:42.694 --> 00:25:46.220
And optical coherence
tomography is actually

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.310
utilizing temporal incoherence.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.210
So as I just described, even
though you have white light,

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.200
if you properly match the
optical path difference,

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.440
then you can get interference
within a very small range.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.840
So let's say you have
multiple layers like tissue,

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.120
and you construct the
Michelson interferometer

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.370
with the white light, and as
you move the other mirror,

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.490
then if the optical
path difference matches,

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.870
then you get interference.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.120
But if you slightly
off that point,

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.130
then you don't get
the interference.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.550
So if you plot the interference
versus the distance

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.550
of the mirror, then you
can see kind of the peak

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:30.440
whenever you have the right
position at each layer.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:35.220
So you can kind of do
the optical sectioning.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.210
And in the lithography
replication technique,

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.470
people use some
spatial coherence

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:49.640
to basically make
some nice pattern.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.460
Because as we described
spatial coherence

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.110
is essentially affecting
this resolution

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.340
and the contrast of your image.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:14.240
So there are these
kind of things

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.720
Even though we deal with
the spatially coherent

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.200
with the first system, so what
if we change the illumination

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.450
to a spatially incoherent
or temporally incoherent?

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:30.100
And obviously, my image
will be different depending

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.055
on the coherent state.

00:27:33.055 --> 00:27:38.880
Actually, that's the bottom
line of today's lecture.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.100
So first, if we have the
temporal incoherent--

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.630
basically, if you have
the broadband for many,

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:45.730
many colors--

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.880
then the chromatic aberration
is typical evidence

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.410
that I have temporal
incoherent source.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:58.420
Then how to deal with it if
you have many, many colors?

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.010
That's pretty straightforward.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.940
So you can define point spread
function, or ATF, or out--

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.770
or whatever it is.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.720
You can define that thing
for each wavelength.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.500
So for example, if I can
define point spread function

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.750
for red wavelength, I can
define point spread function

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.200
for blue wavelengths.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.000
So it's just--

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.840
I can do with a
straightforward equation.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.010
And spatial coherence
is a little bit--

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.090
and you need to be careful.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.720
So the bottom-- actually,
this is the take-home message

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.430
of the lecture.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.680
If the illumination
is spatially coherent,

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:37.950
then input field is
conversion of the-- actually,

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:43.090
output field is a
convolution of input field

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:48.130
with a coherent point spread
function, as we all know.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.710
But if the illumination
is spatially incoherent,

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:54.280
then output intensity,
not the output field.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.160
So output intensity
is a convolution

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.950
of the input intensity with
the incoherent point spread

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:01.450
function.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:12.450
So that's the-- which means
if you have spatial coherent

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.675
illumination, then--

00:29:13.675 --> 00:29:15.270
fields are linear systems.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.710
You can do the
convolution in field.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.530
But if the illumination
is incoherent,

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.730
then intensity is
a linear system,

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:27.640
so you can deal with the
intensity with the convolution.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.140
So rest of the
lecture, we are going

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.200
to deal with the spatial
incoherent illumination.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.060
So how we can define point
spread function, and transfer

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.260
function, and et cetera.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.720
So first, let's review what
we have learned so far.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.040
So we have fourth
system with a two length

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.650
whose focal lengths
are f1 and f2.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.890
And typically, we put
our input transparency

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:03.290
grating at the input plane.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.610
And we illuminate with the
spatially coherent illumination

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:11.560
and also temporally coherent.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.670
So the input field just
right after the input

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:20.560
transparency is going to be just
a product of the illumination

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.010
field and the
complex transparency.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.990
That's the input field.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.260
And you're going to take
the Fourier transform to get

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.030
the field at the wave plane.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:35.090
And another Fourier transform,
you get the final image.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.890
And from that, we all know
that amplitude [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:43.690
function is nothing but
the [INAUDIBLE] function

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.660
with the coordinate scaling.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.710
So ATF, H of u
[INAUDIBLE] some constant

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:57.310
and [INAUDIBLE] mask function,
and lambda f1u and lambda f1v.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.550
And the point spread
function in field

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:09.320
is just Fourier
transform of the ATF.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.800
Or you can say it's field
transform [INAUDIBLE] function.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.000
So this is the coherent
point spread function.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.840
And you can define [INAUDIBLE]
function reduce coordinate.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.530
And the relation between
input and output field

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.180
is this convolution.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.180
So G output-- I
mean, output field

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.000
is convolution of
input field, and this

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.070
is coherent point
spread function

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.010
which is defined in field.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:41.210
So this is the stuff
that we all know.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:47.140
So the next thing is let me put
the two pinholes at the input

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:47.640
plane.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.646
And illuminate with the
spatially coherent light.

00:31:53.646 --> 00:31:56.730
So basically, we have
Young interferometer here,

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.640
and I'm going to
image that pattern.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.480
And since it is coherent--
it is illuminated

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.810
with the coherent light.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:12.360
So essentially, I have--
at the image plane,

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.610
there's actually two
point spread functions

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.140
coming from two pinholes.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.440
So in the upper
image is actually

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.790
coming from the lower
pinhole, and the lower image

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.530
actually coming from
the top pinhole.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:27.730
But I have the addition
of two point spread

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.310
functions which is shifted
by the position of the two

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.810
pinholes.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:36.520
And I may have some initial
phase, a1, e to the phi 1,

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.570
and a to--

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:38.710
e to the phi 2.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.230
But the bottom line
is in coherent case,

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:46.250
I just have coherent
addition of two point spread

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.640
functions like this.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.620
And to get the intensity,
as you all know,

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.450
we just take the negative
square of the sum,

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:59.300
and if we expand it,
then we have [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.810
which is the intensity
of the first point spread

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:05.170
function and intensity of the
second point spread function.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:09.330
And we have some additional
modulation term, which

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.470
means I have some interference.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.920
So it's a1, a2, and
rear path of this guy.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.860
But rear path is always cosine.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.890
So if you change the phase, you
have some sinusoidal modulation

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:22.390
term.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.470
So this is sometimes
called interference term

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.630
or [INAUDIBLE] term.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:35.440
It implies that you
have interference.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.350
So with these parameters--
so initial phase

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.920
is just d to the
negative pi over 3,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.790
and the other one is
the positive pi over 3.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:49.330
Then if I plot this
intensity, then I'm

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.760
going to have this blue line.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:00.410
So this is the case of
spatially coherent illumination.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.755
And next, let's
suppose I illuminate

00:34:03.755 --> 00:34:07.970
with the incoherent
illumination.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:13.989
So as I described
earlier, the difference

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:17.350
between incoherent
and coherent is

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.480
I don't have interference
term if I illuminate

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.880
with the incoherent source.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.035
So at the intensity, I
only have these two terms--

00:34:26.035 --> 00:34:27.410
just intensity of
the first point

00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:29.743
spread function and intensity
of the second point spread

00:34:29.743 --> 00:34:30.340
function.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.870
And I don't have the
extra cosine term.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:39.460
So this is just intensity.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:44.469
So if I plot the intensity
with the same parameter,

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:48.020
then this is how it looks.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.330
And if I put together,
then the upper left

00:34:52.330 --> 00:35:01.670
is the two intensity profiles
for coherent and incoherent

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.050
illumination.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.460
So they are slightly different.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.270
And if I play with a
different parameter,

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:11.120
like the different
initial phase.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.440
And in this case, my
point spread function

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.170
has extra linear
phase term, then

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.450
the difference is
quite dramatic.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.140
So you always have to be
careful what kind of coherence

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.490
your illumination is.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.829
Any questions?

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.370
So in previous case, which
is spatially coherent,

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:48.870
then the input field and
output field is linear,

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.020
so you can use the convolution.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:57.950
But in spatially
incoherent case,

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.590
we deal with the input
intensity which is--

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.760
so we're going to deal with
the input intensity and output

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.480
intensity.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.570
And at the image
plane, the intensity

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:19.070
will be [INAUDIBLE]
incoherently.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:26.940
So I illuminate
with the intensity--

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.380
I mean, incoherent illumination
with the intensity [INAUDIBLE],,

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.130
and g sub t is the
complex transparency.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:38.820
But this is field, so you
have to take negative square.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:47.460
So product of this guy is
basically your input intensity.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.870
So this is illumination
intensity and--

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.130
intensity of your grating--

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:59.790
and this is point spread
function-- actually,

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.440
coherent point
spread function where

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.320
you take the negative
square because you

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.245
take the negative
square to get intensity.

00:37:07.245 --> 00:37:09.370
[CLEARS THROAT] Excuse me.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.150
We define incoherent
point spread function,

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.770
which is ipsf--

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:16.540
it's actually negative square
over the coherent point spread

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.570
function.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:19.710
It's pretty simple, right?

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:23.580
You have point spread
function in field.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.170
And if you just
take the intensity

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:29.750
and test the intensity
point spread function.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:33.220
But you probably already
noticed the difference.

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.870
So if you use the
coherent illumination,

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:40.450
then the fields are
related to convolution,

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:42.240
but in coherent
case, intensities

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.950
are related to convolution,
and point spread function

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:48.957
are different.

00:37:55.976 --> 00:37:57.870
Any questions?

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.040
I'm going to [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.420
So we just defined the
intensity point spread function,

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.370
which is negative square
coherent point spread function.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:23.100
And by analogy, I mean
in the coherence case,

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.120
we had the coherent
point spread function.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.230
And if you take the Fourier
transform of the coherent point

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:32.220
spread function,
then that is ATF--

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.150
amplitude transfer function.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.540
So we could define the
same transform function

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:42.490
for incoherent point spread
function, which is OTF here.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:47.220
So [INAUDIBLE] says that--

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:58.080
so actually, the small h is the
coherent point spread function,

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.790
and the capital H is ATF.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:06.180
So they are a Fourier
transform pair.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.820
And hI, which is intensity
point spread function,

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.750
is the negative square of the
coherent point spread function.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:21.080
But hI and OTF which
is this weird h,

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:26.740
they are also a
Fourier transform pair.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.900
So if you go through
this derivation,

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.630
then it will prove
actually they are--

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:47.810
that OTF is actually
this integration of ATF.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:53.930
So once you have ATF, and after
you compute this information,

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:57.590
then you get OTF which
is auto correlation.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:01.860
And I'm going to derive
in a different way here.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:06.680
[INAUDIBLE] please.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:23.260
So we start with hI of x,
which is intensity point spread

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:27.200
function is negative square
of the coherent point spread

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.280
function.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.172
And-- yes?

00:40:30.172 --> 00:40:31.672
AUDIENCE: Can you
write much bigger?

00:40:31.672 --> 00:40:32.580
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.497
SE BAEK OH: All right.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.280
[LAUGHS]

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.560
Let me try.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.018
That's too big, right?

00:40:41.018 --> 00:40:42.419
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:42.419 --> 00:40:43.360
[LAUGHS]

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.510
SE BAEK OH: It's too small?

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:45.010
OK.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.790
A little bit smaller.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.970
We start with this
thing, and we know

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:10.310
that the OTF is Fourier
transform of intensity point

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:11.020
spread function.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.250
And I can just plug into here.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:25.020
So it's Fourier transform
of negative square

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:30.430
of the coherent point spread
function and Fourier transform.

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.640
And since it is
complex conjugate,

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:38.230
I can write as h of x.

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.652
And it's complex conjugate.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.530
And since these
two are products,

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:53.570
then I can write as
convolution of two guys.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:58.210
So it's Fourier
transform of h of x,

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.810
conversion with
Fourier transform

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:06.240
of a complex
conjugate like this.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.980
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:20.920
And Fourier transform of
the H is actually H of u--

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:25.650
I mean this guy.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:29.610
ATF is just nothing but Fourier
transform of the coherent point

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:30.860
spread function.

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.980
And what about this guy?

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:38.780
Fourier transform of complex
conjugate of small h.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.720
So I can write this
in integral form.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.964
So integral h, complex
conjugate of x.

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:53.030
e to the minus j2pi, xu, dx.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.320
And since it is
complex conjugate,

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.450
I can write as
integral h of x, e

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:16.531
to the I2pi xu, dx,
x, and conjugate.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:34.670
So I can write as OTF
is H of u convolution,

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:46.010
and complex conjugate of
Fourier transform of--

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.950
like this.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.483
Actually, [INAUDIBLE] transform.

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.570
So actually, this inverse
Fourier transform,

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.540
if you remember, the difference
of the Fourier transform

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:15.390
is actually integral h of
x, e to the I2pi xu, dx.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.890
But

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:24.320
You can write as h of x, e to
the minus 2pi x minus u, dx.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.390
So actually, it is Fourier
transform, and h of x.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.850
But you change the
spatial frequency variable

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:35.360
as a minus u, So it's
going to be H of minus u.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:47.530
So at the end, we have
H of u convolution,

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.450
and complex conjugate of--

00:44:52.282 --> 00:44:53.730
ah, sorry.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.025
H complex conjugate of minus u.

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:10.180
[INAUDIBLE] where I can
write as an integral form.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:23.880
Integration H of u
prime, H of minus u

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:30.330
minus u prime, complex
conjugate, and du prime.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:37.100
So essentially, integration
H complex conjugate--

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.254
sorry.

00:45:38.254 --> 00:45:47.400
So I have H of u prime,
complex conjugate u prime minus

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:53.610
u, du prime, which
is essentially

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:57.750
this guy in [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:11.185
And sometimes, we denote by
H of u [INAUDIBLE] H of u,

00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:14.332
which is auto-correlation.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.497
Any questions on the derivation?

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.010
So before we move
on, can anyone guess

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.810
what this integration means?

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:53.520
So you have-- you want
to compute the OTF, which

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.370
is auto-correlation of the ATF.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:01.920
But this integration is
basically you have H,

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.400
and you take the
complex conjugate,

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.350
but you shift and
take the integral.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:21.220
So next slide, I'm going to
explain how we can compute--

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.790
so bottom line of
this slide is OTF

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:27.130
is nothing but
auto-correlation of your ATF.

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:30.960
But next slide is
how to compute when--

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.820
you can simply compute
this integration,

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:38.695
but there is another easy
way to guess the OTF.

00:47:38.695 --> 00:47:44.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.290
SE BAEK OH: Conceptually, yes.

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.120
I mean, actually,
Fourier transform

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.420
of the input intensity and
Fourier transform of the output

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.480
intensity, and the
ratio of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:12.290
So let's first compute the
OTF for the simple case.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:17.930
I have the rectangular aperture
in my [INAUDIBLE] plane.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:21.100
And from that, I
know that the ATF--

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:25.280
H of u-- is just [INAUDIBLE]
function, and u over umx.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.130
So umx is defined
by the physical size

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:29.780
of the [INAUDIBLE] function.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.640
And so if it's just
x, double prime x,

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.560
and with the scaling
vector of lambda F1.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.520
So this is the ATF.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:46.670
And I just put that OTF is
auto-correlation of ATF.

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:49.970
In integral form, I
have this integration.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:54.650
So let's just take a look at
this [INAUDIBLE] actually.

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:58.325
So OTF is function of u,
but this integration--

00:48:58.325 --> 00:49:00.340
I mean inside of
this integration,

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:04.020
I have function of H of u prime.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.220
And H complex conjugate,
u prime minus u.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.470
So I have the first
function, which

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:13.330
is essentially same as
my original function

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:18.230
even though I change the
variable from u to u prime.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:24.560
But this guy is function of
u prime where you shift by u.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.920
And [INAUDIBLE] integration.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.490
And this whole thing
is function of u,

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:30.890
which means you're
going to compute

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:37.370
this integration for every
u, and then you get OTF.

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:39.410
And this integration
is basically

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:43.010
you have two functions,
one is shifted by u,

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.130
and multiply them, and
take the integration, which

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:53.060
is essentially you compute
the overlapped area of the two

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:53.850
functions.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:50:00.775
So graphically, if I have
[INAUDIBLE] function and plug

00:50:00.775 --> 00:50:05.180
it in this integration,
I have this integration.

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.940
But I can imagine for
a different situation,

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.100
the first--

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.560
so this [INAUDIBLE] function
is the coherent [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.780
function.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.180
And the second one
which is moving

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.170
is a coherent
[INAUDIBLE] function.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:21.650
So if they are not
overlapped, then I

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:25.490
get simply 0 the
first situation.

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:28.820
And as soon as they
are overlapped,

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:35.520
and then the overlapped area
is getting linearly increased.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:40.430
So I get this u plus umx until
they are completely overlapped.

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:43.670
And then-- so this
is [INAUDIBLE]----

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:50.660
and then once you move
a little bit further,

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:54.510
then basically this overlapped
area is getting decreased.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:58.260
So this is third situation,
which is this guy.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.370
And eventually, they are
not going to overlap,

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:04.850
so I get 0 again.

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:07.100
Remember that this OTF
is functional of u,

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.000
which is the amount of shift
of this [INAUDIBLE] function.

00:51:16.357 --> 00:51:18.752
Any questions?

00:51:18.752 --> 00:51:22.620
So if you plot this
overlapped area--

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.840
I mean this guy and this guy--

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.070
with respect to u,
then actually we

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:36.130
are going to get a
triangular function, which

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:38.945
looks like this one.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.310
And of course, we normalize
at the 0 frequency.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:50.390
So at the 0, we always have a 1.

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:54.380
So you notice the difference
between these two.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:58.210
So ATF-- my ATF is nothing
but my [INAUDIBLE] function--

00:51:58.210 --> 00:51:59.650
just left function.

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:02.200
And the color frequency,
umx, is defined

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.990
by my physical size
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:07.020
with the scaling factor.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:11.050
But OTF is auto-correlation,
so the shape

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:13.630
is now the triangular shape.

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:19.330
But also the color frequency--
the umx is twice of the umx,

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:25.460
because basically you go
through all this process.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.362
So you get twice of
the color frequency.

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:41.700
So-- yeah?

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.590
Oh.

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.370
So whatever
[INAUDIBLE] you have,

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:48.050
if you compute this
kind of overlapped area,

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:51.060
then you can get OTF.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:56.900
So [INAUDIBLE] you have a
rectangular square aperture,

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:00.890
then you if you go through
this auto-correlation,

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.460
then you can get
this kind of OTF.

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:06.090
So this is just completely
linear in u and [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:08.190
direction.

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:12.820
Again, the fx and fy,
they are [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:16.370
And if you have the circular
aperture, it's almost linear,

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:18.610
but it's slightly
curved at the edge.

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:27.930
But essentially, they
are the same thing.

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.190
So if you move
around two circles

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.800
in completely overlapped
area, then you

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.070
end up with this function.

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.970
I guess this is a good
time to take a break.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.930
Any questions so far?

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:59.930
So we discussed there
is a lot of difference

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:02.210
between temporal and
spatial coherence,

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.510
and defined the intensity
point spread function,

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:06.948
and also defined
the OTF which is

00:54:06.948 --> 00:54:08.990
Fourier transform with
the intensity point spread

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:10.340
function.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.312
And at the last--

00:54:12.312 --> 00:54:14.495
[CLEARS THROAT] excuse me--

00:54:14.495 --> 00:54:17.780
OTF is auto-correlation
of the ATF.

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:21.420
And I visually showed
how to compute the OTF.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:35.170
So let's just summarize
what we discussed so far.

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:41.250
So first, we all know that
coherent point spread function

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:44.917
is nothing but an optical
field generated by a point

00:54:44.917 --> 00:54:47.240
source at [INAUDIBLE] plane.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.620
And that's the field.

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:54.880
And also you know that
coherent point spread function

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.710
is Fourier transform
[INAUDIBLE] function

00:54:56.710 --> 00:55:00.370
with a coordinate scaling.

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:02.680
And incoherent point
spread function

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:07.400
is negative square of
coherent point spread.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.680
Or another way to say
is intensity point

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:14.420
spread function is intensity of
the field coherent point spread

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:14.920
function.

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:26.940
And we define the amplitude
[INAUDIBLE] function, ATF,

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:30.150
which is Fourier transform
of the coherent point spread

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:32.680
function.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:41.260
And it is nothing but the
[INAUDIBLE] function with

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:42.490
the scaling vector--

00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:44.540
I mean coordinate scaling.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:49.330
And we just derive
the OTF, which

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:53.340
is Fourier transform of the
intensity point spread function

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.230
is actually auto-correlation
with the ATF.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.310
In the rest of
the lecture, we're

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:08.920
going to mostly deal
with the MTF which

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.760
is negative modulus of the OTF.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.490
Actually, it should be OTF.

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:17.740
So MTF is the negative
component of OTF.

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:25.870
In terms of input
and output, we're

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:27.590
dealing with a linear
system approach.

00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:32.080
So if you have the spatially
coherent illumination--

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.170
so [INAUDIBLE] is the
illumination field.

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:38.440
And I have the
thin transparency--

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.280
the complex transparency
which is sub t.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.820
Then my input field is just
product of my illumination

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.050
field and complex transparency.

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.490
So g sub n, that's
the input field.

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:53.260
And if I convert with the
coherent point spread function,

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:58.140
that's going to be my output
field, which is g sub f.

00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:01.970
And I kind of think this whole
thing in frequency domain.

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:04.280
So if I take a
Fourier transform--

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.790
[INAUDIBLE] is actually
Fourier transform

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:15.040
of small gn, which is Fourier
component of my input field.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.377
And convolution
is multiplication

00:57:18.377 --> 00:57:19.210
in frequency domain.

00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:24.250
So I multiply by ATF, then
I'm going to get g sub--

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:28.340
[INAUDIBLE] which is Fourier
inform of my output field.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:35.370
And if I have the spatially
incoherent illumination,

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:38.000
then I deal with the intensity.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.830
So I have the intensity
of illumination, and I--

00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:45.180
still complex transparency.

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:51.960
So actually, my input intensity
is illumination intensity

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:56.220
times negative
square of g sub t.

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.550
So remember that gt is
complex transparency.

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:02.850
So to make intensity, you
have to take negative square.

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:05.280
So this is my input intensity.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.640
And in current case,
it's linear in intensity,

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.300
so you have to convert with
the intensity point spread

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:16.870
function, which is negative
square of the coherent point

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:17.980
spread function.

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:22.600
Then you're going to
get in output intensity.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.300
And again, in the
frequency domain,

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:30.204
we can take the Fourier
transform-- so g sub i--

00:58:30.204 --> 00:58:31.410
what can I say?

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:38.730
Character gi input--
character g sub i in,

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:42.480
which is Fourier transform
of the input intensity.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.450
And you're going
to multiply by OTF,

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:48.780
which is what
auto-correlation of the ATF.

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.380
And you'll get the
Fourier transform

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.057
of the output intensity.

00:58:58.350 --> 00:59:02.880
So actually, if you're familiar
with the control theory,

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.430
then you probably
know the Bode plot.

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:09.040
So Bode plot is
nothing but you have--

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.490
in frequency domain, it
describes the weighting

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:14.280
function that is going to
be multiplied by your input

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.240
and produce your output.

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:19.720
So this ATF, and
OTF, and also MTF,

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.650
they are basically
the same thing.

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:25.310
You multiply your--
so basically,

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:29.745
this transform function
in frequency domain

00:59:29.745 --> 00:59:32.200
describes the
weighting function here

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.600
that is going to be
multiplied by your input.

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:38.010
And you can just compare the--

00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:41.050
and also another way to say
it is the ratio between input

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:41.550
and output.

00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:49.930
So MTF-- so, yeah.

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:54.850
So as I described,
this transform function

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:58.870
is nothing but with weighting
function in frequency domain.

00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:01.490
So let me show
you how to use it.

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:06.110
Because if you buy a lens
for your digital camera--

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:08.925
I mean, typically
the SLR camera--

01:00:08.925 --> 01:00:11.740
so lets make us
provide the MTF layer,

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:16.690
which is this weighting function
with the spatial frequency,

01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:19.020
and with the color frequency.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.500
It's cool-- you can say
what kind of image quality

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.670
I can expect with the lens.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:28.510
So first, let's consider
our [INAUDIBLE] grating

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:33.590
whose MTF transform function
is given by this equation.

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:39.040
So the input intensity
is going to be--

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.460
I mean intensity of the grating
is going to be negative square,

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.020
so I add 1 over 2.

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:48.250
Then 1 plus n modulation,
and cosine term.

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:51.207
And the phase
[INAUDIBLE] it doesn't

01:00:51.207 --> 01:00:53.290
matter why, because if you
take a negative square,

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:54.010
it's always 1.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.820
The Fourier transform of
this input intensity is--

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:10.220
we all know that it
has three 3 orders.

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:14.647
So 0-th order, and the 1 over
capital lambda, and minus 1

01:01:14.647 --> 01:01:15.480
over capital lambda.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.480
We have three different orders.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:26.370
And it's going to be multiplied
by the OTF, which is at this h.

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:29.670
And since this is delta
function, which means

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:33.190
this one is 1 only
at u equals 0,

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:37.050
and when u equals 1
over capital lambda,

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:39.700
and at minus 1 capital lambda.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.310
So if you multiply the OTF--

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:44.550
and actually, you still
have the three components.

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:50.940
So at 0 component, you have
the OTF at the 0 frequency.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:54.430
And these two delta functions
are multiplied by OTF

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:58.320
at the 1 over capital lambda
and minus 1 over capital lambda.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.810
We still have the three
[INAUDIBLE] orders.

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:15.320
And let me just go back.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.830
So since this is your Fourier
transform of the output

01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:21.370
intensity, you can
just take the inverse

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:25.010
Fourier transform to compute
the output intensity, right?

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:26.520
But there is another--

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.970
there is an important
property of the OTF.

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.030
So this guy and this guy.

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:41.220
So OTF is actually--

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.730
intensity point spread
function, which is h sub i,

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:48.180
is negative square of the
coherent point spread function.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.520
So it is always positive--

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.340
it's non-negative I should say.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.320
So it's non-negative.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.170
So this Fourier
transform is actually

01:02:57.170 --> 01:03:00.660
Hermitian, which
mathematically, you

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.290
can [INAUDIBLE] h of
minus u-- is actually

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:06.800
h complex conjugate of u.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.040
Or you can say its real path
is [INAUDIBLE] function,

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.750
but its simulated
path is out function.

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:18.520
So OTF of the physically
realizable optical system

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.600
must be Hermitian.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.950
So this condition should
be satisfied always.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.666
So in the previous
slide, I had--

01:03:33.666 --> 01:03:34.280
let me just--

01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.900
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:52.420 --> 01:04:08.100
Capital G, I, out, was 1
over 2 OTF at 0, and delta u.

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:19.760
Plus n over 2, H, 1 over
capital lambda, and delta u,

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.240
1 over capital lambda.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:26.400
Plus H minus 1 over
capital lambda,

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.731
delta u, 1 over capital lambda.

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:47.510
Since the OTF is Hermitian,
which means my OTF over minus 1

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:51.860
over capital lambda is
actually complex conjugate

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.080
of H, 1 over capital lambda.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:59.161
This is Hermitian.

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:03.190
So G out--

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:16.550
I mean, the capital G, I, out,
I can write as 1 over 2 OTF at 0

01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:18.946
is still delta function.

01:05:18.946 --> 01:05:26.870
And m over 2, H, 1 over
capital lambda, delta u,

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:29.040
1 over capital lambda.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.190
But the last delta
function I can

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:43.560
write as H complex conjugate,
1 over capital lambda, decay u

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.010
plus 1 over capital lambda.

01:05:48.142 --> 01:05:49.350
So the first delta function--

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:51.892
I mean, if you take the inverse
Fourier transform [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:51.892 --> 01:05:56.010
transform, the first delta
function [INAUDIBLE]----

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:57.300
just 1 or something.

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.140
So it's pretty straightforward.

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:03.030
The question is still what
happened in these two delta

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:08.070
functions, because
this one has H of--

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:11.220
I mean the OTF at one
over capital lambda,

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.820
and the other one is
actually complex conjugate.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:21.600
So if I just write the
two delta function part,

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.180
and I'm going to take the
inverse Fourier transform.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:32.380
So inverse Fourier transform,
or m over 2, [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:39.060
OTF at 1 over capital lambda,
delta u, 1 over capital lambda,

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:45.040
plus H complex conjugate,
capital lambda, delta u plus 1

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:45.950
over capital lambda.

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:56.310
Then what is-- inverse
Fourier transform [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:56.310 --> 01:07:00.880
function is going
to be exponential.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.300
And [INAUDIBLE] do we scale it?

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.370
So [INAUDIBLE] just outside.

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:09.830
And I'm going to have H
of 1 over capital lambda,

01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:17.880
and exponent e to the I2pi,
x over capital lambda,

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.910
plus H complex conjugate,
1 over capital lambda.

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:27.090
e to the minus I2pi,
x over capital lambda.

01:07:32.956 --> 01:07:40.820
And I can write as
capital lambda--

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:45.110
1 over capital lambda, e
to the I2pi, x over lambda.

01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:48.230
Plus-- actually the same thing--

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:53.570
H, 1 over capital lambda, e
to the I2pi, x over lambda.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.600
And complex conjugate like this.

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:07.070
So what happens if you add
A and its complex conjugate?

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:14.290
So for example, this is A, and
this is A complex conjugate.

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:17.720
And if you add them
together, then you

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:28.189
get only rear path, because
two rear paths over A.

01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:38.899
So then I'm going to have
m, the rear path of OTF

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:47.560
at 1 over capital lambda,
to the I2pi x over lambda,

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:53.040
which I can write
as m, and negative--

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.290
this H is just non-zero.

01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:58.600
So it could have--

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.310
I mean, it can have only 0 or
minus [INAUDIBLE] basically.

01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:04.930
So I can write it
as negative here.

01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:09.939
And this [INAUDIBLE]
cosine 2pi, x over lambda.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:20.010
So that's why the output
intensity is just 1

01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:23.520
plus m, which is
original modulation.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.630
But I add extra modulation
due to OTF and cosine term.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:40.229
Should I prove why
OTF is Hermitian?

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:54.900
Yeah, let me prove
why OTF is Hermitian.

01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:07.540
So OTF is auto-correlation
of ATF, which is like this.

01:10:10.246 --> 01:10:14.450
And integration with the
integral form I can write as H

01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:22.003
of u prime, H complex
conjugate, u prime minus u,

01:10:22.003 --> 01:10:22.920
and [INAUDIBLE] prime.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:29.290
And how to compute H--

01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:33.850
I mean OTF and complex
conjugate of u.

01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:37.280
So I can write as--

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.020
the total thing--

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:46.600
H of u prime, H complex
conjugate u prime u, u prime,

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.720
and complex conjugate.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.580
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:49.510
SE BAEK OH: Yes?

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:52.700
AUDIENCE: We're not able to
see what you are writing.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.027
SE BAEK OH: Oh, it's too small?

01:10:55.027 --> 01:10:55.735
AUDIENCE: OK now.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.400
SE BAEK OH: So I just
take the complex conjugate

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:02.110
on both sides.

01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:09.050
And I can chain the
complex conjugate.

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:15.020
So it's going to be H complex
conjugate of u prime, H,

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.730
and u prime and u, and du prime.

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:21.870
So I just put the
complex conjugate inside

01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:24.640
of the integration.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.110
And here, I define
the new variable.

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:32.590
So u double prime
is u prime minus u.

01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:39.680
So u prime is u
plus u double prime.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.290
And du prime is actually
du double prime.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:53.190
So this H complex
conjugate is actually

01:11:53.190 --> 01:12:01.510
H complex conjugate,
u plus u double prime,

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:05.430
h of u double
prime, and du double

01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:15.070
prime, which I can write as
integration h u double prime.

01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:23.110
A complex conjugate u
double prime, minus u,

01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:24.460
du double prime.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.990
So it's H of minus u.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:39.460
So this is complex
conjugate Hermitian.

01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:51.010
I just proved you
can easily do that.

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:54.500
So then the bottom line
is at the output plane--

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.710
I mean output intensity,
I have extra modulation

01:12:57.710 --> 01:12:59.720
coming from the OTF.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.640
I mean, you can say
intensity is negative,

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.149
so you can say [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:14.150
So if you compare in terms of
the contrast or visibility,

01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:17.750
so the contrast is
defined by imx minus ime

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:19.550
over imx plus ime.

01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:24.140
But at the output plane, we
have the extra modulation term.

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:27.080
So if you compute
the same thing,

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.460
then actually your
contrast is going

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:34.700
to be at the original
modulation multiplied by MTF

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.526
at the spatial frequency.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:48.170
So MTF is just contrast
at the spatial frequency

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:51.230
relative to the transmission
that we're discussing.

01:13:51.230 --> 01:13:53.280
So what does it mean?

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:59.900
So for example, I have
MTF looks like this.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:03.075
And I initially
had the grating--

01:14:03.075 --> 01:14:05.870
the intensity of the grating
is actually 1 over 2,

01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:08.850
1 plus n, cosine, 2pi,
x over capital lambda.

01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:15.200
So if I draw in grayscale-- so
the white is 1 and black is 0.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.090
So I have nice sinusoid with
a full contrast like this.

01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:22.790
But the output
intensity, I'm going

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:29.420
to have 1 plus m, and additional
modulation, and cosine term.

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:33.450
And this factor, you
can find [INAUDIBLE]..

01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:36.170
So if you have the 1
over capital lambda,

01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:40.300
then you can find the
value at that point--

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.910
I mean MTF at this point.

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:47.810
So if that value is
0.6 in this case,

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:52.070
this sinusoidal pattern
will look like this.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:58.340
But if the modulation is
0.2, then the black becomes

01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:00.320
brighter and white
becomes darker.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.770
So you kind of get
the grayscale--

01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:06.810
[INAUDIBLE] version of
the gradient like this.

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:12.170
So basically, this MTF tells
you what kind of contrast

01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:16.820
I expect at this particular
spatial frequency,

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:20.750
and also it specifies the
maximum spatial frequency

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:21.867
you can resolve--

01:15:21.867 --> 01:15:22.700
I mean, you can see.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.149
Any questions?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.260
So so far, we just
deal with the idea

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.730
of thin lens with
a clear aperture,

01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:49.550
like the rectangular
aperture is a clear aperture.

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:52.400
So in the case of the
rectangular aperture,

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.670
we know that the OTF is just
auto-correlation of the two

01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:58.940
[INAUDIBLE] functions which
is just triangular function.

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:03.260
So it's linear from
1 to color frequency,

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:07.310
which is twice of the
[INAUDIBLE] frequency at OTF--

01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:08.990
the ATF.

01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:11.060
And if you have the
circular aperture,

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:15.410
it's almost linear
except at the [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:18.560
you have slightly curved line.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.420
But it's the same thing.

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:27.750
So this blue line and the
black line we call defraction

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:32.630
limited OTF, because we
assume the idea of a thin lens

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.070
without any aberration.

01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:40.170
So this is kind of best
OTF you can achieve.

01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:43.790
But in practice, you
always have aberration--

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:46.310
chromatic aberration,
or any high aberration.

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:53.300
Or you can have a defocus, or
some imperfect factor in lens.

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:57.140
So typically, the
typical lens has

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:01.670
this kind of distorted or
degraded OTF like this.

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:03.426
The red one right here or here.

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:10.550
So in terms of this
defraction limited,

01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:14.780
you want to buy a lens that OTF
is similar to this blue line,

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.080
because this is
defraction limited,

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.386
which means the best
OTF we can achieve.

01:17:21.386 --> 01:17:23.650
And [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:35.260
So I describe-- I mean,
this is slope is linear,

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:39.670
and circular aperture.

01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:45.500
I mean, locally, it can
have a higher value,

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:50.270
but the overall shape should
be smaller than this blue line.

01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:09.740
So let's just apply all these
concepts in [INAUDIBLE] system.

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:13.260
So we have first system
whose focal length f1, f2.

01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:15.720
And I put the
input transparency,

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.520
which is a binary [INAUDIBLE]
grading right here.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.860
And illuminate with the
quasi-monochromatic which

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:24.650
is on a single color,
and spatial [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:30.460
illumination, and [INAUDIBLE] we
assume the intensity variation

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.240
is uniform.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:37.120
So the possible question
is what kind of image

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:44.170
we can expect at the image
plane, or what is the OTF,

01:18:44.170 --> 01:18:49.210
or what is ATF, and
blah, blah, blah.

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:50.350
So let's go through it.

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:59.140
So this is the binary
amplitude grating.

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:03.510
So it is still complex
transparency in here.

01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:06.690
So if you have
[INAUDIBLE] illumination,

01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:08.650
you want to compute
the intensity.

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:11.470
So you have to take
the negative scale.

01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:15.120
So this is just 0 or 1,
so basically you have

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.070
the same thing in intensity.

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:24.900
So that's the input
intensity at the upper right.

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:30.210
And this is the phase mask
located at the rear plane.

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:35.030
And we know that the ATF is
basically the same function

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:41.470
with different coordinates.

01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:45.580
So ATF is phase mask,
but the function

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.710
is the x double
prime-- well, I mean

01:19:47.710 --> 01:19:49.710
you have this coordinate
scaling vector.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.830
So if you compute the
OTF from this ATF,

01:19:56.830 --> 01:20:03.330
basically, what you do is you
have two [INAUDIBLE] functions.

01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:06.610
So you will have actually
4 [INAUDIBLE] functions.

01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:10.450
And you move toward them,
so whenever they overlap,

01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:13.030
you get some value.

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:16.270
So if could do the
auto-correlation,

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:19.750
then actually you're going
to have three triangular.

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:24.550
But remember, if you have
the [INAUDIBLE] function,

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:26.330
then you move two
[INAUDIBLE] function.

01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:29.750
So you're going to
have one triangular.

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:32.560
So since we have two [INAUDIBLE]
functions, so whenever

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:36.670
they first [INAUDIBLE],, then
we have the one triangle.

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:40.240
But the second and the
two [INAUDIBLE] functions

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.880
overlap, then we have
the center triangle.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.480
And like this, we
another triangle, so

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.140
we get three triangles.

01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.750
So that's the OTF.

01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:59.400
And if you expand with the
Fourier series of your input

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.890
intensity, then we're going
to have an infinite number

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:03.000
of diffraction.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.910
But in ATF case, we
have only first order

01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:11.640
and the minus first
order, and minus

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.270
first order going
to be transmitted.

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:17.320
But in OTF, actually,
they are blocked.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.294
[INAUDIBLE]

01:21:19.294 --> 01:21:23.340
Actually, plus 2,
and 0, and minus 2,

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.412
they are going to
be transmitted.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:34.420
So you just multiply these
three delta functions

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:37.930
by the value of the ATF--

01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:40.000
this, this, this.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.260
And the Fourier transform
will be your output intensity,

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.950
which is this.

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:53.200
So 1 over 3 just came from the
central [INAUDIBLE] function,

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.430
because this is 1--

01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:56.530
so just 1 over 3.

01:21:56.530 --> 01:22:04.450
And for the first order,
at the 0.1 and minus 0.1

01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:08.500
micrometer [INAUDIBLE],,
actually they have 0 value.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.100
So I multiply by 0.

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:16.450
And for the second order,
I have one over 2 which

01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:21.400
is this value here and here.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:25.672
So that is the [INAUDIBLE]
of the output intensity.

01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:32.140
So if you compute the
inverse Fourier transform

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:35.770
of this equation, then we
are going to have 1 over 3,

01:22:35.770 --> 01:22:39.730
and 1 over 2, and
two exponent here

01:22:39.730 --> 01:22:45.970
which is actually
cosine like this.

01:22:45.970 --> 01:22:48.160
So in terms of
grayscale image, we

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.570
have the binary
amplitude grating,

01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:54.260
which varies just black
or white like this.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.950
But if you go through
this [INAUDIBLE] system

01:22:56.950 --> 01:23:00.520
at the image, we're going to
have this kind of grayscale

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:06.910
because contrast is just 0.1034.

01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:09.460
So it's very little.

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:14.770
And the average value is
about 0.33 or something.

01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:19.120
So basically, it looks gray
with a little wiggling.

01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:26.830
So ATF basically
tells you the contrast

01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:29.311
of the particular
spatial frequency.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.760
So, yeah.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.390
What happened-- I mean,
the orders at this side.

01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:51.926
So if my OTF is 0, then what
kind of image I can expect?

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:52.854
It's black?

01:23:55.353 --> 01:23:56.270
It's not light, right?

01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:00.910
So if it is 0--

01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:03.535
I mean if the
values are 0, then--

01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:13.130
so I still have [INAUDIBLE]
so some kind of grayscale.

01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:16.150
So I don't see any [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.880
OTF is auto-correlation,
so you always

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:26.020
have 1 at the dc frequency.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.460
Because if you move
the two functions,

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.810
so when they exactly
overlap, you always

01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:31.770
have the maximum value.

01:24:31.770 --> 01:24:38.810
So you always have
[INAUDIBLE] system.

01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:41.840
And actually, that is very
different in current case.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.770
So in ATF case, you can actually
cancel [INAUDIBLE] system,

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:45.820
right?

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.860
But OTF, you can not
cancel the system,

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:49.400
because it's auto-correlation.

01:24:55.670 --> 01:25:01.370
So again, we have some
relation with the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:06.870
So this particular
circular aperture,

01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:09.650
if I eliminate the
coherent illumination,

01:25:09.650 --> 01:25:10.910
then this is the image--

01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:11.940
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.550
SE BAEK OH: Yes?

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:16.870
AUDIENCE: In Singapore
slide, the [INAUDIBLE] slides

01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:18.500
are not [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:29.440
SE BAEK OH: Maybe
it takes time or--

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:35.750
AUDIENCE: No, it even didn't
show that input and output

01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:38.885
image when you explained
about that contrast.

01:25:42.286 --> 01:25:45.170
SE BAEK OH: Just let
me ask [INAUDIBLE]..

01:25:45.170 --> 01:25:49.030
Hello, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:50.010
AUDIENCE: Yes?

01:25:50.010 --> 01:25:51.330
SE BAEK OH: Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:55.960
It's frozen.

01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:02.330
SE BAEK OH: I think they're
going to reset the system.

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:09.150
So let me just
take a few moments.

01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:10.060
Any questions so far?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.450
[INAUDIBLE]

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:34.851
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:36.540
SE BAEK OH: So actually--

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:37.505
yeah?

01:26:37.505 --> 01:26:39.380
AUDIENCE: What happens
when you [INAUDIBLE]??

01:26:41.888 --> 01:26:43.930
SE BAEK OH: Actually, I'm
going to talk about it,

01:26:43.930 --> 01:26:48.760
but in general, if you use
the incoherent light, then

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:52.337
you don't see any phase
effects because [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:52.337 --> 01:26:53.170
the negative square.

01:26:53.170 --> 01:26:55.673
So it doesn't really matter.

01:26:55.673 --> 01:26:56.590
So you don't see any--

01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:58.510
I mean, you barely
see some variation,

01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:02.573
but usually it's not
dramatic as [INAUDIBLE]..

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.697
And what was I about to say?

01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:20.220
Oh, yeah-- so MTF is just
magnitude of the OTF.

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:24.390
So we haven't talk about
any phase of the OTF.

01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:26.790
So what's the effect of the--

01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:31.230
I mean, what does
it mean if I have

01:27:31.230 --> 01:27:32.540
some phase variation in OTF?

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.660
Can you guess?

01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:40.630
So for example, OTF
is always non-zero.

01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:44.540
It's always 0 or positive.

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:49.390
But its phase can be 0 or pi.

01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:52.130
So what if I have pinhole
phase shift in OTF?

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:04.950
For example, I have sinusoidal
grating, and at the output

01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:06.430
I have a sinusoidal grating.

01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:09.430
But what does it mean I
have the pi phase shift?

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:33.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:35.160
SE BAEK OH: Not really.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:39.840
What happens if
you shift by pi--

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.260
I mean if you move
to a cosine by pi?

01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:44.940
You get sine.

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:47.593
So you have cosine pattern here.

01:28:47.593 --> 01:28:49.260
And if you have pi
phase shift, then you

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.790
will have the sine
pattern, which

01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:53.640
means you flip the black
and white of the image.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.400
And I flip the [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.260
So I flip the-- but
still I [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.430
between the black and
white, not the sine/cosine.

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:21.447
[INAUDIBLE] can anybody see
the slide right now, or?

01:29:21.447 --> 01:29:22.030
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.220
I have a question.

01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:30.771
How do you introduce this
pi phase shift in OTF?

01:29:30.771 --> 01:29:33.400
SE BAEK OH: So if you have
pi phase shift in OTF, then

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.250
basically you flip
the black and white.

01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:40.090
So your input image is black--

01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.280
let's say the black,
white, black, white.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:45.450
And your image is going to be
white, black, white, black.

01:29:45.450 --> 01:29:50.470
AUDIENCE: No, my
question is physically,

01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:54.400
how do you introduce that
controllable phase shift

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.030
in OTF?

01:29:57.950 --> 01:30:02.020
SE BAEK OH: So this
ATF can be complex.

01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:06.100
So if you compute
the auto-correlation,

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:10.240
then actually, you can
have negative value of OTF.

01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:14.860
And if you have
the negative value

01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:18.200
in OTF, which means you have
still positive and negative,

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.356
but you have some negative--

01:30:20.356 --> 01:30:23.680
I mean, basically pi phase.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.660
So if you want to do
that kind of thing,

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:28.150
basically, you have some
complex transparency

01:30:28.150 --> 01:30:30.720
at your [INAUDIBLE] mask.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:34.690
But if you have clear aperture,
then you don't get that effect.

01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:48.440
So let me continue this slide.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:53.450
I mean, these three images we
already seen maybe two or three

01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:54.520
lectures ago.

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.000
So this is MIT lecture--

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.590
I mean the image of MIT letters
with the coherent emission.

01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:06.980
And the right two
images obtained

01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:08.930
with the incoherent emission.

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:13.740
So I can notice two
main differences here.

01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:17.090
So if I use the
[INAUDIBLE] emission,

01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:19.310
basically, the
image looks sharper

01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:22.130
than the one with the coherent.

01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:26.330
And that's because
OTF has a higher--

01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:29.270
twice of higher
color frequency even

01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:30.590
though they get attenuated.

01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:33.450
But basically, it can pass
through the higher spatial

01:31:33.450 --> 01:31:38.630
frequency, so that's
why it preserves more

01:31:38.630 --> 01:31:40.240
higher frequency--

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.865
preserves higher frequency.

01:31:43.865 --> 01:31:45.090
And it's same thing here.

01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:50.090
So with the coherent light,
you barely see the letter "I",

01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:53.450
but you can still see the MIT.

01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:57.800
And another difference is
actually if you see "M" or "T",

01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:01.070
there are some variations,
like black or white.

01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:03.620
Some wiggling in MIT here.

01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:08.480
But in coherent case, the
intensity is more like uniform.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.650
You don't see some
weird variation.

01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:14.430
So that's another difference.

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:23.690
So here's the incoherent light.

01:32:23.690 --> 01:32:26.640
So generally, you
don't have the ringing

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:30.840
artifact as I described,
and also no [INAUDIBLE]..

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:35.340
So you're not going to
see any interference.

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.940
And it is higher bandwidth
because the color frequency

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:43.480
is twice higher than the
color frequency in ATF.

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.060
So you can see the
smaller features--

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:54.020
I mean the two points closer.

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.650
You can see the smaller feature.

01:32:58.590 --> 01:33:04.060
But as I answered to
[INAUDIBLE] question,

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:07.690
incoherent image is
insensitive to phase variation.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:14.610
So mostly, we just deal with the
monochromatic, and especially

01:33:14.610 --> 01:33:15.330
incoherent.

01:33:15.330 --> 01:33:18.340
But if you have polychromatic,
which is broadband,

01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:22.110
then you're going to have
some chromatic aberrations.

01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:26.490
But again, you can define
all these OTF, or MTF,

01:33:26.490 --> 01:33:29.410
or point spread functions for
each different wavelength.

01:33:29.410 --> 01:33:32.730
So it just extends this in
a straightforward fashion.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:44.900
It's the end of show,
so any questions?

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:47.450
So the take-home message
of this [INAUDIBLE] lecture

01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:51.450
is if you have
coherent illumination,

01:33:51.450 --> 01:33:55.510
then you have linear
convolution in field.

01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:58.050
But if you have
incoherent case, and you

01:33:58.050 --> 01:34:01.710
have the linear
relation in intensity,

01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:03.720
and for incoherent
light, you have

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:07.400
to deal with the OTF, which
is auto-correlation of ATF.

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:09.865
And that's pretty much about it.

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:19.440
If you don't have questions,
then let's see next Monday.

[CLICKING]

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.000
NANCY KANWISHER:
All right, so we're

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.587
going to talk about number.

00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:16.170
I got a little carried away with
the behavioral work on number

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.623
because I just think
it is so awesome.

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:20.790
And I think it's, frankly,
a little more interesting

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.040
than a lot of the neural work.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.740
So this is going to be sort of
a behaviorally heavy lecture.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.390
But let's start by thinking
about why we have number

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.009
and what we use it for.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.900
And the first
thing to realize is

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.700
that we use concepts of number
and quantity like all the time.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.182
Most obviously, if you're,
say, getting change at a store.

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:43.390
I guess that doesn't really
happen very much anymore.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.510
People are going to forget how
to subtract because they just

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.370
put their credit card
or bump their phone

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.250
or whatever they do.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.610
But anyway, it used
to be that you handed

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.190
over this stuff called money
and that coins came back

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.280
and that was the
subtraction involved.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.970
We use it to tell time
or to fail to tell time,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.310
as in my case this morning.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.410
To choose the larger
of two objects,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.250
that's a continuous
idea of quantity,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.030
not a discrete idea of number.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.880
To choose the shortest line
at a grocery store, right,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.110
and all of those kinds of
things are comparing quantities.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.130
And we also take these basic
ideas of number and quantity

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.140
and we build on them
in modern societies

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.940
to do all kinds of amazing
things like engineering.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.760
Like all of modern science
is highly quantitative,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.440
like all of computer science.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.670
And so these are really
fundamental ideas.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.770
And animals, it turns out,
are capable of mastering

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.030
very simple but sophisticated
understandings of number

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.650
and even arithmetic
computations.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.540
They can learn about order
and number and quantity.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.410
OK, and they need to
for lots of reasons.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.210
So here, just a brief overview
of some of the situations

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.970
where animals need concepts
of number and quantity

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.770
in the wild.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.080
Foraging, right, so
animals spend a lot of time

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.922
rooting around for
food over here,

00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:13.380
rooting around for
food over there,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.650
deciding when to keep rooting
around here despite diminishing

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.910
returns and go somewhere else
where there's unknown pay off,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.960
unknown amounts of food.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.460
So that's a whole math
of foraging behavior.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.400
OK, so that deals with
the rate of return

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.490
of the food at each location
and the amount and the quality.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.180
And you can imagine a whole math
to optimize the amount of food.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.960
They also need to know
about number and quantity

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.620
when they form teams, which
many animals across taxa

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.550
do in different ways.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.050
So schooling fish
can quickly pick out

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.160
the more numerous
school of fish to join.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.987
And that's what they want to
do because your statistics are

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:56.570
better if they're a
predator if you're

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.600
in the larger school than
the smaller school, right?

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.200
So your chance of getting
eaten is reduced just

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.910
dividing by the
number of options.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.670
And then there's
all kinds of animals

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.630
that take into account the size
of groups of their own species

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.870
or other species when making
decisions about how far to run

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.380
or who to chase or
who to predate on

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.280
or who's at risk of
predating upon you.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.160
So lions hunt in teams.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.460
And they have to work together.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.060
They have actually whole
strategic situation

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.700
where different lions play
different parts like a football

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.260
game.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.500
And they have to decide
which groups of predators

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.520
to take on based on
numerical advantage.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.390
And my favorite is the n
plus one frog, the Tungara

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.890
frog that lives in the
rainforest in Puerto Rico.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.420
And it literally one ups
other frogs, the males

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.210
do in trying to
impress the females.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.320
And so what happens is that one
frog will start calling out.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.570
One male frog will
start calling out trying

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.090
to sound all hot to the gals.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.690
And then another frog will
one up him by doing that call

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.050
but elaborating on it
by adding an extra call

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.970
or an extra component.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.955
So for example--

00:04:21.955 --> 00:04:27.180
[FROG CALL] OK, so that's
one dude calling out.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.766
And not to be outdone,
the next guy calls back.

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:37.780
[FROG CALL] And apparently,
if you follow these guys, they

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.760
pretty systematically add one
to the previous frog's call,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.220
right, up to a point.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.800
The point being
approximately four.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.010
So it's not like 100 and 101.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.950
But it happens.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.680
OK, so that's just a broad
overview of some of the cases

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.700
that understandings
of number and quantity

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.370
arise in natural environments
without training.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.270
So we want to know how is
all this computed in the mind

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.020
and brain.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.430
And so what are the foremost
thinkers on this topic

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.260
is Stan Dehaene, shown here.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.620
And he wrote in a very
widely cited book, actually

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.400
review article and book quite
a while ago, 20 years ago,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.210
he said, animals, young
infants, and adult humans

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.450
possess a biologically
determined,

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.240
domain-specific
representation of number.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.488
So this is a very kind of
extreme, hardcore claim.

00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:40.030
We will see at the
end of the lecture

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.700
that he has backed
off that claim.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.090
OK, so a couple of things,
biologically determined,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.720
he's kind of implying
innate, right?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.690
Domain-specific, I've
avoided this phrase,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.880
for the most part, because
it's kind of like jargon

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.600
gobbledygook.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.282
But it's actually so
entrenched in our field

00:05:58.282 --> 00:05:59.740
that it's worth
knowing what it is.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.860
Domain-specific is just this
idea of functional specificity

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.120
that I've been talking about.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.940
But you can apply it to not
just a piece of brain like,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.550
does this patch of brain
process only faces?

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.160
You can also apply it
to a mental process

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.500
even if you don't know what
its actual brain basis is.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.350
So do we have special
mental machinery

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.820
for thinking about
numbers that's

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.420
distinct from our machinery for
face recognition or navigation

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.100
or language or whatever else?

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.410
OK, so that's what
domain-specific means.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.970
And it's worth
knowing because you'll

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.430
encounter it in other contexts.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.410
OK, so in more
detail, Stan says,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.050
a specific neural
substrate, located

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.900
in the left
intraparietal area, is

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.810
associated with knowledge of
numbers and their relations,

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.090
which he defines
as number sense.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.950
The number domain
is a prime example

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.190
where strong evidence points
to an evolutionary endowment

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.250
of abstract, domain-specific
knowledge in the brain

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.620
because there are parallels
between number processing

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.720
in animals and humans.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.790
Again, kind of hardcore claims.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.120
Not just is there this so
he doesn't quite say innate,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.770
but he's strongly
implying innate.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.380
I mean, that's evolutionary
endowment, that

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.180
basically means innate, right?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.240
It's an evolved ability that
lives in a particular part

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.200
of the brain.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.980
OK?

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.660
So who would a thunk, right?

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.243
Number, right?

00:07:17.243 --> 00:07:19.660
You think of number as something
you get taught in school.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.220
But no, he's saying
it's really part

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.000
of your biological endowment.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.480
It has a particular
brain region.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.990
And all of that may be if
not completely independent,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.370
it may exist without
explicit training.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.870
OK?

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.670
So that's quite a claim.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.200
So what does number
sense mean exactly?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.910
Well, what Stan and others in
the field mean by number sense,

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.180
it's a bunch of things.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.085
First of all, the idea
that for human adults

00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:48.210
to have number sense, that
means they can represent

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.350
large numerical magnitudes
without verbal counting, right?

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.850
So counting is an
interesting thing.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.892
But we're going to leave
it aside for the moment.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.200
Number sense is a
more general idea

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.200
that's going to apply
to animals and infants

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.815
without explicit counting.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.190
OK, so you can have some way
of representing that there's

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.065
a lot of things here.

00:08:06.065 --> 00:08:08.970
And there's fewer things there.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.470
Second of all, these
representations

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.870
are approximate.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.510
And the ability to
discriminate two of them

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.910
depends on the
ratio of those two,

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.160
not the absolute difference.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.620
OK, and I'll show you in more
detail what I mean by that.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.450
It's a deep fact
about number sense

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.200
and actually all of
perception, pretty much.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.800
Further, the idea is that these
representations are abstract.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.100
They're not just, say, a
particular visual form.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.169
Like approximately
13 looks like this.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:38.669
No.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.640
They're going to generalize
across modality, OK,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.620
and space and time.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.100
Next, these mental
representations of number

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.870
can be used in operations.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.260
Even without counting and
being explicitly informed,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.150
you can add approximate numbers.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.400
You may be thinking, what
the hell am I talking about?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.050
But I'll show you in a second.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:07.650
So for example, I'm going to
show you two sets of dots next.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.660
And you're just going
to shout out first

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.360
if the first set
of dots had more,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.310
if there were more
dots in the first array

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.930
and second if the second
array had more dots.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:17.430
OK, ready?

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.750
Here we go.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.880
Boom.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.800
Boom.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.400
Second.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:23.910
Duh.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.993
OK, let's try another one.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.693
Duh.

00:09:29.693 --> 00:09:30.360
And another one.

00:09:33.162 --> 00:09:33.990
Uh huh.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.590
Another one.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.270
I noticed the volume decreasing.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.920
And I noticed some hesitancy.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.840
Actually, I'm not
sure about that one.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.190
OK, so how did you do that?

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.410
What did you do?

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.620
Did you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.120
No.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.860
I tried to do it, so there
wasn't time to do that.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.597
How'd you do it?

00:10:03.597 --> 00:10:05.680
AUDIENCE: I kind of tried
to see like the density,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.110
like how close
all the dots were.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.110
NANCY KANWISHER: Mm-hmm.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.590
Mm-hmm.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.673
And did that work for you?

00:10:09.673 --> 00:10:11.610
Did that work OK?

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.015
AUDIENCE: It seems to be OK.

00:10:13.015 --> 00:10:14.890
NANCY KANWISHER: OK,
what Jack is pointing to

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.515
is a really important
thing in thinking

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:18.730
about number, which
is that number

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.040
is confounded with area extent.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.410
How much total yellow
stuff is on the screen?

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.460
And it's confounded
with density.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.090
And this is a big
problem in people who

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.500
want to do research on number.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.500
And so what they usually
do is you can't totally

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.560
unconfound those things.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.850
But you can unconfound
them one at a time.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.090
So you can vary the
size of the objects.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.230
And you can vary the
density across trials.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.343
So no one of those cues will
enable you to do it fully.

00:10:42.343 --> 00:10:44.260
This example isn't great
that way because they

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.750
were all the same size, right?

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.990
OK, but so the point is,
without explicitly counting,

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.950
and God knows what you
do it, how you do it,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.400
you just feel like you have
a sense of roughly how many.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.960
Everybody got that sense?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.150
OK, so that's what we
mean by number sense

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.310
is that sense that you
can just look at something

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.290
and have a sense of
roughly how many.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.420
Like you don't know
if it's 19 or 18,

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.720
but you know it's not 13, right?

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.080
OK, right.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.400
Oh, and you guys all got
quieter when the numbers

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.580
got closer together.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.080
OK?

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.930
It gets harder when the
numbers are closer together.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.657
OK, so in experiments that have
quantified this, lots of people

00:11:24.657 --> 00:11:25.490
have looked at this.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.450
Here's one that I was
involved in way back.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.590
Just like you did,
this is the task here

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.558
that you guys just did.

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:34.100
And here are some
of the data we got.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.433
So let me walk you through this.

00:11:35.433 --> 00:11:38.450
This is accuracy on a bunch
of different comparisons.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.220
16 dots versus 32 dots, people
are pretty much 100% correct.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.060
OK?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.970
This is just normal
human adults.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.980
16 versus 24, great.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.020
16 versus 20, pretty good.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.110
16 versus 18, now
we're really dropping.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.030
16 versus 17, forget it.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.000
Can't do it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.500
OK?

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.790
So performance falls off as the
numbers get closer together.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.300
OK?

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.310
So that's sort of intuitive.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:11.540
But now let's consider these
are all comparing to 16.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.000
Here, we compare to eight.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.630
Eight versus 16.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.830
Eight versus 12.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:16.580
Eight versus 10.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.330
Eight versus nine.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.900
You see the same fall off as
the numbers get closer together.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.920
OK?

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.490
So far, so good.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.690
But now we can ask, what
determines that fall off?

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.090
Is it the absolute
difference or the ratio?

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:36.110
And the way we tell is we plot
the ratio of those two curves,

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.640
and we look at performance.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.090
And we see they are spot
on top of each other.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.670
That tells us that it is not
the absolute difference that

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.440
determines your
ability to do this

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.030
but the ratio of
the numbers of dots.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.530
OK?

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.690
It's sort of intuitive, right?

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.510
But it's amazing how
clear the result is.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.040
Everybody get that?

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.670
OK, so this is a really
deep fundamental fact

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.480
about perceiving
approximate number.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.130
And it's actually,
more generally,

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.690
a fact about perception.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.130
It's called Weber's law.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.980
And it just means that
the discriminability

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.470
of, in this case, two
numbers, two numerosities,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.530
depends on their ratio, not
their absolute difference.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.240
The exact same thing holds for
evaluating which of two stimuli

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.280
is brighter, which of
two objects is heavier,

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.980
which of two sounds is louder.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.810
They all follow.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.430
The ability to do
that is a function

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.490
of the ratio of the, two
not the absolute difference.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.550
Yeah?

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:38.385
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
with the size of the dots?

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:40.010
NANCY KANWISHER: So
in this experiment,

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.510
we varied the sizes every
which way and the density.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.300
As I mentioned before,
you can't completely

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.710
unconfound both size and
density within each trial.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.620
But across trials,
you can muck them up.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.370
So you can ask whether
people are doing it

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.470
by size or by density.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.340
OK?

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.690
And we did all that here.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.880
OK, so this is not shocking yet.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.600
It's just kind of a basic,
deep, clear fact about whatever

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.160
our mental
representation of number

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.650
is, that it's this
approximate thing.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.730
It's pretty good.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:16.950
And its precision scales
with the magnitude.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:22.560
OK, all right, so this has been
quantified in lots and lots

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.820
of experiments.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.560
And this is called
the Approximate Number

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.080
System, or ANS.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.570
And the standard test that's
been used in lots of studies

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.470
to measure people's
kind of number acuity

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.603
is a lot like what
I just showed you.

00:14:36.603 --> 00:14:37.770
You show an array like this.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.340
And you say, are there more
yellow dots or blue dots?

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.710
And people very quickly
say yellow, in this case.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.720
And then you ask for
a case like this.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.940
And they're a little
slower, right?

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.550
And here, you can see that
the sizes have changed

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.160
and have been orthogonalized.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.510
OK, so the ratio of
yellow to blue dots

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.610
is called the Weber
fraction, right?

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.970
This is this idea of Weber's law
that determines your accuracy

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.700
from just that ratio.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.810
And so you can measure people's
Weber fraction, their ability

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.582
to do this task, their
kind of number precision.

00:15:11.582 --> 00:15:13.040
And what you find
is, first of all,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.800
that there's very big
individual differences.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.790
OK?

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.870
Now, this is interesting.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.180
It's like things that we've
seen in other domains.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.160
There are very big
individual differences

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.040
in navigational ability.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.910
There are very big
individual differences

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.610
in face recognition ability.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.790
And in both of
those cases as well,

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:37.100
there are people who are just
so bad at it, from an early age,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.390
that it's like a syndrome.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.170
In this case, it's called
developmental dyscalculia.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.420
I think I didn't fit it into
the navigation lectures.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.200
But there's a whole kind
of developmental disability

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.440
in navigation that's called
developmental topographic

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.040
agnosia.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.550
People were just always
really awful at knowing

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.320
where they are, right?

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.560
And I did mention
developmental prosopagnosia.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.380
People were just always
awful at face recognition.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.040
In each of these cases,
in the apparent lack

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.900
of any evidence of brain
damage and in the absence

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.780
of differences in IQ
or other abilities.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.910
So it seems like each
of those abilities

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.500
has a very broad range.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.030
At the bottom end
of the range, it's

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.390
really kind of affects
your life you're so bad.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.028
And it's unrelated
to other abilities.

00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:26.570
And I think that's
pretty interesting

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.340
because it goes
along with the idea

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.090
that those mental abilities are
really distinct parts of mind

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.930
and brain.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.820
You can have a
crappy number sense,

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.090
and it doesn't mean that
you're bad at other things.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.770
You just have a
crappy number sense.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.120
It's a separate system, right?

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.620
OK.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.470
Approximate number
sense develops slowly.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.210
It's best at age 30.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.010
You guys are still
on the upswing.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.860
We won't talk about me.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.560
This is what do we have here?

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.950
This is Weber fraction.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.910
So the Weber fraction
is what that ratio

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.640
needs to be for you to be fairly
accurate on whatever criteria

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.140
they chose.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.810
And so a small fraction
means you're better.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.380
And so it goes down.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.520
And this is age
here, best at 30.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.599
And this is reaction time,
which goes up for everything.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.420
What a bummer.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.300
Anyway.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.290
Interestingly, early ability
with approximate number

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.710
on this kind of a test
predicts later math ability

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:32.150
with very different
kinds of organized math

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.560
that you learn in school.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.960
So here's a study
that looked at that.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.690
They asked whether this
early approximate number

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.960
sense is predictive of
later arithmetic ability.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.107
And so in this case, they
did a task like this.

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.690
And their measure, they didn't
use the task I just showed you.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.773
This is another thing you
can do with little kids.

00:17:50.773 --> 00:17:51.990
You just flash this up.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.120
And you just ask them,
how many dots are there?

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.800
And they have to
say four, right?

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.420
And you just measure
reaction time.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.710
It's pretty basic.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.540
OK?

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.080
And so then what you do is you
run this on kindergarteners.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.810
And you define groups
that are slow, medium,

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.820
or fast at this task.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.120
OK?

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.360
So then you follow them.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.430
And you look at them
later, in this case,

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.880
at age nine and six years.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.310
And what you see is, even
these older kids, who

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:28.330
are defined by the slow, medium,
or fast group in kindergarten,

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.470
this is now their accuracy
at arithmetic tasks

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.740
four years later.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.180
Yeah?

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.570
So it's not just some
weird little task

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.140
that psychophysicists made
up to measure God knows what.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.200
It's predictive of your
later arithmetic ability.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.920
OK?

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.910
So it matters.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.190
So the speed of this dot
estimation task at kindergarten

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.730
is not associated with later
abilities of other kinds,

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.760
like Raven matrices, which is
one of the standard measures

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.290
in an IQ test, right?

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.970
It's a nonverbal and
non-number kind of task.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.640
Or ability to name digits
or letters or other things

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.670
that you can test
kids on in however old

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.140
they are, nine years.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.860
OK?

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.730
So it's specifically predictive
of later arithmetic ability.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.900
Everybody with me?

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.490
So it matters.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.230
All right, and that suggests
that there would be ways

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.000
to intervene in dyscalculia.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.890
Potentially, you could
catch the kids early

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.420
who are destined
to have a hard time

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.580
and maybe figure out what
you could do about it.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.680
And there are efforts
underway to do that.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.280
OK?

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.780
OK.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.980
OK, so I'm going to show you.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.418
We're exploring these
various number abilities.

00:19:48.418 --> 00:19:50.210
I'm going to show you
something interesting

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.885
about symbolic numbers.

00:19:51.885 --> 00:19:54.260
So far, we've been telling
you about nonsymbolic numbers.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.823
That means just dot arrays.

00:19:55.823 --> 00:19:57.740
Now we're going to deal
with symbolic numbers.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.810
I'm going to flash up
a bunch of numbers.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.230
And you're just going to say
bigger if it's bigger than 65

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.470
or smaller if it's
smaller than 65.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.260
Really easy.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.260
But you're going to shout
it out loud and clear.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.460
Ready?

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.124
Here we go.

00:20:12.124 --> 00:20:13.070
AUDIENCE: Smaller.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.994
NANCY KANWISHER: Good.

00:20:13.994 --> 00:20:14.702
AUDIENCE: Bigger.

00:20:14.702 --> 00:20:15.684
NANCY KANWISHER: Good.

00:20:15.684 --> 00:20:17.650
AUDIENCE: Smaller.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.540
Bigger.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.330
Smaller.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.320
Bigger.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.520
Smaller.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.083
Bigger.

00:20:27.083 --> 00:20:29.500
NANCY KANWISHER: OK, did you
guys see what happened there?

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.960
Did you feel what happened?

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.900
When the numbers get closer
to 65, you're slower.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.570
Now you think about it, why
the hell is that, right?

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.310
If you run this in
Matlab, it's not

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:43.720
going to take longer to tell
you that 63 is smaller than 65

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.100
than it takes to tell you
that eight is smaller than 65,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.610
right?

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.378
I assume.

00:20:49.378 --> 00:20:50.170
I haven't tried it.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.100
But I doubt it.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.720
So what does that mean?

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.450
That means that even
when you are dealing

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.880
with symbolic numbers,
numbers that you

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.550
have this whole elaborate
edifice you've been trained

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.470
on how to operate with these
guys, especially you guys,

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.130
you are still invoking
some kind of notion

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.690
of the continuous quantity.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.940
You haven't totally
left that idea behind

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.770
and moved off into
some abstract space.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:20.410
You're still, even in doing
this very literal, exact

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.050
symbolic number task,
you find it easier

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.550
when the numbers are farther
apart than when they're closer.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.663
Yeah, Talia?

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:31.790
AUDIENCE: Could it be because
of the number you chose?

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.530
So if you chose the
numbers 60, let's say,

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.840
I feel like we
read left to right.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.880
And they maybe
have a good concept

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.660
for the number of
digits that we see.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.590
So when we see a
number like 62, we

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.195
have to read both the digits
instead of just the one.

00:21:47.195 --> 00:21:48.820
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, but all the ones

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.895
I showed were at
least two digits.

00:21:50.895 --> 00:21:51.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.200
But when you read, like when
you see a number like 25,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.580
you see the two.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.440
And then you automatically
like know that.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.815
NANCY KANWISHER:
OK, fair enough.

00:22:00.815 --> 00:22:03.040
OK, that's a good
counter explanation.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.150
But you guys were
slow even with 58.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.590
I think, right?

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.730
We could test that.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.147
I'm pretty sure all this has
been tested pretty carefully.

00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:15.310
I don't know this literature
totally thoroughly.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.320
But I doubt-- it's a
good alternative account.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.612
And there might be some effect.

00:22:18.612 --> 00:22:19.450
But I think it's--

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.060
oh, in fact, in fact,
actually, there is, yeah,

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.680
I have data coming up next.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.550
But right.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.270
Blah, blah.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.250
OK, here's the data.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.720
OK?

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.640
It's pretty continuous.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.660
So I think your good, plausible
alternative doesn't seem

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.230
to capture very much of it.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.730
OK?

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.000
So yeah, this is what
you guys just did.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.583
And does everybody get how this
kind of reveals that even when

00:22:43.583 --> 00:22:45.370
you think you're doing
this kind of more

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.010
symbolic abstract
thing, you're still

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.280
tapping into some kind
of continuous notion?

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.120
Yeah?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.320
OK.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.630
So that says not only
does your ability

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.390
to do that in kindergarten
predict your ability

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.900
to do arithmetic later, it
says, even now as highly trained

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.570
MIT students who do
all kinds of much more

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.280
sophisticated math
than this, you're

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.190
still invoking that same
kind of continuous sense

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.560
of approximate number
or something like it.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.550
OK.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.147
All right, so where
have we gotten?

00:23:15.147 --> 00:23:16.730
We started with this
checklist of what

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.200
number sense might mean.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.010
And I've argued that
you adults can represent

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.640
large numerical magnitudes
without verbal counting,

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.140
that these numbers
are approximate,

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.970
and that your ability
to discriminate them

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.220
depends on the ratio,
not the difference.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.540
And I've sort of
loosely told you

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.040
that these experiments
are generally

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.610
done unconfounded
from things like area

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.850
and that they refer to
the discrete number.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.860
OK, what about these
other questions here?

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.160
I haven't really shown
you how abstract they are

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.610
or whether you can actually use
them in arithmetic operations.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.410
OK, so how would we tell that?

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.690
Well, here's an experiment
that we did way back.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.460
We did the very same
task I did on you

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.730
guys before, which has more,
except the first thing was

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:02.750
an array of dots.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.200
And the second thing
was a series of tones.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.220
OK?

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.090
Series of tones presented
faster than you could count.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.070
Beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, like that, right?

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.090
OK.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.800
And so you might
think that if people

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.260
are doing some literal
perceptual thing that this

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.980
would be just like
freaking impossible, right?

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.240
But it's not.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.280
Accuracy is just
about the same, maybe

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.230
a hair lower, but
almost the same

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.960
with the cross-modal
comparison of which has more

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.380
than with the within modality
one, visual dots to dots

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.443
or tones to tones.

00:24:34.443 --> 00:24:36.110
This is dots to dots
and tones to tones.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.596
And that's across.

00:24:37.596 --> 00:24:39.215
It's a little bit surprising.

00:24:39.215 --> 00:24:41.340
So that shows you that
whatever you're tapping into

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.020
is a pretty abstract
representation.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.370
It's not tied to vision.

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.840
It's not tied to hearing.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.850
And it also
completely eliminates

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.100
worries about density
or area or stuff

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.140
like that because that
doesn't work here at all.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.140
OK?

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:53.640
All right.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.750
OK, can you do
operations on these?

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.250
Sure.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.000
Why not?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.820
You can give people a
dot array and a dot array

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.400
and then tell them to add and
ask whether the sum of those

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.450
is greater or less than that.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.450
Let's try it.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:11.080
OK, here we go.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.870
Everyone ready?

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:19.210
Consider, is the sum of this
plus this greater or less

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.660
than this.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.410
AUDIENCE: Greater.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.000
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.960
OK?

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.060
And I really didn't
leave you time to count.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.830
And so whatever you
were doing in adding,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.930
you weren't adding
symbolic numbers.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.240
You were adding these
approximate amounts.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.900
OK?

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.550
Well done.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.880
And then we could go crazy
and do it across modalities.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.160
I'm going to ask you
to add dots to tones

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.130
and ask whether the sum is
greater or less than that.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.270
We won't do it.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:50.760
But it turns out, people
are just as good at that.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.560
Amazing, huh?

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.240
So where has this gotten us?

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.820
This told us that whatever
this approximate number sense

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.060
that we all have,
it's damned abstract.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.610
You can compare it across
sensory modalities pretty much

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:03.990
as well as within.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:05.820
And you can perform
operations with it.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.720
You can do addition.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.690
And you can also do subtraction
just as straightforwardly.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.330
OK?

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.120
So that's pretty cool.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.080
But in all of these studies
and the demos with you guys,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.900
these are done on people with
years and years of training

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.980
in arithmetic.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.460
And so we really want to
know, are these things--

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.710
is any aspect of
this system innate?

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.450
Is it present in
very young infants?

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.420
And to what extent do
animals have these abilities?

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.268
OK?

00:26:33.268 --> 00:26:35.060
Well, how would we find
out whether they're

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.230
present in infants?

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.480
Well, there's a bunch of ways.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.300
But looking direction
and looking time

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.180
are the key cues you have
with newborn infants.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:49.160
And so here's a study that was
done on four-day-old infants.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.920
And what they did
was they presented--

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.090
they had a
familiarization phase.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.130
This is done cross modally.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.730
OK?

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:02.780
So they present either
sets of 12 sounds,

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:07.490
to, to, to, to, 12, right,
of those, or ra, ra, ra, ra,

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.590
present a bunch of
those to infants.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.580
Or they present sets of four
taking the same total duration,

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.728
to, to.

00:27:15.728 --> 00:27:17.270
It's just a coincidence
that it's to.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.070
This is, I think,
done in French.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:23.960
So anyway, the infants won't
be confused by the sound to.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:30.350
So during that, you then show
the infants these arrays.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:34.230
And you ask what
they look at more.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.840
OK?

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.052
They're not told the task.

00:27:37.052 --> 00:27:38.510
There's no way to
tell them a task.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.520
It's just something they do.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:46.250
And what you find is, in
the four versus 12 case

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.100
like here, that's
four versus 12,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:53.700
the infants look more at
the congruent number then

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.110
the incongruent number.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.610
OK?

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.010
So again, they're
comparing across modality.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.670
They're hearing some
number of syllables.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.060
And they're selectively looking
at the corresponding number

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.400
of visual forms.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.210
No instruction.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:09.960
No nothing.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.070
Four days old.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.180
Amazing.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.140
OK?

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.320
So they can do that if the
comparison is four versus 12.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.650
They can do it if
it's six versus 18.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.330
But they kind of
can't do it very well.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.340
I mean, it's significant,
but it's not very good

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.480
if it's four versus eight.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:25.980
OK?

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.350
So they have some
sense of number.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.920
But it's very approximate.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.420
Yeah?

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.020
AUDIENCE: Did you
say they looked

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.860
at the one that
matches the number,

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.568
or they hear the sound
that goes with it?

00:28:34.568 --> 00:28:35.610
NANCY KANWISHER: Matches.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.260
That's congruent means match.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.450
Looking time on congruent
versus incongruent.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.471
AUDIENCE: Isn't that
kind of different from--

00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:43.015
NANCY KANWISHER:
From adaptation.

00:28:43.015 --> 00:28:43.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:44.590
NANCY KANWISHER: It is.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.257
It is totally different
from adaptation.

00:28:46.257 --> 00:28:49.870
And herein lies a
classic annoyance

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.580
for developmental psychologists.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.250
Because sometimes kids match.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.530
And sometimes they
show adaptation.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.920
And you kind of don't know.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.940
Sometimes you don't know
which way it's going to go.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.575
I don't know.

00:29:04.575 --> 00:29:06.700
Heather, do we have any
insights about how you know

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.825
which way it's going to go?

00:29:07.825 --> 00:29:11.740
Or you just try and experiment
and you find out and yeah?

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.280
Yeah.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:12.780
Yeah.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.458
It does mean you
have to be careful.

00:29:14.458 --> 00:29:16.000
Because if you run
a whole experiment

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.560
on a smallish
number of infants--

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.720
and it's usually hard to
get enough because people

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.310
have to drive in
with their kids.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.610
And this, how do you find them?

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.850
And there's other developmental
labs who have all the kids.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.808
And it's like you're
always running experiments

00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:29.470
with barely enough kids, right?

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.330
And so that means
there's a problem here.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:34.750
Because if you would take the
result in either direction,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.460
that's a statistical problem.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.530
You gave yourself two
shots at it, right?

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:42.490
And so you have to statistically
discount your finding

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.380
because it could
have gone either way.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.863
That is if your
prior hypothesis is

00:29:45.863 --> 00:29:48.280
it has to go in one direction,
you're on stronger footing.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.580
But you just suck it up
and run a few more kids.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.990
Yeah?

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.230
OK, so good.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:00.595
So this also shows that
ratio dependence, right?

00:30:00.595 --> 00:30:02.470
They're better at it
with the big differences

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.890
than the small differences.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:04.390
OK?

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:11.240
OK, so that's infants having
this very, very early, at least

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.740
in very crude form.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.170
What about animals?

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:18.710
OK, so let's meet
Mercury the macaw.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.105
Here's Mercury the macaw.

00:30:20.105 --> 00:30:20.772
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:20.772 --> 00:30:22.550
- To a human, the
order of the symbols

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.487
shown on the above
screen are obvious.

00:30:24.487 --> 00:30:26.945
We have all learned from a
young age which of these symbols

00:30:26.945 --> 00:30:27.170
represented--

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:27.290
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:27.980
NANCY KANWISHER: Oh,
what a good birdie.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.647
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:28.647 --> 00:30:31.280
- --the lowest number
and which the highest.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.360
However, for Mercury, the
blue-headed macaw we see here,

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.430
he has had to learn
by trial and error

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.680
the specific order to
press these symbols to get

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.240
a piece of food.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.480
It took him quite a long time.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.810
Mercury's brother Mars can
do a bit better than that.

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.180
He has begun to learn
the more general concept.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.640
That is the symbols will
always have an order.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.640
So when presented
with a new list,

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.240
he was able to rapidly
decipher the order

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.710
of new symbols, in
this case kingfisher,

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.040
warhead, hawk, hummingbird.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.990
Pressing randomly
on the screen would

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.870
have led to him receiving the
correct answer less than 1%

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:09.890
of the time.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.050
He's clearly doing
better than that.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:15.080
This is interesting, as it
shows the very basic aspects

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.390
of cognition related
to numbers are

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:19.610
present in an animal
that is very distantly

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.694
related to humans.

00:31:21.694 --> 00:31:22.580
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.780
NANCY KANWISHER: OK,
mostly, I just showed

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.738
that because it's cute.

00:31:24.738 --> 00:31:26.780
But it's impressive ordering.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.290
OK?

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.120
Still, he's kind of slow.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.180
I think it only goes
up to four things.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.930
OK, so now we're going
to meet the chimp Ayumu,

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.600
who lives in Kyoto and
who's the son of a very

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.020
famous chimp named Ai,
who was like a number wiz.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.105
But anyway, here's Ayumu.

I can only catch
the first three.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.628
And then it's like I can't
even tell if he's correct,

00:31:58.628 --> 00:32:01.460
except from the tone.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.120
Pretty good.

NANCY KANWISHER:
Oh, got one wrong.

00:32:20.818 --> 00:32:22.110
Anyway, mostly gets them right.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.210
Pretty impressive, huh?

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.680
OK, so that's cool.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.720
And order is clearly relevant.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.740
It's part of the space.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.190
But it's not the same as
quantity or number, right?

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.700
OK, so now we're going
to skip to the honeybee,

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.650
just for kicks because
this paper just

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:38.890
came out a month ago.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.320
And I think it's awesome.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.837
Honeybees have 1
million neurons.

00:32:43.837 --> 00:32:45.670
And if you're impressed,
don't be impressed.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.600
Remember like a mouse
has 100 million.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.370
And we have 100 billion.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:51.960
OK?

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.460
Six orders of magnitude.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.670
OK, so 1 million
is like not-- no.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.910
eight orders of magnitude.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:01.020
So 1 million is not
that many, right?

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.000
OK, and further, these
guys branched off

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.800
from us, evolutionarily,
a very long time ago,

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.240
600 million years ago.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.120
So they're tiny
little guys, not very

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.220
many neurons, totally
different kind of thing.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.430
Who would think they have any
kind of numerical abilities?

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.360
Of course, they wouldn't, right?

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.130
Oh, and yet, they
can do arithmetic.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.750
OK, so here's the design.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.840
So here's what these guys
did, this wonderful lab

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.440
in Australia.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.220
I love this stuff.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.680
OK, so they trained
these honeybees.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.710
This was a chamber like this.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.390
Honeybees fly into the chamber.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.360
And they see a number
in a color right here.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.090
It's blue.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:37.920
And it's two.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.580
OK?

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.410
And then there's a
little entry hole.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.900
And they can choose
to play or not play.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.050
If they go into the
chamber, then they're

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.940
in this interior
space, where they

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.480
get to make a choice between
that pattern and that pattern.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.380
OK?

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.360
And there's a little pole
underneath each pattern.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.690
And if they light and
they land on the pole,

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:59.500
they can get some liquid.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.000
OK?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.500
So in the blue case, they're
rewarded over trials.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.330
That if it's blue,
that means they

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.406
should add one to this number.

00:34:08.406 --> 00:34:10.239
And hence, that would
be the correct answer.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.460
And that's the incorrect answer.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.180
OK?

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.290
That would be amazing.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:15.520
Yeah?

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.020
And if they choose
the wrong number,

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.540
they get some nasty quinine.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.770
OK?

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:26.020
All right, in contrast, if
the shape out front is yellow,

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.090
then they have to subtract.

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.310
So that means they have to
keep track of this number

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:34.005
and go in there and choose
that number minus one.

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:35.949
All right?

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:40.150
OK, so keep in mind, oh, so they
balance the total surface area.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:41.650
It doesn't look
like in this figure.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.659
But it says in the
method section they did.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:45.699
I believe them.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:49.480
And further, realize that
when the bee is in here,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.980
he has to be holding that number
in memory and adding one to it

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.960
or subtracting one to it to
figure out what to choose here.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.600
So this is pretty sophisticated.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.780
It's not like they're
side by side, right?

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.740
OK, and yet, they're
pretty good at it.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.900
Here's accuracy over
training trials.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.320
By 100 trials, they're
over 80% correct.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.270
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:19.580
OK, so then, in any good animal
or infant cognition study,

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.530
you want to show
whether it generalizes.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.740
So then they test the same
ability with new numbers.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.120
I forget what this range was.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.200
But it went one to four
or something like that.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.210
And then they go to five or six,
just to generalize the numbers,

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.330
and different shapes than were
used in the training trial.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:39.080
And the accuracy
is around mid 60s.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.438
It's not quite as good.

00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:41.480
But it's still very good.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.897
They're not being
reinforced here.

00:35:42.897 --> 00:35:44.720
And they're still
doing the task.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.520
Now, what are the
pink and blue bars?

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.420
OK, so you might think,
well, is a bee just

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.170
going to the one that
has more or less?

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.140
So instead of
learning add one, he's

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.200
learned go to the larger
number, larger than the one

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.060
that you saw at
the entry chamber,

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.590
or go to the smaller number.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.870
But no, that's not
what they're doing.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:06.800
Because the pink bars
show the performance

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.980
when both of the options are
in the same direction, right?

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.160
So the thing is blue.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.140
So he's doing addition.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.250
And he sees a two.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:19.520
And he goes in, he has a
choice between three or four.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.980
He can only do that if
he knows the difference

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.050
between adding one
and just taking

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.360
the thing that has more, right?

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.200
And he's well above
chance in the pink bars.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.750
OK, so he's not
just saying, choose

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.790
the one that has more or
the one that has less.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:37.650
He's adding one,
pretty accurately,

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:38.870
I mean sort of accurately.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.510
Better than chance.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.540
OK?

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.660
All right, now
that's pretty cool.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.950
But adding one,
subtracting one, it's cool.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:54.060
But do they really
have abstract concepts?

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:58.470
Do they understand
the concept of zero?

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.428
OK, so paper was
published last year

00:37:00.428 --> 00:37:02.220
arguing that they have
the concept of zero.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.840
Here's how it goes.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.390
Same lab trains
them, in this case,

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.950
just on greater
than or less than.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.880
So the bees are given
a choice like this.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.580
And one set of bees is
trained on greater than

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.940
and one is trained on less than.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.110
So this set of bees trained
on greater than chooses

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.650
this one and then this one
and then this one and so on.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.060
OK?

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.790
Another set of bees is
trained to do the opposite.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:27.750
All right?

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.910
OK, so that's the
training phase.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.820
Then we want to test in
a generalized situation.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.930
So now they're tested
with different shapes

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:41.547
and different numbers,
so threes and fours were.

00:37:41.547 --> 00:37:42.630
Maybe threes weren't used.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.930
I forget.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.222
There's some numbers in here
that were not used before.

00:37:45.222 --> 00:37:48.360
OK, so you test them
with new shapes.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.200
And here is accuracy for
less than or greater than.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.400
Chance is 50%.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.410
And they're 75%.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:56.790
Not bad.

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:57.630
OK?

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.120
So they get more
than or less than.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.260
OK, now we want to test
the generalization.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.220
OK, oh, yes, sorry.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.270
This is where they changed
the range of numbers.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:11.013
So the bees had not
dealt with sixes before.

00:38:11.013 --> 00:38:13.055
So now they still have to
do greater than or less

00:38:13.055 --> 00:38:16.880
than with a new numerical range.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.430
And they're still
well above chance.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.530
OK?

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.330
So then finally, they test zero.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.350
OK?

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:30.070
So the bees that
have to do less than

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.610
have to say which of those
is correct, all right?

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.800
And you can see--

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.980
where did it go?

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.910
Where's the zero one?

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:40.667
Right here.

00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:42.250
And they're well
above chance for both

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.440
less than and greater than.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.250
OK?

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.960
So we could quibble
about whether that's

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.400
a concept of zero.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.860
But the cool thing is these
bees had not been tested

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.840
with a blank card before.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:58.510
And they spontaneously get the
idea that that is less than one

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.400
or two or three
or anything else.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.970
Yeah?

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:05.060
So arguably, they
have a concept of zero

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.390
with no training and
only 100 million neurons.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.810
OK, so all of that is
in trained animals.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:16.500
And we can see some of
these kinds of abilities

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.210
even with untrained animals.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:21.300
And I will tell you just
one more animal experiment

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.077
because it's my
all-time favorite ever

00:39:23.077 --> 00:39:24.660
and the simplest one
in the whole set.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.140
This was done a long time
ago by Church and Meck.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.140
So here's what they did.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.310
This is done in rats.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:30.900
They have a training
phase, where

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.510
they train the rats
to press the two

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:37.830
lever if they see two light
flashes or hear two sounds.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.110
And they press another
lever, the four lever

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.910
if they see four lights
or hear four sounds.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:43.410
OK?

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.957
That's kind of basic
animal training.

00:39:44.957 --> 00:39:45.540
It's a rodent.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.415
They're good at this.

00:39:46.415 --> 00:39:47.470
No big deal.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.680
But then after the
animals have learned this,

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.190
they spontaneously throw,
in the testing phase,

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:56.720
a trial with two
lights and two sounds.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.540
And the rats press the
four lever, first time.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.290
No training.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:01.160
No nothing.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.600
Spontaneous addition.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.430
Spontaneous abstraction
across tones and lights.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.200
Pretty awesome, huh?

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.110
So it's not just that you
can reveal these abilities

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.580
with elaborate training.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.030
OK, so we have all of these
different kinds of evidence

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:20.860
of an abstract number sense.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.380
And they're present
in newborn infants.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.150
And they're present in animals.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.210
And they just seem to be part of
our basic cognitive machinery,

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:31.040
machinery that we
share with animals.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.600
So how are they
implemented in the brain?

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.440
OK, so a little neuroanatomy
reminder of some basics.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.060
This is a weird
angle of a brain.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.490
It's kind of like this,
kind of back of the head,

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.048
front of the head,
temporal lobe,

00:40:44.048 --> 00:40:45.340
frontal lobe around the corner.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.900
Everybody oriented?

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.690
There is one of the longest
sulci in the brain that

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:50.748
starts about here.

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:51.790
On me, it goes like this.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.290
And it curves around like that.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:53.915
It's back here.

00:40:53.915 --> 00:40:54.700
It goes up.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.930
And it curves over.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:56.650
OK?

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.660
It's called the
intraparietal sulcus.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.310
And I mention that
just because it's

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.050
in a lot of the
number literature.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.650
You saw it in the paper you
guys read for last night.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:09.130
And above it is the
superior parietal lobule.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:11.320
And below it is the
inferior parietal lobule.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.110
And none of that matters other
than that a lot of the action

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.480
is in the parietal
lobe, particularly up

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.490
here around the
intraparietal sulcus.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:19.780
OK?

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.780
All right, so studies
that have looked at this

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.460
includes some classical studies
of patients with brain damage

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.950
and something called acalculia.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.650
That means loss of
ability to calculate.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.430
OK?

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:38.140
And so there's two
basic kinds of acalculia

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.330
that are really
interestingly different.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.690
So there's one
acalculic patient who

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:46.210
has left parietal lobe damage,
that same region I just

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:47.990
talked about.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:49.970
And this person is
bad at approximation.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:53.980
So the kinds of dot array
tasks that I gave you guys,

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.900
this guy, after brain
damage right here,

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.150
is really bad at
that kind of stuff.

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:01.960
And interestingly, he's
more impaired on subtraction

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.830
than multiplication.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:08.620
So for example, hes worse
at, what is seven minus five

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.745
than what is seven times five?

00:42:11.745 --> 00:42:13.120
So think about
that for a moment.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.100
And think about what
that might mean,

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:19.160
especially in light of another
acalculic patient who has

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.410
a very different presentation.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.720
He's got left temporal damage.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.400
His approximation is fine.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.310
So all those kind of dot array
kind of tasks and tone tasks

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.250
that I told you
about, he's good at.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.110
This guy shows the opposite.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:33.850
He's more impaired
at multiplication

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.910
than subtraction.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.720
So do you guys have any--
oh, so first of all,

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.130
you put these two patients
together, and what do you have?

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:45.980
AUDIENCE: Double dissociation.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.240
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah?

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:46.480
What?

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.140
AUDIENCE: Double dissociation.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.190
NANCY KANWISHER:
Double dissociation.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.690
Right.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:52.060
Two patients with opposite
patterns of deficit, right?

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.523
If we just had one, then we
could maybe tell a story.

00:42:54.523 --> 00:42:55.690
But it wouldn't really know.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.013
But we have two, and they
have opposite patterns.

00:42:58.013 --> 00:43:00.430
And now that really kind of
constrains the interpretation.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.930
David.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.700
AUDIENCE: Can the
first person add fine?

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.440
NANCY KANWISHER: Good question.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.908
He's not very good at adding.

00:43:06.908 --> 00:43:07.450
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:43:10.207 --> 00:43:11.290
NANCY KANWISHER: Thoughts?

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:13.050
What do you think it means?

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:18.430
AUDIENCE: It might mean that
the addition and subtraction

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:22.345
[INAUDIBLE] use the same like--

00:43:22.345 --> 00:43:23.470
NANCY KANWISHER: Used what?

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:25.283
AUDIENCE: Like they
use the same area.

00:43:25.283 --> 00:43:26.200
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.140
So one hypothesis is that
addition and subtraction

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.945
are just a different
beast than multiplication.

00:43:31.945 --> 00:43:33.820
Different parts of the
brain do those things.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.260
Totally possible.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.750
But there's a kind of more
intuitive interpretation.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:40.450
AUDIENCE: Well, I think people
tend to memorize times tables.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:41.680
NANCY KANWISHER: Bingo.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.200
Bingo.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.200
Often, like the right
answer is something that's

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.010
like right in front of you.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:46.885
Just think about, what
is it like to do that?

00:43:46.885 --> 00:43:48.400
How do you do seven times five?

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.560
You don't think about the
meanings of the numbers.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.750
You just blurt out 35.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.020
Right?

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.520
Right?

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.640
It's not a very
rich number task.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.810
I mean, it's a number task.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.680
But it's a concrete, rote,
verbally memorized thing.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.880
Right?

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:11.200
And so the idea is that those
verbalized concrete number

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.960
facts are in one domain.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.060
One set of brain damage
would impair those.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.800
And it's a different
thing to impair

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.770
the actual representation
of numerosity.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:25.090
And the idea is
that this person is

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:28.460
the one with the real damage to
the approximate number system.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:28.960
Right?

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:29.740
Yeah?

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.920
AUDIENCE: Does that mean
that patient can be it

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.970
is a problem doing the
seven times five normally.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:40.730
But when they ask for
summing seven for five times,

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.113
they're not very good.

00:44:42.113 --> 00:44:43.030
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.822
Well, I think the
approximate number system

00:44:44.822 --> 00:44:49.750
might have a tough time dealing
with summing seven five times.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.610
So yeah, it has limits, right?

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:54.550
It can deal with it can
add two approximate things.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.183
But you might really
lose your mind

00:44:56.183 --> 00:44:57.850
if you tried to do a
whole string of it.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:58.370
Yeah?

00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:59.762
Yeah?

00:44:59.762 --> 00:45:01.720
AUDIENCE: If he was
working on the same digits,

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.260
like maybe seven plus
seven or seven minus seven,

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:08.860
expect him to maybe
do that fairly easily

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.010
if that's the case, right?

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.390
NANCY KANWISHER: Say more.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:16.240
AUDIENCE: If it's a case
that his approximate--

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.510
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:18.010
Yeah.

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:19.600
AUDIENCE: He should be able
to do seven minus seven

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.100
fairly easy.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.268
Because you know that when
you subtract the same things,

00:45:23.268 --> 00:45:24.310
you're going to get zero.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:24.760
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.170
But it's an interesting
question, actually,

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:28.000
whether that would be
part of that system

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.700
or whether that's kind of
more abstract formal thing you

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.200
learn.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.607
So I think it depends
how you do it, right?

00:45:34.607 --> 00:45:35.440
So one of the ways--

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.482
I didn't talk about this.

00:45:36.482 --> 00:45:39.940
But those same
experiments adding, say,

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.660
adding dots to dots, those were
also done with little kids.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.622
And there, what you
do is you show--

00:45:45.622 --> 00:45:47.080
I don't really
remember what it is.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.880
But you show some
array of things,

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.320
and you hide it behind a screen.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.270
And then you show another array
and hide it behind the screen.

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:53.562
And then you reveal the screen.

00:45:53.562 --> 00:45:55.750
Like how many things are there?

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:59.800
That kind of stuff
works spontaneously.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.175
So it might tap
into that system.

00:46:02.175 --> 00:46:03.800
I think that's an
interesting question.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.250
I'm not totally sure
how it would go.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:06.750
Yeah?

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.125
AUDIENCE: So the
second person is

00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:09.450
bad at recall across the board?

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.710
Or is it just with numbers?

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:11.790
NANCY KANWISHER:
Just with numbers.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:12.180
Yeah.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.590
I mean, there's always
a little bit messy.

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.990
The patient literature is always
like some other random stuff.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.470
And how do you account for that?

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:19.110
And there's lesions
in other places.

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.450
But to a first
approximation, these

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:24.585
are reasonably
number-specific deficits.

00:46:24.585 --> 00:46:26.190
All right?

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:29.098
OK, so that's a
bit of a hint from

00:46:29.098 --> 00:46:30.390
the neuropsychology literature.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.600
But there's mainly
these two patients

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.420
and some other
like messier ones.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.710
And so one wants
to use neuroimaging

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.140
to get a better picture of it.

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.140
Of course, that's been
going on for a long time.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.520
And so here's one of the early
papers from Stan Dehaene's lab.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.070
This is a top view of the brain.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:51.480
So this is this parietal zone.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.090
And this is what
is often referred

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:58.200
to as the horizontal segment
of the intraparietal sulcus.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.402
hIPS to its friends.

00:46:59.402 --> 00:47:01.860
And it's that sulcus I talked
about that goes up like this.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:02.970
It kind of curves over.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.650
And it's like this
bit right there.

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.490
OK?

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.035
That little orange strip.

00:47:07.035 --> 00:47:09.660
And so what he's saying in this
review article from a long time

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.090
ago is that that region
is activated only

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:13.470
when you do calculation.

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.170
He means basic
arithmetic in this case.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:20.060
Not when you do all
these other things.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.990
But when this paper came
out, I'm like, yeah, right.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:25.850
I don't think so.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.910
I can't tell you how many
experiments I've run and seen

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:32.510
big ass activations right there
on tasks that have nothing

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:33.470
to do with numbers.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:34.280
So looks good.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.300
Sounded good.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.070
He got away with it for a while.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:38.110
And it's not true.

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:38.873
Yeah?

00:47:38.873 --> 00:47:40.790
AUDIENCE: So is the
reason sort of high enough

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:41.623
that you can zap it?

00:47:41.623 --> 00:47:42.770
NANCY KANWISHER: Terrible.

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:44.240
Being filmed too.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.680
He's a really smart, nice guy.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.972
I just like when people are
a little bit fast and loose

00:47:47.972 --> 00:47:50.960
and make a big claim, which
you can tell at the time

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.785
isn't quite right.

00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:52.910
It's a little bit annoying.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:53.210
Anyway.

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.710
Sorry.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:54.230
Go ahead.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.577
Is the region high enough
that you can zap it?

00:47:56.577 --> 00:47:57.410
NANCY KANWISHER: Ah.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:58.243
We're getting there.

00:47:58.243 --> 00:48:00.410
Yes, indeed, you can.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.330
But let's do a little
more basic stuff first.

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:05.630
OK, so the claim is
that this hIPS thing

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:07.850
is the locus of the
approximate number system.

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.120
That was the early claim.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.620
OK.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.800
And for further, the claim
implicit in this article

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.810
in this figure is
that it's involved

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.150
in numerical
representations only,

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:24.290
not any of these other things,
grasping tasks, manual tasks,

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:27.230
eye-movement tasks, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:31.070
OK, really?

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:33.680
And as I mentioned, like
me and lots of other people

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.780
had seen it looks like
the same regions activated

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.930
in all kinds of other
situations, especially

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.620
those involving reasoning
about spatial location.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:45.823
You guys got short
shrift six weeks ago.

00:48:45.823 --> 00:48:47.990
I meant to talk about the
parietal lobe and its role

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.885
in high-level vision.

00:48:48.885 --> 00:48:50.510
And it just somehow
went by the boards.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:54.110
But all this stuff is
involved in aspects

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:58.040
of vision, particularly spatial
vision, knowing what is where.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.690
OK?

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.190
And so there's an
alternate view,

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:06.140
which is that there's no
specific brain region that's

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:10.760
specifically all only involved
in discrete number per se.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.410
Instead, there's a common
region for processing magnitude

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.560
of almost any dimension,
whether discrete or continuous,

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.470
right, that approximate number
system or your exact number

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:25.570
system, and that it builds
on previous representations

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:26.920
of space.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.260
OK?

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.380
For example, the
number line, right?

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.950
So you guys read this
article for last night.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:36.990
And just to review
what the key point was,

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:40.740
this is, again, the
kind of aerial view

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.120
with the parietal lobe here.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:47.820
And that's the
hIPS region, yeah,

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.410
that was in the previous slide.

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:51.870
And you can see it's this
horizontal part of that sulcus

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.430
way up in the parietal lobe.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.100
And the yellow and
green means that there's

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.370
overlapping activation for both
symbolic calculation, that's

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:02.430
like with symbols, and for
nonsymbolic calculation.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.870
That's like dot arrays
stuff like that, right?

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:08.370
And so it's activated
for both of those.

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:13.950
And the point of this
paper is, first of all,

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:18.900
that there's also overlap with
the eye-movement system, right?

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.000
And so here, they're
really asking,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.340
is this spatial
representation kind

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.310
of co-opted in your
representation of number

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:28.350
using a kind of spatial
number line, right?

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:29.700
It makes perfect sense.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.650
Animals need a
representation of space.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:33.780
It's like extremely
basic, right?

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:37.080
And once you have that, you can
co-opt it and represent numbers

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.660
in that same spatial code.

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.330
And as you guys all read, the
cool result from that paper,

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:47.250
which is also from
Stan Dehaene's lab,

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:51.570
is that when you take that
region right in there,

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:54.390
you take those voxels in
there, and you train them

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.840
on making leftward versus
rightward saccades.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.700
So now you have
a classifier that

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.560
looks at the pattern
of activation there,

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.940
can distinguish
a leftward versus

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.050
a rightward versus saccade.

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:05.050
I'm just reviewing this.

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:07.110
Hopefully it was clear enough.

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:10.200
That same classifier
can then distinguish

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.510
subtraction versus addition.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:14.430
Did you guys all get
that from the paper?

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.930
Yeah?

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:17.170
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:18.990
Anyway, so that's
kind of nice evidence

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:20.790
that the same
spatial system that's

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:23.070
used in spatial attention
and eye movements

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:28.850
has been co-opted to
represent numbers as well.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.700
OK.

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.300
All right, so I just
wanted to incorporate that.

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.520
In case anybody missed
what the paper was about,

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.800
those were the key points.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.710
Other early studies
have asked more directly

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.890
this question of whether
different kinds of magnitude

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:48.170
are all represented
together in the brain.

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:51.350
And this study is quite clever.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:55.280
They used a variant of the fact
that I showed you guys before.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.230
Remember when saying
whether the number is

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.940
greater or less
than 65, it's harder

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.970
when it's closer to 65 than
when it's farther from 65.

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:04.310
OK, even though I was
showing you symbols,

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:05.780
that was key thing, right?

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.570
So that's called the
distance effect, right?

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:10.160
And that's true for
all comparisons.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.980
And so this study exploits
that distance effect.

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.560
And they use stimuli like this.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:19.020
And they ask, which
one is larger?

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.440
And it could be larger
in absolute size.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.360
Like the two is larger here.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.370
Or it can be larger
in number meaning

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:26.990
like the seven is larger.

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.030
OK, so in different
blocks, you're saying,

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.590
which one is physically larger?

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.990
Which one is numerically larger?

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:34.490
Which one is brighter?

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.470
That would be this one here.

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:41.120
And then they just have
a control with letters.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.170
OK?

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:43.580
And so then-- sorry.

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.110
The design is
slightly complicated.

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:48.080
So there's these three main
tasks and a control task.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.900
But then within each, they
have the difficult version

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.300
and the easy version.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.800
And the difficult version is
when the comparisons are close,

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.140
two similar brightnesses,
two similar numbers,

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:00.030
two similar sizes
versus two larger ones.

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.530
OK?

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:02.990
So that's what all
this garbage shows.

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:05.047
OK, so then you do
that subtraction.

00:53:05.047 --> 00:53:07.130
You look, and you say, OK,
what parts of the brain

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.000
are more active when you do the
difficult versus easy number

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.540
comparison?

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.730
Like saying, which is larger?

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.640
It's not that difficult.
But two versus three

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.860
versus two versus seven.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.780
OK?

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:26.160
And so what they find is that
similar regions of the brain

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.680
are active for all three of
those kinds of comparisons.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.180
OK?

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:34.530
So it's not like you get
just one for symbolic number

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:38.370
or for the two magnitude tasks.

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:40.140
All of those different
kinds of magnitude

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.440
activate the same regions.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:51.750
And so the conclusion is that
number and size and brightness

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.890
engage a common parietal
spatial code, OK, an overlapping

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:57.390
region for all of these.

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.860
Does that make sense?

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.830
OK.

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.670
And so that shows, in this
case, that it's not just

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:10.030
symbolic number
but also magnitude.

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:11.910
Which one is bigger, right?

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:14.910
It's kind of continuous
magnitude idea.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:17.130
OK?

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.480
OK.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:19.980
Right.

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.190
So one worry is that,
in each of these cases,

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:27.590
they're comparing a difficult
condition to an easy condition.

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:30.020
And so maybe the
regions they got

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:34.030
are just engaged in any
kind of task difficulty.

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:39.070
Maybe if they had
done a syntactic task

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:41.978
on language stimuli that
was difficult versus easy,

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:43.270
they would get the same things.

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:44.950
From this experiment,
we don't know.

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:47.080
We'll talk more about that
in a couple weeks when

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.650
we talk about language, right?

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:54.070
But here's at least one control
that deals with that sort of

00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:57.850
and which does a TMS experiment,
as you suggested a while back.

00:54:57.850 --> 00:54:59.530
OK, so this is kind
of cool experiment.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.780
I mean, it's weird,
but sort of cool.

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:02.830
OK, so what do they do?

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:06.190
They use-- OK, so
they have, again,

00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:09.100
an easy task and a hard task.

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:12.700
Again, it's the thing
greater or less than 65.

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.593
Not very hard, right?

00:55:14.593 --> 00:55:15.760
The hard one it's that hard.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.030
But so is it greater
or less than 65?

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:23.230
And it's either a symbolic
number, or it's a dot array.

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:24.730
You can't really
see it, but there's

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:27.220
a bunch of teeny dots in there.

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.020
Or in the other
condition, they have

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:34.270
to say whether that ellipse is
more horizontal or vertical.

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:35.347
OK?

00:55:35.347 --> 00:55:37.930
And so you spend a lot of time,
before you run the experiment,

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:42.610
measuring reaction time and
accuracy to balance difficulty

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.920
within the easy conditions
and balance difficulty

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.660
within the hard conditions.

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.350
OK?

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:53.260
So then what they do is they do
something called offline TMS.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:54.040
OK?

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.820
Offline TMS, I didn't talk
about this much before.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.923
The standard kinds of TMS,
you stick the coil right

00:56:00.923 --> 00:56:01.840
on the subject's head.

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.910
There's a subject doing
a task on a monitor.

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:05.910
And somebody is standing
there holding the coil.

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:08.170
It's really kind of rudimentary.

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:11.230
And right at a key
point of the trial,

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:13.850
you deliver a zap to disrupt
that part of the brain.

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.160
And you find out how
much that interferes

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.410
with performance on that task.

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:20.620
That's the standard
online kind of TMS thing.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.260
But there's also
offline TMS, where

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:28.420
you zap people at a slow
rate for like 10 minutes.

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.150
And then the idea is that
you've kind of generally

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:35.740
disrupted that piece of brain
for, say, another 10 minutes.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.030
It's a little bit scarier.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:40.060
But it's just like
10 minutes, right?

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.620
OK, and so that
way, you don't have

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:43.810
to be quite so fancy
about the precise timing.

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:46.480
You can just kind of
reduce its effectiveness

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.590
for a whole 10 minutes.

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:50.650
OK, so that's what they
did here, offline TMS.

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:53.830
So you sit there and get zapped
for 10 minutes slowly here.

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:56.260
And then you do some math tasks.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:57.280
OK.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.000
OK, so what they
find is that zapping

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.070
the left intraparietal sulcus
disrupts the magnitude tasks

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:08.560
on both numbers and dots.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.410
But it doesn't mess up the
shape tasks with the ellipses,

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.720
even though the ellipses
are balanced for difficulty.

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:15.680
OK?

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.630
So that's at least a
little bit of an argument

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.180
that it's not just about
generic difficulty,

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:22.230
at least in this experiment.

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:24.240
OK?

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.340
All right, I think
that's what I just said.

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.220
So that's some
evidence for a role

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:32.380
of at least the left
intraparietal sulcus

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.692
in both symbolic and
nonsymbolic number.

00:57:34.692 --> 00:57:36.400
Again, nonsymbolic
number just means dots

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.120
without Arabic numbers,
not just any difficulty.

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.280
All right, so that's
all very nice.

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.050
But it's crude as hell, right?

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:46.030
We found these big,
blurry chunks of brain

00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:46.960
that are implicated.

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.060
And we zapped a
big chunk of brain

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.980
and slightly
reduced performance.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.450
It's like, OK,
better than nothing.

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.100
But it's not very impressive.

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.260
What are the actual
neurons doing in the brain?

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.800
Well, now it becomes
really important and useful

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.710
that this approximate
number system

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:06.160
that I've been talking about
is also present in animals.

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.410
And that means we can
use animal models.

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:10.990
And we can record from
individual neurons

00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:13.000
in the parietal
lobes of monkeys when

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.630
they do number tasks to find out
what actual neurons are doing.

00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:17.500
OK?

00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.960
And so there's a guy named
Andreas Nieder, who's been

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.370
doing this for a long time.

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:24.800
And he has some pretty
remarkable data.

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:29.900
And so he starts by training
monkeys to do a number task.

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.510
So here's what the monkey sees.

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:35.320
Monkey sees a sample,
some number of dots.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.440
And then there's a memory
delay, in this case, one second.

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.000
And then he has to
do a matching task

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.770
and choose that
array, not this array.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:43.270
OK?

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:45.228
So he's got to remember
that there's three dots

00:58:45.228 --> 00:58:46.570
and choose the right three.

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:49.090
And notice that the sizes
and configuration of the dots

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:49.640
have changed.

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.940
So we have to do something
more like remember

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:56.950
three in whatever mental monkey
E's version of three exists.

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.060
OK?

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.670
OK, simple matching tasks.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.580
Then he records from neurons in
the parietal and frontal cortex

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:05.660
in monkeys.

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:10.040
And he finds neurons that are
sort of specific for number.

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:13.380
OK, so here's time in that task.

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:17.570
This is the time that the
sample is presented right here.

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:21.680
And here is the response of
a single neuron that likes

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:26.400
two more than anything else.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.390
OK?

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:30.540
And that too, notice,
is all different kinds

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.780
of spatial arrangements
and sizes of the dots.

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:37.770
What's common about all
of them is that it's two.

00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:40.570
Next best, it likes four.

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:41.070
OK?

00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:43.180
And it generalizes
across number from there.

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:44.520
So it's approximate.

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.640
It's not like high for two
and zero for everything else.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.550
It's got a kind of
generalization gradient.

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:52.060
But it prefers two.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:52.560
OK?

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.630
So that's a number neuron.

00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:56.100
Yeah?

00:59:56.100 --> 01:00:01.270
OK, here's a six neuron.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:03.790
This neuron likes six.

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:07.840
Here it is same task during
presentation of trials here.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.766
Red is six.

01:00:09.766 --> 01:00:13.390
Next closest is like
eight and maybe 10.

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:16.360
So it also generalizes as well,
but it responds more to six

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.650
than anything else.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:18.550
Pretty awesome.

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:19.940
Huh?

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:25.370
OK, now that doesn't tell us
how it was computed, right?

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:28.970
So finding a single neuron
that does something spectacular

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:29.660
is thrilling.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.380
We all love it.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.270
It's great fun.

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:34.400
And we're closer to
the neural circuit

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.160
because we found a neuron that
seems to be part of the action.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.340
But notice it doesn't tell
us how that neuron made

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.620
that computation, right?

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.290
What are the circuits that
led into it, that enabled it

01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:48.285
to be specific to six or two?

01:00:48.285 --> 01:00:50.450
But it's still cool.

01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:53.850
OK, but next, we want to know,
how abstract are those neurons?

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.210
This is just dot arrays.

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.840
OK?

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.110
And they're just
presented in one array.

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:04.740
So next, Andreas Nieder
trains his monkeys

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.670
to keep track of the number of
things that happen over time.

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:10.290
It's not a spatial array.

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:12.600
It's a temporal sequence.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.230
OK?

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:16.870
So we have to see that there's
four things coming in here

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:20.460
and then choose the array
that matches with four.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.800
OK?

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.660
See how this is the way to
ask how abstract those number

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.280
neurons are.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.505
Are they really representing
the abstract magnitude of two

01:01:29.505 --> 01:01:30.700
or six or whatever it is.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.117
Or are they
representing something

01:01:32.117 --> 01:01:35.410
about the shape of a two-type
array or a six-type array.

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:40.540
OK, and they can also test
over different modalities.

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:43.530
So now they present
four different tones.

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:46.780
And the monkey has to
choose the four dots.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.280
OK?

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.690
Now it's both over time
and over sensory modality.

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:54.210
So how abstract are
those number neurons?

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.650
OK, they're pretty abstract.

01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:58.270
So here are a few
number neurons.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:00.300
Cell one is in the blue colors.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.750
And here is its response
in light blue to dots,

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:06.660
one dot, two dots,
three dots, four dots.

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:12.120
And here is the same cell
responding to sounds.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.605
It's specific to one, both
for sounds and dot arrays.

01:02:16.605 --> 01:02:18.000
Isn't that cool?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.410
And you see the green
cell is selected for two,

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:26.440
whether in dots or
sounds, and so forth.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.940
Pretty cool, huh?

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.706
So these are very
abstract number neurons.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:33.350
Does that makes sense?

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:35.420
OK.

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.110
OK.

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:41.590
OK, now these monkeys are
trained on number tasks.

01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:44.230
So you might think that these
kinds of abstract number

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:46.480
neurons-- and they're trained
to do the generalization

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.950
from tones to arrays.

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:50.950
So maybe those neurons
wouldn't live in their brains

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:53.712
if they hadn't been
trained to do that.

01:02:53.712 --> 01:02:55.670
But I don't have time to
show you all the data.

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:59.650
But in subsequent
work, the same team

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:02.260
has recorded from monkeys
before any training.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:06.200
And you find similar
number of neurons.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.570
So it does seem like these
are things that exist in--

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:13.010
and remember that's consistent
with what I said before,

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:17.710
which is that a lot of
these number abilities

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.830
are present in animals without
any training and in newborns.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.900
And so it makes sense
that some of those neurons

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.300
would be around even in
advance of any training.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.550
AUDIENCE: How many neurons
did they have to look at it

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:28.330
to find?

01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:29.410
NANCY KANWISHER: Oh,
that's a good question.

01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:30.760
I forget what percent it is.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.830
We could look it up
in the Nieder paper.

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:33.700
Yeah.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.830
It's not like you
record from thousands,

01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:38.890
and you find 10, right?

01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:42.910
Remember they know where to look
from, first, the human lesion

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:45.940
literature and then the human
functional imaging literature.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.940
And then there's also monkey
neuroimaging literature

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.860
where you can have
monkeys doing dot tasks.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.647
So you can know where to look.

01:03:52.647 --> 01:03:53.980
Because the brain's a big place.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.813
If you're just sticking
electrodes all over,

01:03:55.813 --> 01:03:56.650
God help you, right?

01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:59.597
So they know to go up
in that parietal lobe

01:03:59.597 --> 01:04:01.930
if that region is homologous
between humans and monkeys.

01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:03.520
And there's a lot
of other evidence

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.130
that that region is homologous.

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:07.930
So they know how to
get in the right zone.

01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:09.472
And I'm sure, once
in the right zone,

01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:10.840
they're not all number neurons.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.730
I'm sure it's a
relatively small percent.

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:15.384
But it's not a trivial percent.

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:16.638
Yeah?

01:04:16.638 --> 01:04:19.180
AUDIENCE: Do we have sense for
how fractions are represented?

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.105
Because all of these
seem to be discrete.

01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:26.003
Or [INAUDIBLE], any ideas?

01:04:26.003 --> 01:04:26.920
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.220
Well, it's tricky because,
certainly, at the single unit

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.490
level, you'd have to either
find some natural version where

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:36.640
monkeys think about
fractions naturally

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.310
or teach them about fractions,
which would be really hard.

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.740
Because, for some reason,
fractions are just really hard.

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.800
Like all the people who
study math education,

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.862
it's like the key problem
is, how do you get

01:04:46.862 --> 01:04:48.070
kids to understand fractions?

01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:50.950
I don't know why they're
such a tough thing.

01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:53.710
But apparently, it's like
a real dividing line,

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:56.980
the kids who get fractions
and the kids who don't.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.310
So I'd have to think.

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:04.500
But, occasionally, there
are patients with electrodes

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.340
in their brains.

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.230
And one could look at that.

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:09.750
Actually, I took this
slide out, but there's

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:12.570
a paper that came out last
year where they found number

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:14.335
neurons in humans as well.

01:05:14.335 --> 01:05:15.960
I took it out because
I didn't know how

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.920
to integrate it in the lecture.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.480
Because the number
neurons are deep

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.910
in the medial temporal lobe,
far from the parietal lobe.

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:22.800
And it's like, I don't
know how that fits.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.790
I don't know if that's the
same thing or something else.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.340
But anyway, there are at
least some number neurons

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.820
that have been found in humans.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.050
And you could, in principle,
look for number neurons

01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:33.420
up in the parietal lobe.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:38.125
In fact, I have a guy I'm
trying to collaborate with.

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:39.750
I'm begging him to
collaborate with me.

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:42.870
He's got two people who
have arrays of electrodes

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:46.410
chronically implanted
right up in this region

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:49.500
here because they are paralyzed.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.000
They had spinal damage.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.920
And like Michael
Cohen's lecture,

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.170
he's got arrays of
electrodes where

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:57.300
he's trying to use the
neural responses there

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.040
to direct robot arms.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.570
And so there's two
of these people

01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:02.180
who have these chronically
implanted things.

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.722
I'm like, oh, please,
please, please,

01:06:03.722 --> 01:06:05.760
can I collaborate with
you and get responses

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.680
from your patients' neurons?

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.740
Was there a question
over here a moment ago?

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:10.550
Sorry.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.800
I thought I saw a hand go up.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.990
OK, so let me wrap up.

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:17.690
So I've been arguing that
this approximate number

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:21.740
system is shared with
animals and newborns.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:25.460
It's a pretty basic system
that lots of animals have.

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.100
It follows Weber's law,
which you should remember.

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.230
I don't like testing you
guys on esoteric facts.

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:32.780
But Weber's law is a
very fundamental fact.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.110
And you should know it about
perception and, in particular,

01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:36.930
about number.

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:39.350
It tells you that the ability
to discriminate two numbers

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:44.360
goes as the ratio, not as the
difference of those numbers.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:48.290
And that these approximate
magnitude representations

01:06:48.290 --> 01:06:52.040
measured both behaviorally and
neurally in humans and animals

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.740
are very abstract to
the particular objects,

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.330
to the modality, to
whether they come

01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:59.120
in over space or
time, et cetera,

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:03.140
whether they're represented
in symbols or arrays of items.

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.502
OK?

01:07:04.502 --> 01:07:06.710
I mentioned that there are
big individual differences

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:11.210
in humans in the precision of
the approximate number system.

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:15.080
And that is predictive of
later arithmetic abilities

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.170
independent of IQ.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:21.230
And we talked about
the horizontal segment

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:24.110
of the intraparietal
sulcus as a key locus

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:29.120
for the approximate
number system in humans,

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.330
including
number-specific neurons.

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:34.370
And we also talked
about, both in some

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:37.430
of the papers I mentioned
and the paper you guys read,

01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:40.910
that there seems to be that that
approximate number system up

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:44.090
here in the parietal
lobe, so far, doesn't seem

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:48.710
to be one of these extremely
specialized systems like faces

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:51.680
and motion and navigation,
which may turn out

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.880
to be less specialized later
with pending more data.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.670
But at the moment,
we can already

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:58.910
see that these number
representations overlap a lot

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:02.510
with representations of space,
shown perhaps most dramatically

01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:03.980
in the paper you
guys read showing

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:07.730
cross decoding between
eye-movement direction

01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:10.310
and arithmetic operations.

01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:12.845
OK, hang on.

01:08:12.845 --> 01:08:13.970
I'm almost done summing up.

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:16.550
Number neurons, we
talked about that.

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.859
Yes, so we'll give the last
word to Stan Dehaene, who

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:21.380
started off with this
very extreme view

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:25.340
and has evolved to a still
interesting but slightly less

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.510
extreme view.

01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:29.540
He says, the brain treats
number like a specific category

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:33.439
of knowledge requiring its
own neurological apparatus

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:35.390
in the parietal lobe.

01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:38.149
But when it comes to subtler
distinctions, such as number

01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:42.740
versus length, space, or
time, the specificity of hIPS

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:43.819
vanishes.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.520
No part of hIPS
appears to be involved

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.160
in numerical computations alone.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.689
In fact, he goes further to
say that the human brain,

01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:57.229
in general, is neither
anisotropic white paper,

01:08:57.229 --> 01:09:00.859
like equipotential, where all
the regions are equivalent,

01:09:00.859 --> 01:09:02.779
nor a neat
arrangement of tightly

01:09:02.779 --> 01:09:05.750
specialized and
well-separated modules.

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:06.265
All right?

01:09:06.265 --> 01:09:07.640
Anyway, OK, there
was a question.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.555
Sorry.

01:09:08.555 --> 01:09:18.979
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] just
then having this, I guess,

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:21.830
easier time with
approximate numbers,

01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:24.740
given more of an
interest in that.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.500
NANCY KANWISHER: That's a
really, really good question.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.607
And I am sure there
are data on that.

01:09:29.607 --> 01:09:30.899
And I don't know what they are.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:32.300
But I will go look.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:33.170
I always say that.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:36.470
But, Dana, will you send
me an email right now to go

01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:39.649
look up whether the
prediction from childhood

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:43.760
ANS to adult
arithmetic abilities

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.500
has to do with an
interest or you might

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.050
say just an emotional response.

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:50.600
Like if you suck at
it, it feels bad.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.550
And you become avoidant,
and you get all

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:54.860
dysfunctional about it, right?

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:59.000
We all have-- I mean, most of us
have domains where we do that.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.400
And math phobia is a real thing.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.290
And who knows.

01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:03.290
It could start in there.

01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:04.458
So yeah, good question.

01:10:04.458 --> 01:10:05.000
I don't know.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.230
I will look that up.

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:10.100
Other questions?

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.870
OK, see you guys on Wednesday.

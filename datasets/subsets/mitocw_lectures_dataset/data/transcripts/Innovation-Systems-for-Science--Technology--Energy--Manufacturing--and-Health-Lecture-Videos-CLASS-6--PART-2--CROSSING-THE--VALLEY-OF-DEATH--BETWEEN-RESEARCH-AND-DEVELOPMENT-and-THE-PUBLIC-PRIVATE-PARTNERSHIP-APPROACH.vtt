00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.810
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So I'm
just putting In-Q-Tel out

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.530
there as probably the
most extreme example

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.630
of governmental willingness
to intervene in territories

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.690
we thought the government
really wouldn't do.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.340
Right?

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.870
And, again, it's an example of
this national security state

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.930
doctrine that David
Hart told us about.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.350
Whatever is needed for national
security, we're going to do,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.030
however interventionist
it might be.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.690
And this is a good example.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.790
So Ruth David, a very
talented former CIA Director

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.720
for Science and
Technology, comes up

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.650
with the idea of creating this
entity to sponsor IT research.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.540
Because the CIA realized
it was falling behind.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.810
It wasn't part of
the IT revolution.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.172
It didn't understand,
wasn't a participant,

00:01:20.172 --> 00:01:22.130
and yet it was going to
be absolutely critical.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.075
And, of course,
virtually no day passes

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:26.450
without reading
in the newspapers

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.110
about some latest cyber
security set of issues.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.440
So In-Q-Tel is set up as a
government venture capital

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.030
firm, a completely unique model.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.730
And it's aimed at early
stage technology development.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.780
So the CIA is not new to
technology development.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.710
I mean, in aerospace, the
U2 and SR-71 blackbird

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.920
are two of the most famous and
spectacular aircraft ever put

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.420
together.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.560
They were put together
by Lockheed skunk works.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.840
But In-Q-Tel really is
a very different model.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.280
So Norm Augustine, who
had been CEO of Lockheed--

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.000
and is the winner of the
president's National Medal

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.370
of Technology, by the way,
so a great technologist

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.660
in his own right--

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.660
he helps in the
founding of this.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.140
And they pick a CEO right
out of Silicon Valley.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.790
And they've got a board
with ties to IT innovators,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.850
as well as economic
researchers, and VC firms,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.570
and tech companies.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.750
So In-Q-Tel is allowed to
enter into joint ventures, i.e.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.620
In effect, it can
co-own the companies

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.040
that it's nurturing to
bring along IT technologies

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.650
that the CIA is going
to be interested in.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.170
It can use sole source grants.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.240
It can set up open competitions.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.330
It can award sole source
development contracts.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.610
It's got a set of powers
here that are really quite

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.700
interventionist in the model.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.420
And the CIA itself doesn't
review its business deals.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.340
It's because it's
a bit offshore.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.930
So it collaborates with the
CIA, but it's independent of it.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.183
It has this set of
characteristics.

00:03:23.183 --> 00:03:25.100
And we're going to talk
more about these kinds

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.500
of characteristics when
we do the great groups

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.370
class, the seventh class.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.850
But agile, problem-driven,
solutions-focused,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.340
team-oriented, technology aware,
output measured, innovative.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.930
These are all kind
of characteristics

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.260
that In-Q-Tel likes to
say that it's capable of.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.370
And these are some of
the technology areas

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.560
that In-Q-Tel, in its
earlier stages, worked on.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.600
So a whole suite of IT-related
and software-related tech

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.200
capabilities.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.170
So that's the model,
and it's different.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.930
So, Chris, do you want to
bring us through it quickly.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.670
CHRIS: So this is a
pretty unique situation.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.519
Basically, it's kind
of posed as a win-win.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.390
Like the CIA gets new
tech that they are kind of

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.400
behind in producing.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.430
And then, these tech
companies, or In-Q-Tel,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.320
has the opportunity
to get exposure

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.550
to potential big next problems
that they could develop

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.970
commercial products for.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.460
So one question
that was posed was,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.530
are there other such
private enterprises

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.980
funded by the government?

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.370
And if not, what is
preventing these partnerships

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.900
from happening.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.770
I think Bill mentioned that
the Supreme unique case

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.900
so, probably, I
don't think there's

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.610
any other such partnerships.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.020
But why is that, maybe?

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.730
AUDIENCE: They're
still around, are they?

00:04:59.953 --> 00:05:01.120
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Oh yeah.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.140
AUDIENCE: They
re-branded as IQT.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.305
AUDIENCE: Ah, thank you.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.017
I do remember there was one,
maybe it was similar to DARPA,

00:05:15.017 --> 00:05:17.100
I remember in DARPA, at
least in the next reading,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.530
there was something
that was similar.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.470
Oh, that's right.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.650
So I remember that one of
the points they mentioned

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.150
in this reading,
there was some sort

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.850
of licensing that
corporations needed

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.503
to work with the government.

00:05:28.503 --> 00:05:29.670
Do you remember what it was?

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.503
Like, FRC licensing.

00:05:30.503 --> 00:05:32.587
AUDIENCE: I think we were
just talking about that.

00:05:32.587 --> 00:05:34.920
Like, level of strictness
of the contracts.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.870
And how In-Q-Tel
works to restructure

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.583
how that contract works so that
they could encourage smaller

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:43.000
companies that
didn't want to deal

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.385
with overwhelming bureaucracy
to join the party.

00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:47.510
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Thanks.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.930
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.430
Good.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.510
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say, I think agencies similar

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.480
to In-Q-Tel might
be a hard sell,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.880
because if you think about--

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.080
they probably have a
pretty large employee base,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.355
and they're privy
to information leak.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.090
Also, it's going--
kind of directly

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.223
flying in the face of our
aversion to industrial policy.

00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:20.890
So we are picking
winners, in this case.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.290
So those two things I think
make it really difficult

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.762
to have other agencies
like this ourselves.

00:06:25.762 --> 00:06:27.970
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right,
because really, in effect,

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.260
In-Q-Tel is a
venture capital firm.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.882
It's not doing its own research.

00:06:31.882 --> 00:06:33.340
It's a venture
capitalist, and it's

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.940
taking positions in
companies and helping

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.150
drive those companies
towards technology work

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.828
that's going to be relevant to
concerns that the CIA has got.

00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:46.370
Sorry, Chris.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.540
Go ahead.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.370
CHLOE: Oh, no, I--

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.620
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Oh, Chloe.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.600
CHLOE: I think it's interesting
to think about why this would

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.100
or wouldn't work
for other agencies,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.475
because personally,
I'm surprised

00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:01.930
that it has been such a
successful model for the CIA,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.440
of all government agencies,
on several levels.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.120
The article says
that they didn't

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.950
deal with any classified
work or contracts,

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.340
but I don't understand
how such a firm could

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.400
exist in partnership with an
agency that does any classified

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.150
work.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.110
I don't see how--

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.620
I'm surprised that
that happened.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.100
I am surprised, also, a
bit that that was able to--

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.640
yeah.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.430
Start with that.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.790
AUDIENCE: Which part are
you surprised by-- the fact

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.610
that they work so much
on non-classified stuff?

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.200
CHLOE: No, no.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.790
They didn't.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.870
In-Q-Tel, at least--

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.520
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, they didn't

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.562
work on classified stuff.

00:07:34.562 --> 00:07:35.950
CHLOE: So I'm surprised that--

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.907
I think, of all
agencies that I think

00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:40.240
this model could work for,
I'm surprised that it works--

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.720
AUDIENCE: For someone who--

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.496
CHLOE: --the CIA.

00:07:41.496 --> 00:07:42.460
AUDIENCE: --who
compartmentalizes

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.210
their information.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.380
CHLOE: Yeah,
compartmentalizes information.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.505
They were probably-- they
mentioned also, oh, there

00:07:47.505 --> 00:07:48.922
will definitely
be people who will

00:07:48.922 --> 00:07:50.530
raise questions
about ethics concerns

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.993
and the government meddling
in funding technologies

00:07:54.993 --> 00:07:56.660
that they might simply
be interested in.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:02.098
And feel like the CIA is
just the worst possible--

00:08:02.098 --> 00:08:02.890
AUDIENCE: Customer?

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.390
CHLOE: Yeah.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.670
It's really surprising to me.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.420
AUDIENCE: I think--
yeah, it's really cool

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.060
that it works, and also kind of
shows that private enterprise

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.453
work with government.

00:08:11.453 --> 00:08:13.870
Private enterprise has a strong
incentive to move quickly,

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.828
but I also think it's a
case study in terms of,

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.170
it was an IT revolution.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.020
Their business is information
like information in general.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.775
And if anybody's kind of better
than us, then we're screwed.

00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:24.400
So they're like, we
really need to win.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.317
We really need to win.

00:08:25.317 --> 00:08:26.740
So I think there's
a strong stress

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.030
to actually make it work.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.810
So there's probably
a lot of issues.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.780
And I'll look from a management
perspective, a lot of times,

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.070
you don't say about
the bad things

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.480
when they write
stories about it.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.429
So their-- I feel like, yeah, it
was really stressful probably,

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.400
the people from the--

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.400
because it's going to be
an old wing who's like,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.608
yo, we don't want to do this.

00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:42.983
And there was a
new wing who were

00:08:42.983 --> 00:08:44.410
like, no, we need to do this.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.170
So I think it might have been
a pretty stressful thing.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.060
I can see how it
works, but I can also

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.990
see how they made it work.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.490
CHLOE: Yeah.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.360
AUDIENCE: That's my point.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.777
AUDIENCE: Which
means that if it's

00:08:53.777 --> 00:08:57.340
such a difficult situation,
and if they were still

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.700
able to make it work just out
of necessity, then [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.680
probably any other
government agency

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.010
could do something similar.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So in order
that we get through everything,

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.388
I'm going to push this
ahead on this one.

00:09:10.388 --> 00:09:14.710
But first, just a closing
thought, Chris, on this one?

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.290
CHRIS: I think the
central idea here,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.480
that you can maybe
outsource what

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.650
you may be a little bit behind
in or aren't so good at,

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.790
is really interesting, so
that the CIA can effectively

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.360
focus on its core business,
which is gathering

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.150
and maintaining intel.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.520
And this goes back to
our previous discussion

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.890
about the government
choosing winners and losers,

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.090
and it's really interesting
that this case has emerged

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.560
as the real case that they've
chosen a clear winner here,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.160
and they're actually
forging a pretty strong

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.830
public-private partnership
that seems to work.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.890
So yeah, this is a pretty
interesting article.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.390
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And I wanted
to have Sarah Jane Maxted--

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.260
that is, our distinguished
visitor in our class today--

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.760
just introduce herself briefly.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.600
And maybe, Sarah Jane, you
can tell the team some things

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.350
you're working on.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.350
SARAH JANE MAXTED: Sure.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.040
I'm Sarah Jane Maxted, also SJ.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.765
[INAUDIBLE] refer to me.

00:10:11.765 --> 00:10:14.440
I might pop in a few
other times as well.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.903
I work at MIT.

00:10:15.903 --> 00:10:18.070
I run a program called the
Regional Entrepreneurship

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.840
Acceleration Program.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.240
We work with global
regions all over the world

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.430
to accelerate their
innovation ecosystem.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.870
So my background--
I'm not that old,

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.100
but my specialization is
in innovation ecosystems.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.960
Specifically, my background's
most directly related

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.958
to the energy space.

00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.750
So I worked in the US
Department of Energy,

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.530
and I worked for a
US senator, and I

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.900
worked in the private sector
as well, all in relation

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.450
to energy and
innovation ecosystems.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.790
So how do you cultivate--

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.830
how do you deal with
this valley of death?

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.420
And so it was so
interesting being

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.003
in the beginning of
this conversation,

00:10:54.003 --> 00:10:57.580
talking about not
using market terms.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.830
And when I worked in
the federal government,

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.560
we were not allowed to
say commercialization.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.320
It was the death word.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.210
It was ridiculous.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:06.850
I was like, why
can't we just use it?

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.615
To your point,
that helps clarify.

00:11:08.615 --> 00:11:10.470
So it was very frustrating.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.830
It's been really great to hear.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.090
AUDIENCE: What words did
you use as an alternative?

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.625
SARAH JANE MAXTED:
Tech to market.

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:18.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:18.722 --> 00:11:20.430
We also weren't allowed
to say marketing.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.390
Marketing was absolutely not OK.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.040
AUDIENCE: What
about tech transfer?

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.300
SARAH JANE MAXTED: Yeah.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.830
SARAH JANE MAXTED: That was OK.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.640
Congressmen didn't love it.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.350
But it's really fascinating
to hear each of you guys.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.120
You guys are very well-versed.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.237
I'm quite impressed.

00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:36.820
But yeah, any questions
on that front.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.130
And what I'm doing
here at MIT, I also

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.803
work with the
Innovation Initiative.

00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:43.220
I think somebody
mentioned earlier

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.540
some of the educational
things related to innovation

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.450
entrepreneurship and
business, and being

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.440
able to have
multiple skill sets.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.050
And I am interested
at some point

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.425
to hear what you guys think
about the minor in innovation

00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:57.970
and entrepreneurship, which
was launched last year.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.000
Maybe some of you
are part of it.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.460
But anyways, that's
what I [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:02.880
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Thank you.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.616
SARAH JANE MAXTED:
You're welcome.

00:12:03.616 --> 00:12:05.050
Thank you for having me.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.300
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.842
Now we're going to crash through
the last couple of readings.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.690
This is a piece I did in 2014.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:19.680
And essentially,
I began to realize

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.100
that there were different
periods at which point

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.770
we began to reorient in
the US our understanding

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.860
and the organization of
our innovation system

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:36.180
towards, heaven forbid,
commercialization.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.530
And I roughly delineated
five periods--

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.860
the immediate postwar,
the Sputnik period,

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.850
the 1980s competitiveness
period, and then more recently,

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.370
these new potential
innovation waves

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.590
that are coming in--
energy for sure,

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.040
I think, but also potentially
advanced manufacturing.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:01.410
And the US essentially had
to rethink the Vannevar Bush

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.760
disconnected model that it
brought into place in the early

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:11.190
postwar, and create a
more connected model.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.280
And each one of
these stages presents

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.250
movement towards more
connected kinds of systems.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.270
So the postwar period
you're familiar with.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.710
That's Vannevar Bush himself.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.310
And he creates a highly
connected model during the war,

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.150
as we've discussed,
and then disconnects it

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.790
as we've gone through
and talked about--

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.262
particularly from
the Stokes reading--

00:13:36.262 --> 00:13:37.470
at the close of World War II.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.870
So this is where,
as we said before,

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:44.130
our great, strong, and
certainly very important

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.260
basic research
organizations come from.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:51.330
And as we've talked before, we
get a lot out of that model.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.610
But Sputnik is an attempt--

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.640
led by the Defense Department,
but embracing other pieces

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.990
like NASA and NSF--

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.310
where the Defense
Department pushes

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.620
on that disconnected model.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.430
The Defense Department can't
take a disconnected model.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.910
It just won't work.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.080
It's got to have
fairly rapid movement

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.690
towards actual
technology development.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.830
And to an extent a
system is disconnected,

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.600
it's not going to
serve DoD well.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.600
So DoD, in the course of the
Cold War-- and certainly,

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.910
this is rampant by 1957--

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.820
is rebuilding its much
more connected, World War

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.710
II-like system, with deep ties
between industry, university

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:39.820
research systems and efforts,
and the defense lab system.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.350
So DoD plays a pervasive role
at every stage of the pipeline,

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.490
as we've talked
about previously.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.790
So if that's the
innovation pipeline,

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.130
our classic basic
research agencies

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:57.930
are playing, at this
stage, research and maybe

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.640
invention of
early-stage prototypes,

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.486
maybe into early-stage
development, but that's it.

00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:05.170
Whereas the Defense Department,
as we've talked about,

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.330
will perform the
research, the development,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.030
fund the prototype,
fund the demonstration,

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.260
fund the test bed, and move
into actual production,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.800
often creating initial
markets for new technologies.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.990
That's the IT story that
we've begun to tell.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.380
We'll tell a little more when
we talk more about DARPA.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.860
So DoD has got a much more
connected system, because

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.630
of its potential--
and it doesn't always

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.710
play a role at every
one of these stages,

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.300
but it potentially plays
a role at all of them.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.140
So it's a very different
organizational model,

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.780
as we've been
talking about today.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.760
DARPA comes right out of
the Sputnik challenge.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.090
It's set up in '58.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.060
Sputnik is '57.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.260
President Eisenhower had
been completely frustrated

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.930
that the three
separate service space

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.240
programs were not
talking to each other

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.700
and not sharing ideas.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.970
Each of the services was
pursuing a rival effort

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.930
to capture what was then
known as the higher ground,

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.790
and put that higher
ground project

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.500
into its own
procurement program.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.990
So the Army and the
Air Force and Navy all

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.180
had their own separate
missile programs.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.690
Eisenhower wakes up,
stuck with Sputnik,

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.790
appropriately
blames the services

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.710
for not having
undertaken collaboration.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.040
Eisenhower decides, I'm
taking space away from you.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.502
We're going to create
this DARPA thing,

00:16:32.502 --> 00:16:34.710
and it's going to report to
the Secretary of Defense,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.980
and we're going to run
it as a unified program.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.740
That only lasts a few months,
because there's a big movement

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.670
to have a civilian agency led
in space, not a military agency.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:50.620
So then NACA-- which was the
Aeronautical Research Agency

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.320
that, actually, Vannevar
Bush led in the 1930s,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.870
which is where he learns
his innovation organization

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.460
lessons--

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.990
that becomes NASA, and
becomes aeronautics and space,

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:08.810
and is essentially created
around the Apollo mission.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:09.310
Max?

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.990
MAX: Quick question
regarding the previous slide.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.839
You mentioned that the
DoD is basically involved

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.329
in all of these steps,
whereas places like the DoE

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:19.319
are not involved.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.397
Why isn't the DoE involved?

00:17:21.397 --> 00:17:23.230
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: The
Department of Energy

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.033
doesn't have a--

00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:25.450
Sarah Jane can
tell us about this,

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.400
but it doesn't have
a procurement budget,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.920
so it doesn't buy stuff.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.460
So DoD buys its stuff.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.430
It will buy the technology
advances that it's supporting.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:39.720
It will buy aircraft.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.960
It will buy IT systems.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.370
It will create
the initial market

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:49.180
for the integrated circuit
for its own computer needs.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.970
The Department of Energy doesn't
have a procurement budget,

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.030
therefore it's
limited in its ability

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.870
to do this creation
of initial markets

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.360
and undertake support
of the production stage.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.110
It's hard-- look, in the
end, the energy technology--

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.318
we're going to talk about it.

00:18:08.318 --> 00:18:10.760
We'll do a whole case
study on energy, which I

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.040
hope will sort of satisfy you.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.030
But in the end, we're
going to stand up

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.060
an energy technology revolution
in the private sector.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.730
There's no pretending
that a government contract

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.160
model is going to
achieve that revolution.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.910
It's gotta get stood up
in the private sector.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.350
So I don't think it
solves our problem.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.690
I think that we
have to recognize

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.760
the reality that 12% of
the economy is in energy.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.380
It's going to be
a civilian sector.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.100
Let's figure out how to
stand those technologies up

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.528
in that civilian sector, because
that's the lasting model.

00:18:46.528 --> 00:18:47.570
I mean, it wouldn't hurt.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.350
The DoE would buy certain stuff.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:53.010
But Congress is just not
going to give it the power.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.100
And Sarah Jane's comments
about the unwillingness

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.740
to talk about, God
forbid, commercialization,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.470
is symptomatic--

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.980
much less initial
market creation.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.400
So it's a challenge in
other organizations.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.320
Third period is around
competitiveness.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.910
So from 1973 to 1991--

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.170
and we talked about this
in the first class--

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.940
the US economy
significantly slowed.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.410
And this is where the
Rust Belt comes from.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:30.320
This is the first great job
disruption in manufacturing.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.440
This is Japan's brilliant
quality production

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.670
model coming to bear against
an earlier model of US

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.320
mass production, and
quality production

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.350
proved the better model.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.785
And US GDP growth historically
is around the 3% level.

00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:47.390
It came down to the 2% level.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.730
US productivity
growth, historically

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.450
around the 2% level, comes
down to the 1% level.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:58.270
Lower productivity growth
means a lower GDP growth.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.290
This is not a happy time.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.690
This is a tough time
in the United States.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.810
By the way, current growth rate
in the United States is 2%.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.880
Productivity rate is 1%.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.430
Comparable economic problem.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.920
Economists now call
this secular stagnation.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.070
We had that period for an
extended period of time.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.150
and the US had
organized its economy

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:28.713
around frontier innovation, but
it missed an innovation wave.

00:20:28.713 --> 00:20:30.130
And when you
organize your economy

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.680
around frontier innovation
and you miss a wave,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.300
it's a problem.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.180
So when Japan--
and, to some extent,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.420
Germany as well-- leads this
manufacturing revolution,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.120
a real innovation wave
around quality production,

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.930
the US misses the wave
and has to catch up.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.960
So in this time
period, particularly

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.610
in the '80s It's trying
to rethink its model

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.300
and figure out how to
be more competitive,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.410
with particularly the
economies in Japan and Germany.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.280
And the models that it came
up with were the following.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.860
So a lot of interesting
things happened

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.830
that are, in effect,
more connected.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.990
And the government is
going to be pushing further

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.400
down the pipeline.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.920
The Bayh Dole Act.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.440
The government used to own
the intellectual property

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.608
rights to federal research.

00:21:25.608 --> 00:21:27.400
The government is not
a company, so it just

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.100
went and sat on the shelf.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.930
Bayh Dole Act gives
intellectual property ownership

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.870
to the universities that
are conducting the research,

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.940
and they in turn share it
with their researchers.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.270
It makes the university
an economic actor.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.790
So universities have done
education and research

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.440
for a long time.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.870
Suddenly they've got
an economic stake

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.080
in the outcomes
of their research.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.470
So increasingly, we are
drawing universities

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.850
in to the economic
system and having

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.680
them play an economic role.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.120
Whole new development.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.470
And the Bayh Dole Act is not
the only thing going on here,

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.160
but it's one significant
part of the story.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.870
We create the Manufacturing
Extension Program

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.600
to bring the latest
manufacturing

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.980
technologies and processes
to small manufacturers.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.890
So the majority of
US production is

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.050
done by small firms and
mid-sized firms that

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.450
have less than 500 employees.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.510
They don't do any R&D. They
have a lot of trouble--

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.210
as we talked about in the
manufacturing classes--

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.000
keeping up with
technology advances.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.440
So the MEP program is an attempt
to bring the latest technology

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:51.860
advances and process advances
to small manufacturers.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.600
And here, there is
an explicit attempt

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.150
to understand what Japan
is undertaking in quality

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.150
manufacturing and
translate that model back

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.370
to small and mid-sized
manufacturers.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.980
We create the advanced
technology program NIST.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.980
That's now over, on
precisely the reasons

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.150
we've been talking about.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.190
That was viewed as
too interventionist.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:17.530
The Commerce Department was
supporting company research

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.260
at the applied level, and it was
viewed as too interventionist.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.480
Eventually, Congress
shuts it down.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.670
The Small Business Innovation
and Research Program.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:32.410
As we've talked before, when
you all set up your startups,

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.870
this is the first place
you're going to go for money.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.210
This is where you go,
and you can get up

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.510
to about a million dollars
in two different phases

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.320
to really do startup efforts.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.220
And the number of startups
that have used SBIR money--

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.390
they all use it.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.040
It's very critical.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.470
That program comes out
of this general era.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.290
Sematech at DoD, that we've
talked about briefly earlier

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.480
today, is another program--

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.910
also quite interventionist--
where essentially,

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.010
the government attempts an
advanced manufacturing project

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.470
in the semiconductor sector.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.450
So these are all
program elements

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.210
that began developing
in this period.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:17.100
Interestingly, we don't
have to follow through,

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.060
because Japan misses the
IT revolution that really

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.360
begins to hit at about 1990.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.100
The US leads it.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.880
We did very well very quickly
starting in that 1990s time

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.430
period--

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.250
one of the most successful
economic periods

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:38.050
in US 20th century, 21st
century economic history.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.410
So we forgot the
problems we had.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:43.330
And of course, those
manufacturing problems

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.670
are now right back on us,
because we didn't fully

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.050
follow through.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.913
Period 4 is the problem
of energy innovation.

00:24:51.913 --> 00:24:53.580
We're going to do a
whole class on this.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.810
I'm not going to
spend much time on it.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:00.750
But energy is driving
the organizational model,

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.465
and an organization
like ARPA-E--

00:25:03.465 --> 00:25:07.860
a DARPA within DoE--

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.000
explicitly has what Sarah
Jane reminded us of--

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.350
a tech to market outlook that
really very much considers

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.810
the possibilities of
commercialization before it

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.880
selects the R&D projects
it's going to fund.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.360
Is there a pathway
to commercialization?

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.590
There's a conscious
attempt there.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.350
So this is not a
curiosity-driven, Vannevar Bush

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.300
basic research agency.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.200
ERE explicitly works with
industry for the great bulk

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.790
of its research portfolio.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:38.930
Advanced manufacturing.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.850
We've talked about
this one as well.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:46.340
This may be an evolving
innovation movement.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.950
We'll see what the
current administration

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:49.820
wants to do with it.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.510
It's not clear yet.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.840
So those are five periods.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.860
I'll just recap.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.120
Period 1, the postwar.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.220
We move from a wartime
connected system

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.870
to a disconnected system.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.050
And then slowly over
time we've been,

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.320
creating more and more
connections in our system.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.200
So Sputnik creates
DARPA, and we'll

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.060
talk a good bit about DARPA.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.030
I'm just laying the groundwork
here on several topics,

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.250
including this one.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.970
But a reconnection of the whole
Defense innovation system.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.920
Period 3, around
competitiveness.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.760
We do a series of experiments--

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.460
which, with one exception,
all of which remain in place

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.650
and have been pretty
successful over time--

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:38.045
to attempt better
connections between industry

00:26:38.045 --> 00:26:40.390
and the commercialization
efforts and university

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.410
research.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.750
And then the energy challenge
and advanced manufacturing

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.260
challenge push us further
down that pipeline.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.180
The advanced
manufacturing institutes

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.370
and manufacturing
that we talked about,

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.380
those bring together
collaborations

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:59.720
of private sector firms,
government, and university

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.930
researchers for a collaborative
effort around developing

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.710
new advanced technologies.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.140
It's not early-stage technology.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.920
It's very applied.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.150
It's quite late-stage.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.270
A lot of development.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.470
So these are much-- this is the
government supporting an effort

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.020
to move much further
down the pipeline

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.820
towards commercialization
of these new technologies.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.870
Who's got this one?

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:23.650
RASHEED: Me.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:24.692
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Good.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.650
RASHEED: So bringing
together these five periods,

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.882
I thought these were pretty--

00:27:32.882 --> 00:27:34.840
these held up pretty well
with all the readings

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.180
that we've done so far.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.570
In particular, I think the
postwar and the Sputnik one

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.640
we've kind of gone
over in spades.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.760
But a little bit newer, I think,
is the period 3 through 5.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.640
But particularly, if we focus
on '80s competitiveness,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.090
we see that that's spurred
on a little bit towards--

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.580
with the advent of Sematech
and semiconductors,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.130
and missing its innovation
wave with Japan.

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.540
And is there sort of this--

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.040
so what we want to
find out here is,

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.470
is there an idea
that globalization

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.210
brings about new forms?

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.300
So now that we have this
'80s competitiveness,

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.960
these periods get a lot shorter.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.020
So the '80s, and the
period 4 is in the 2000s,

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.513
and now we're in
advanced manufacturing.

00:28:22.513 --> 00:28:24.430
So is there this opportunity
for globalization

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.460
to make these innovation
waves maybe shorter,

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.340
or add more and make them more
compact so more people have

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.570
this opportunity?

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.070
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Rasheed, I think

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.903
that's an important
point, because actually,

00:28:34.903 --> 00:28:36.970
each one of these
stages are driven

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:42.430
by external developments landing
on the US economic situation

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.950
and forcing change.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.800
So they're just not
materializing from within.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.540
These are all
external developments

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.070
that force a US response.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.800
So you make an important point.

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.830
RASHEED: But is this something
that you guys also saw, maybe,

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.720
with the idea that
globalization will

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.450
bring more innovation
to the forefront--

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.420
maybe not just in the US, but
elsewhere as well, and make

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.060
other people respond in
the way that we have?

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.520
MAX: At least
intuitively it does,

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.562
because if you have more
people that are talking,

00:29:15.562 --> 00:29:18.390
more people that are exchanging
ideas through globalization,

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.460
then by extension,
you would think

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.850
that would mean that more
ideas can get produced

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.417
and people have access
to more resources, which

00:29:27.417 --> 00:29:29.250
means that whatever
ideas that come up with,

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.236
they can implement better.

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:32.800
So at least intuitively.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.355
AUDIENCE: I would challenge
the resource point, though,

00:29:35.355 --> 00:29:36.390
because that would
trigger [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.920
AUDIENCE: No, I was going to
talk about everyone talking,

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.060
if that's a good thing, because
usually, the best decisions are

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.183
made when everybody's
following along the same path,

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:46.850
and it's also not
mainly just one person

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:47.850
thinking for themselves.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.060
If you think about Wall
Street and speculation--

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.730
because you get an echo chamber.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.138
And this was shown by
the whole Facebook case

00:29:55.138 --> 00:29:56.555
after the election,
where everyone

00:29:56.555 --> 00:29:57.680
was saying the same things.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.660
So it's usually--
a lot of evasion

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.780
happens when an
individual thinks

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.222
of a different perspective
and then echoes back

00:30:05.222 --> 00:30:05.930
to the community.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.263
So if you can have individual
figures, it's really good.

00:30:08.263 --> 00:30:11.000
But usually what happens
is, because of dogma or just

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.720
the way groups work, there's
very few innovative ideas,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.130
and it's more of
an echo chamber.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:19.400
AUDIENCE: Well, that's true,
but that's been true always.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.620
So my thought is that having
a greater access to more

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.140
communities that have
these different ideas,

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.537
then you have more
of those Zuckerbergs

00:30:29.537 --> 00:30:33.560
who are thinking of
something different.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.310
AUDIENCE: Perhaps.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:35.092
AUDIENCE: Perhaps.

00:30:35.092 --> 00:30:36.550
AUDIENCE: I would
say, getting back

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.820
to Rasheed's original
question or point,

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:43.060
I think that we
probably are seeing

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.680
a contraction of
technology waves,

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:53.500
or these periods, probably
due to just the speed at which

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.390
information can be transferred.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.590
That might explain it.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.760
RASHEED: Also, I'll
argue that financing

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.150
and getting a reputation
for things, that's easier

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.880
now, because back in
the day during Edison

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.780
or during Ford's
day, getting money

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.607
was a huge problem
for an entrepreneur.

00:31:13.607 --> 00:31:15.190
Nowadays, it's very
easy to get money.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.773
And also, you get
to keep your equity,

00:31:16.773 --> 00:31:19.030
because back in the day,
too, you would create--

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.060
you could create one of
the best technologies,

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.670
and you would give up 1/3 your
company or the full company,

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.140
and then they'd kick you out.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.850
So you came up with
this innovation.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.058
You understand technology,
how to bring it to market.

00:31:30.058 --> 00:31:32.308
And now, because this person
wants to make more money,

00:31:32.308 --> 00:31:33.070
they kick you out.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.690
So that's really a
good opportunity,

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.760
because now it's really
the technologist who

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.527
has more power.

00:31:37.527 --> 00:31:39.360
So that's why these
cycles are [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.320
AUDIENCE: But see,
that's exactly where--

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.330
the point at which I
would challenge Max,

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:47.472
because just because we have
a globalized spread of ideas

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:49.930
doesn't mean that we have a
globalized spread of resources.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.270
And often our innovation,
especially the United States,

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.530
is built on imperialism.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.320
Dependency theory, borrowing
from [INAUDIBLE] economics,

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.590
is one of the reasons why the
United States and why colonial

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.040
governments were able to
make such incredible gains.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.890
In particular, we saw this with
the Dutch East India Company.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:07.000
Their exploitation
of Southeast Asia

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.530
was exactly what enabled them
then to promote, I guess,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.220
a Marxist society
in the Netherlands,

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.460
and then enabled the spread of
colonization in the New World.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.780
And so what we're seeing now,
especially with the innovate

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.602
here, produce there
paradigm is, I think--

00:32:25.602 --> 00:32:28.060
and the sort of detriments that
we talked about maybe three

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.640
classes ago, about the ways
in which countries are now

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.700
understanding how to
innovate there as well--

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:38.380
is that we may be
sharing all of our ideas,

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.070
but there's not going to be a
capture of value economically

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:46.960
or in terms of the practical
gain of technological advances,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.750
because those resources
are not local.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:52.270
We're going to have to purchase
them from other countries.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.630
And if the United States doesn't
have access to those resources

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.400
and production
and manufacturing,

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.040
then we're going to miss out on
the benefits of having created

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.502
those ideas domestically.

00:33:01.502 --> 00:33:03.460
And that's what I think
is so treacherous about

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.790
the international
relations landscape

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.430
that the Trump administration
is creating for us,

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:10.930
and why it's really
important for us

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.980
to be wary of our reputation
on the international plane,

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:19.120
because we don't have all
of the resources necessary

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:24.100
in order to produce, and if we
destroy our reputation abroad,

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.840
people won't want
to work with us.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.150
And if they now have
the innovation capacity

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.900
as well, then what is the
future for American innovation?

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.310
Imperialism hegemony does not
exist for Americans anymore.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.220
AUDIENCE: But I would argue two
points on what you just said.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.560
One is, the interesting
thing about Trump

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.350
is, he became such a polarizing
figure that abroad, people

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.380
know we don't like him.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.630
So it's like, that's just him.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.690
That's not the US.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:48.810
And then two, I
think you're thinking

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:50.760
about-- your framework
is based on the past,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.927
in terms of what's happened.

00:33:51.927 --> 00:33:55.390
And I think in the past,
it's been very much--

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.910
we're a scarcity society.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.230
So there's a scarce
amount of resources,

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:00.820
so we need to take
from somebody else.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:01.890
So there's been--
there's a philosopher who

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.598
talked about how we
have so many enemies,

00:34:03.598 --> 00:34:06.060
and the US creates so
many enemies because we

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.304
used to take, take, take.

00:34:07.304 --> 00:34:09.429
But I think what will change
in the next 100 years,

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.969
200 years is that
we will get closer

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:15.960
to like a post-scarcity society
so that we have more resources.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.925
Say people discover a better
form of energy, so we have--

00:34:18.925 --> 00:34:21.699
assume infinite energy,
even though that's ideal.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.420
Assume we have water, because
we've figured out desalination,

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.679
so we can get enough food.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.630
Assume that now we
have automation,

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.760
so people don't have to
work with their hands

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.920
and more people can think.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.170
And then assume we're
expanding, and we go into space.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.304
So now we're also-- it's
like the American period

00:34:36.304 --> 00:34:38.429
of growth, where people
are expanding other places.

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:41.900
So the game before was to
take and take and take.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.320
And if the game becomes
more to, how do you give?

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.520
What becomes valuable
once you already--

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.190
to have money
wouldn't be valuable.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.023
It would be respect.

00:34:49.023 --> 00:34:50.820
It'd be, this person
got a Nobel Prize.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.570
This person did a
social initiative.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:56.850
That's just an evolution
of what you just said.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.450
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So you
guys are really leading us out

00:34:58.450 --> 00:34:58.980
of here.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.022
Go off into utopia land.

00:35:02.022 --> 00:35:02.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, really.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.188
RASHEED: [INAUDIBLE] That
was four individual points.

00:35:05.188 --> 00:35:06.243
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:06.243 --> 00:35:07.410
AUDIENCE: But the thing is--

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:08.485
AUDIENCE: Bring it back.

00:35:08.485 --> 00:35:10.110
AUDIENCE: --from a
startup perspective,

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.430
you don't think linearly.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.490
You think exponentially.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:14.240
So we're talking about
these contractions.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.500
That could be a
reality in terms of--

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.320
if you think about how
the past used to be,

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.445
that's not the game
we're playing anymore.

00:35:20.445 --> 00:35:20.557
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:35:20.557 --> 00:35:22.320
I don't think that's the
game we're playing anymore.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.160
You could probably
look at these,

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.510
and that's pretty already--

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.740
you're already
looking exponential.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.000
AUDIENCE: It could be
bioengineering, energy,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
and physics all at once.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.800
RASHEED: Yeah, which I
think offers the opportunity

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.260
to be pretty cool.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.350
And I think ARPA-E--

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.490
we can focus on them a
little bit now, on period 4--

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:40.260
is looking at these
interdeparmental collaborative

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.940
mechanisms to spur these
short-term, three-to-five-year,

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:49.980
very industry-focused
targeted growth periods.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.910
And so is that an idea that
we want to kind of take back,

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.730
is can we look at-- now that
we're so interconnected in all

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.570
of this globalization,
[INAUDIBLE] try to create is,

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:05.520
can we focus all of these
things in these targeted areas

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.410
with any degree of success?

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.970
Or are we just playing the
game, gambling [INAUDIBLE]??

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.280
MAX: So you're saying
to focus the defense--

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.200
for example, the Department
of Energy, you would say,

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.095
focus it only on
one form of energy.

00:36:19.095 --> 00:36:20.220
Is that what you're asking?

00:36:22.828 --> 00:36:24.120
RASHEED: Let me take this back.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.120
SARAH JANE MAXTED: Hear
about the mechanism.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:25.550
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.450
So as a mechanism--
does the mechanism work?

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:28.908
But the mechanism
is basically, you

00:36:28.908 --> 00:36:32.210
have this idea for
advanced materials,

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.860
and you take a couple
of industry partners--

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.610
the Department of
Energy, for example,

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:41.690
and maybe even an
international partner-- and you

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.480
make them all work together on
an advanced materials project

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.663
for three to five years.

00:36:45.663 --> 00:36:48.080
Do you think all of these
people can get together and work

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.390
effectively in the
short time span

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.740
to produce any
degree of success?

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:57.540
MAX: Well, obviously, I have
a bit of a pension for fusion,

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.170
so my first thought's
going to be here--

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:04.430
the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor--

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.060
partially because science
and engineering for plasma

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.260
is just really
hard, and partially

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.540
because I feel that,
at least in my opinion,

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.640
it hasn't been managed
as effectively as it

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.260
could have been.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.140
It was supposed to
be the best example

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.420
that I can think of
international collaboration

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.610
trying to solve a
very big problem.

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:28.830
And it's more than
double its first budget,

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:33.990
and it's, what, 10, 20
years behind schedule?

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.510
Of course, that's not to say
that the approach itself--

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.300
the fact that you're using
international resources--

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.330
that's not to say that
that is inherently flawed.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.630
But I can't really think
of any counterexamples.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.080
AUDIENCE: The way we think about
it as a businessperson is--

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.520
this a pretty common problem--

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.200
is, you stress people.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.373
I gave the case example
before of Silicon Valley,

00:37:56.373 --> 00:37:58.040
and how there's not
minorities and there

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.060
weren't that many women.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.420
So sometimes what you do is,
you actually make the problem

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.130
be very apparent.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.600
And so the CEO of
a company knows,

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.933
there's a problem in my company.

00:38:06.933 --> 00:38:09.140
They won't announce it,
but they'll leak a paper.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.390
And somebody will be like,
oh, there's a real problem.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.860
And then everyone's like,
oh, we need to solve this.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.277
Oh my god, there's
all this press.

00:38:14.277 --> 00:38:17.460
And you use the tools
at your disposal.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.830
And so, yeah, you can--

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.990
you have to stress them
just the right way,

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.270
because people would
stay by themselves

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:24.748
in their own little bubble.

00:38:24.748 --> 00:38:26.540
But if you stress them
so it's like, oh no,

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.640
we need to do this,
we need this now,

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.690
that's how I think about it.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.350
MAX: Actually-- oh, sorry.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:34.433
SARAH JANE MAXTED: No, no.

00:38:34.433 --> 00:38:40.040
I was just going to say,
I think the question that

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.930
gets beyond the mechanism
itself of the ARPA-E

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:50.780
is, how do you monitor
or evaluate success?

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.390
So I think-- to your point, some
technologies take a lot longer.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.680
So is three to four or five
years a good time horizon?

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.200
And if we keep it at
that, that's fine,

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.080
but how do we bundle in
all these different energy

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:03.860
technologies?

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.890
For instance, for some, maybe
more building technologies

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.480
are going to be a lot quicker,
and then some, like fusion,

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.730
are going to take much longer.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:14.120
And how do you identify
the right technologies

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.900
or applied research to
do in that capacity,

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.400
and how do you
evaluate the success?

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.760
And that's the tech to
market question as well--

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.660
what are those points of
evaluation?-- which is,

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:27.950
I think, [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:29.825
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Sarah, you're driving us,

00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:32.060
I think, to some
additional perceptions

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:37.400
here given your basic
question, Rasheed.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.740
What are the innovation
organization models

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.260
that we're going to
use if we're trying

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.150
to take on these bigger tasks?

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.610
In other words, it was
straightforward enough

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:50.630
to do a curiosity-driven
research project and fund one

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.830
PI.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:56.630
But if we're moving the
model to move much further

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:01.780
down the pipeline, which is
what all these stages represent,

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.120
what are the organizational
mainstay models

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.900
we're going to use here?

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.430
And then you come to a
model like the manufacturing

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.820
institutes, which
can typically have

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.300
more than 100 companies;
four or five major research

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.210
universities; a comparable
number of community colleges,

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:25.550
if not more; and, potentially,
one or more federal agencies

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:29.660
and five or six states and
state economic development

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.890
organizations.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.692
As some of the
Defense Department

00:40:32.692 --> 00:40:35.150
described this to me, standing
up a manufacturing institute

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:39.740
is like standing up a country,
compared to funding a single PI

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:40.940
researcher.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.980
So these call for--

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.470
and I think is what
Rasheed is driving us to

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.510
and Sarah is driving us to--

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:52.850
they call for a much more
complex organizational model,

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.690
because the tasks have
gotten considerably larger,

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.810
and the number of actors
that need to be involved

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:00.230
is getting considerably larger.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.498
So these are all
lessons learned that I

00:41:02.498 --> 00:41:04.040
think we're going
to have to pull out

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:08.210
of the experiments were running
now on energy and potentially

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.030
advanced manufacturing,
and really consider

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:12.202
the models we're using.

00:41:12.202 --> 00:41:13.910
Rasheed, do you want
to give us a closing

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.772
thought about this reading?

00:41:15.772 --> 00:41:16.430
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:19.760
I thought this reading
was pretty comprehensive,

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.510
and it seemed very
Bill, I would say,

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:26.900
because it did a good
job of starting us

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.260
from the beginning at
this postwar system

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.360
and walking us all
the way through now

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.180
to advanced manufacturing
and the [INAUDIBLE] problems

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.650
that we have today.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.460
So it was pretty--

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.590
I felt like I was in class,
reading through and--

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.687
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:40.687 --> 00:41:42.270
AUDIENCE: I felt
like, I've done this.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:43.490
RASHEED: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.170
And then you get to the new
stuff at the end, and you're--

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.220
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Rasheed, I had

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.595
to write this because I needed
it in class, because there

00:41:48.595 --> 00:41:51.200
wasn't anything else that
covered this entire panoply.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.380
So that's really, frankly,
the reason why I wrote it.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.880
All right.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.780
We're now going to jump
to another Bill reading,

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.000
and now we're going
to take a deep dive

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.690
into this whole concept
of legacy sectors.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.510
And this will be foundational as
we do some of the case studies,

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.861
like in energy,
like in health care.

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:13.120
AUDIENCE: If I
could just ask you,

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.040
at the very end of this last
[INAUDIBLE] just talking about,

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.733
you have--

00:42:18.733 --> 00:42:20.150
I guess your driving
conclusion is

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:24.720
that the new model innovation
organizations discussed here

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.990
deserve ongoing scrutiny
and pragmatic evaluation

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.063
of their performance
to refine these models.

00:42:29.063 --> 00:42:30.980
Obviously, you published
this three years ago,

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.615
and were probably thinking
of this five years ago.

00:42:33.615 --> 00:42:35.990
So I was curious if you could
talk a little bit about how

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.420
you've maybe developed
that already,

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.880
or if you've been thinking about
what a model might look like.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.625
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, I learned a lot

00:42:43.625 --> 00:42:47.400
in working on the advanced
manufacturing initiative--

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.160
the Advanced
Manufacturing Partnership

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.860
that the President set
up, and the Production

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.500
in the Innovation
Economy project at MIT,

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:58.180
because it really
forced a lot of thinking

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.760
about what the organizational
model was going to be.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.710
And in turn, I've learned
a tremendous amount

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.120
about looking at what
the Department of Energy

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.170
has been doing.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.020
So we'll dive into this
in the energy case study,

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:11.540
but essentially,
DoE, at the front end

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.760
of the innovation,
the R&D stage,

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.130
has created a whole
set of new models.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:19.550
It is a very different agency
than it was 10 years ago.

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.850
And it's created a
host of new pieces

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.280
on the innovation
front that enable

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.140
it to do a lot more things.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.950
So yes, they still have a
Vannevar Bush basic research

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.690
agency--

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.190
the Office of
Science, a $5 billion

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.190
basic research
organization-- but they've

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:39.680
got all these other pieces
on the table now which

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.190
make the mix quite interesting.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.728
So we'll have a chance,
actually, Steph,

00:43:46.728 --> 00:43:48.770
to dive into what some of
those models look like.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:53.350
We'll take a particular look at
ARPA-E, which is actually maybe

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:54.850
on the chopping
block at the moment.

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:58.420
So it may turn out to
be an historical lesson.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:03.070
But a pretty interesting
organizational model.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:06.010
But let me do
another driver here

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:10.610
that forces us to think about
innovation organization, which

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:14.200
is innovation in legacy sectors.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:23.650
So the US is pretty good
at doing the next big thing

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:27.760
and standing up new technologies
in frontier territories.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.170
In other words, in effect--

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.090
to use a metaphor--

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:34.750
we take our new technologies,
we put them into covered wagons,

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:38.020
we go across the mountain, and
we open up a new technology

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.370
territory.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:43.760
We do frontier innovation,
and we're pretty good at this.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:49.430
There was nothing really like
computing before computing.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:51.500
So that would be a good
example of opening up

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.700
a whole new territory.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:45:03.230
The US is not good at bringing
innovation into legacy sectors.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:07.710
The new innovations often
have to parachute in,

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:09.780
and they get shot
at on the way down.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.890
So the US tends to do
the next big thing,

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:19.280
but doesn't tend to go
back and fix the old.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:25.040
That's why the-- driving from
Kennedy Airport into Manhattan

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.500
often is kind of a
third-world experience.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.020
Sometimes you think you could
lose an axle on your cab

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.350
before you get into downtown.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:37.550
We don't tend to maintain a
lot of our existing systems.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.080
We push on to the
next big thing.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.850
And that's not bad.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.700
That's not a bad
American tendency.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.805
But we do pay a
price for it if we're

00:45:45.805 --> 00:45:47.930
going to have to bring
innovation into these legacy

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.430
sectors.

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:51.930
Just think of the
health care debate

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.420
we've been having
in recent months.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.820
The United States does biotech.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.640
It does not go back and fix the
health care delivery system.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.610
That's a legacy sector.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:01.402
That would be hard.

00:46:01.402 --> 00:46:03.660
We'd rather open a new thing.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.030
So this is a problem
in our society.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.740
Look, every society
has got these problems.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.080
It's hard for anybody to
innovate in the legacy sectors.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.320
But it's particularly
tough here, I would argue.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:18.240
And the problem is that a lot
of our big societal problems

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.360
are tied to these
legacy sectors.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.170
We can't avoid the innovation
challenge in these sectors--

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.440
climate and energy,
food and water,

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.460
the problem we've got of quality
job creation, health care

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:38.660
delivery, improving education
to address inequality problems.

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.300
These are all profound
societal challenges,

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.620
and they all have to be
fixed within legacy sectors.

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.950
And to do this, we've got
to confront these sectors.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:50.513
Frankly, I was--

00:46:50.513 --> 00:46:53.180
Chuck Weiss and I, my co-author,
were amazed we wrote this book.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.440
There's no literature on this.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.570
There's no literature
in the innovation policy

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.450
field about innovating
in legacy sectors.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:03.530
It's a problem that's just
hidden in plain sight.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.280
So how would we do this?

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.570
Because we need to do it.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.620
One example is the revolution in
military affairs in the defense

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:13.470
sector in the 1990s,
where we bring

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:18.210
a raft of new technologies to
bear even though the Defense

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:21.030
Department is one of the
most notorious legacy sectors

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.290
around.

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:25.710
How is it the DoD is
able to organize to bring

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.200
these technology advances in?

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.250
But we can start to see a
whole set of innovations

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.410
that are starting
to move in what

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:36.000
we can consider legacy sectors.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.300
So advanced manufacturing.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.560
Manufacturing is
definitely a legacy sector.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.000
New energy technologies.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.160
Intelligent cars.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.470
Higher education for
sure is a legacy sector.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:49.170
We're starting to
see online education.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.070
Commercial space.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:52.410
So there are possibilities here.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.340
We're starting to see what some
of the possibilities might be.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.710
So learning how to innovate
in these sectors is critical.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.410
What are some of the
take-home lessons?

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.240
There are obstacles
to innovation

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.280
in the legacy sectors.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.440
Innovation, by the way, is
not just the shiny new lights

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.367
and only the cutting edge.

00:48:12.367 --> 00:48:13.950
There's a lot of
innovation that needs

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:15.570
to land in these
legacy sectors that

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:18.150
are not quite as glamorous.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:21.420
Legacy sectors have a lot
in common, both in the US

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.780
and abroad.

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:26.397
So there are definitional
aspects of a legacy sector

00:48:26.397 --> 00:48:28.980
that apply to manufacturing, but
also to health care delivery.

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.950
We can find commonalities here.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.800
And legacy sectors in
countries here and abroad

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.380
have commonalities.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:40.560
And the context of innovation
can be every bit as important

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.390
as the innovation system itself.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:46.500
So this class is focused
on the innovation system,

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.320
but it's within
a larger context.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.530
And I'll explain what
that means in a minute.

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:55.691
Entrenched legacy sectors
resist innovation.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:03.140
For example, we often
provide incentives

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.870
to producers that don't
align with societal needs.

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:15.080
The legacy sectors are defended
by a technological, economic,

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:19.890
political, social, and maybe
even cultural paradigm.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.010
So a legacy sector
is a castle, and it's

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.170
got a rich defense system.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:27.170
That is, it defends
the technology advances

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:28.220
that it's encouraged.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:32.450
It will defend the economic
models that it's pursued.

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:37.700
It will use the political
system to block change.

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:40.550
And it uses societal
and educational systems

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:43.010
to ensure that it
gets staffed up

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.070
and has a social outlook
that tends to protect it.

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:51.660
So these legacy sectors tend
to share this common paradigm.

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:57.250
They will resist
disruptive innovation,

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:03.430
and they will be more
accepting of innovations that

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:05.610
fit their own business models.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.270
And we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:50:09.913 --> 00:50:11.330
The features of
the legacy sector,

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.780
they get a little
definitional, and I

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.780
don't want to go into a
lot of details on these.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.300
But you get the idea.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.200
And these are
characteristics that--

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.990
a legacy sector will share
all of these characteristics,

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:27.660
but it will
typically share many.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.350
In the characteristics
side, there

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:31.170
are often perverse
prices that don't

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:36.030
reflect externalities-- i.e.,
like the low cost of gasoline.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:38.580
There will be an
established infrastructure--

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.660
gas stations.

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.060
Massive infrastructure
system that's got

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.260
to get rethought and overcome
if you're going to make change.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.240
There are strong
public expectations

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.540
of low cost of energy
in the United States.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.940
It's very hard to
overcome these.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.640
There are often
regulatory requirements

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.370
that block entry
of new technology--

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:02.400
again, in the energy space.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:07.680
Good luck in connecting your
out of state new solar system

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.230
with the transmission system
across a series of states.

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:11.855
You've going to have
to get the states'

00:51:11.855 --> 00:51:13.040
regulatory systems lined up.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.910
It's very tough.

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:16.920
There are career
pathways and curricula

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:21.180
at universities that tend to
support the existing system.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.690
All of these, there's
typically very limited R&D

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:26.380
compared to revenue.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:31.760
So in the energy sector,
for example, less than 1%

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.460
of annual revenues is spent
on research and development

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.120
in the energy private sector.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:40.870
An astonishingly low number
for a major industry.

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:43.660
And there are powerful vested
interests behind these legacy

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.080
sectors that defend them.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.600
On terms of-- I'm not
going to go into detail

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.520
about these kind of
market imperfections,

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:57.605
but often perverse
subsidies, network economies,

00:51:57.605 --> 00:51:59.980
non-appropriability where the
developer of the technology

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:03.220
can't recapture its value.

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.800
There's often problems
of collective action.

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.330
So for example, it's tough to
introduce technology advance

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:12.760
into the building sector because
it's so totally decentralized.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.510
There are not major actors.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.500
There's just lots and lots
and lots of little actors.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.510
So you can't get
collective action together

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:21.640
in a sector that's
organized like that.

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:26.390
There's a short time
horizon for financing,

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:28.550
and that limits the
ability to scale up

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.530
new technology advances.

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:36.470
So these are-- now,
in contrast, if you're

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:40.910
developing a technology that
is compatible with the legacy

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:44.310
sector's paradigm of
technology and business model

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:46.533
and so forth, then
you can do it.

00:52:46.533 --> 00:52:48.200
You can do it in
relatively short order.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.800
So fracking was adapted within,
really, a 15-year period.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.350
The original technology advances
came out of the national labs

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:00.140
around things like
3D seismic imaging.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.370
And they moved very
quickly because fracking

00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:11.370
fit the existing fossil
fuel economy so nicely.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.960
If you're doing solar,
good luck to you.

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.000
It's a much more complicated
adaptation process.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.032
So if you're doing
disruptive technologies,

00:53:20.032 --> 00:53:21.740
that's where the
problem really comes in.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:30.050
So we have a series of models
of the dynamics of innovation,

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:32.650
and we've been
struggling to see these

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:35.420
in the course of
the classes so far.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.190
But as you think about it,
there's really five ways

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:43.840
that our economy
undertakes innovation.

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:48.310
One, we've spent a lot of time
last class and this class--

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:50.110
the pipeline.

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:51.890
Again, the model--
dump basic research

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:53.765
in the end of the
pipeline, mysterious things

00:53:53.765 --> 00:53:55.780
happen, great products emerge.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.190
That's technology push.

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:59.950
Federal government
is, in effect,

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:03.130
pushing a new kind of
technology or scientific advance

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:05.740
into the pipeline,
and hopefully it

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.130
will emerge from the pipeline.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:10.840
It's a technology push model,
a technology supply model.

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.630
That's the dominant model
underlying US innovation

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:15.160
policy.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.840
But there's also
induced innovation.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.400
Remember, Vernon
Ruttan came up with

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.410
this theoretical framework.

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:24.760
Industry does the majority
of innovation in our economy.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.370
Industry will typically see
a market niche or a market

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:31.570
opportunity and will move
to fill that opportunity--

00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:35.900
typically with incremental
advances, not radical advances.

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.510
So that is a demand pull.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:41.240
Industry is identifying
a potential demand

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.670
that can pull the technology
into the marketplace.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:47.530
That's typically
what industry does.

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:48.780
But then there's other models.

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.670
The extended pipeline, we've
just been talking about today.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.410
That's what the Defense
Department does.

00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:59.050
It operates at every
stage of the pipeline.

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:01.510
So in addition to the pipeline
model in the US system,

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.910
we have an extended pipeline
model in the US system.

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:09.050
A fourth model is
manufacturing-led innovation.

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:11.520
US doesn't do this one.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.540
We didn't build this one.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:17.970
Countries like Germany
and Japan do this model.

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:21.220
Korea, Taiwan do this model.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:24.105
China now jumped on this model.

00:55:24.105 --> 00:55:25.730
In other words, their
innovation system

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:30.990
is led by the creative
work, the new engineering,

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:35.010
the new science that can
lead to produce products.

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.830
It's that product
design stage that's

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:42.880
central in a manufacturing-led
innovation system.

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.050
US never built one of these.

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:46.530
So by creating these
manufacturing institutes,

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:52.350
that's an attempt in the US to
get this piece into our system.

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:59.330
Overall, entry
into legacy sectors

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:01.970
is such a complex
effort that you're not

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:06.030
going to do one of these
innovation organization models.

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:09.850
You're going to have to
do probably all of them.

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:12.540
When you think about a
sector as complex as energy,

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.000
you've probably got to
tackle all of these dynamics

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.240
to get the changes you need.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:23.490
So that puts a premium on
innovation organization,

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:26.850
the way in which you organize
your innovation system.

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.340
That becomes critical
when you're trying

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.840
to tackle a legacy sector.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.560
Just as we were having
that conversation, Steph,

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.040
that you pushed for,
what's the new ways

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.450
of organizing around innovation?

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:42.470
What are the new models?

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:45.110
If you're trying to innovate
in a legacy sector like energy

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:47.510
or manufacturing, you're
going to need new models,

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:49.760
and you're going to need to
think about the innovation

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.680
dynamics at each
one of these points.

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:57.730
Oh, I don't want to forget.

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:01.390
You need change agents,
because legacy sectors will not

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:02.530
change themselves.

00:57:05.232 --> 00:57:06.690
You're going to
have to have people

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:10.830
prepared to push these legacy
sectors to adapt change.

00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:12.330
And maybe it's
political leadership.

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:14.820
Maybe it's new
companies and startups

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:17.040
that are going to be
the change agents.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.870
Maybe it's a new R&D agency.

00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:21.968
Maybe it's a mix of
all of the above.

00:57:21.968 --> 00:57:23.760
But you're going to
need change agents that

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.460
are prepared to move things
in these legacy sectors.

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:31.070
So those are the five models.

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:33.440
Some of this calls for
us to think about what

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.420
the governmental role is.

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.035
Do we need a more
activist governmental role

00:57:38.035 --> 00:57:39.035
in this kind of context?

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.262
What's the process?

00:57:43.262 --> 00:57:44.720
And this is
particularly important,

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:48.390
because this is going to be
important in your papers.

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:51.600
So the stuff we're talking
about here is going to be--

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.780
in terms of launching
new technologies,

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:58.090
this multi-step,
five-step process

00:57:58.090 --> 00:57:59.620
is going to be
something that I'm

00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:03.700
going to ask you to use as you
consider the topics you develop

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:05.830
in your papers.

00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:09.980
Step one-- you can't
innovate without innovation.

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:14.530
So you're going to need stuff.

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:16.870
So you're going to have to
have a front-end innovation

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:20.610
system that's giving
you creative stuff

00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:24.060
to innovate with.

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.470
Here's some ideas here.

00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:28.170
Form critical
innovation institutions.

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:30.830
Build thinking communities
so that you can have a--

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:32.970
you got have a community
that's big enough

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:35.550
to really get a lot of ideas
on the table for innovation

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:37.560
to occur.

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.380
It's Romer.

00:58:42.348 --> 00:58:44.280
It's the prospective
theory here.

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.350
You've got to have a
thinking community that's

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:49.590
at a big enough scale that they
can really work on creating

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:51.630
innovations in a legacy sector.

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.930
You need to link the
technologists to the operators.

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:56.690
They can't be in
isolation from each other

00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:58.695
if you want to
implement this stuff.

00:58:58.695 --> 00:59:00.570
And you can use that
island and bridge model,

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.850
and we'll talk more
about this next week

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:05.910
when we talk about
innovation by great groups.

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:10.290
But your innovators need to
be connected decision-makers

00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:14.710
that can effectuate the changes
they're going to propose.

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:16.525
Some other steps,
and then I'll quit

00:59:16.525 --> 00:59:20.950
and we can do some
Q&A. Step two is,

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:24.130
each technology is going to
have a different launch path.

00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:29.110
The launch path for
batteries for grid storage

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:32.380
is probably going to be a
very different launch path

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:36.410
than batteries for transport.

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:37.850
Launching into
the utility sector

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.130
versus launching
into cars, those

00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:42.350
are different launch pathways.

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:45.320
So you're going to have to think
about what the launch pathway

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.110
is for your technology
that you want

00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:50.150
to have enter the marketplace.

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:54.210
And then you're going to
need to tie support packages

00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:56.580
to those launch
pathways that fit,

00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.030
that are relevant to the
particular launch pathways.

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:04.260
A fourth step is, look at the
innovation system and the gaps

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.910
in the innovation system.

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:08.150
What are the holes
in the system?

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:09.440
Where are things dying?

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.510
For sure it's the
valley of death,

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.640
but what are the other
gaps in that system?

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.500
Because again, the
valley of death

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:19.760
is only between research
and development.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.260
You've got all kinds
of other stages

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:24.020
to get through, too, all
the way up into production.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.110
What are the gaps in
that overall system?

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:29.500
So think about what the
gaps are, and then think

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.270
about institutional fixes--

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:33.790
public or private or both--

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:37.070
that fill those gaps.

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:40.900
So this is kind of a menu of
how to think about bringing

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.090
innovation into legacy sectors.

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:45.700
And if you all are going to
work in the energy field,

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.910
that's the king
of legacy sectors.

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:50.800
Right if you want to pursue
advanced manufacturing,

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.950
that is a big-time
legacy sector.

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.700
So we're going to have
to have a much more

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.030
sophisticated innovation
organization approach.

01:00:58.030 --> 01:01:02.800
We're not going to solve these
problems by individual awards

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.290
to individual investigators.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:07.880
That's not going to work.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.230
It's not going to get us there.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:12.080
We're going to have to have
a whole new delivery system

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.640
for the innovation system.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.860
Let's see if there's anything
else I want to cover.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:23.210
Change agent orchestrates the
activity here, and therefore

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:24.450
is a pretty critical player.

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:26.870
So again, these
chapters here are

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:30.200
pretty important for your paper,
and that five-step process

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.060
and understanding the
dynamics of innovation

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:36.390
are pieces that you're
going to need in your paper.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:38.640
So Rasheed, it's all yours.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.190
RASHEED: Great.

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:41.840
That's actually a
great place to start,

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.100
because I think a lot of
us were pretty much in line

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.890
with what was going on,
understanding what a legacy

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:50.240
sector is and identifying them.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.380
We're pretty much
all OK with that.

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:55.190
Where I think people
started to diverge

01:01:55.190 --> 01:02:00.260
was deciding on who would
play the role of these change

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.482
agents.

01:02:01.482 --> 01:02:03.440
A lot of people were
looking in their questions

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.080
to figure out who would
be the best poised

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.660
in certain situations to play
that role of a change agent.

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:11.960
Would it change for
different initiatives?

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.710
And I think one of
the interesting things

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:19.460
was, we tried to identify of
this community of change agents

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.240
first.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.280
We were all looking for
this thinking community

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.038
for different individuals.

01:02:24.038 --> 01:02:25.580
So just to start
off with, who do you

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:30.080
think might be able to play a
role, in any particular case,

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.810
to be the change agent
for a legacy sector?

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:33.874
And it can be anyone.

01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:41.970
AUDIENCE: I'll start it off.

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:43.150
This is a complex question.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:44.380
There's different answers.

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.710
But I think for energy, I think
the big thing would be having

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:50.610
a breakthrough innovation.

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:52.330
Because the main
issue right now is,

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:56.150
we are worried about climate
change, but solar and--

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:59.627
well, solar in general is
expensive, and doesn't really

01:02:59.627 --> 01:03:01.960
do what we need to do, because
if you look at the energy

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.650
market, how much is solar, it's
rather small versus our energy

01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:06.910
needs and also the cost.

01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:08.440
It's hard to innovate there.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.850
But if you can come
up with a much,

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:14.310
much better innovation--
so maybe fusion.

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:15.560
Maybe there's something there.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.102
It'd be the difference
between if you

01:03:17.102 --> 01:03:20.290
had to come up with a whole new
phone line system versus if you

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:21.820
create the cell phone.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.290
You might have a huge
opportunity there.

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.950
And the thing that I think
is important this issue is--

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:28.840
Steve Case, the
guy who made AOL,

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.210
has this thin called the
third-wave entrepreneur,

01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:32.650
where it's like--

01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:35.110
the thing about
innovating in this sector

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:37.540
is that, you kind of
Uberize it in terms of,

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.540
there's already an
existing society.

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.730
There's already all these
institutions that people--

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:44.500
there's these pathways
for this legacy sector.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.020
So when you innovate
in it, the issue

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.655
is going to be that
you tear those down.

01:03:49.655 --> 01:03:51.280
And these people will
spend their lives

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.552
dedicating themselves to
being part of the sector,

01:03:53.552 --> 01:03:54.760
and you just cannibalized it.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.950
So it's like, how do
you really work with it?

01:03:56.950 --> 01:04:00.130
And that's a policy issue, but
it's also a whole social issue.

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:03.910
And I think Uber has been a
good preliminary basic example,

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:04.410
because--

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:06.720
it's pretty much an appetizer,
or a warm-up example.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.400
But if somebody did come up
with an amazing innovation

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.340
in energy, like fusion
that is relatively cheap

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.760
and won't take like 10
years to build a reactor,

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.160
then maybe something
like that could happen.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.060
Any other thoughts?

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:23.900
AUDIENCE: Maybe another good
example, probably almost

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.610
more disruptive.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:25.568
You mentioned gasoline.

01:04:25.568 --> 01:04:28.340
It would be-- that's part of
what makes Elon Musk a really

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.370
interesting change agent.

01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:33.050
He's not just
developing the electrics

01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:36.602
that drive the car, but
the charging stations that

01:04:36.602 --> 01:04:38.060
will go in the
house, and then even

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.700
connected to the solar
roofing that will charge those

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:41.720
stations.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.970
I think you put a lot of thought
into, basically, the launch

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.100
pathway for that technology.

01:04:51.913 --> 01:04:53.330
STEPH: That's a
really good point,

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:57.377
because I think often about the
energy value chain in the oil

01:04:57.377 --> 01:04:59.210
and gas industry-- like
upstream, midstream,

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:03.610
downstream-- and the flow of
value within the industry,

01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:04.447
and I feel like--

01:05:04.447 --> 01:05:06.530
I hadn't thought of that,
that Elon is essentially

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:11.390
creating not only upstream
change, but also midstream

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:15.710
change and downstream change,
in that he's comprehensively

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:17.720
trying to transform the
industry and capture

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.040
all of the value for himself.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:24.765
But I definitely
think that perhaps--

01:05:24.765 --> 01:05:26.790
or I don't know, maybe
I'll pose this question.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:31.478
do you feel like
change happens more--

01:05:31.478 --> 01:05:33.270
or change is more
feasible on the midstream

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:36.030
or downstream sector?

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:38.790
Because I feel like upstream
is kind of that disruption.

01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:41.550
It's trying to create fusion,
which can be challenging,

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:44.990
and it can be difficult
to have people adopt.

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:47.240
But then you get stuck at
the midstream or downstream.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.818
Do you want to change
infrastructure,

01:05:48.818 --> 01:05:50.610
or do you want to change
consumer patterns,

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:51.770
is my question.

01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:53.560
RASHEED: Steph, quickly
define upstream,

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.713
midstream, downstream for me.

01:05:56.713 --> 01:05:57.380
STEPH: Oh, yeah.

01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:00.120
So upstream is just the
production aspects of it--

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.550
so the extraction of
natural gas and oil.

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:07.190
So the derrick systems.

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:08.980
Midstream is the
infrastructure that's

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.110
created in order to
transport that-- so, say,

01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:15.310
the railways, the trailers,
the trucks, et cetera.

01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:17.440
And then downstream is the
consumer aspects of it--

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.216
so the people buying it
in their car at scale.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.885
RASHEED: So I think what's
interesting about this--

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:30.260
and maybe particularly
in energy,

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.970
but in other fields and
other legacy sectors--

01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:36.160
creating these thinking
communities of change agents,

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:39.150
which is the first
step, is something

01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:40.650
that you can't really--

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.620
is there a way to
organically do this?

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:48.870
Because I don't see
getting together

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:50.850
the heads of all
of the big energy

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:52.440
corporations together in a room.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.220
They're not going to come up
with anything super radical.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:59.200
And so there's no--

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.530
and it's way different from--

01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:03.697
before you could just get
the Comptons, the Vannevar

01:07:03.697 --> 01:07:05.113
Bush in the room,
and you're going

01:07:05.113 --> 01:07:06.680
to get something crazy out.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.060
But now, if you're looking
to innovate in a sector,

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.880
you can't really call upon
the greatest minds pulled here

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.980
and then get something out.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.470
AUDIENCE: Can you give
me an example [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:18.500
just to [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.940
AUDIENCE: Well, isn't MIT trying
to create a thinking group,

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:26.070
or a space where thinking groups
can occur, with The Engine?

01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:28.900
Isn't that one of--

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.453
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, or Mighty could be

01:07:31.453 --> 01:07:32.870
and the Energy
Initiative could be

01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:35.840
seen as a thinking community.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.280
It's not simply MIT-based.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:41.660
It brings in all kinds of people
from various sectors and places

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.360
to think through
these big challenges.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.280
And the big reports
that MIT does

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.030
are the products of these
thinking communities

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:52.940
as they attempt to think
through a new technology area,

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:58.400
like solar or the
future of the grid.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.070
STEPH: [INAUDIBLE]
did you interact

01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:05.120
at all with the American
Petroleum Institute?

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.220
SARAH JANE MAXTED:
Well, not really.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.810
It was there.

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:10.760
It was affiliated--

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.063
I don't even know how.

01:08:12.063 --> 01:08:13.730
I think it was out
of Office of Science?

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:14.785
Or was it Fossil?

01:08:14.785 --> 01:08:15.910
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Fossil.

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:16.993
SARAH JANE MAXTED: Fossil.

01:08:16.993 --> 01:08:19.560
I think the Office of Fossil
Energy has the relationship.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.203
But we didn't interact
with them at all.

01:08:22.203 --> 01:08:24.370
STEPH: So I think an
interesting example for Rasheed

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:27.109
within the legacy
sector of oil and gas,

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:28.850
because I know API
does a lot of work

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:31.520
in ensuring that the
regulatory framework is there

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.840
for all of the oil companies.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.910
And the heads of all
the oil companies

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:38.540
get together as a group,
or provide representatives

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.460
at meetings, and
then they go through

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:45.260
and talk about the potential
outcomes for the energy

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.939
industry, and then
think collaboratively

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:50.120
about what that industrial
framework might look like.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.210
And obviously, there's a
lot of those industries that

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:55.231
are trying to create
disruptive innovations,

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:56.689
because that's the
only way they're

01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:58.481
going to win in the
market in the long run.

01:08:58.481 --> 01:09:00.147
SARAH JANE MAXTED:
Well, I think there--

01:09:00.147 --> 01:09:00.770
so there are--

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:03.979
I think something
to think about.

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:06.365
Most applied programs
in government have--

01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:10.760
what do you call
them, working sessions

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.020
where they hear industry--
what do they call them?

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:13.520
Oh my god.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.145
Peer reviews?

01:09:14.145 --> 01:09:15.020
Oh, not peer reviews.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.395
I don't know what
they call them.

01:09:16.395 --> 01:09:18.290
But it's basically
where you bring together

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:23.263
the community of practice
of all of the people

01:09:23.263 --> 01:09:24.680
that make sense
to bring together,

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:27.310
in solar and
batteries or whatever,

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:32.090
and you have a conversation
to identify pain points.

01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:34.075
And all of the ERE does this.

01:09:34.075 --> 01:09:35.450
The Energy Efficiency
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:38.840
office and I know most
other applied programs

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.660
do as well, to kind of do that.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.720
But I actually think--
to your point about,

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.390
does it really make sense to
get all these execs in a room?

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.490
Are they really going to
move the ball forward?

01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:51.439
Is actually a really
interesting question,

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:55.550
because I think we're starting
to see more of the exevs

01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.100
in the room with the
midstream and the downstream,

01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.650
and all of the--

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:02.030
to actually be
innovative, it can't just

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:04.350
be the CEOs of these companies.

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:06.950
It has to actually be
different layers as well.

01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:11.650
And I think that goes to this--
they can do this kind of model.

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:13.950
I don't know if that
answered the question.

01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:15.990
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
I'm going to need to--

01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:18.610
if we're going to
get out of here,

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:21.280
I'm going to need to
do a wrap-up of today.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.600
And then I want to talk
about next week's class,

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.022
because seven of you
will be presenting,

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.980
and I just want to go
through the dynamics of--

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.195
that's going to be a
different kind of class,

01:10:30.195 --> 01:10:31.930
so I just want to
talk about that.

01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:33.930
But before we do that,
Rasheed, why don't you

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:37.440
lay out you know some closing
thoughts for us on this piece?

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.035
RASHEED: Yeah.

01:10:38.035 --> 01:10:39.660
So I didn't get to
it, and I was hoping

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:40.952
to, actually, another question.

01:10:40.952 --> 01:10:45.180
But another idea
that everybody had

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:48.330
was identifying policy
and policymakers

01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:51.540
to give this impetus towards
making these changes,

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.090
and making these
changes more politically

01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:56.250
favorable and apparent.

01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:58.730
And it's difficult in
these legacy sectors

01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:00.480
because, I think,
you're facing and you're

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.822
up against powerful
vested interests.

01:11:02.822 --> 01:11:04.530
And I think it's just,
to Martin's point,

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:08.190
making the case for, maybe
I don't have fusion yet,

01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:11.910
but it's making it socially
applicable or politically

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:16.402
palatable to say, if we invest
here and get this fusion,

01:11:16.402 --> 01:11:18.360
we can make this change
that can be politically

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.710
favorable for everybody.

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:23.418
And so I think looking
at policy incentives,

01:11:23.418 --> 01:11:24.960
you have to think
a little bit bigger

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.770
than just what is scientifically
or technologically possible.

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:31.198
But I think this
is a great piece,

01:11:31.198 --> 01:11:33.740
and this is was a great piece
for us because it encourages us

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:37.855
to not only think about
innovation systems as being

01:11:37.855 --> 01:11:40.230
differentiating-- you can do
different things but achieve

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:41.160
the same result--

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.460
but also, a lot of people have
to buy into and get on board

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.200
and be coordinated
in their actions

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.110
to achieve feasible
and long-term change,

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:50.910
because we have a
lot bigger problems

01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:52.998
than we did 50 or 100 years ago.

01:11:52.998 --> 01:11:54.540
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
And a lot of them

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.940
are tied to these
legacy sectors.

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.080
Thank you.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.320
So I'm going to do a quick
wrap-up of this class.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.880
So our backdrop was Donald
Stokes and Pasteur's Quadrant,

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.450
and that led us into
Branscomb and Auerswald.

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:17.650
And their underlying-- the focus
of innovation policy, frankly,

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:22.073
for the last 25 years
has been on the problem

01:12:22.073 --> 01:12:24.240
that they write about, this
valley of death problem.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.260
And how do you get across it?

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.390
But one thing I want
to be clear about today

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:32.680
is, the valley of death is
only one piece of a larger

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.500
innovation system which
stretch a lot further than just

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.570
research and
development, and we've

01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:41.350
got to think about the gaps
in that system overall.

01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:42.910
But Branscomb and
Auerswald really

01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:46.300
lead us into this
foundational problem.

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:51.220
And a valley of death is
essentially a linear view,

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.220
and they also point out that,
hey, the system is really not

01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:54.820
linear.

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.120
It's more complex than that.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.660
It's this Darwinian sea.

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:04.210
Ruttan describes for us
this parallel universe.

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:07.480
We have a set of civilian
basic research agencies,

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.510
and then we have a very
differently organized set

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:14.350
of defense R&D agencies
and mission agencies.

01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:15.940
And they are very
different systems,

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.190
and one is, from an
organizational point

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:20.950
of view purposely disconnected.

01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:23.620
The other is
purposely connected,

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:25.900
and they are different worlds.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.517
We have gotten a lot out of
that defense innovation system.

01:13:29.517 --> 01:13:31.600
We don't normally think
about it or talk about it,

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.120
but the results
are quite powerful.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.810
Glenn Fong told us
about the models

01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:40.120
that DoD uses when
it's actually going

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:43.690
to play a role in
civilian sectors,

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:46.960
and laid out the byproduct
model, the spin-off model,

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.260
the dual-use model, the
industrial base model.

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:53.890
So these are all models
the DoD uses in practice.

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:56.320
We looked at In-Q-Tel,
which in some ways

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.560
is the most extreme model
of governmental intervention

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.110
into the private sector,
because it will actually

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:04.540
play the role of being
a venture capital firm

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:08.410
and take ownership positions
in companies that it wants

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:12.250
to encourage innovation in.

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:16.390
We talked about the new model
innovation agency piece.

01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:20.830
Essentially, the idea here is
that the system isn't static.

01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:23.920
It isn't standing still from the
time Vannevar Bush created it.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.280
It has been changing pretty
dynamically over time.

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.800
And these outside crises--

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.960
the competitiveness
challenge in the 1980s,

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:36.710
the Sputnik challenge of
the later part of the '50s,

01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:40.180
the energy technology challenge,
now this advanced manufacturing

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.520
challenge-- these are
all external elements

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.190
that have been driving
change in the US system

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:50.640
and pushing its model to be
more of a connected model.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.890
And then the final reading
was about innovation

01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:56.130
in legacy sectors.

01:14:56.130 --> 01:15:00.450
As we discussed just now, many
of our deep societal problems

01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:03.270
are tied up in these
legacy sectors.

01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:05.580
And these legacy
sectors need innovation,

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:09.210
and they resist it
inherently in their model.

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:12.120
And how do you think about
innovation organization that's

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.970
going to start to
bring new technology

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:18.340
advances, new
innovative advances

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:20.230
into these legacy
sectors that they

01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:22.750
will be disruptive of
their business models?

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:24.250
How do we start to
think about that?

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:27.310
Because we're now
into that project,

01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:30.520
and we need to much more
systematically organize

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:33.970
our innovation organization
approaches to cope with it.

01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:37.550
So that takes us
through class 6.

01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:39.928
Next week is going to be
a different kind of class,

01:15:39.928 --> 01:15:42.220
because you guys are going
to own it much more than I'm

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.360
going to own it.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.850
So seven of you
will be presenters.

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:48.710
I'm asking that-- and I've
got pretty detailed directions

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:49.710
in describing the class.

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:51.700
If you've got
questions, let me know.

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.880
But divvy up the innovation
organization groups

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.200
you want to present on.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.390
And as we discussed
a few weeks ago,

01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:01.990
I'd love to have
innovation groups that

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:04.510
were based on other than dead
white males in the group.

01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:08.350
So if somebody can
find some, fine.

01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:09.490
And talk to me about them.

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:11.978
I may be able to
help you on sources.

01:16:11.978 --> 01:16:13.270
If you can't, that's fine, too.

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:16.240
And these are very interesting
groups, so it's going to be--

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.170
whichever one you pick, these
are very interesting stories.

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:22.560
I think we'll have
fun with them.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.330
And the great group
model takes us--

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.910
we've been talking about
institutional innovation.

01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:30.430
We talked a lot
about that today.

01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:32.740
Innovation at the
institutional level.

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.720
But innovation
belongs to people,

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.270
and they organize
themselves in groups,

01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:39.520
and we have to understand
the dynamics of those groups

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.840
as well.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.400
So that's what the
object of the class is.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.010
So I'm going to
ask the presenters

01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:49.900
to do three or four slides
on your group, and tell us

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:52.360
what they accomplished,
what they did.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:59.670
Tell us what-- the rules that
they followed from the Bennis

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:01.670
and Biederman
framework, which is

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:03.530
one of the several
foundational readings

01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:04.940
that everybody should read.

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:06.920
What were the rules
that they followed?

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.520
And then what is
a new rule or two

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.590
that you see them doing
that's different in the Bennis

01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:13.850
and Biederman rule?

01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:16.670
What's different about
your particular group

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:21.040
that contributes to our thinking
about how great groups operate?

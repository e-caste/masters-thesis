00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.250
At a pristine lake in Ontario, Canada, scientists
had been adding low levels of estrogen to

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.710
the lake and were watching for changes. The
levels were approximately equal to the concentration

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.000
of estrogen found in treated sewage discharge.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.680
The result: fathead minnow populations began
to collapse!

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.109
Many of the chemicals that we use and release,
whether on purpose or by accident, can have

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.070
severe effects on organisms and ecosystems.
To predict the accumulation and levels of

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.409
contaminants, we can use differential equations.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:43.220
This video is part of the Differential Equations
video series.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.909
Laws that govern a system's properties can
be modeled using differential equations.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.470
Hi, my name is David Griffith, and I'm a graduate
student in the MIT/Wood's Hole Joint Program

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.940
in Oceanography and the Department of Civil
and Environmental Engineering at MIT.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.040
Before watching this video, you should be
familiar with defining control volumes and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.930
applying conservation of mass.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.640
After watching this video, you will be able
to: Construct a differential equation to estimate

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.100
the concentration of a chemical in the environment;
and Appreciate how informed estimates can

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.150
help simplify and solve these differential
equations.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.680
While everyday chemicals provide a range of

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.789
benefits to society, they are often released
into the environment and can cause unintended

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.729
harm.
Examples include acid rain from smokestack

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.200
sulfur emissions, toxic groundwater from leaky
gas station tanks, and endocrine disruption

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.470
in fish populations due to treated and raw
sewage discharges.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.070
It would be helpful if we could monitor the
levels of potentially hazardous chemicals

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.479
in the environment. But, given the tens of
thousands of chemicals in daily use, it shouldn't

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.890
be surprising that measuring all of them is
not practical.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.110
So, what we need is a framework for simplifying
a very complex world. We accomplish this through

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.920
the use of mathematical models, which are
simplified versions of reality.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.410
Many models take the form of differential
equations, which describe how one variable,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.920
like the concentration of a chemical, changes
with respect to another variable, like time.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.030
By applying conservation of mass, we can model
the change in chemical concentration with

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.030
time as being equal to the inputs minus the
outputs. An input is the rate at which a chemical

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.400
enters our control volume. An output is the
rate at which the chemical leaves the control

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.490
volume.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.160
To find the inputs and outputs of chemicals

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.610
into a control volume, the first step is to
identify the ways that chemicals enter and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.990
leave the control volume.
If we think about the estrogen experiment

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.959
in Ontario, the estrogen entered the lake
from the scientist intentionally dumping estrogen

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.020
from a motorboat and from the fish themselves.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.599
Once released into the lake, there are many
ways estrogens can leave the lake. A stream

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.430
could carry the estrogens out of the lake.
Also, physical, chemical, and biological processes

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.760
within the lake could degrade the estrogens
to inactive byproducts.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.280
In my own research, I am interested in the
fate of estrogens in the treated sewage that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.040
is discharged into Massachusetts Bay.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.110
To start, I had two initial questions:

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.239
1) would the estrogen levels in the bay be
high enough to detect with our instruments?

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.819
And
2) how much water would I need to collect?

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.569
To answer these questions, I needed to estimate
the concentration of estrogen in the bay.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.989
This is where the differential equation comes
in. We can set up the equation by setting

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:01.489
the time change in estrogen concentration
(dC/dt) equal to inputs minus outputs.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.180
Note that our definition of outputs includes
both physical flows and chemical reaction

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.160
rates. What are the possible inputs? Because
Massachusetts Bay receives 360 million gallons

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.548
of treated sewage discharge from the city
of Boston every day, we can assume here that

00:04:20.548 --> 00:04:25.499
sewage is the dominant input.
Now, can you think of any removal processes

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.340
(that is, outputs) besides water leaving the
bay? Pause the video here and write down a couple.

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.240
There are many possible outputs, including

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:50.469
the rates of dilution, sedimentation, biodegradation,
loss to the atmosphere, and photodegradation.

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.779
Observe that some of these estrogen outputs
remove estrogens from the control volume,

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:02.779
while others chemically transform estrogens
into other compounds.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.979
At this point we may decide to neglect terms
that we suspect will be small given what we

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.979
know about the characteristics of the particular
chemical and environment that we're modeling.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.979
For example, we might neglect loss to the
atmosphere because estrogen's structure means

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.469
it has a low vapor pressure.
In addition, the fact that sewage is discharged

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:31.219
from a pipe at the seafloor and will be trapped
below the sunlit surface allows us to neglect

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.308
photodegradation.
We include the inputs and outputs into the

00:05:35.308 --> 00:05:41.339
differential equation like so.
We're going to make two more simplifying assumptions

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:46.689
to make this equation easier to solve. Remember,
the goal is not to have a perfect model of

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.129
estrogens in the bay, but to make a quick
computation to estimate how much water I should

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:56.599
collect before I will have levels of estrogen
that I can detect.

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.789
The two simplifying assumptions we make are
that: 1. The distribution of estrogens in

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:08.789
the control volume is uniform. That is, the
bay is "well mixed. 2. The concentration is

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:15.809
constant in time, that is the inputs and outputs
are balanced. We could solve this equation

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:20.289
without assuming that the concentration is
constant in time, but this would make our

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.300
solution a lot more complex, so for OUR back
of the envelope calculation, this is OK.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.499
Let's look at the terms in our differential

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:39.099
equation. The input rate is represented by
the mass flux, which is the mass per time,

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:46.099
Q, of estrogen leaving the wastewater treatment
plant, divided by the volume, V, of the bay.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.860
Dilution rate is represented by the dilution rate constant K dilution times C.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.960
Sedimentation rate is determined in terms
of the concentration of estrogens that are

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:04.159
attached to solid particles, since only the
estrogen on solid particles will sink.

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:09.569
Keep in mind that the solid particle estrogens
are represented by some fraction fs of the

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:11.779
total concentration.

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:17.819
So the sedimentation rate is represented by
the sedimentation rate constant, k_sed, times

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:24.819
the fraction of the concentration of estrogen
attached to solid particles.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:32.120
Biodegradation rate is represented by the
biodegradation rate constant k_deg times C.

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:38.909
Assuming steady state we get this equation.
Grouping like terms, and solving for C we

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:44.149
get this.
Now we can isolate C and solve the equation

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:49.529
using what we know or can estimate about the
chemical or the system.

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:53.749
Once we solved for the concentration of estrogen
in the bay, we determined that we needed to

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:58.319
collect 20 liters of water in order to make
the necessary measurements.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.140
Here you see me on Massachusetts
bay collecting water samples.

00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:13.050
We would collect 8 samples of 20L of water
per day, extract and concentrate each sample

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:18.039
down to 100 micro liters before high enough
levels of estrogens could be experimentally

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:25.039
measured using a mass spectrometer. The model
was key in helping me plan my sampling strategy.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.169
It turns out that this quick estimate was
pretty good, and I've collected and was able

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:33.990
to detect estrogens in Massachusetts bay.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.590
Now I can use these measurements to refine
my model. For example, I might remove the

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:43.049
assumption that the concentration is unchanging
in time.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:48.430
By comparing measured and predicted concentrations,
we can also hypothesize about which processes

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:54.070
are dominant and discover potential missing
processes that affect estrogen concentration

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.980
in the bay.
Once these hypotheses are well formed, we

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:05.020
can then design new experiments to test them.
And can continue to refine the model.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.080
Ultimately, it's the iterative process of
taking measurements and refining our model

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.210
that allows us to answer important questions
about whether estrogen levels are likely to

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.670
pose a hazard in the bay.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.820
We have demonstrated how differential equations

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.750
and simplifying assumptions can be used to
help us predict the concentration of a contaminant

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:35.750
in a coastal bay. We have shown a simple example,
but the approach can be applied to any chemical

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:42.320
in any control volume and at any scale. So,
the next time you are marveling at the complexity

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.360
of the world around you, you can imagine how
you might construct a model using differential

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.180
equations to help you understand it better.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.080
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.480
So we are still in a
discussion of atoms

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.740
in external magnetic fields.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.840
And we are working our way
up from simple static fields

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.190
to time dependent fields.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.850
Last week and the
week before, we

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.760
covered external magnetic
fields, Zeeman shifts,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.660
different coupling limits,
strong field, and weak field.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.970
Last class on Friday,
we talked about what

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.030
happens when you put atoms
into DC electric fields.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.250
So what we did was simple.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.980
Lowest order, which means
in this case, second order

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.340
perturbation theory.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.720
And we derived an
explicit expression

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.350
for the polarizability, alpha.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.300
And this polarizability
tells us how energy levels

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.900
are shifted quadratically
with the electric field.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.060
I put some emphasis
in talking about what

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.210
is inside perturbation theory
and identified with you that,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.350
yes, if you have
an electric field,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.370
we have electrostatic energy.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.370
But in order to
polarize the atoms,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.950
we have to create
an internal energy.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.410
In a concrete example,
if we have an s state,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.180
we have to mix a p state
to create a dipole moment.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.160
And this costs energy.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.280
Exactly in the same way
as when you have a spring

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.890
and pull on the
spring with gravity,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.630
you gain gravitational energy.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.645
But you have two pay
exactly half of it

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:06.590
to create internal
energy in your spring.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.820
And this is actually the
reason for this factor of 1/2

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.055
as we discussed in great length.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.680
Question is do you have any
questions about that part?

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.150
Because we want to
go to the next level.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.125
Perturbation theory?

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.360
DC polorizability?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.350
So anyway, the menu
for today is we

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.180
have done perturbation theory
here for weak electric fields.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.570
But the question came already
up in class, is it really valid?

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.470
Or for what regime
is it invalid?

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.700
So today I want to
talk to you briefly

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.550
what happens when we go
beyond perturbation theory.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:02.810
When we go beyond the
quadratic Stark effect.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.540
And that leads us
to a discussion

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.400
on stability of atoms in
strong electric field and field

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.560
ionization.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.970
I like to sort of feature
it because it allows

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.650
me to tell you something
about the peculiar properties

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.550
of Rydberg atoms.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.730
And also the
ionization of Rydberg

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.420
atoms through electric field.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.050
This is how people in our
field create cold plasmas.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.730
And it's also a way to do a very
sensitive detection of atoms.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.110
So what I'm telling you today
is interesting for its own sake,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.020
but also because it's an
important tool for manipulating

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.900
atoms, creating plasmas,
or sensitive detection.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.850
So this will probably only
take 10 or 20 minutes.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.580
And then we want to go
form DC electric fields

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.530
to AC electric fields.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.570
So we then discuss
the AC polarizability.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.730
And, well, that will take
us from perturbation theory

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.280
in a time independent way what
we have done now for DC fields

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.160
to time dependent
perturbation theory.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.470
So all the topics are
rather basic aspects

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.020
of quantum physics.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.250
But as usual, I try to give
you some special perspectives

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.560
from the atomic physics side.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:36.550
So in perturbation theory, we
have a mixture of other states.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.725
And this said mixture is
done with the matrix element.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.650
And in perturbation
theory, we always

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.430
have an energy denominator.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.510
Intermediate state
to ground state.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.740
And if the electric field
is smaller than this value,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.880
then we have mixture of other
states into the ground state.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.850
So usually when we estimate
the validity of perturbation

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.590
theory, we look
for the state which

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.270
is closest to the ground state.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.320
For which the energy
denominator is smallest.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.510
So therefore, i here is the
nearest state, but, and this

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.090
is important, of
opposite parity.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.060
Otherwise, because of the
parity selection rule,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.672
the matrix element would
be 0 and electric field

00:05:42.672 --> 00:05:44.460
does nothing.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.685
I made a comment on Friday,
but let me do it again.

00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:50.800
That, of course, means that
when we apply electric field

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.890
to our favorite
atoms, we don't have

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.660
to worry about the
other hyperfine states.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.840
The other hyperfine states have
the same spatial wave function.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.260
Have the same parity.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.770
So we are really here talking
about the first excited state.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.630
And a concrete example
for those of you

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.420
who work with alkalis
with an s ground

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.930
state, the relevant
energy scale here

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.460
is the excitation energy
to the first p state.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.910
So let's just estimate it
for a single electron atom.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:34.220
And well, this is a
hydrogenic estimate.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:44.890
The excitation energy to
the first excited state.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.610
1s to 2p is about 1 Rydberg.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.170
And the Rydberg is
nothing, or Hartree,

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.720
and that's nothing else
than e square over a0.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.800
It's electric potential
of two charges separated

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.160
by Bohr radius.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:08.560
And if we estimate
that the matrix element

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.830
for strong transition is on
the order of the Bohr radius,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.330
there are no other length
scales in the problem,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.750
we find that the value for the
electric field in atomic units

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.990
is the charge divided by
the Bohr radius squared.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.070
And this is really high.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:36.350
It is on the order of 5 times
10 to the 9 volt per centimeter.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:47.190
And this is 1,000 times
larger than laboratory

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.100
electric fields.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.400
Those fields would just create
sparking along the electrodes.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.820
You cannot apply such
high electric fields

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.390
in a laboratory.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.020
So, therefore, nothing
to worry about.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.670
If you have ground state
atoms, the Stark effect

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.974
in perturbation theory
is all you need.

00:08:10.974 --> 00:08:12.890
Actually, to be a little
bit more precise when

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:18.740
I used the Rydberg and a0, I
made a little bit overestimate.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.820
So that the typically the
critical electric field

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.050
which would cause a breakdown
of perturbation theory

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.590
for the ground
state is around 10

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.780
to the 9 volt per centimeter.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:38.340
OK, so we are safe when we
talk about ground states.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.830
But once we got to the excited
state, we have degeneracy.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.320
p states have a
three fold degeneracy

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.720
and they are states
with opposite parity.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.450
So we can't have mixing there.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.670
And actually as we will
see for excited states,

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.420
we have already a breakdown
of perturbation theory

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.050
at very, very small
electric field.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.380
So let us discuss
hydrogenic orbits

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.180
with principal
quantum number, n.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:17.810
And if you estimate what is
the size of the matrix element?

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.040
Well, it's not just a0.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.140
There is a scaling with
n which is n square.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.210
The matrix element in higher
and higher excited state scales

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:28.990
with n square.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.230
Well, how does the
energy separation scale?

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.530
Well, let's not
discuss hydrogen here.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.074
Because in hydrogen, energy
levels are degenerate.

00:09:42.074 --> 00:09:43.740
And we would immediately
get a breakdown

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.500
of perturbation theory.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.810
Let's rather formulate
it for general atoms.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:56.200
And we had this nice discussion
about the quantum defect.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:05.587
So if we compare the energy of
two l states, they scale as 1

00:10:05.587 --> 00:10:06.170
over n square.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:22.500
But for different l states, we
have different quantum defects.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.860
Delta l plus 1.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.520
And here we have delta l.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.420
So, therefore, doing
an expansion in m

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.820
which we assume to be large, we
find that the energy difference

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.920
is proportional to the
difference between the quantum

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.480
defects for the
two states we want

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.490
to mix with the electric field.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:56.360
And then again, the scaling with
the principal quantum number

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.270
is n cube.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.470
So, therefore, we find
for the critical field

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.240
using the criterion
I mentioned above.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.060
We take the energy splitting.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.420
The energy the denominator which
appears in perturbation theory.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.895
We divide by the value
of the matrix element.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:36.940
Well, we had the Rydberg
constant or two times

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:45.150
the Rydberg constant is nothing
else than b squared over a0.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:49.190
The matrix element
was 1 over a0.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:56.280
And then we have the difference
between quantum defects.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.310
And now-- and this makes
it really so dramatic.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.730
We had an n square scaling
of the matrix element.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.970
And we have an into the minus 3
scaling of energy differences.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:13.560
So that means the critical
field scales by n to the 5.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.920
Go to an excited state
with n equals 10.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.665
And the breakdown of
perturbation theory

00:12:18.665 --> 00:12:22.110
happens 100,000 times earlier.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.280
So some of the scaling
in atomic physics

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.365
is very, very
dramatic when you go

00:12:27.365 --> 00:12:29.540
to more highly excited state.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:44.650
If you threw in that quantum
defects become very small,

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.810
once you go beyond
s and p states.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.260
The higher states just don't
penetrate into the nucleus.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:58.010
So if l is larger than 2, if
you have more complicated atoms,

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.740
you may add the angular
momentum of the core here.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.490
But so if you put n to the 5
scaling and the small quantum

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.780
defect together, you find
that critical electric fields

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:16.490
are smaller than one
volt per centimeter

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:22.340
already for principal
quantum numbers as low as 7.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:28.610
So that means bring a 1.5 volt
battery close to your atom

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.080
and you drive it crazy.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.835
You drive it out of
perturbation theory.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.790
So what we have
is the following.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.620
We have, of course,
the structure

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.120
of atoms in excited field.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.910
Here is the electric field.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.810
And let me just
pick three n values.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.660
18, 19, 20.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.500
And now the
structure, of course,

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:04.630
is that by the
criterion I actually

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.740
gave you was the criterion for
the application of perturbation

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.790
theory.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.640
If the energy levels are
smaller than the matrix element,

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.940
you have to rediagonalize
between those levels.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.710
And that gives you then not a
quadratic, but a linear effect.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.160
So, therefore, the
structure is here

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:31.071
that you have a region where
you have strong l mixing.

00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:32.820
So you have to use
degenerate perturbation

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.550
theory for the
different l states.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:40.450
But the many folds in n, the
principle quantum number,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.640
are still well separated.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.100
But then, eventually,
when you go further,

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.100
you have a region which
is called n mixing.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.150
So now the electric
field is really

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.900
completely rediagonalizing your
states with different quantum

00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.710
numbers, n.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.500
So the result of
this discussion is

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.210
that highly excited
states of atoms

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.985
behave very differently
from ground state atoms.

00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:18.880
And n to the 5 scaling
is sensitivity to volt

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.070
per centimeter.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.680
Level mixing all over the place.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.530
And that's why for those
highly excited states,

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.730
people have coined the word
Rydberg atoms or Rydberg

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.440
matter.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.930
That means atoms with higher
principal quantum numbers.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:45.310
And the study of Rydberg
atoms was pioneered, well,

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.610
the early pioneering work
by our own, Dan Kleppner.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:54.370
And then Herbert
Walther in Munich

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.900
who happened to be
my Ph.D. Advisor.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.330
And finally, Serge
Haroche, who was recognized

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.510
with the last Nobel Prize
together with Dave Wineland.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.020
So this is not just theory.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:21.600
What I am showing to
you here is spectroscopy

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.410
done at MIT by Dan Kleppner.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.990
So what is done here is
from the ground state,

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.970
they excite to an excited state.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:37.400
And whenever you hit an excited
state, you see a signal.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:43.250
Let's focus on the upper part.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.980
So if at a given electric
field, you scan the laser,

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.520
you get one of those traces.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.640
You find peaks, peaks, peaks.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.510
And those peaks correspond to
the different and many folds

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.880
with strong Stark mixing.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.860
And eventually when you go
to somewhat higher field,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.980
you have states
all over the place.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.130
And this is the regime where
you have done n mixing.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.640
So in the '70s and
'80s, there was really,

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.859
those experiments obtained
a clear understanding

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:20.680
and description
of atoms in, well,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.400
I would say high
electric fields.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.900
But the fields were not so high.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.185
It was just the atoms were
very sensitive that already

00:17:26.185 --> 00:17:27.560
is at lower electric
fields, they

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.920
reached what is regarded
as the high-field limit.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.990
Now the question is
when we recorded signal,

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.930
suddenly the traces stop.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.520
And that means the electric
field is now so high

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.980
that the atom no longer
has a stable state.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.860
The electric field is so
high that it literally rips

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.740
the electron away from the atom.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.580
And if you go to higher
states, the electric field

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.900
where this happens is lower.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.440
This is the process
of field ionization

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.891
and that's what we
want to discuss next.

00:18:07.891 --> 00:18:08.390
Question?

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.687
AUDIENCE: Um, for what atoms?

00:18:09.687 --> 00:18:12.020
PROFESSOR: Those studies were
actually done for lithium.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.050
It's actually peculiar.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.030
Dan Kleppner really
liked hydrogen.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.940
Dan Kleppner is the
person who tried

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.570
to do almost all
experiments with hydrogen.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.630
The famous BEC experiment.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.820
He also had the
Rydberg experiment

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.125
which was just in building 26
where Vladan Vuletic teaches

00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:33.110
now, his labs.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.780
This is where
spectroscopy of hydrogen

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.120
were done with the
goal of a precision

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.440
measurement of the
Rydberg constant.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.700
So we excited hydrogen to
some of those high levels.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.900
But as probably
the experts know,

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.080
the hydrogen atom is the
hardest atom to work with.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.790
Because you need
[INAUDIBLE] and alpha.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.280
You have this huge gap to
the first excited state.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.180
And that's why if
you can get away,

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.090
you try to work
with other atoms.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.615
And in those
experiments, those people

00:19:02.615 --> 00:19:04.710
worked with the lithium atom.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.760
So the lithium atom
has a quantum defect

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.710
which will actually contrast
to hydrogen where the quantum

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.900
defect is 0.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.450
And this will actually
be very, very important

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.334
for field ionization as
I want to discuss now.

00:19:18.334 --> 00:19:19.000
Other questions?

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:30.720
OK, so at a given electric
field, states, so to speak,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.580
just disappear.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.720
They're no longer stable.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.583
And this is the process which
is called field ionization.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:56.990
So the phenomenon is
that sufficiently strong

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:03.950
electric fields ionize the atom.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.150
And whenever there
is a simple model

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.270
and I can give you an analytic
answer, I try to do that.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.690
Because I feel a
lot of our intuition

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.760
is shaped by understanding
simple models.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.370
And the simplest model
for field ionization

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.520
is just the classical
model by calculating

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.570
what is the settle point
in the combined potential.

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.550
The combined potential
of the nucleus

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:38.320
which is a Coulomb potential
and the external magnetic field.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.880
So many features
of the experiment

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.880
can be understood by this
simple three line derivation.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.920
So we have a potential.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:56.240
One part of it is the
Coulomb potential.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.620
And focusing on one
spatial direction here.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:09.655
And then, in addition, we
apply an electric field.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.785
And the electric field
creates a linear potential.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.970
And if I take the sum of the
two, well, at large distances,

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.860
see, it's the electric
field which dominates.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.320
Then the Coulomb
potential takes over.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.800
So that's how it looks like.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:42.190
So now we have the situation
if we would put in atoms

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.620
and we would look at
the energy eigenvalues.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:52.100
At this point, this is
the maximum excited state

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.800
in the atom which
is still stable.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.400
So what I want to derive
for you is what determines

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.630
the stability is simply
the settle point.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:06.170
When the binding energy of
the excited state for which we

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.990
use the Rydberg
formula is not stronger

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.680
than the position
of the settle point,

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.140
the atom becomes unstable it
and becomes field ionized.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.900
And we'll discuss
a little bit later

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.510
if this really
applies to real atoms.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.820
The quick answer is for lithium
and all the other atoms,

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.810
it applies.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.630
For hydrogen, it doesn't.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.624
Because hydrogen has
too many symmetries.

00:22:30.624 --> 00:22:31.790
Too many exact degeneracies.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:46.050
OK, so the total potential
is the Coulomb potential

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.396
plus the electric potential.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:02.210
What we need is the position
of the settle point.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:07.200
Where we have a
maximum in this one.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.570
This is a one dimensional cut.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.810
And this one dimensional cut
has a maximum at this position.

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:16.610
And by taking the derivative
of the total potential,

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:21.530
you immediately find
this to be of that value.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.490
And now what we are
calculating next

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:30.455
is what is the potential
energy at this point.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:42.160
And, well, this is just copy
from the notes, e to the 3/2.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.140
And now what we want
to do is we want

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:51.290
to postulate that
for field ionization,

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:56.970
this should be able to the
binding energy of the electron.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.620
Which is nothing
else than the Rydberg

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.160
constant divided by n square.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.160
OK, now here, we
have the square root

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:20.140
of the electric field
from this calculation.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:25.530
So that means the critical
electric field will scale as 1

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:26.690
over n to the 4.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.930
And this is a
famous scaling which

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.900
can be found in many textbooks.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:43.070
That the critical electric
field for ionization equals,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.080
and now, that's the
beauty of atomic units,

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.090
it is 1/16, n to the 4.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:54.670
Beautiful formula derived from
the settle point criteria.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.070
Of course, what I mean here is,
and if you do the derivation,

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:59.215
it's in atomic units.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:08.460
Which means in units
of the atomic unit

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.390
of the electric field which is
e over the Bohr radius squared.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.650
So it's a simple model.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.150
It's an analytic result.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.980
The question is is it valid?

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.560
Does it make any sense?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:33.579
And the answer is yes, but in
a quantum mechanical problem,

00:25:33.579 --> 00:25:35.620
you would actually solve
Schroedinger's equation,

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.750
such a potential.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.510
But then, the onset
of field ionization

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:44.060
comes when tunnelling becomes
possible for this barrier.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.510
But it is the
nature of tunnelling

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.190
that if you're a little bit too
low, tunneling is negligible.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.730
You may have ionization rates
of 1 per millisecond or so.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.880
And if you just go
a little bit closer,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.710
it becomes exponentially larger.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.750
So, therefore, this scaling
is very, very accurate.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.630
Because the transition where
you go from weak tunneling,

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.470
to strong tunneling, to
spilling over the barrier,

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.530
it's a very narrow range
of electric fields.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.460
But, yes, people have looked
at it in great details

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:24.220
and have calculated
corrections due to tunneling.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:29.890
So these are quantum corrections
to the classical threshold

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:30.890
which I just calculated.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:27:02.370
But now in hydrogen, a lot of
n, l mixing matrix elements,

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.000
matrix elements due
to the electric field

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.910
between an l states vanish.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:13.990
Hydrogen is just too
pure, too precise.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.670
There is actually
parabolic quantum numbers

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.330
where you can
exactly diagonalize

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.040
hydrogen electric fields.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.860
And you find some stable
states which do not decay.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.360
And they are above the
classical threshold

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:31.840
we have just calculated.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.440
So as Dan Kleppner would have
said, the simplest of all atoms

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.050
is the most complicated when
it comes to field ionization.

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:46.670
Because it has a
lot of stable states

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.940
above the classical barrier.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.410
So you can sort of
envision that there

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.060
will be orbits which are
just confined to this region.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.180
And the electron never
samples the settle point.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:19.210
And if you look at it
this diagram on the wiki,

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.930
these are actually
calculations for hydrogen

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.740
which include ionization rates.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.680
You will find that
the states which

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.600
are the ones which
go down, which

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.730
are on the downhill side
of the electric field,

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:38.870
you see always here marked
an onset for ionization.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.980
And then you see
a rapid increase

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.610
in the ionization rate.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.160
But you also see
those hydrogenic state

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.590
which go upward in energy
and they refuse to ionize.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.410
Because of the symmetry
of parabolic coordinates

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.190
and the things I've mentioned.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.020
Anyway, it's too especially
to spend more time here

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.590
in class on it, but I just
think you should at least know

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:07.890
qualitatively what is
different for hydrogen.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.170
OK, so that's what
I wanted to tell you

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:21.220
about high electric fields and
field ionization in principle.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.820
Let me now briefly mention
important applications

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.700
of field ionization.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:55.070
One is close to 100% detection
efficiency for atoms.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.680
If you want to
detect single atoms,

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.500
for instance, you'll
have a krypton sample

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.950
and you want to find a
rare isotope of krypton

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.720
for dating the material.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.710
You need an extremely
high sensitivity

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.000
and you may just have a few
single atoms in the sample.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.680
One way to do it would be
that you excite the atom maybe

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.640
through an intermediate
state, to Rydberg state.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.380
And then by just applying
a few volt per centimeter,

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.460
you get an ion.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.380
And ions can be counted
by particle detectors.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.320
You can accelerate the ion,
smash it into a surface

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.390
and count the particles with
close to 100% efficiency.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:51.130
And this is one of the most
sensitive detection schemes.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.680
I remember in the
aftermath of Chernobyl,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.890
there was an interest
in detection schemes

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.180
for radioactive strontium.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.450
And on the wiki, I
give you a reference

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:04.070
where some people developed
this resonance ionization

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.480
spectroscopy for
some atomic isotopes.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.760
Which unfortunately
appeared more frequently

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.030
after the Chernobyl disaster.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.700
And they developed
a method based

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.180
on excitation to Rydberg states.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.020
Which was more sensitive
than other methods.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:25.295
You may ask why don't you
ionize it with a laser?

00:31:25.295 --> 00:31:28.930
Well, the fact is, you can
photoionize it with a laser.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.460
It's another alternative, but
it takes much more laser power.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.880
Because if you excite
into the continuum,

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.090
the matrix element
is much smaller.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:40.710
And often, if you want to have
100% ionization probability

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:45.170
to go into the continuum, you
need such high laser power

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:49.750
that you may get some background
of resonant ionization

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.160
of other elements and such.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.760
So Rydberg atoms is really
the smart way to go.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:59.280
You go to an almost bound to
an almost unbound electron.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.170
And then it's just
the electric field

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:06.655
which causes the final
act of ionization.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:17.710
I also want to briefly mention
that the famous experiments

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:22.380
on Rydberg atoms by
Herbert Walther and Serge

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:27.520
Haroche and collaborators
would not have been possible

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.690
without field ionization.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:38.370
I give you this one
reference, but I'm

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:42.160
sure you'll find more
in the actually very,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.910
very nicely written Nobel
lecture of Serge Haroche.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.300
I just read it a few
weeks ago and it's

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.480
a delight to read how
he exposes the field.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:58.690
So they did QED experiments by
having microwave transitions

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:02.020
between atoms in two
highly excited states.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.640
Let's say with principal
quantum number 50 and 51.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.320
So that's now conveniently
in the microwave regime.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:21.070
Then those atoms are
passed through a cavity.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:26.410
And in this cavity, single atoms
interact with single photons.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.840
And they have done beautiful
quantum non-demolition

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.440
experiments of single photons.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:37.830
I mean that's really wonderful,
state of the art experiments.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.430
Back to Rydberg atoms
and field ionization.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.740
Eventually, the read
out of those experiments

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.570
was you prepare atoms
in the state 50 or 51.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.600
And afterwards, if they have
absorbed or emitted a photon,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.640
they should be in
a different state.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.500
So you were interested in a very
high detection efficiency which

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.660
could distinguish
between 50 and 51.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.950
And of course there is a
way to distinguish that.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:07.230
And this is because
of n to the 4.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.400
You first apply
an electric field

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.810
which can only field ionized 51.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.750
And then you allow
the atoms to propagate

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.239
into a slightly
higher electric field.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.850
And then the 50s are ionized.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.530
So the standard
experiment is that you

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:29.065
pass those atoms between
two field plates.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:39.920
And by putting an angle
between them that indicates

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.469
the voltage is increasing.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:47.390
And then you have
two little holes.

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:52.310
You have some channel-drawn
particle detectors.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:59.200
And the first detector
will detect the 51s

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.850
and the second detector will
detect the lower lying states.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:06.690
So you can detect every
atom with high probability,

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.300
but also in a state
selective way.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:21.930
So this way of doing state
selective field ionization

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:25.370
based on the discussion
we had earlier, this

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:29.590
is sort of the method of
choice for experiments

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.080
involving Rydberg atoms.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.680
Any questions about atoms
in the electric fields?

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.320
Well, then.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:59.010
Frequently we add
time dependence.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.690
So what we should
do next is atoms

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.790
in oscillating electric fields.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:10.320
It's also a good way to
review what we have done.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.190
Because the first
thing to do now

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:16.160
is we calculate the
polarizability for AC fields.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.360
We calculate the
AC Stark effect.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.830
And, of course, if in the AC
Stark effect we said omega 2, 0

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.260
will retrieve the
DC Stark effect.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.460
So in a way, what I'm
doing for you now is

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.010
I'm using time dependent
perturbation theory

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.680
to obtain a new result.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.400
But it will reproduce
the result of time

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.250
independent perturbation theory
which we have just discussed.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:48.450
All right, so atoms in
oscillating electric fields.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.330
Of course the next
step is, and this

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.490
is where we are
working towards, we

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:04.214
will in the next few lectures
starting on Wednesday.

00:37:04.214 --> 00:37:06.630
Well, then there is Spring
Break, but in the next lectures

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.140
develop a deep
understanding what

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.120
happens when atoms
interact with light.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.800
And oscillating electric
fields is already

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.230
pretty close to light.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.760
And I want to
actually also show you

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.830
that we capture already a
lot of the phenomena which

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:25.175
happen with light except
for a full understanding

00:37:25.175 --> 00:37:28.220
of spontaneous emission.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.170
So we pretty much when we use
an oscillating electric field,

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:35.310
we allow the atom to
interact with just one

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:37.310
mode of the
electromagnetic field.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.740
Which is filled with
a coherent state.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.580
And this is so classical
that we don't even

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.760
need field quantization.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.050
We just use a classical
electric field.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:49.570
And this already gives us the
interaction of atoms with light

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.570
except for spontaneous
emission which

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.810
involves all the other modes.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.790
So that's what we do later.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:59.300
But today, we just do the
same classical description

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.680
of an atom in an
oscillating electric field.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:09.120
And this is the theory
of the AC Stark effect.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:14.650
So all we do is application
of time dependent perturbation

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:15.150
theory.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:25.546
So our electric field
is now time dependent.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:32.740
It has a value epsilon,
polarization e hat,

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:33.490
and it oscillates.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:41.120
Our perturbation
Hamiltonian is exactly

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:45.890
the same dipole Hamiltonian
we had before for the DC Stark

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.220
effect.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.170
But now it's a
time dependent one.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:39:03.430
And it will be useful to break
up the oscillating term in e

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.740
to the i omega, t and e
to the minus i omega t.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:14.320
I don't want to bore you with
perturbation theory in quantum

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:21.570
mechanics because you've
all seen it in 805 or 806.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:23.570
I just want to
jump to the result.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:26.120
You find more details
about it on the wiki.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.530
But all you do is you
parametrize your wave function,

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:35.560
you expand it into
eigenstates with amplitude an.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:44.820
And then you put it into
the Schroedinger equation

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:51.140
and assume that for
short times the atom

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.260
is in the ground state.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.700
The amplitude of the
ground state is 1.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.150
And the amplitude
of the excited state

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.810
is infinitesimal that you
can use the lowest order

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.240
perturbation.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.720
This immediately gives
you the first order result

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:10.150
for the amplitude in
an excited state, k.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.870
It only comes about because
your initial state, the ground

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:20.760
state, is coupled by the matrix
element to the excited state.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.190
It's linear in the
applied electric field.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:29.750
So what you do is you have
the Schroedinger equation

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:33.410
and you integrate it
from times 0 to time 1.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:39.490
And since you have e
to the i omega, t and e

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:47.460
to the minus i omega t, you
get two time dependent terms.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.080
e to the i.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:59.850
So what appears now is we
have the frequencies omega

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.990
n of the excited state.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:09.690
And now when we couple
the excited state, k,

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.620
to the ground
state, what appears

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.160
is the frequency
difference between the two.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.650
That's pretty much
the excitation gap.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:24.360
And we have a time dependent
oscillation at omega.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:29.160
And then we have, of
course, the same term

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.810
where we flip the
sign from omega--

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:34.120
let me write that more clearly.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:44.210
Where we flip the sign
from omega to minus omega.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.390
So that's the second term.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.880
By integrating an exponential
function with respect to time,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:00.150
we get an energy and a frequency
denominator which is this one.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:02.710
So this is really
just straight forward,

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.310
most basic plain
vanilla application

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.082
of perturbation theory.

00:42:07.082 --> 00:42:09.290
The only thing I want to
discuss because it sometimes

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.940
confuses people is
that we integrate

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:16.550
from times 0 to the finite time.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:21.450
And then you integrate,
you get contributions

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.280
from the upper
integration limit.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.000
And from the lower
integration limit.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.650
And this contribution at
the lower integration limit

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:40.950
is actually a transient.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.090
It is at the frequency.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.410
It doesn't depend on omega.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:54.590
So it's a beat node between
the ground and excited state.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.650
I could say at
frequency omega k,

00:42:56.650 --> 00:43:01.020
but then it's together with the
ground state, it's omega kg.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:06.450
And this is due to if you
switch on a perturbation,

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.390
it's like you suddenly
switch on the drive

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:09.580
of an harmonic oscillator.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.940
And you have some ringing.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:16.216
You have a transient at
the natural frequency

00:43:16.216 --> 00:43:17.340
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.780
It has nothing to
do with the drive.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:19.835
It's just a sudden onset.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:27.320
It's transient and frequent
due to the sudden switch on.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.580
So like any
transient, we haven't

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:34.742
included damping in here.

00:43:34.742 --> 00:43:36.200
We don't have
spontaneous emission.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.240
Everything is undamped.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.640
But eventually, all
those transients

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.560
will damp out with time.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.360
And as we should have known
also from the beginning,

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.890
when we drive a system, when
we switch on a perturbation,

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:52.670
just think about an
harmonic oscillator.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.460
You have a response at the
harmonic oscillator frequency

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.520
which is always
transient in nature.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.650
And then you have a response
at the dry frequency.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.520
And we are
interested, of course,

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:14.760
only in the driven response
The driven response

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.610
is at frequency
plus minus omega.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.290
That's how we drive it.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.380
But now I have to
be careful since I'm

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:27.050
looking at the amplitude and I
factor out the time dependence

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:32.540
of the time dependence of
the wave function, the time

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.560
dependence of the eigenstates.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.240
I'm now looking for drive
terms in this expression

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.940
for the amplitude which
are at frequency omega,

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:50.570
but modified by the ground.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.760
Or the frequency of
the ground state.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.180
But anyway, what I mean
is the relevant term

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.330
is the one which
depends on omega.

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:01.230
And in the following discussion,
I simply drop the minus 1

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:02.740
because it's a transient.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.440
If you would switch on your
time dependent electric field

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.715
in a smoother way, this
term would disappear.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.750
OK, let's now be specific.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:21.540
Let's assume the electric field
points in the z direction.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:33.670
For an isotropic medium,
the dipole moment,

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:37.406
the time dependent dipole
moment which we induce

00:45:37.406 --> 00:45:42.660
is also pointing
in the z direction.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:48.940
And so we want to calculate now
what is the dipole moment which

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:53.610
is created by the drive term?

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:58.610
By the driven electric Field

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:04.940
And for that, we simply
use the perturbation theory

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.820
we have just applied.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:12.640
We take the ground state and
its first order correction.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.445
And calculate the expectation
value of the dipole moment.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.820
In the line at the top, we
have the first order correction

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:26.850
to the ground state
wave function.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.600
And so we just plug it in.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.330
And what we obtain
is result where

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:39.930
we have the matrix
elements squared.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.270
Remember, we do first
order perturbation theory

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.660
which is one occurrence
of the matrix element,

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.640
but now we take a
second matrix element

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.550
because we're interested
in the dipole operator.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:54.085
So this gives us now a sum
over matrix element squared.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:01.890
We have e to the plus i omega
t and e to the minus i omega t.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:04.905
This means we get 2 times the
real part of this expression.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.890
And the time dependent
term is e to the i omega t.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:23.900
And then we have the term
with plus and minus omega.

00:47:27.941 --> 00:47:28.440
Yes.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.530
And so, most
importantly, everything

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.340
is driven by the electric field.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:57.500
We can now just to write
the result in an easier way,

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:01.420
we can use this result
with omega minus omega.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:07.840
And the real part
and write that.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:13.980
We can write that as
2 times omega k, g.

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:23.720
Omega k, g squared minus omega
squared, times cosine omega t,

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.500
times the electric field.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.410
And now finally, we
have the matrix element.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:37.020
We have integrated the e to the
i omega t function and such.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:41.350
So what we have here now is the
time dependent electric field.

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:45.710
And what we have
here is the factor

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:48.510
by which we multiply
the electric field

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:50.550
to obtain the bipole moment.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:52.820
And this is the
definition of the now

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.260
time dependent or frequency
dependent polarizability.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:00.260
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.012
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:49:01.012 --> 00:49:03.964
AUDIENCE: Why are we only
getting the cosine and not

00:49:03.964 --> 00:49:05.440
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:11.836
You only multiply by the other
terms to get the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.756
In terms of the cosine.

00:49:21.347 --> 00:49:23.180
PROFESSOR: I haven't
done the math yesterday

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.740
when I prepared for the class.

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.530
I did it a while ago
when I wrote those notes,

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:36.370
but you know, one comment, I
know you don't want to hear it,

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:37.650
but it's a following.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:40.010
This system has no
dissipation at all.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.490
And when I drive
it, I will always

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:48.740
get a response which is
in phase with the drive.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.030
It can be cosine omega t,
or minus cosine omega t.

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:53.120
You cannot get a
quadrature at this point.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:57.350
So if you find I've made a
mistake, and you would say,

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:59.900
there is a sine, omega
term, I've made a mistake.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:03.220
I know for physical reasons,
I cannot get a phase shift.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.180
You only get a phase shift
in the response of a system

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:08.956
to drive when you
have dissipation.

00:50:08.956 --> 00:50:10.980
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.864
I'll have to talk with you.

00:50:12.864 --> 00:50:14.280
PROFESSOR: But why
don't-- I mean,

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.990
I know the result is correct.

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:18.360
And this is just, I
hate to spend class time

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:23.000
in trying to figure out
if I've omitted one term.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
AUDIENCE: The real part.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.772
PROFESSOR: But the real part
what I've probably done is--

00:50:28.772 --> 00:50:30.730
AUDIENCE: I think that's
probably what you did.

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:31.229
Yeah.

00:50:31.229 --> 00:50:32.689
Thank you.

00:50:32.689 --> 00:50:34.230
PROFESSOR: I think
that's what I did.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:37.460
So let me, therefore,
also say we have now

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.520
included the real part of it.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:41.040
Yes.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.240
OK, thank you.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:56.760
OK, this part here
can actually--

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.190
that's how we often report.

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:01.340
And that's how you often
find in textbook the result,

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.920
the frequency dependence
of the AC polarizability.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:19.470
But I like to rewrite it
now in a different way which

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:20.915
is identical.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:31.340
And it shows now that there
are two contributions.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:40.680
And I will discuss
them in a moment.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:46.725
But those two contributions,
one has in the denominator,

00:51:46.725 --> 00:51:50.080
let's assume we excite the
system close to resonance.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.200
Omega is close to omega kg.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.720
Then one term is
much, much closer.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.980
It's to a near
resonant excitation.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.040
And from our discussion
about rotating frames,

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:05.100
we have all of this near
resonant excitation corresponds

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.310
to a corotating term.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:11.134
And the other one corresponds
to a counter rotating term.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.770
We've not assumed any
rotating fields here,

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:21.000
but we find those terms with
the same mathematical signature.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.520
And I will discuss
that little bit later.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.570
But the physics is between the
corotating and counterrotating

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:28.070
term.

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:35.190
And it's the
corotating term which

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.799
is the term which [INAUDIBLE]
the so-called rotating

00:52:37.799 --> 00:52:38.590
wave approximation.

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:45.050
I just want to identify
those two terms

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:50.720
and let's hold the thought for
until we have the discussion.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:55.740
What I first want to say
is the limiting case.

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:59.630
We have not made any
assumptions about frequency.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:07.380
When we let omega go to 0,
we obtain the DC result.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.900
It is important to point
out that when we have the DC

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:19.170
result, we can only get to
correct results because we have

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:25.720
equal contributions from co
and counterrotating terms.

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:37.650
So that's sort of a
question one could ask.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.850
You know, which mistake do you
do for the DC polarizability

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.740
when you do the rotating
wave approximation?

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.300
Well, you miss out
on exactly 50% of it.

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:48.215
Because both terms
become equally important.

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:58.750
I have deliberately focused
here on the calculation

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:01.380
of the dipole moment.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.640
Because the dipole, I simply
calculated the dipole moment

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.150
as being proportion
to the electric field.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:13.570
And the coefficient in front of
it is alpha the polarizability.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:18.260
You may remember that
when we calculated

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.490
the effect of a
static electric field,

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:25.480
we looked for the DC Stark shift
for the shift of energy levels.

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:30.125
We can now discuss also
the AC Stark shift.

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:39.890
Which is a shift of the
energy levels due to the time

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:41.220
dependent field.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.880
But I have to say you have
to be a little bit careful.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.700
And sometimes when I looked
at equations like this,

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.250
there is a moment of confusion
what you want to actually,

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:50.890
what the question is.

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:53.980
Because the wave function is now
a time dependent wave function.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:55.420
It's a driven system.

00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:57.705
It's no longer your time
independent Schroedinger

00:54:57.705 --> 00:54:59.550
equation and you
are asked, what is

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:02.210
the shift in the
value of eigenvalues?

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:05.700
So the AC Stark
shift here is now

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:10.710
given by the frequency
dependent polarizability.

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:14.540
And then, and I know some
textbooks do it right away.

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.520
And at the end of the
day, it may confuse you.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.390
It uses an average of e square.

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:24.060
So in other words, if you
have an electric field which

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:29.390
is cosine omega t, and you
calculate what is the AC Stark

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:32.930
shift, you get
another factor of 1/2.

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:37.700
Because cosine square omega
t time average is 1/2.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:41.190
So anyway, just
think about that.

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:44.237
It's one of those factors
of 1/2 which is confusing.

00:55:44.237 --> 00:55:45.320
Will, you have a question?

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.570
AUDIENCE: So when
we take omega goes

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:49.820
to 0 from our previous
results, are we still justified

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.320
in neglecting the
transient term?

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.320
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.136
But why?

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:14.790
What will happen is
the transient term

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:18.910
is really a term which
has time dependence.

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.600
And even if omega is 0,
just the step function

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:26.380
of switching it on
creates an oscillation

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:30.790
in the atom at a frequency
which is omega excited

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:33.240
state minus omega ground state.

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.830
You may think
about it like this.

00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:36.530
I give you more the
intuitive answer.

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:39.630
Take an atoms and put
it in electric field.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:42.790
If you gradually switch
on the electric field,

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:48.680
you create a dipole moment
by mixing at 0 frequency

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.650
a p state into the s state.

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:53.890
And that displaces the
electron from the origin.

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:57.030
But if you suddenly switch
on the electric field,

00:56:57.030 --> 00:57:00.520
you actually create a
response of the atoms which

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.500
has a beat node between the
excitation frequency of the p

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.110
state and the excitation
frequency of the s state.

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:11.260
And what you regard is the
DC response of the atom

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:15.650
is everything except
for this transient term.

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:17.940
However, and this tells
you maybe something

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.380
about the different formulas
in quantum mechanics

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.835
when we talked about the
time independent perturbation

00:57:22.835 --> 00:57:23.720
theory.

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.780
We never worried
about the switch

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.020
on because we just did time
independent perturbation theory

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.650
and we sort of assumed that the
perturbation term had already

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:35.370
existed from the
beginning of the universe.

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:38.910
So it's not that we
excluded the term.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:41.450
We formulated the
theory in such a way

00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:44.210
that the term just
didn't appear.

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:47.270
But if you switch on a DC
field, you should actually

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:48.770
if you want an
accurate description,

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:51.390
do time dependent
perturbation theory,

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:54.280
you get the transient
term even for DC field.

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.055
And then you discuss
it away the way I did.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.640
OK, so if you want, these
are the textbook results.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.520
We could stop here.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:13.513
But I want to add three
points to the discussion.

00:58:20.272 --> 00:58:21.980
You can also see at
this point, we really

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.520
understand that AC
Stark shift theory

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:28.062
as you find it in generic
quantum mechanics textbooks.

00:58:28.062 --> 00:58:30.020
And now I want to give
you a little bit of sort

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:37.840
of extra insight based on my
knowledge of atomic physics.

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.600
So there are three points I
would like to discuss here.

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:51.890
The first one is the relation
to the dressed-atom picture.

00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:03.210
The second one is I want
to parametrize the results

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:06.520
for the polarizability using
the concept of oscillator

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.020
strengths.

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.860
And thirdly, I want
to tell you how

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:18.020
you can, already at this point,
take our result for the AC

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:23.110
polarizability and calculate
how do atoms absorb light

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:28.140
and what is the dispersive
phase shift which atoms generate

00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:30.040
when they're exposed to light.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.920
Or in other words,
I want to show you

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.390
that based on this
simple result,

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:37.400
we have pretty much already
all the information we need

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.700
to understand how absorption
imaging and dispersive

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.130
imaging is done
in the laboratory.

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:49.960
So these are the
three directions

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:54.320
I would like to take it.

00:59:54.320 --> 01:00:05.966
So let's start with number one.

01:00:05.966 --> 01:00:07.340
The relation to
the dressed-atom.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:19.030
So what I want to show you now
is that a result we obtained

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.450
in time dependent
perturbation theory,

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:24.390
we could've actually obtained
in time independent perturbation

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:28.380
theory by not using a
coherent electric field which

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.300
oscillates.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.600
But just assuming that
they're stationary Fock states

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.590
of photons.

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:35.800
And this is actually the
dressed-atom picture.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.770
I know I'm throwing now a
lot of sort of lingo at you.

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:40.325
It's actually
very, very trivial.

01:00:40.325 --> 01:00:42.950
But I want to show you that you
have a result where if you just

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:45.730
open your eyes, you see actually
the dressed-atom shining

01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:47.300
through.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.390
So what we had is we had
an energy shift here.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.800
Which was let me just
summarize what we have derived.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.170
Was this result with
a polarizability

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:02.350
which we derived.

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:06.206
And let me rewrite the
results from above.

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:23.430
So this is why I made the
remark about the averaging

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.810
of the electric field.

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:30.020
If you combine it
with, as you will see,

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.690
Rabi frequencies and
dressed-atom picture,

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:36.040
you'll need the amplitude
of the electric field.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.170
And formulated in the amplitude
of the electric field,

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:40.750
you have a one quarter.

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:42.350
And this is not a mistake.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.590
And you can really trace
it down to the time

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:47.440
average of the cosine term.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:58.930
OK, so this is now-- I'm really
copying from the previous page.

01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:04.890
We had the difference frequency
between state 1 and state 2.

01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:07.610
So I'm simply assuming
that we couple two states.

01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:12.410
Now an s and p
state, If you want.

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.680
We have a matrix
element which is

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.200
the matrix element of
the position operator,

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.350
z, between state 1
and state 2 squared.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:30.010
We have an energy denominator
which was this one.

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:35.000
And we have-- so I'm just
rewriting the previous result.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.290
But now I usually
hate matrix elements

01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:41.110
when they appear in an equation.

01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:44.570
I mean, who knows
matrix elements.

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:46.745
What is the relevant
thing when we

01:02:46.745 --> 01:02:49.990
couple two different states
is the Rabi frequency.

01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:52.540
Frequency units is what we want.

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:56.320
So, therefore, I have
prepared the formula

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:02.890
that I can take
the matrix element

01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:05.620
with the electric field.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:09.830
And this is nothing else than
the Rabi frequency squared.

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:12.430
Or actually, one is
measured as energy units.

01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:14.020
The other is frequency units.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.690
So there is an h bar square.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:24.650
So, therefore, I have
now written this result

01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:28.120
in what I think is a more
physically insightful way

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.960
by explicitly identifying
the Rabi frequency which

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.950
couples ground and
excited states.

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:39.460
And I also want
to separate, want

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.080
to introduce the
detuning of the time

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.016
dependent oscillating
electric field from resonance.

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:01.560
And then I obtain this result.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.630
Doesn't it look so much simpler
than what we had before?

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:10.310
And it has a lot of
physics we can discuss now.

01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:18.100
One over delta is sort
of like an AC Stark

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:21.540
effect in one limit.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:25.460
It's a far-off resonant case of
an optical trapping potential.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.220
So this formula has
a lot of insight

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.600
which I want to provide now.

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:35.960
The second part I give you the
name and the interpretation

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.930
will become obvious in a moment.

01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:41.500
Is the important
Bloch-Siegert shift.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.600
It is the AC Stark shift due
to the counterrotating term.

01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:56.530
So what I'm motivating here
is just don't get confused.

01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:58.340
What I write down
is very simple.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:02.097
And I sometimes use advanced
language for those of you

01:05:02.097 --> 01:05:03.430
who have heard those buzz words.

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:06.180
But what I really mean
is what I want to discuss

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.086
and you to follow are the
simple steps we do here.

01:05:10.086 --> 01:05:11.460
So anyway, what
I've just done is

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.550
I've rewritten the result
from the previous page

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:17.110
by just introducing
what I suggest

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:20.690
as more physically
appealing symbols.

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:28.080
And now I want to remind you
that this result for the AC

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:36.870
Stark effect doesn't it look
very similar not to a result,

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:40.537
to the standard result of
time independent perturbation

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:41.037
theory?

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:55.890
And, of course, you
remember that in time

01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:58.320
independent
perturbation theory, you

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:03.360
get an energy shift which is
the square of a matrix element

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.250
divided by detuning.

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:12.730
So it seems when we inspect
our result for the AC Stark

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:16.390
effect which came from time
dependent perturbation theory,

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:21.320
that this result here has
actually-- if we map it

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.200
on time independent perturbation
theory, it has two terms.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.710
Both coupled by
the Rabi frequency.

01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:32.610
But one has a detuning of delta.

01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:43.970
And the other has a detuning
of minus 2 omega, minus delta.

01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:48.160
So it seems that the result
for the AC Stark shift

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:54.370
can be completely understood
by a mixture of not one,

01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:59.340
but two different states
with different detunings.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:04.150
And this is exactly
what we will do

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.810
in 8.422 in the
dressed-atom picture

01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:16.600
when we have quantized
the electromagnetic field.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.970
In other words, we have photons.

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:25.810
Because then what we
have is the following.

01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:32.720
We have the ground state
with n photons, n gamma.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.300
Well, there are sort of
n quanta in the system.

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.720
n photons.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.580
But what we can do is we can now
have one quantum of excitation

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.730
with the atom.

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:45.580
And n minus 1 photon.

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.980
So it's almost like
absorbing a photon.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:56.120
And this state has
a detuning of delta.

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:09.040
But then we can also
consider an excited state.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.900
In other words, here, we
connect to the excited state

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.260
by absorbing a photon.

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:17.729
But we can also, we talk
about it more later,

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:20.540
we can also connect
to the excited state

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.709
by emitting a photon.

01:08:24.779 --> 01:08:29.310
So this state has now not
one quantum of excitation,

01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:30.794
there's three quanta
of excitation.

01:08:30.794 --> 01:08:33.689
One in the atom and
two in the photon.

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:38.600
So, therefore, its detuning
is now much, much larger.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.930
Actually, if we're on
resonant, the detuning

01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:43.080
would be just 2 omega.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:47.710
But if you are detuned,
there is the delta.

01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:52.420
So in other words,
we can just say

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.434
if it would do
time independent--

01:08:55.434 --> 01:08:56.350
I'm not doing it here.

01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:57.850
And I leave kind
of all the beauty

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:00.840
to when we discuss the
dressed-atom picture

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.560
in its full-fledged version.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.430
But all I'm telling you is that
the result for the AC Stark

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:09.899
shift looks like type
independent perturbation theory

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:12.140
with those two detunings.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.609
And I'm now offering you the
physical picture behind it

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:18.830
by saying, look, when we
have the ground state with n

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:21.460
photons, and we have
those two other states,

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:25.439
they have exactly the detuning
which our results suggests.

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:29.290
And yes, indeed, if you look at
the many folds for those three

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:33.620
states and we would simply do
time independent perturbation

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:37.210
theory, we would find exactly
the same frequency shifts,

01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:39.609
the AC Stark shift
as we just obtained

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:42.720
in a time dependent picture.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.140
So in other words, what
I'm telling you is there

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:48.069
are two ways to obtain
the AC Stark shift.

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:51.510
One is you do time dependent
perturbation theory assuming

01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:53.420
oscillating electric field.

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.010
And that would mean in
the quantized language

01:09:56.010 --> 01:10:00.110
you assume the electromagnetic
field is in a coherent state.

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:03.280
Alternatively, you can
quantize the electric field

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.940
and introduce Fock states.

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:10.470
And then because Fock
states are type independent,

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:14.170
then these are the eigenstates
of the electromagnetic field

01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:15.360
in a cavity.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.324
And now you obtain the
same atomic level shift

01:10:18.324 --> 01:10:19.990
in time independent
perturbation theory.

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:37.785
So in other words, we can
have photon number states.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:51.090
And do time independent
perturbation theory.

01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:57.160
Or alternatively, we can use a
semi-classical electric field.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.460
Which means we have a
classical electric field.

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:09.399
And then we can treat
it in time dependent.

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:22.330
All the textbooks generally
use the latter approach.

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:25.390
Because it uses a same
classical electric field.

01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:29.960
But I can tell you, I strongly
prefer the first approach.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.625
Because in the
first approach, you

01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:33.520
have no problems whatsoever.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.980
What is the time
dependent wave function?

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.530
What is an energy level shift
when you have a driven system?

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:44.960
In a time independent
way, everything just

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.650
is simple and right
there in a simple way.

01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:51.600
But it's two different
physical regimes.

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:54.600
Questions?

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.932
OK, second point of
discussion is the concept

01:12:03.932 --> 01:12:05.098
of the oscillator strengths.

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:16.820
So what I'm teaching in
the next five minutes

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.750
is so old-fashioned
that I sometimes

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:22.102
wonder should I still
teach it or not.

01:12:22.102 --> 01:12:25.320
On the other hand, you find
it in all the textbooks.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.820
You also want to understand
a little bit the tradition.

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:30.540
And at least I'm giving
you some motivation

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:35.010
to learn about it that if
I parametrize the matrix

01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:37.840
element with an
oscillators strength.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.760
And most of your atoms,
most of the alkali atoms

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.530
have an oscillator
strength for the s

01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:44.170
to p transition for the D-lines.

01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:46.100
Which is unity.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.810
You can actually write down
what is the matrix element.

01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:53.410
What is the spontaneous lifetime
of your atom without knowing

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:55.510
anything about atomic structure.

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:58.960
Just memorizing that f equals
1, the oscillator strength

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.150
is 1 is pretty much all you
have to know about your atom.

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:04.740
And the rest, the only
other thing you have to know

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.580
is what is the resonant
frequency of your laser?

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.030
780 nanometer?

01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:10.506
589 nanometer?

01:13:10.506 --> 01:13:12.180
671 nanometer?

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.420
So the modern motivation for
this old-fashioned concept

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.390
is for simple atoms where
the oscillator strength

01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:21.980
is close to 1, this is
probably the parametrization

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.810
you want to use
because you can forget

01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:28.080
about the atomic structure.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.580
So but the derivation
would go as follows.

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.220
I want to compare our result.

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:41.880
How an atom responds
to an electric field.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.620
I want to compare this
result to the result

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:48.290
of a classical oscillator.

01:13:48.290 --> 01:14:03.490
So compare our result
for the AC polarizability

01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:08.690
to a classical
harmonic oscillator.

01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:11.360
So I assume this classical
harmonic oscillator

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:19.540
has a charge, a mass
term, and a frequency.

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:24.400
And both the atom and the
classical harmonic oscillator

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.230
are driven by the time
dependent electric field.

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:34.860
Which we have already
parametrized by cosine omega t.

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:35.360
OK.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:41.320
If you look at the classical
harmonic oscillator,

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:53.800
you find that the--
you drive it at omega

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.220
and ask what is it time
dependent dipole moment?

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.930
It's driven by the cosine term.

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:06.170
And what I mean, of
course, is dipole moment

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:07.610
of a classical
harmonic oscillator

01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:12.154
is nothing else than
charge times displacement.

01:15:12.154 --> 01:15:14.880
And, well, if you
spend one minute

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.780
and solve the equation for the
driven harmonic oscillator,

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:23.480
you find that the response,
the amplitude, the steady state

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.050
amplitude, [? zk ?] of
the harmonic oscillator

01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:28.660
is cosine omega t.

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:32.582
Times a prefactor which
I'm writing down now.

01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:41.305
There is this resonant behavior.

01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:47.195
So that's the response of the
classical harmonic oscillator.

01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:56.190
And yeah.

01:15:56.190 --> 01:15:58.730
So this is just classical
harmonic oscillator physics.

01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:04.270
And I now want to
define a quantity which

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:09.234
I call the oscillator
strength of the atom.

01:16:09.234 --> 01:16:11.900
So I'm just jumping now from the
harmonic oscillator to the atom

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.320
and then I combine a the two.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.750
And the oscillator
strength is nothing else

01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:21.220
than a parametrization
of the matrix element

01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.395
with between different states.

01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:28.210
But it's dimensionless.

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:31.390
And it's made dimensionless
by using the mass.

01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:33.960
By using h-bar.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.798
And by using the
transition frequency.

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:54.430
So the atomic-- let me just
make sure we take care of it.

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:58.020
This is the result for the
classical harmonic oscillator.

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.720
And this is now the
result for the atom

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:07.480
that we have found already they
the result for the atom before.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:20.920
And now I'm rewriting
it simply by expressing

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.470
the matrix element square
by the oscillator strength.

01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:45.230
And this here is just
another expression

01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:49.100
for the polarizability alpha.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.190
Well, let's now
compare the result

01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:55.370
of a quantum mechanical
atom exactly described

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.480
by time dependent
perturbation theory

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.530
to the result of a classical
harmonic oscillator.

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.540
The frequency
structure is the same.

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:11.210
So if I would know say
we have an ensemble

01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:19.320
of harmonic oscillators,
and the harmonic oscillators

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:24.200
may have different frequencies
and different charges.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:38.010
Then I have made those
formulas exactly equal.

01:18:38.010 --> 01:18:42.590
And I can now formulate
that the atom reacts

01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:45.770
to an electric field to time
dependent electric field.

01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:49.890
Exactly as an ensemble
of classical oscillators

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:52.470
with effective charge.

01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:55.600
If I would say I have an
ensemble of oscillators

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:06.350
with effective charge,
then the response

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:08.530
of the atom and the
response of the ensemble

01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:11.018
of classical oscillators
is absolutely identical.

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:41.880
So the atom response is a
set classical oscillators

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:48.670
with an effective charge
which is given here.

01:19:48.670 --> 01:19:51.510
So, therefore, you
don't have to go further

01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:54.500
if you want to have any
intuition how an atom reacts

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.310
to light.

01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:57.190
The classical
harmonic oscillator

01:19:57.190 --> 01:19:59.280
is not an approximation.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.650
It is exact.

01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:12.640
So that result is
relevant because it

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:18.520
allows us to clearly formulate
the classical correspondence.

01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:26.770
The second thing is
as you can easily

01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:30.190
show with basic
commutator algebra,

01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:33.140
there is the Thomas
Kuhn sum rule

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.130
which is discussed in all
texts in quantum physics

01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:43.020
which says that the sum over
all oscillator strengths is 1.

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:46.340
So, therefore, we know
if we have transitions

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:49.220
from the ground state
to different states,

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:52.000
the sum of all the oscillator
strengths to all the states

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.508
can only be 1.

01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:02.830
And another advantage of the
formulation with oscillator

01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:06.330
strength is that it is
a dimensionless unit.

01:21:10.190 --> 01:21:14.470
It's a dimensionless
parameter which tells us

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:21.330
how the atom corresponds to an
external electromagnetic field.

01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:23.270
I just need two or
three more minutes

01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:26.760
to show you what that means.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:32.010
If you have hydrogen,
the 1s to 2p transition

01:21:32.010 --> 01:21:34.010
is the strongest transition.

01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:36.290
And it has a matrix
element which

01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:42.610
corresponds to an oscillator
strength of about 0.4.

01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:48.170
So the rest comes from
more highly excited states.

01:21:48.170 --> 01:22:00.220
However, for alkali atoms, the
D-line, the s to p transition

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:03.180
has an oscillator strength.

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:05.360
I didn't write down
the second digit,

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.780
but it's with excellent
approximation, 1.98

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.330
or something.

01:22:10.330 --> 01:22:13.970
So not just qualitatively,
almost quantitatively,

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:19.490
you capture the response from
the atom by saying f equals 1.

01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:23.410
So if you use for the
alkali atoms f equals 1,

01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:33.090
then simply the transition
frequency of the D-line

01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:37.170
gives you the
polarizability alpha.

01:22:37.170 --> 01:22:40.850
And as we will see later,
because we haven't introduced

01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:49.230
it is, but it will also give you
gamma the natural line beats.

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:51.830
Because all the coupling to
the electromagnetic field

01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:55.580
to an external field is
really captured by saying what

01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:56.970
the matrix element is.

01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:59.720
And f equals 1 is
nothing else than saying

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:02.880
the matrix element
is such and such.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:07.360
And, indeed, if I now use the
definition of the oscillator

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.820
strength in reverse,
the matrix element

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.690
between two transitions,
between two states

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:19.060
is the matrix element squared
is the oscillator length

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.860
times one half.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:23.370
And if you just go back
and look at the formula,

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:29.670
you find that this
is now dimensionless.

01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:32.930
So we need now because the left
hand side is the length square,

01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:34.440
we need two lengths.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:42.550
One is the Compton wave length
which is h-bar over 2 times

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.690
the mass of the electron.

01:23:44.690 --> 01:23:49.960
And lambda bar is the
transition wave lengths,

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.870
lambda divided by 2 pi.

01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:58.020
So, therefore, I haven't found
it anywhere in textbooks,

01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:02.280
but this is my sort
of summary of this.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.550
If you have a strong
transition, and strong

01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:12.760
means that the oscillator
length is close to 1,

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.430
then the matrix element
for the transition

01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:25.160
is approximately
the geometric mean

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.080
of the Compton wave
length of the electron.

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:36.680
And the reduced wave lengths
of the resonant transition.

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.160
So now if you want
to know what is

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.190
the matrix element for
the d-line of rubidium,

01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:45.560
take the wave length
of 780 nanometer.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.650
Take the Compton wave
lengths of the electron

01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:50.800
and you get an
accurate expression.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.997
I know time is over.

01:24:51.997 --> 01:24:52.580
Any questions?

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.330
All right.

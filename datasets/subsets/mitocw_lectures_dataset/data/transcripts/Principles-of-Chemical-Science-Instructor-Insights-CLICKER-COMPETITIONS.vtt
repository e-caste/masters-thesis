CATHERINE DRENNAN: We started
using these clicker devices

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.260
in 511.1, and clickers are there
small credit card sized devices

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.900
where I can put a
question up on my computer

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.700
that the students will see,
and it will have three, four,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.080
or five choices.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.990
And the students can
look at the question

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.450
and click in what they
think the answer is.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
And this was a big
trend, I think,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.930
in education for big
classrooms because it allows

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.649
the students to engage more.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.190
The teacher, who's standing in
the front of the room with 300

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.564
people, they're not necessarily
going to raise their hand

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:50.830
and go, I'm confused,
because it's a big class.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.300
But if I ask them a question
to see if they're confused,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.008
they'll click in.

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.640
I'll go, oh yeah, that did
not go the way I wanted.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.020
Clearly people are confused.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.450
Let's talk about this some more.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.130
Or 95% get it right,
and it's like, OK,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.239
I can move on and go
on to the next thing.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.170
So it's a great, I
think, teaching tool.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.520
Everyone should be clicking
in to the clicker question.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.440
So does someone want to explain
why this is the correct answer?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.500
But when we first
brought them in,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.430
the students were not
so excited by them.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.430
And there were other classes
at MIT that were using them,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.980
but it was like,
OK, we'll do this.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.850
But I didn't get that there was
a lot of enthusiasm for them.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.510
So I tried to think about ways
that we could make it more fun.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.210
And so one thing that
I thought is that we

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.490
could have some competition.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.170
And in 511.1, there are
multiple recitations

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.570
that are run by a
graduate student TA,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.720
so everyone in the class
would have their recitation

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.340
group of 20 people.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.800
And so I thought, well,
on Friday in class,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.780
we'll have a little
competition and we'll

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.830
see which recitation gets the
most clicker questions right.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.230
And they will get
a reward, which

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.470
is maybe some donuts at
recitation next week.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.220
Something small.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.930
Some kind of food.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.930
And largely, it was
bragging rights.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.080
Our recitation got the
most questions right.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.570
So we started doing
this, and then I

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.020
surveyed the students
both before we

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.390
had done the competitions
and after to kind of look

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.880
at whether the students
liked the competitions

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.740
and felt like they
were learning.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.620
And I found a really
big difference.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.020
So students had
always said, yes, I

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.340
try to answer the
questions correctly.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.780
But then when we asked them
questions about how hard they

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.750
wanted to work to understand
chemistry and their real desire

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.630
to learn and the
impact of the course,

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.120
that with the competitions,
all of these things

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.620
were much higher.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.680
And so it just seemed like
they were more engaged.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.960
There was more of a
buy in, and I would

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.310
talk to some of these students.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.740
And they were like, oh yeah,
I'm in Jay's recitation.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.680
And they felt a
part of something.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.820
They had ownership.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.932
And a lot of the groups
in the recitation,

00:03:05.932 --> 00:03:07.390
they would start
studying together.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.460
Even though they didn't
know each other before

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.830
and this is often
freshman year, so these

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.870
might be some of
the first people

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.420
they're meeting
in their classes.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.730
They got very serious
about the competition

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.220
some years, so they would
meet the night before class

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.630
to review some things so they
were ready for the competition.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.220
And I've seen
students who've been

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.370
doing this for a number of
years in their junior year,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.250
and they're like, oh yeah, I
get together with my friends

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.190
from the clicker competition
every month or so.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.410
We go have dinner
or do something fun.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.270
So they're making
friends for life.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.790
And so I think that this is
just in a big 300 person class,

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.240
feeling like you belong,
you're an active participant

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.220
rather than a passive one.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.990
These clicker competitions
built this sense of team.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.040
This is a bungee jumper at the bottom of his
trajectory. This is a pack of dogs pulling

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.730
a sled. And this is a golf ball about to be
struck. All of these scenarios can be represented

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.740
by free body diagrams. Physical problems -- for
example, calculating the force on the bungee

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.490
jumper by the bungee cord -- are much easier
to solve once you've drawn a complete and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.430
correct free body diagram.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.820
This video is part of the Representations
video series.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.899
Information can be represented in words, through
mathematical symbols, graphically, or in 3-D

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.699
models. Representations are used to develop
a deeper and more flexible understanding of

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.760
objects, systems, and processes.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.089
Hello. My name is John Belcher. I am a professor
in the physics department at MIT, and today

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:56.420
I'll be talking with you about free body diagrams.
Physics uses many different representations

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.649
to aid with problem solving. Free body diagrams
allow us to represent the forces on an object,

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.820
thus enhancing our understanding of situations
and helping us to solve problems. Studies

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.340
have shown that students who understand and
use free body diagrams tend to score better

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.549
on homework, quizzes, and exams. Such representations
can be powerful tools for solving problems,

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.158
and remain useful even for physics experts.

00:01:20.158 --> 00:01:25.420
Our objectives are to improve your skill with
free body diagrams and to show some of the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.939
connections between them and the physical
situations they represent. I hope you find

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.039
it useful.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.979
We're going to assume that you have drawn
a few free body diagrams in the past, so this

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:31.859
video will start with only a short refresher
of how to draw them before getting into some

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.109
more difficult and detailed problems. Here
are some guidelines to remember when drawing

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:41.520
your free-body diagram. Rather than trying
to sketch an object in detail, we're always

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.189
going to draw it as a single point. We focus
on a single moment in time. Our diagram will

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.320
only include forces, and not any other vectors
or any other quantities. The arrows we draw

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.320
for the forces will be longer for stronger
forces, and we'll always draw them as coming

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.530
from the object. Finally, we'll want to draw
only forces with a substantial impact on the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.319
object's behavior, and leave out any that
are negligible.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.509
The forces we'll consider today are primarily
those we see in the world around us: gravity,

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:07.670
the normal force, tension, hands pushing or
pulling, friction, and so forth. We won't

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.850
be talking about things like the magnetic
force, buoyancy, and so forth, but when you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.030
encounter those in your courses, they can
be treated in exactly the same manner as the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.080
forces you'll see today.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.288
To keep the length of this video down, we've
had to leave some things out. The first is

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:08.449
anything to do with circular motion, including
torque or centripetal force. Dealing with

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.619
torque requires a more complex approach that
you'll learn later on in your course. The

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.818
second is a complete lesson on how to deal
with angles in forces and free body diagrams.

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:09.020
That is something that you will need to practice
on your own in order to really understand

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.038
well.

00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:13.160
Let's do a quick refresher on how to draw
free-body diagrams. We'll walk through them

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.500
one step at a time. If you have some paper
available you should draw the diagrams yourself

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.940
as we go through the steps.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.110
This is very basic example: a falling block.
If we ignore air resistance, this is an object

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.350
with just one force applied: the force of
gravity. We're going to...

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.000
draw the object as a point,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.829
draw the force of gravity as an arrow,

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.490
and label our force. We're done.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.750
Let's build up to a more complex example.
Here's the block on a table, stationary.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.590
We need to draw the object as a point,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.960
and draw the force of gravity pulling down
on it.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.620
Our block is stationary, which means that
it is not accelerating. No acceleration means

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.220
a total force of zero, so we must have at
least one more force in place to cancel out

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.910
the force of gravity. In this case, that cancellation
is provided by the normal force from the table.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.900
Let's draw in the normal force.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.750
If we wanted to have a hand pushing the object...

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.870
...we can adjust our existing diagram to include
that. All we need to do is

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.390
add an arrow to indicate the force provided
by the hand.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.880
We can also tilt the table upwards and push
the box up the slope. As you can see, this

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.579
tilt changes the direction of our normal force,
but not the force of gravity.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.430
We could also include friction from the surface
if we wanted to be more realistic. Now we

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.460
have a fairly complex diagram that visually
represents many different forces on our object.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.070
Now we're going to show a couple of real-world
examples, and show how we would diagram them.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.290
Here's a bungee jumper. This is a very dynamic
situation. It's important for us to choose

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.290
a particular time during the jump at which
to draw our diagram, because the forces will

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.530
be very different at different times. We can
choose any time we like, but we do have to

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.670
pick just one time. Let's say that we're interested
in the time when the jumper is at the bottom

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.350
of his trajectory.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.509
Again, we start with a dot. We don't draw
a stick figure, just a single point. And we

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.810
don't include the rope, even though it is
important. We just draw the object in question

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.160
-- the jumper.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.350
Gravity is clearly an important force, as
is the tension from the bungee cord. To determine

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.250
the strength of the tension, we must decide
what the acceleration of the jumper is. Pause

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.250
the video to consider this.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.780
At the bottom of the arc the jumper must be
accelerating upwards, so as to bounce up.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.650
Therefore, we make sure to draw tension as
being stronger than the force of gravity.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.240
Looking at the diagram at different points
during the fall would give us different amounts

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.620
of force. Even though we might like to represent
that, it doesn't belong on our diagram. Free

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.160
body diagrams are drawn at a single point
in time.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.370
This example involves a dog sled.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.470
Let's draw a diagram of the sled as the dogs
pull it across the snow at constant velocity.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.550
Here's the sled, "with gravity pulling down,
and the normal force pushing upwards.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.200
Here is the force from the dogs, pulling the
cart forward.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.770
The sled is moving at constant velocity; therefore
the sled has no acceleration.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.560
Therefore, the total force on the sled must
be zero. Right now our forces are unbalanced,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.060
so there must be another force we haven't
drawn yet in order to balance out the pull.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.960
That's the force of friction between the sled
and the snow.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.380
Once we draw that in, we're done.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.990
Since we know that the sled is moving at constant
velocity, the sum of our forces should be

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.470
zero.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.900
Here's another example: a golf swing. Let's
say that we want to draw a free body diagram

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.490
of the ball just after it loses contact with
the ground.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.889
You can see that the photo is not at a great
angle for us to see what's going on, so let's

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.400
draw a sketch to help us picture it.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.260
We'll start the diagram with a point representing
the ball...

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.840
...and drawing the force of gravity.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.240
The contact force between the ball and the
club will be perpendicular to the club, so

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.470
we need to be careful to make sure our angles
match. We also need to draw a fairly long

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.050
arrow to represent a strong force, because
the hit from the club is lifting the ball

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.840
off the ground. We need to make sure that
the vertical part of the club's force is stronger

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.970
than the force of gravity.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.260
Since the ball is no longer in contact with
the ground, there will be no normal force

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.510
from the grass. We're all done.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.500
Now we're going to look at some typical mistakes
that people make when drawing free-body diagrams.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.590
This is to help you catch errors in your own
work, as well as to assist others during group

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:19.210
work. Many errors come from breaking the guidelines
we set forth earlier, so watch for places

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.860
where those are broken as we go through this
sequence.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.270
The diagrams we'll show here each have issues
with them. To remind you of this, we'll put

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.180
a red exclamation point in the bottom right
corner of the screen.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.800
If you're watching this on your own, pause
the video when a new example appears, to try

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.540
to find out what's wrong.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.330
When we correct the diagram, we'll change
the exclamation point to a green check-mark.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.669
Here's a diagram with a problem. In this situation
we're trying to show the forces on the ball

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:54.960
after it is thrown. Try to spot the error.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.380
The diagram shows gravity pulling down, and
air resistance at work, but a 'throwing force'

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.070
is also included.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.830
Because the diagram is intended to be drawn
after the ball leaves the pitcher's hand,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.949
that force has already done its job. There's
no need to include it here. Newton's First

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:17.800
Law tells us that the ball will keep moving;
it doesn't need an extra force pushing it

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.120
along all the time.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.270
Now the diagram is correct.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.320
Here's our example of a block on a tilted
table from before. We've drawn in a coordinate

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.828
system to show the x and y directions. We
can see that there are several forces at work:

00:08:34.828 --> 00:08:40.729
the pushing hand, the normal force, friction,
and gravity.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:47.180
However, there seem to be three gravitational
forces at work: one pulling straight down,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:53.240
one pulling against the normal force, and
one pulling down the slope. It seems as if

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.980
the gravitational force has been decomposed
into x and y components, and then also left

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:05.149
on the diagram. Once a force has been decomposed,
the original should be removed.

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:07.999
That's better.

00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:13.790
Here's a diagram of a car driving on the highway.
Can you tell what's wrong here?

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:20.319
We have gravity, friction, and a force moving
the car forward, but this arrows seems to

00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:27.279
represent a velocity. It might be useful information,
but it's not something that gets included

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:33.600
on a free body diagram. Free body diagrams
only include forces.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.879
Let's remove it.

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:40.510
That's better. But we're not done yet. According
to the diagram, this car is accelerating downward

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:46.180
-- it's falling through the road." "We need
a force to balance out gravity. The car is

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.089
in contact with the road, so there must be
a normal force.

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:54.399
There we go. Much better.

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:57.550
Here's our final bad example.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:03.360
It looks like whoever drew this was trying
to list every force they could think of. Earth's

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.160
gravity is something we almost always include,
and one can understand including air resistance

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.550
for a parachute, but this diagram also has
gravity from the moon, gravity from the sun,

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:21.550
a buoyant force, force from the wind, aerodynamic
lift, and whatever this F-Z is! We're practically

00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:28.720
out of space. One key to drawing a free body
diagram is narrowing down your forces to just

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.720
those that apply to the problem at hand. Are
all these forces present? Probably, yes. Are

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:39.679
all of them important in your current situation?

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:41.939
Probably not.

00:10:41.939 --> 00:10:47.059
Simplification is an important part of physics.
The more complex we make things, the harder

00:10:47.059 --> 00:10:52.379
our problems will be to solve. If our problem
tells us to keep air resistance, we'll use

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:55.329
that, and ignore other forces.

00:10:55.329 --> 00:10:59.709
Now we're going to look into what our diagrams
tell us about a physical setup. This will

00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:04.470
help us refine our understanding of these
diagrams. After all, if a free body diagram

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.490
is really a representation of what's going
on, it should have a strong connection to

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.550
a physical situation.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:16.689
Here's a car on the highway. This animation
will help us understand the changes in our

00:11:16.689 --> 00:11:18.100
diagram.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.759
We can tell that this car is not accelerating.
The forces in our y direction balance, and

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:26.809
the forces in our x direction balance.

00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:33.369
That means that if we remove or change any
of these forces, the car should accelerate.

00:11:33.369 --> 00:11:38.240
For instance, if we reduce the force of friction,
the car will speed up.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.220
We could also speed up the car by applying
more force in the forward direction.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.079
Removing the force that's pushing the car
forward results in the opposite effect.

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:49.889
The car will eventually slow to a halt.

00:11:49.889 --> 00:11:54.230
Finally, without the normal force, there's
nothing to stop gravity from accelerating

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.119
the car downward.

00:11:56.119 --> 00:12:00.600
You can see how any change in the physical
forces applied can be represented on the free

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.639
body diagram.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:07.550
As useful as they are, there are some situations
in which a free body diagram is not the right

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.029
tool for the job.

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:14.160
Some situations are so simple that they may
not warrant a diagram. There's no harm in

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.300
drawing it, especially when you're starting
out, but as you become more skilled you may

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.209
be able to do without it.

00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:26.949
Some situations are better solved with a different
approach entirely. This exercise, for example,

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:32.350
calls for the use of a different principle:
conservation of energy. A free body diagram

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.670
is not likely to shed much light on the problem.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:42.429
This problem involves rotation and torque.
Free body diagrams work best with linear motion.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:46.410
Even though force is involved, a free body
diagram may not help.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.939
However, a more sophisticated diagram may
be of assistance. This one shows where the

00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:56.499
forces are applied to the bar, and can be
used in the calculation of torques. You can

00:12:56.499 --> 00:13:02.100
see that it is very different from a free
body diagram. Free body diagrams are only

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:07.149
one type of representation, and it is important
to choose the right representation for your

00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:08.699
purpose.

00:13:08.699 --> 00:13:12.939
Now you've seen how to represent physical
situations with free body diagrams, and gained

00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:18.509
some greater insight into their use. The ability
to use and analyze free body diagrams is a

00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:24.239
skill that remains useful to physicists and
engineers at all levels of experience. Your

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:29.420
expertise with them will improve with practice.
I hope this video has helped to improve your

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:36.420
understanding of free body diagrams and their
uses.

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.783
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So today's topic

00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:24.160
is workforce planning.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.410
And we have Professor
Nigel Wilson,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.970
who is the father of
the Transit Lab here

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.960
at MIT and of this course.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.490
He's sort of the master of
everything related to transit

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.315
and the applications
of transit data,

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:41.560
to operations
planning and study.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.760
You may remember that we
divided the course into themes.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.410
And so we already talked
about crew scheduling

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.495
in the context of
operations planning.

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:56.380
And now we're in the
strategy and policy theme.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.140
So this lecture is on looking,
again, at proofs and planning,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.950
but from a strategic
perspective.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.480
I think that's probably--

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.040
NIGEL HM WILSON: That's great.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.900
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--enough of an introduction.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.670
Maybe you can provide--

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.940
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yeah.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.350
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--a little more.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.850
NIGEL HM WILSON:
Thank you, Gabriel.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.950
It's good to see a fair
number of familiar faces

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.110
and some new ones
I don't know yet.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.050
So I encourage you
all to jump in and ask

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.780
questions if I'm not making
things clear or if you disagree

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.130
or whatever.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.590
But I'm delighted to
be here with you today.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.080
So the work that I'm
going to be discussing

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.800
is work that I
haven't done recently.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.620
It's about workforce planning.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.330
And it was done with the MBTA.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.990
Principally the results
I'll give are for the MBTA

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.660
as it existed 20-odd years ago.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.710
But the issues are exactly
the same then as they are now.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:58.880
In fact, I gave a summary of
this presentation to Brian

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.506
Shortsleeve and some of the
other people at the MBTA

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:05.850
a year and a half ago, or so.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.289
And they were
thinking about maybe

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.289
they really should
[AUDIO OUT] --thing something

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.560
like this again.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.150
So what I want to discuss
the problem in general

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.518
of the approach that
we've taken to this,

00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:20.810
and then look at three
different levels of the problem.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.640
One is the strategic
level, which

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.340
is the long-term
view, which fits

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.040
in with Gabriel's
statement about the theme

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.620
of this part of the
course being on strategy.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.910
Then the tactical level,
which is shorter range.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.040
And then the operational level,
which is really short range.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.062
And these are all tightly
connected and interrelated,

00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:42.770
as I hope I'll be able
to explain to you.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.860
OK, so the challenge
that we have

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.780
in this part of the
operations planning

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.660
process, if you think
of it that way, is we

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.100
want to provide good service.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.010
We've got hopefully a
decent operating plan

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.900
that we've developed
and want to make sure

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.910
that the service that's
delivered is reliable.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.010
That requires decent equipment,
decent infrastructure, and also

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.230
a workforce that's
motivated and there

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.060
when you need them, which
is pretty much every day.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.640
So the operations
plan you've all

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.160
been through this at
this stage in the course.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
So you know what goes
into the operations plans.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.920
So what comes out of
the operations plan

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.510
are a set of schedules,
timetables, runs, or duties

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.610
for operators to perform.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.200
And that require a certain
amount of workforce or--

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.230
excuse me for using the term
"manpower," but it's sort

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.140
of the workforce that we need.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.590
So if you don't have the
right level of workforce

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.560
available on a particular
day or at a particular time

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.820
on that day, then you've
got a problem potentially.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.960
If you can buy work
on an overtime basis,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.870
you can do that and at
least not drop any trips.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.187
That's going to cost
you money though.

00:04:04.187 --> 00:04:06.270
And you may not be able
to get the overtime, which

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.800
will, again, produce unreliable
service through dropped trips.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.690
It may also, if some
workers in the workforce

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.200
feel that they can rely on
overtime, which gives them

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.520
a 50% premium rate, then maybe
you can take more absence time.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.530
So there's a substitution
relationship here

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.690
between absence and overtime.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.390
So if you rely more
heavily on overtime,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.010
perhaps your absence
rate will go up.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.910
That's not an outcome you want.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.480
So you've got to be
very careful about that.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.640
Certainly, if you
can't buy the overtime

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.120
and you don't have enough
people on the property

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.440
that particular day,
that particular time,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.010
then you can drop trips
because you don't have anyone

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.870
to run the bus or
to run the train.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.460
And that's a
problem because that

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.090
produces worse service
reliability, worse customer

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.810
satisfaction.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.170
Politically, it's a very
negative [AUDIO OUT] as well.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.870
And so workforce
planning is actually

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.260
a fairly critical piece of
getting from the operations

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.085
plan to good service on
the street or on the rails.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.390
This is sort of a high
level view of what

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.300
the problem is, as I see it.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.600
So on the left of
this chart, you

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.850
have the operator availability.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.720
So that means the number
of drivers you have

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.880
available on a particular day.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.600
That's affected by the
number of operators

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.750
you had available
the previous day.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.360
If you hired people,
how many people

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.420
are coming on to
increase the supply?

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.200
What sort of attrition--
what sort of outflow

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.870
do you have in your workforce
from your previous time, day,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.620
or time period?

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.420
What's the absence?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.830
Because those guys
aren't going to be there.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.410
Those people aren't going to
be there to deliver service.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.470
And of course,
you have a roster,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.650
so everyone typically works five
days and takes two days off.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.910
And that rotates
among the workforce.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.130
So this is the supply side,
in terms of the operator.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.280
On the demand side, you
have the scheduled service,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.020
which is a result of
your operating plan--

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.530
what you want to provide.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.820
You have unscheduled
service additions.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.820
And you potentially have
unscheduled service deletions.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.570
For instance, if there's
a school vacation,

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.910
you will drop some
school trips--

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.610
trips which are primarily
there on high frequency

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.830
routes to provide
school service.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.910
And these don't fit naturally
into the timetable process

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.410
because there's lot of overhead
in developing and timetable,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.600
as I'm sure Gabriel
has explained to you.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.190
So you'll just take those
trips off the table that day.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.190
And those operators are
then available to provide

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.460
other service that you need and
to fill in for absent operators

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.980
those days.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.810
So you've got the supply.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.100
You've got the demand.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.950
And so you're down here
looking at the availability

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.445
versus the supply of drivers.

00:07:06.445 --> 00:07:08.080
I'll call them "drivers."

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.040
The technical jargon in the
industry is "operators."

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.160
In a perfect world, you'd
have an exact balance

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.410
between availability
and demand, and you

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.020
have no additional cost,
and you've got someone

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.190
to cover every trip.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.090
That will never happen.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.890
Why?

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.820
Because the operator
availability is stochastic.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.050
It's uncertain.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.840
You don't know what the absence
rate is going to be tomorrow.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.520
With the best will in the
world, with the best models

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.187
in the world, you
don't know whether I'm

00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:38.660
going to be feeling well
enough to work tomorrow.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.310
So that's a problem.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.063
And for instance,
in the MBTA, you

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:47.480
don't know if you going to
have a failure on the Red Line.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.820
You're going to have to
bus parts of the Red Line

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.760
tomorrow at 8 o'clock
in the morning, OK.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.470
So all of those uncertainties
affect this balance

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.960
between the
availability and demand.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.430
So you'll never be here.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.100
I mean, statistically,
it's virtually

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.050
certain you'll never be there.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.020
You're either going to be over
here, where the availability is

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.370
less than the demand.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.500
In that case, you have
additional time costs,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.260
because you're going to have
to try and buy operators

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.400
to work that overtime.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.580
And perhaps more seriously, you
have the risk of dropping trips

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.220
if you can't persuade
operators that they should

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.480
work the overtime that day.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.625
Or you're over here,
where the availability

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:33.750
is greater than the demand.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.150
In that case, you have
additional personnel costs

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.900
who aren't going to be used as
productively as you might like.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.970
If they were going to
be used productively,

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.520
you'd have built them
into the operating plan.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.600
So they're probably not going
to be used as productively

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.190
as your average operator.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.880
So this is sort of one way
of looking at the framework.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:02.020
We can think of, again, three
levels of planning here.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.040
At the strategic level,
this is typically

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.250
looking at a one-year or even
longer than one year horizon.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.920
So it's not strategic in
terms of infrastructure.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.120
It's strategic in
terms of operations.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.720
So that's how many
people will we

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.270
need in the driver workforce
over the next 12 months.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:29.050
And how do we get
a hiring plan that

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:33.700
will give us the right number
of people throughout the year?

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.150
How do we allocate
our vacations?

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.460
Do we have a certain
vacation liability?

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.140
If I'm a 20-year employee of
the MBTA in the commons union,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.380
I probably have about five weeks
vacation time over the year.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.730
So I get my five weeks.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.590
But the MBTA
management decisions

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.020
include when to provide
the vacation allocation.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.800
So you may have an overall
life vacation liability

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.560
of 2,000 vacation weeks.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.750
So the question of
the strategic level,

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.820
how do you allocate those 2,000
weeks of vacation liability

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.687
over the course of the year?

00:10:13.687 --> 00:10:15.270
And there are good
ways of doing that.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.950
And there are bad
ways of doing that.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.340
I mean, if you give
vacation liability

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.440
when people don't want
to take vacations,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.740
what's likely to happen?

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.682
Your absence rate's
going to increase.

00:10:26.682 --> 00:10:28.390
So you really want to
give vacations when

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.280
people want to take vacations.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.743
But you don't want to
give them so much vacation

00:10:32.743 --> 00:10:34.660
when they want to take
vacation that it really

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.250
costs you a lot more money.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.650
In that case, maybe
taking a higher absence

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.610
will be a better way
of dealing with that.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.250
So there are really
important questions

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.900
on how to meet the
vacation liability.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.460
And this is the timetable.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.760
We've decided what
we need in terms

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.290
of finding decent service.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.670
And then, at the
strategic level,

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.480
I'd also include
personnel policies.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.850
So as I think you all
know, in many agencies,

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.090
including the MBTA,
you have a mix

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.140
of part-timers and full-timers.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.323
In the MBTA, you have
Management Rights Act, which

00:11:08.323 --> 00:11:09.490
I'm sure you've heard about.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.330
Maybe Fred'll talk
about that next week.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.920
It's a very interesting topic.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.500
And Fred will make a meal
of it, I guarantee that.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.680
So the MBTA management was given
these rights by the legislature

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.350
35 years ago, 36 years ago.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:35.610
And so they cannot negotiate
about not using part-timers.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.770
That's not part of the
contract negotiation.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.810
That's a right they've
been given legally.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.570
It's been challenged
in the courts.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.680
It's been upheld.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.870
And so they will
use part-timers.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.390
They've decided to use
part-timers in a way

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.970
that I think is
very unproductive.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.710
They use part-timers as
apprentice full-timers.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.710
And so someone suffers
through perhaps five years

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.440
as a part-timer at
the MBTA in order

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.740
to reach nirvana of being
a full-timer at the MBTA.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.310
Well, that's one
way of doing it.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.630
But I'm not sure that's
the best way of doing it.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.970
Perhaps what you're
doing is, you're

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.720
making these part-timers
suffer for five years,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.210
if that's how long it takes
to get promoted from part-time

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.085
to full-timer status.

00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:25.090
So they're sort of unhappy
for that five years,

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.590
because that's not
what they want.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.210
And it's pretty miserable
working conditions.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.850
They don't get full benefits.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:39.480
And typically, they work a
6-hour day spread over 13

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.260
hours--

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.480
so covering the AM
peak and the PM peak.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.610
And they're doing nothing
between the AM peak and PM

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.110
peak.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.670
You hope they're not in bars.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.337
But they're certainly
not doing anything

00:12:49.337 --> 00:12:52.230
productive with the property.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.620
So that's the way
the MBTA decides

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.520
to use the management
rights they

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.320
were given by the legislature.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.160
I don't think that
was a good decision.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.810
If you have separate
AM part-timers,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.840
might you be able to
increase your workforce?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.100
I think so.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.640
You have people-- shop clerks
who don't really start work

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.190
until after the
AM peak who might

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:19.290
be very interested in
supplementing their shop clerk

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.220
job by having an
AM-peak driving job.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.280
And similarly, in the
PM peak, you probably

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.920
can increase your
labor pool with people

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.940
who are not interested in a
full-time MBTA driver's job,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.930
but they would be interested
in just a sort of a guaranteed,

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.670
3-hour piece of work every day.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.150
So there are lots of different
ways of implementing this.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.280
And I'm pretty sure the
MBTA didn't do it optimally.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.860
So that's what I mean
by personnel policies.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.760
So all of these are at
the strategic level.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.020
At the tactical level, what
we're making decisions on

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.270
is the time horizon is
typically one timetable.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.653
How many timetables does
the MBTA have per year?

00:14:05.653 --> 00:14:06.278
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:07.960
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yeah, four.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.940
So you're making
these decisions,

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.430
running up to each timetable--

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.800
the start of each
timetable period.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.730
And the main decisions
are the staff.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.240
And you've sort of got
your workforce fixed.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.980
And you're deciding
how to allocate them

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:30.110
across depots or garages or rail
lines and by days of the week.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.920
Those are the tactical-level
decisions you're making.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.690
Those, it turns out, are
actually quite important.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.235
If you make poor
decisions, then you're

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:40.360
going to be providing less
reliable service or more

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.020
expensive service than
you otherwise would.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.140
And then at the final level,
your operational level,

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:52.450
is here we are 4
o'clock on a Thursday.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.220
At 12 o'clock today--

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.280
so four hours ago--
the MBTA was deciding

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.450
when to ask each extra
board operator to show up

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.020
for work tomorrow if they didn't
have a guaranteed assignment.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.310
OK?

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.430
So there are unexpected absences
that will occur tomorrow.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.340
You don't know when
they're going to occur.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.715
You don't know
whether it's going

00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:16.840
to be an AM report or a PM
report or whatever it is.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.510
And you have to make
the decision about when,

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.700
if you have five extra
board operators that

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.740
don't have an assignment,
because a known,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.640
in advance absence, when
you want them to show up?

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.000
And that the daily report times
for unassigned, extra staff

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.060
is the operational-level
decision.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.160
Any questions about
this, in terms

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.240
of strategic,
operational, tactical?

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.740
And I'm not talking here about
policies that may change--

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.630
absenteeism, for instance.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.910
Fred will talk about
some of those next week

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.620
when he talks about
labor relations.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.510
But I'm talking about sort of a
narrower piece of this puzzle.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.900
Any questions on this?

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.640
Yes, Kenji?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.083
AUDIENCE: [? Someone ?] become
the part-time operator--

00:16:05.083 --> 00:16:06.000
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yeah.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.428
AUDIENCE: So are they
required any license or--

00:16:09.428 --> 00:16:10.470
NIGEL HM WILSON: Oh, yes.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.920
A commercial driver's
license is required for them.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.360
But again, what I
was saying is, you

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:25.410
have choice about both who to
recruit into those positions--

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.970
do we want an AM part-timer
or a split-shift, full-day

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.830
part-timer who's
going to be unhappy

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.610
until they get their
full-time position at the MBTA

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.940
that they really want.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.920
So yeah, sorry.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.110
The other point I wanted
to make is that how

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.040
you select those people who
will get promoted to full-timer.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.610
So you've decided,
through attrition

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.400
in the full-time ranks, you want
to promote some part-timers.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.570
How do you make that promotion?

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.710
Do you promote based
strictly on seniority?

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.740
In other words, the first
one to become a part-timer

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.160
becomes the first one to be
promoted to a full-timer?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.200
Probably not,
because you'd really

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.130
like people who are motivated,
who have a good absence record,

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.480
a good accident record.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.140
So you'd like to use criteria in
that promotion, which are more

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.609
than just strict seniority.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.400
And the MBTA, again,
has been, I would say,

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.670
not very effective in using
that balance between seniority,

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.760
which is an important issue--

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.080
you want to avoid favoritism and
discrimination in the promotion

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:29.890
process--

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.370
with having some
elements of performance

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.435
in the promotion
process, I would argue.

00:17:37.435 --> 00:17:38.560
Did I answer your question?

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.647
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:39.647 --> 00:17:40.730
NIGEL HM WILSON: Go ahead.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.355
AUDIENCE: I was
interested in the topic

00:17:42.355 --> 00:17:47.340
because, yeah, we have a similar
culture for the station's

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:47.960
time--

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.470
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.345
AUDIENCE: --in Japan.

00:17:49.345 --> 00:17:55.922
But for the driver, they
require a very strict license--

00:17:55.922 --> 00:17:56.880
NIGEL HM WILSON: Right.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.713
AUDIENCE: --which takes
a long time to test.

00:17:58.713 --> 00:18:00.730
So we don't have any
part-time drivers.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:01.800
NIGEL HM WILSON: Right.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.580
Right, yes.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.360
And there are commercial
driver's licenses

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.380
required for the MBTA.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.890
A bus driver or train driver has
to have a commercial driver's

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.910
license.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.170
But it's not as a rigorous and
long period of qualification

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.860
as it is, I'm sure in JR-East.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.430
That would be my guess, anyway.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.080
Any other comments or questions?

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.460
OK.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:30.430
OK, so let's look at this
as three levels of planning.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.880
So strategic level-- we're
deciding the workforce size,

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.280
vacation allocation
over the year,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.940
and hiring patterns over
the course of a year.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.840
So by period of the
year, the input into this

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.570
includes absence hours.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.570
If we know we typically
have more absence hours

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.660
in the winter because the
conditions are miserable--

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.850
you don't drive
in snow and ice--

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.330
and if you have observed
higher absence rates,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.820
that's important in
making the right decisions

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.220
on the strategic level.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.390
Required extra work.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:11.210
If we know that we are going
to be bussing on the Braintree

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.667
branch of the Red Line
because of reconstruction,

00:19:13.667 --> 00:19:16.000
then we'll build that into
our workforce planning thing.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.230
So that's an example
of required extra work.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.360
And attrition--
we do projections

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.510
about the number of
full-timers and part-timers

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:29.150
who will be retiring or leaving
the productive workforce

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.360
over the next year.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.510
On the right-hand side, we
have input such as budget,

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.260
the service plan, the operations
plan, vacation liability--

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.740
how much vacation do we have
to provide in the next year--

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.730
work rules and policies
that we want to meet.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.820
And what I'm showing
here is strategic level,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.200
tactical level, and
operational level.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.980
And what you'll see is
these downward arrows

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.340
from strategy to
tactics to operations,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.340
and the upward
pointing arrows back

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.570
up the chain from operations
to tactical to strategic.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.230
So let's explain
each of these arrows.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:17.850
The downward arrows represent
constraints on your decisions.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.050
So if you've made some
strategic-level decisions

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.390
on workforce size,
that limits what you

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.220
can do at the tactical level.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.860
And that's this
downward arrow here.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.250
Similarly, you make your
tactical-level decisions

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.030
at the beginning of
a timetable, that

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.030
limits what you can do
at the operational level.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.180
These are these
downward-pointing arrows

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.040
between these boxes.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.480
The upward pointing arrows
are the relationships

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.540
between that you need
to know about how

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.890
efficiently the operations
level is conducted

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:56.030
to make good decisions at the
higher levels of the planning

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.800
hierarchy.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:05.390
So for instance, if you know
that overtime is virtually

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.130
impossible to get
from your workforce,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.000
for whatever reason--
they may say,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.170
I'm just not going to cooperate,
I'm not going to work,

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:16.760
or that could be bad or
good reasons for that--

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.710
then you need to
know that in order

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.430
to make the right decisions
at the tactical level.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.500
And similarly, you need
to know that to make

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.365
the right decisions at
the strategic level.

00:21:27.365 --> 00:21:30.990
So these are these
upward-pointing arrows here.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:35.220
And the difference in the
inputs are just more detail.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.500
So absence hours by
garage and by day of week

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.850
is important input into
the tactical level.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.290
Absence hours by
garage and time of day

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:54.420
is important input into
the operational level, OK.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.930
And you have work
rules and policies

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.360
as critical inputs
on all these levels.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:07.650
So this is a slightly different
look at these relationships.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.110
And I want to lead you
through this a little bit.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.810
So this is our
strategic planning box

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.300
where we're deciding
workforce size.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.140
What goes into this?

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.030
The unit costs--
how much does it

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:27.050
cost to provide a
platform hour, which

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.650
is an hour of driving
a bus, by an overtime

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.670
employee, a full-time employee,
and a part-time employee?

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.300
Those are very important,
basic cost units

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.520
that we need to have.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.630
What's the budget, and
what are the work rules?

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.260
The work rules are important
because they tell us

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:51.713
how easy it will be
to do certain things.

00:22:51.713 --> 00:22:53.630
And I'll give you an
example of that later on.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.693
And of course, you have
the scheduled hours,

00:22:55.693 --> 00:22:57.110
which comes out
of your operations

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:01.300
plan-- the timetable
requirements.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.980
So given that you've made a
decision on the workforce size

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.780
at the strategic level,
on a particular day,

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.110
you may have an
amount of open work.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.860
What do I mean by open work?

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.770
It's work that we
want to deliver,

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.860
but there's no one
obvious to provide it.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.910
There's no one.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:29.260
So we'll try and buy time
on an overtime basis.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.000
So we're down here.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.842
And if we're lucky,
the overtime--

00:23:35.842 --> 00:23:37.300
there'll be someone
available who's

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.500
willing to work the
overtime for increased pay.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.920
The negative side of that
is it increases the strain

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.360
on that employee who's working
more hours than he or she was

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.620
expecting to.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.900
That may produce this
negative feedback on absence.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.970
And I described it
previously as the trade-off

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.690
between how much do I have to
work to get to a certain target

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:02.410
income level?

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.740
Well, that's one way
of looking at it.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.365
But the other way of looking at
it, which is equally realistic,

00:24:06.365 --> 00:24:10.060
is if you're working harder,
that puts more stress

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.020
and strain on the body.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.330
You're more likely to be absent.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.120
Because there are two ways of
looking at it, which both raise

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.560
the concern about relying
heavily on overtime and what

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.000
that will do to absence.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.323
Again, over here, if you
can't get the overtime,

00:24:26.323 --> 00:24:27.740
you're going to
be dropping trips.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.960
So reliability suffers.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.447
Negative effect on service
reliability, service quality.

00:24:33.447 --> 00:24:35.030
Presumably, that
will affect ridership

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.650
if it goes on long enough.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.450
And that will affect
your operating plan,

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.460
because your ridership's down.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.350
And so there's that
feedback, as well.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:47.520
So this is sort of another way
of looking at the framework.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:54.920
Now let's look at the strategic
level in terms of the planning

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.200
process.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:05.210
What I've shown here is
a month, as was said--

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.940
four seasons in the MBTA.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.020
Some agencies have more.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.730
Some have less.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:15.060
Winter, spring,
summer, and fall.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:20.280
And let's have a hypothetical
workforce hiring scenario,

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.430
where we hire up at the
beginning of each timetable.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.290
We sort of run
through the timetable.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.300
And then we hire up
for the beginning

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.080
of the next timetable.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.790
That's sort of the hypothetical.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.910
That's not unusual.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.900
But it's not a very
effective way of doing it.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.260
And what I've tried to explain
here is why that is the case.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:48.430
So the bottom bar in this
graph indicates the timetable

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.020
requirements.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.290
So typically, the timetable
requirements for the operating

00:25:53.290 --> 00:26:00.540
plan are pretty similar across
winter, spring, and fall,

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.640
and they're lower in the summer.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.640
Why is that?

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.900
No schools, and
people on vacation,

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.340
so your demand is
generally down,

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:13.800
unless it's a very strong summer
tourist place, like Boston.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.760
So that generally means that you
can reduce your operating plan

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.190
requirements in the summer.

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:21.450
That is a wonderful.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.500
Why?

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:28.130
Because many drivers would like
to take vacation in the summer,

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.980
OK.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.830
I mean, unless you're a serious
outdoor skier, ice skater,

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.720
whatever have you in
the winter, you probably

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.660
don't want to take
vacation in the winter

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.020
because your children
are still in school.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.880
Parents want to go
on family vacations

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.440
when the weather is decent.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:52.410
So this cross-hatched area
here is the vacation allocation

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.600
you've made to
fulfill your vacation

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.830
liability over the year.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.830
And so what you
see here is we're

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.860
providing much more
vacation in the summer

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.950
than we are in the
winter, or even

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.160
in the spring and the autumn.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:08.660
Why?

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.900
That's because our
demand is down,

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.150
but the vacation demand is up.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:19.600
So that's a way of
minimizing absenteeism.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.660
Makes our workforce
happy, it's a good thing.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:29.180
So this gives us this
profile here about the number

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:34.580
of people we need to cover the
work and cover the vacations.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.220
So the only thing we haven't
covered is the absence.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.975
And we have to cover
the absence as well,

00:27:39.975 --> 00:27:41.350
because those
people aren't there

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.930
to work that particular day.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.620
So typically, if you did this--

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.140
you hire up at the beginning
of each timetable model

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.040
that I talked about--

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.850
what you would have is
something like this, in terms

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:03.940
of the extra board coverage--

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.330
sort of a constant
level throughout this,

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.610
except at the end.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.570
And the end of the
timetable is higher

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.700
because people have
made changes and routes.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:19.660
There's retraining.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.340
There's training
of new operators.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.960
So actually, your
required work is

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.870
greatest at the end of the
timetable in the last three

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.820
or four weeks.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.550
So that's what this jump here
is, in terms of required work.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.185
However, look at the supply.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.210
Typically what
happens, is you have

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.710
attrition over the
course of the timetable.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.470
And you have
increasing absenteeism

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.940
over the course
of the timetable.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:48.840
Why?

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.500
Because at the beginning
of the timetable,

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.420
people have just
picked that work.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.450
They sort of want to do it.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.830
The grass is always greener.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.590
They're sort of enthusiastic at
the beginning of the timetable.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.090
They get out there,
and they realize

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.230
it wasn't all it's
cracked up to be.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.410
And so when they're
not feeling up to it,

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:11.370
they're more likely to be absent
perhaps, as time wears along.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.700
And then, towards
the end, they've

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.950
made their new selection of work
for the following timetable.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.960
OK?

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:24.690
So what this suggests is you
have a surplus of operators

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.120
available at the
beginning of the timetable

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.420
and a significant
deficit of operators

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.240
at the end of a timetable.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.550
So you sort of have one day
in the middle of a timetable,

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.470
which is perfect.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:41.020
But otherwise, you're off.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.080
You haven't got this good
balance between the operators

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.990
that you have available
and what you need.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.850
So clearly doing workforce
hiring every month,

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.450
for instance, is one way
of dealing with this.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:07.480
So you can reduce this hump
for training new operators

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:13.210
and spread it over the whole
period because, in round terms,

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.400
training for an operator
takes about a month

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.040
of on-the-road training.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.315
And so you spread that over
the month, over the timetable.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.110
So going to monthly hiring
makes a lot of sense.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.630
And again, you
avoid these problems

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.360
having unassigned cover time.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.860
What that means is
you've got people

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.640
who are being paid not to be
very productive in the garage.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.890
You haven't got very, very
good things for them to do.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.473
Because otherwise,
you'd have built it

00:30:43.473 --> 00:30:44.590
into the operating plan.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.890
And large amounts of
overtime and unreliability

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.790
at the end of the timetable.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.980
And I don't know what
your experience is,

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.480
but in my experience,
that's exactly what you see.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.500
At the end of a timetable,
service goes down the tubes,

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:04.120
because you get this imbalance
between higher absence

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.190
and higher requirements
for running

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.540
into the next timetable.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.490
So you want to try
and avoid that.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:11.990
OK.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.510
So let's look at this from
a total cost perspective.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.210
This is a very simple sketch.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.610
I'll show you something more
realistic in a few minutes.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.880
But this is the
conceptual part of this.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.200
So on the x-axis--

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.140
and I apologize,
this is a typo--

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.880
that's number of extraboards.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.430
The extraboard is
the cover list--

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.460
the people who are there
to cover absences or do

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.580
extra work that's required
not built into the timetable.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.030
These are extraboards
or cover lists--

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.240
whatever.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.310
And that should be the
number of drivers--

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.130
"extraboard operators," not
"extraboard operations."

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.090
And on the y-axis,
you have the cost.

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:56.340
So if you have a small number
of extraboard operators,

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:01.330
your fringe benefit
costs are low.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.930
Your fixed fringe benefit
cost will increase

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.580
as you increase the number.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.110
But you'll be relying
very heavily on overtime.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.890
So you'll be having high
direct payment costs because

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.390
of the reliance on overtime.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:20.440
And that gives you an
overall high cost solution

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.840
beyond some point where
you get a good balance

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.860
between the costs of overtime
and the cost of fixed fringe

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:27.970
benefits.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.960
Then you'll get a sweet spot
you'll want to try and operate.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.655
And you want to avoid
this, where you've

00:32:34.655 --> 00:32:36.030
got so many
operators that you've

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.030
got a lot of people who
don't have a lot of work

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.460
to do on many days.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:44.950
Yes, question?

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:45.760
Comment?

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.510
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
It's a question.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.060
NIGEL HM WILSON: OK.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.727
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I didn't quite

00:32:50.727 --> 00:32:53.130
understand why monthly
hiring would reduce the time.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:53.460
NIGEL HM WILSON: OK.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.490
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Can you explain that?

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:54.940
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.440
Sure.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:06.590
OK, so-- sorry, yeah.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.780
Thanks, Gabriel,
for reminding me.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.780
It will take care of this hump
at the end of the timetable.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.030
If there really is
an extra requirement

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.800
for work at the
end of a timetable,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.140
you can hire up for
that a month before.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:24.560
So if you think of this
as a sawtooth pattern, OK,

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.540
which is what it is--
you've got attrition,

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.980
and then you've
got a bulk hiring--

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:33.330
if you reduce the
periodicity of the saws--

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.820
the gaps-- you'll
reduce the integrated

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.530
imbalance between the
requirements and what you need.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:44.080
So that's, in essence,
what's going on here.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:44.740
Thanks.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:45.930
Good question.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:51.190
OK so this is sort of the
classic schema for analyzing

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:55.170
this problem, for modeling it.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:34:01.950
So here on the x-axis, we
have number of scheduled runs.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:06.720
This is for an organization
that sort of looks a lot a lot

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.345
like the MBTA.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:22.260
And this histogram here is
the cumulative distribution

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:27.590
for number of absence days
in the previous period.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.550
OK.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:35.150
So now we're running into the
summer timetable for the MBTA.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.150
So when the MBTA was doing
the analysis on this,

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.250
they were saying, well,
what level of absence

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:41.780
can we expect this
coming summer?

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.312
Well, we'll start by
looking at last summer.

00:34:44.312 --> 00:34:45.770
That's probably a
fairly good proxy

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:47.489
for what we can
expect this summer.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:50.150
And so the way they
would look at that

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:54.370
is look at the number
of absent operators

00:34:54.370 --> 00:35:01.190
by day of week over the
full range of experiences

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.480
from last summer.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.800
So on your best day last
summer for the MBTA--

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.050
these are hypothetical
numbers, but I want to give you

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.670
the flavor of this--

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.770
you had 16 absences.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:16.250
16 drivers didn't show up for
work, for whatever reason.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:21.980
On your worst day,
you had 60 operators

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.660
who didn't show up
for work that day.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:28.030
So it's a tremendous range.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.530
Question?

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:28.855
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:35:28.855 --> 00:35:29.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.695
AUDIENCE: Can you explain how
the chart works a little bit

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:30.800
more?

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.717
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yeah.

00:35:31.717 --> 00:35:32.970
OK, so yeah.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:36.660
I'm trying to do a lot
in one chance here.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.075
So this, if we
look at that, it's

00:35:39.075 --> 00:35:44.250
the cumulative distribution
of absence days.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:50.880
So this is the percent of
days which have absences less

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.223
than this number.

00:35:52.223 --> 00:35:53.640
So it's a cumulative
distribution,

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.900
cumulative density function.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.790
So what we're saying
here is that every day

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:03.760
had no more than 60
operators absent.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.860
Every day had at least
16 operators absent.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.200
And this is the
historical record

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.980
of absences over that period.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.180
Now, the reason I've
drawn this line here

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.500
is to show you what the
extraboard sizing trade off is.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.530
So we're looking at, say, 31
extraboard operators here.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.380
If we have 31 extra board
operators and we assume

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.390
there's no absence in the
extraboard operators--

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.080
of course, there will be--

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:38.190
then we will be able to cover
all of the absences in area B

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.920
without paying any overtime.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:45.000
But all of the absences
on days in area A,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.790
we'll have to pay
overtime for, and we'll

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:54.380
have to deal with reliability
to drop trips on those days.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.110
So the first point
I want to make

00:36:56.110 --> 00:37:00.340
is this is a very simple
model, but it's very useful.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.110
It provides a lot
of insight into how

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.950
you make these decisions.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:08.030
The first point to
make is, my god,

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.520
that's a lot of variability--

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.470
from 16 to 60 operators
absent on different days

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.010
of the timetable.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:20.260
So probably some of
that is systematic.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:24.050
So some of them, probably you
have maybe a higher absence

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:28.140
on Mondays and Fridays than you
have on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.530
and Thursdays.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.640
So you probably want
to do this analysis

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.220
at the day-of-week level, OK.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.710
Maybe you can group Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, Thursdays.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.960
Maybe you can group
Mondays and Fridays.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.750
But the principles are the same.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:49.910
So there are different
ways of classifying days

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:51.240
to reduce the variance.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.448
But you're basically going
to have this sort of trade

00:37:53.448 --> 00:37:57.560
off between your [AUDIO OUT]
--terministic number

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.660
from this cumulative
density function,

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.003
cumulative distribution.

00:38:01.003 --> 00:38:02.420
Is everyone
comfortable with this?

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.940
Because this is important.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.455
Yeah.

00:38:04.455 --> 00:38:06.070
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious about--

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.570
so this is a broad spin on
public transportation here.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.960
But I'm thinking of like
delivery companies might

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.060
be very similar.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.130
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:14.630
Yeah.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] consulted
by them for this type of work?

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:17.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.420
NIGEL HM WILSON: I
don't personally,

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.395
but the problems
are very similar.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.770
And the airlines have had
very similar problems.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.690
I was on a trip,
not too long ago,

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.690
where I was delayed at
Logan Airport for an hour

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:36.320
because they had an
unexpected absence.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.770
Their reserved crew
member happened

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.450
to live in Nashua,
New Hampshire, which

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:47.120
a lot of airline pilots
live in because it doesn't

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.250
have any taxes in that state.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.597
And they had to drive
down, in the peak hour,

00:38:51.597 --> 00:38:52.430
to get to the plane.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.020
I was delayed for an hour.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.590
So every industry has
the same sort of problem

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:03.803
when it's a transportation
industry, where

00:39:03.803 --> 00:39:04.970
you don't have a shelf life.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.220
It's not a production process.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:06.920
It's a service.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.620
And you have to deliver it at
that time, in that location.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.370
So there are similar problems.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.580
Again, it's not totally
dissimilar from staffing

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.282
in hospitals for nurses, for
doctors, everything like that.

00:39:19.282 --> 00:39:20.990
So there's a whole
class of problems here

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.350
which are quite similar.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:26.945
And I'm just presenting the
particular variant of this

00:39:26.945 --> 00:39:29.470
for the transit industry.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:32.610
Other questions or
comments on this?

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:33.110
Yeah.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.735
AUDIENCE: Is this
axis mislabeled here?

00:39:34.735 --> 00:39:38.672
Should it [INAUDIBLE]
drivers, not scheduled runs?

00:39:38.672 --> 00:39:39.630
NIGEL HM WILSON: Sorry.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.330
[CHUCKLES]

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:42.010
No.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.764
No, no-- it could be mislabeled.

00:39:49.715 --> 00:39:52.050
What I'm trying to
say is, these are

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.750
the number of
scheduled operators

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.370
who are absent on that day.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.980
That's what it really means, OK.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.363
AUDIENCE: Runs for which
the scheduled operator--

00:40:00.363 --> 00:40:01.280
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yeah.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:06.050
So the analysis is the sort
of full day for a full-timer.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.340
That's sort of the unit.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.640
And you can label the
x-axis in different ways.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.990
And this probably isn't
the best possible label.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:15.600
But that's what
I'm getting at, OK.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.970
Other questions or comments?

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:26.540
OK, so let's quickly look at
the strategic-level model here.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.340
Decision variables--
are what we're

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:34.130
trying to decide is the
workforce size for each period.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:36.650
And typically, as I
said, maybe the period

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.948
of a month, four weeks.

00:40:39.948 --> 00:40:45.410
And vacation allocation for
each period and the vacation

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:49.800
allocation will typically be
over the course of a timetable.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.260
So what's the average
number of vacation weeks

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:56.850
we want to provide in the
summer at a particular garage

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.890
or across the whole system?

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:03.420
We'll provide the same
number of vacation weeks

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.400
for all the bus
system in the MBTA.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.270
And there's someone who's
covering the vacation--

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.760
just is covering the
different vacations

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.680
every week of the timetable.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.110
So we have to have
the same number

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.000
throughout the timetable.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.950
OK?

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:23.970
And the optimal hiring level--
so you get the right number

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.590
throughout the year.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:30.670
That's sort of what we're
trying to achieve here.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:34.150
And the objective is to
minimize the workforce cost,

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.230
which includes the cost
of the schedule runs,

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.480
the costs of the extraboard--
the people who are there

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.030
to cover the absences
and the extra work--

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:43.375
and the cost of overtime.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.240
And you'll notice there
that I didn't include

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.490
costs of reliability
or unreliability,

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.900
because I'm including
that in the constraint.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.960
I could have included in
the objective function.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.938
But I'm including it
in the constraint,

00:42:00.938 --> 00:42:02.480
just because it's
a little bit easier

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.160
to conceptualize it that way.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.710
And we were doing this
work for the MBTA, who

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.740
kind of like to think of
overtime as a constraint.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.010
Because overtime, as
you're probably aware,

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:16.660
gets a lot of attention in
the medial, in the press.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.890
You know, "10% of
our budget is being

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.020
spent on overtime for drivers."

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.670
Those are headline
sorts of issues.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.820
So the MBTA and transit
agency generally

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.950
are sensitive to the
level of overtime.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.590
That's why I structured
this as a constraint,

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.940
rather than as a
multi-objective function--

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.200
[INAUDIBLE] multiple objectives.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.330
Constraints we need to
meet-- vacation liability,

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:45.120
overtime service reliability,
part-time operator constraint--

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.750
sorry.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.120
And any other policy
constraints that we want to

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.780
can be included in this
optimization problem.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:58.720
And the reliability model that
we have is basically this.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.590
So what this is saying
is we have open work.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:06.230
What open work means is we
have work we want to do.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.310
We don't have anyone who's
going to be willing to do it

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.050
without paying overtime.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:13.100
That's what I mean by open work.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.010
It's work that wasn't
a regularly scheduled

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.620
employee available to cover.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.720
So overtime is available.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:25.990
If an operator is available
and willing to work time,

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.550
you come down here.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:28.930
And overtime is worked.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.610
That may produce more absence.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:34.120
May have those negative
feedback effects.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:38.200
But at least you've delivered
the service that day.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.300
If there's no operator
available or there's

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.033
no operator willing to work the
overtime, you drop the trips.

00:43:44.033 --> 00:43:46.158
And you've got a reliability
problem on your hands.

00:43:51.043 --> 00:43:52.960
Don't worry about the
individual points there.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:44:02.360
But this is showing for the
bus network on the MBTA,

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.202
on the x-axis, the open work.

00:44:05.202 --> 00:44:09.760
This is for a particular
timetable, system-wide

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.510
for the bus, and the
number of missed trip hours

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:15.200
that were incurred that day.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.930
So each point here
represents a day of operation

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:22.340
on the MBTA bus system.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:27.710
And so this particular day,
you had close to 300 hours

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.630
of open work.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.825
And you dropped close
to 150 hours of service.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.260
And if you do an OLS
regression on this,

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.370
this was the best fit we got.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:48.850
So that means for every
100 hours of open work

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:54.810
at the time we did this
analysis that you wanted to get,

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.390
you were only able to get 72.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.370
And you wound up dropping
28 hours of service.

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.140
That is pretty tough.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.570
That's actually
really quite bad.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.790
By comparison purposes,
I've done other work

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.100
in Montreal,
Ottawa, and Toronto,

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:16.230
which are pretty good, more or
less, east coast properties.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:20.050
In Canada, they're
never more than 10%.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:24.840
So there's something not
being done very efficiently

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.380
in the way the MBTA
covers their overtime.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.960
And I think part
of this is probably

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:36.390
over-reliance on seniority,
again, and probably not

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.130
doing enough advance planning.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:47.370
And what do I mean by relying
too heavily on seniority?

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.820
How many phone calls do you make
to the most senior operator who

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.550
might be available before
you say, he or she isn't

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.960
going to do this
work, and you go

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.560
to the next person on the list?

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.590
And how much advance
planning do you

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:03.850
do to make sure that you've
got a set of operators who

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:07.980
are really going to be available
if you have a need for them

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.490
at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning?

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:13.300
Those are the things that you
could do to try and reduce

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:17.860
this 28% missed trips to 5%
or 10% missed trips, which

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.692
would be a much better situation
for everyone concerned.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.970
So this is the MBTA
case study again.

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:30.830
Bear in mind that this
was basically mid 1990s.

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:31.810
So it's 20 years ago.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.850
But also, believe
me, nothing much

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.980
has changed in this
regard at the MBTA.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.380
I'm not saying nothing's
changed in the MBTA

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.480
in any regard over
the last 20 years.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.850
But certainly in this regard,
nothing much has changed.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.170
And I think there are still
some of the same problems

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:53.350
that I'll talk about here
still in existence, which

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.720
is sad for me to admit
because, obviously, I

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.200
was trying to help them--

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.200
didn't succeed.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.950
So at that point, the
part-time workforce

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:05.980
was sized to about 40% of
the full-time workforce.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.930
That's a little bit
lower now, I believe.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:14.950
There's a large variability
in required work hours.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:16.550
So what do I mean by that?

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.350
The mean daily
absence and extra work

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.200
required-- this is apart
from the timetable.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.540
So this is shuttling
service when

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:29.730
you get a line down
for signaling problem

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:35.530
or disabled train or whatever it
is, or fatality on the tracks.

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:37.650
The mean daily
absence and extra work

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:40.020
for the whole MBTA
bus system was

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:44.340
1,250 hours on a daily basis.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.220
And the standard deviation
of that was 290 hours.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.370
AUDIENCE: What percent
of that is total hours?

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:51.750
NIGEL HM WILSON: It's coming up.

00:47:55.398 --> 00:47:56.940
I'm getting into it
in a few minutes.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:01.517
But round figure's 10%.

00:48:01.517 --> 00:48:02.100
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.380
NIGEL HM WILSON:
It's pretty high.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.450
That's not just absence.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:07.090
It doesn't include extra work.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:07.803
OK?

00:48:07.803 --> 00:48:10.220
AUDIENCE: But it does
include sick leave, as well?

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:10.670
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:11.070
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:11.490
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:12.100
AUDIENCE: Any kind of absence.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:12.975
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

00:48:12.975 --> 00:48:14.420
Any sort of absence, exactly.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.125
So it's not in any
sense absenteeism.

00:48:17.125 --> 00:48:18.500
It's the amount
of extra work you

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.625
have to do beyond what's
the scheduled work,

00:48:22.625 --> 00:48:25.800
the scheduled operating plan.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.750
But anyway, it's quite large,
and it's very variable.

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.170
So it is highly stochastic.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.310
Now, these figures
were from 1996.

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:38.740
And so the numbers will
have changed significantly

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.190
over the last 20 years.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.770
But the relative
ratio of the numbers

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.650
in the different
columns and cells

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:48.380
has not changed significantly
in the last 20 years.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.780
So what this is saying--

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:56.627
what we're showing here is the
driver cost per platform hour.

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:04.360
And so this includes
the wage rate

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.080
and benefits-- fixed and
variable fringe benefits.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:18.100
So an hour of overtime worked
by a driver at that time

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.930
was around $30 an hour.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:27.310
So sorry, the first
row is the wage rate.

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:30.040
The second row is the full cost.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.550
So the difference here is the
benefits that are included,

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:38.000
and the productivity changes
between overtime, part-time,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.010
and full-timers.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:43.060
So for overtime, you get
a very small benefit load

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.570
because most of the benefits are
covered through their base job,

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:48.070
OK.

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.980
So the marginal cost
of overtime work

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.530
in terms of the benefit
load is quite small,

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.470
in the order of less than 10%--

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.590
or just about 10% of this.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.570
Whereas for part-timers
and full-timers,

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:06.200
full-timers get somewhat
greater benefits.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.650
So it's a significant increment.

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:11.170
So if you just scan
across here, this

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.990
gives you the straight,
direct comparison

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:17.590
between the cost of an hour of
work produced on an overtime

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:21.400
basis by a full-timer
or by a part-timer.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.660
And in round terms,
you say, well,

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:29.290
if it's 40% part-timer,
60% full-timer, as the mix

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:34.630
of workforce, versus $32.72
for an overtime, it's a wash.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:37.070
It's basically the same.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:37.770
OK.

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:41.950
So strictly in terms of cost,
it doesn't really matter.

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.540
It matters a lot if you
have far too many people.

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:48.150
But it doesn't matter too
much in terms of the cost

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:50.390
if you have about
the right number

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:53.160
or slightly less
than that number.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.520
If you have a lot
less than that number,

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.220
the short-run financial
costs won't change,

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.230
but you'll have
reliability problems

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:04.570
because you won't be
able to get the overtime.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.500
However, what we really
should be looking at

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:12.570
is the marginal cost of the
last person on the cover list.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.540
That's where we're making
the marginal decision about

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:17.610
whether we want to increase
the cover list by 1

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:20.730
or decrease it by 1 or
hold it where it is.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:24.830
So if the last person
on the cover list

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:29.930
is being used 50% of
the time, then you're

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:34.720
making a trade off between
$32.72 for an overtime hour

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:41.170
versus $69.56 for the marginal
person on the cover list.

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:50.110
OK, so what a critical issue
is, in terms of any of you guys

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.850
doing analysis for
transit agency,

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:55.780
be it JR-East or the MBTA or
whatever it is, in this area,

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:59.320
you really want to look at what
the distribution of the costs

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.410
are of the cover list.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:06.330
And a good proxy
for that is who's

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:09.600
picking the work
on the cover list.

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.300
If it's the most
senior operators who

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.460
are picking the work
on the cover list,

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:15.230
that means that's
pretty easy work.

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:21.050
If the senior operators are
not picking the cover list

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:24.380
and it's being left to the
junior people on the seniority

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:29.010
list, that means the senior
operators want to avoid it

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:31.770
because it's difficult work.

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:35.130
So that's a sort of
very simple shortcut--

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:38.020
do we have an oversized cover
list or an undersized cover

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:38.520
list?

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.730
Look at who's picking that
work on the cover list.

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:44.980
Is it very senior
operators or not?

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.997
Any questions on this?

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:49.330
AUDIENCE: So cover lists--
are those people who come in,

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.670
and they're sort of waiting
to go on a [INAUDIBLE]??

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:51.100
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yeah.

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:51.196
Yeah.

00:52:51.196 --> 00:52:52.240
AUDIENCE: They're not people
who are sitting at home,

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:52.780
waiting for a phone call.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:53.947
NIGEL HM WILSON: No, no, no.

00:52:53.947 --> 00:52:55.713
They're in the garage--

00:52:55.713 --> 00:52:57.130
maybe playing cards
in the garage.

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:58.540
But they're in the garage,
and they're available.

00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.037
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:59.037 --> 00:52:59.870
NIGEL HM WILSON: OK.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:06.020
OK, so I'm not going to
go through the model.

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:10.670
Again, I'm happy to give you
the papers and theses on this.

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:13.453
One of these theses was done
by Haris Koutsopoulos, who

00:53:13.453 --> 00:53:14.620
many of you know quite well.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.450
He's a senior faculty
member at Northeastern.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:21.560
Another of the theses was
done by Yoram Shiftan,

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:26.137
who was entertaining me in
Israel just three days ago.

00:53:26.137 --> 00:53:28.470
So there's some very good
work that's been done on this.

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:34.838
But the model that
came out of this--

00:53:34.838 --> 00:53:36.380
I'm going to go show
you some results

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:40.840
and talk about what they mean.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:45.913
What this is showing is,
under different scenarios,

00:53:45.913 --> 00:53:47.330
the number of
full-time operators,

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:51.950
the number of part-time
operators that produce

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:57.230
the optimal solution,
the overtime as a percent

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:01.810
of the full cost--

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:06.070
the full cost, $96.4 million
in this case, per year.

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:12.932
Sorry, that's the regular
cost, regular time cost.

00:54:12.932 --> 00:54:13.890
It's the overtime cost.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.810
You add them up, and
you get the total cost--

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:17.370
$97.8 here.

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.230
And this is adding
different constraints.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:25.720
So the base case, without any
constraints beyond vacation

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.720
or liability-- the things that
we've already talked about--

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:42.430
are that the cost of the
MBTA bus drivers should be--

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:48.710
these are 1996 dollars
again-- but $98 million.

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:52.220
And the reliability,
given 1.5% of the time

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.870
has to be worked on
overtime, and given

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:56.360
the way they manage their
overtime, which is not

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.540
very good, not
very well, they'll

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:03.320
be dropping about
0.4% of the trips--

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:06.770
4 trips out of every 1,000.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:09.450
That was their existing
level of unreliability

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:12.920
in terms of dropping service.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.720
So that's the base case numbers.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.340
You could then add
different constraints.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.570
If you add a constant
hiring constraint, which

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:25.840
means that we hire the same
number of operators every month

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:27.460
over the course
of the year and we

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.080
don't allow it to vary
from month to month,

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.640
what does that do?

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.480
It makes it easier for
the human resources folks.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.540
It makes it easier for
the training people,

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.290
because they know what
their load is going

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:40.460
to be throughout the year.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.860
And in fact, you can incorporate
that single constraint

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:48.790
with zero impact on the
budget or reliability.

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:50.670
So the solution is
exactly the same.

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:52.680
We've just juggled
vacation liability

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.760
between different periods.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.410
OK?

00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:00.980
If we wanted to have a
constant vacation as a policy

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:03.560
in the organization, we
add that as a constraint--

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.960
so the same month vacation
throughout the year--

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.570
then that would result in
about an almost $2 million

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:18.020
increase in the total cost
of the MBTA bus drivers.

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.240
We'd have less overtime.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.850
And so our reliability
would improve

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:26.330
to dropping 2 trips
out of every 1,000,

00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:28.700
rather than 4 trips
out of every 1,000.

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.460
And if we included in them
both the constant hiring

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.715
and vacation, which I
don't think you'd want to,

00:56:33.715 --> 00:56:35.090
but this is just
to show what you

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:37.280
can do with this
sort of model, then

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:41.180
that would increase the budget
by an additional $1.5 million

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.580
a year.

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.670
And because you'd be
relying less on overtime,

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:49.140
you'd be having even
more reliable service.

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:53.780
So it gives the MBTA managers
a sense of the trade offs here,

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:57.440
but between the size of the
workforce optimally structured

00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:01.184
over the course of the year
and reliability and overtime.

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.900
One different set
of results here.

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.420
This is showing,
OK, so what happens

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:13.780
if we change the level of
the overtime constraint?

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:21.450
So the base case here is
1.5% time as a constraint.

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:24.870
If we just eliminated the
overtime constraint completely

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:29.630
and said, just choose
the amount of overtime

00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:32.990
that gives you the
minimal cost solution,

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:38.860
then your overtime costs would
be close to $12 million a year.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.590
And that would enable you
to save about $1.3 million

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:44.050
per year on the
overall budget, because

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:49.610
of the relative costs of
overtime versus regular work.

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:54.110
However, your reliability would
go to hell in a hand basket.

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:56.405
And you'd be dropping 3
trips out of every 100--

00:57:56.405 --> 00:57:58.550
3 hours of service
out of every 100.

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:00.230
And probably, this
is much better

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.540
than it would really
be if you did that.

00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:05.630
Because this is not a
linear function, OK.

00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:07.380
You're going to have
more and more trouble

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.005
covering those trips
and getting people

00:58:09.005 --> 00:58:11.820
to agree to work overtime if
there's so much overtime being

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.990
asked of the workforce.

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.592
So this is a gross
underestimate.

00:58:16.592 --> 00:58:21.370
But if you looked at 5%,
which is still pretty high,

00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:26.700
then you'd save, in theory,
about $800,000 a year--

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.470
less than $1 million a year.

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:33.720
And your reliability would
decrease significantly

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.900
from dropping 4 trips
out of every 1,000

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:43.410
to dropping 120 trips
out of every 1,000--

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:45.980
no, 12-- from 4 to 12.

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:53.480
And then if you tighten
the overtime constraint

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.420
for whatever reason, then this
is what it would cost you.

00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:00.870
It would cost you about half
a million dollars a year.

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:04.460
And again, you get some
improvement in reliability.

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:08.210
So these are the sort of
uses of the model that you

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:12.560
can use to inform management
decisions about how you

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.010
structure your hiring
process and training process

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:16.137
and extraboard size.

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.650
OK.

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.200
That's all I want to say
on the strategic level.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.420
Any questions?

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.626
Yes.

00:59:25.626 --> 00:59:28.494
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
sense of how difficult it is

00:59:28.494 --> 00:59:34.150
or how costly it is to hire
additional, new drivers?

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:35.140
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:36.400
Yes.

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.890
So there is a training period.

00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:41.320
The MBTA, since
Fred was Secretary,

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:46.690
has had a lottery process for
selection of new employees.

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:48.910
And every agency,
including the MBTA,

00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:50.650
has a pretty rigorous
testing procedure

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:53.920
you have to go through to get
to the point of being hired.

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.020
You then go through training,
the criminal records

00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.530
check, all sorts of checks
before the training begins.

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.045
And then the training--

01:00:02.045 --> 01:00:05.410
I'm trying to remember, I don't
have it on top of a head--

01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:10.210
I think that the
total training is

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:12.610
in the order of six
weeks, which includes

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.410
getting your commercial
driver's licenses,

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.960
as we talked about earlier.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:21.400
So you've got a certain amount
of advance planning in here.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.890
You can't decide today, I
want to have more people

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:26.442
on the driver
workforce tomorrow.

01:00:26.442 --> 01:00:27.400
It's not going to work.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.280
So that's why you need to
have a strategic view of this.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.115
Yes?

01:00:31.115 --> 01:00:35.075
AUDIENCE: Does this model
capture the behavioral feedback

01:00:35.075 --> 01:00:35.882
loop?

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.090
NIGEL HM WILSON: It does not.

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:38.440
So that was separate work.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.040
And we did look at that.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.560
But it's not in the
results I presented.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.490
Though, as I said,
Yoram Shiftan looked

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:49.630
at feedback effect between
if you provide more overtime,

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:52.170
what does that do to absence?

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.200
And what he found
was, it's variable.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.170
For some operators, there
is a feedback effect.

01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:02.650
But it's not as strong
as you might expect, OK.

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:04.420
So the MBTA management,
for instance,

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:09.880
was pretty convinced this
was really a serious issue.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.450
It wasn't, in our analysis.

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:14.110
But there is a feedback effect.

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:17.330
It's not reflected in here.

01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:18.810
Yeah, Scott.

01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:20.310
AUDIENCE: Earlier,
you said you look

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:24.938
at the seniority of the
extraboards that are taking

01:01:24.938 --> 01:01:25.980
work from the cover list.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.370
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:27.950
AUDIENCE: And you said
it's approximately

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.410
more than the work
that's desirable, right?

01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:29.810
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:30.810
AUDIENCE: The more senior
person takes the work

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:31.685
from the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:31.685 --> 01:01:32.810
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes, yes.

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:35.310
AUDIENCE: And I didn't quite
get the implication there

01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:38.680
for the amount of
work, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.400
NIGEL HM WILSON: OK.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:40.900
So yeah.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:44.020
So if the most
senior operators--

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.575
who can pick anything--
are picking the extraboard,

01:01:46.575 --> 01:01:47.950
that means you
don't have to work

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:49.300
very hard in the extraboard.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.880
The extraboard is
probably too large.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.380
OK.

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.570
That's the simple proxy.

01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:57.810
Similarly, if the
most senior operators

01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:02.520
are picking certain duties
in a garage in terms

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.060
of the types of shifts
and the days they work,

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:10.180
that's a good proxy for what's
easy, what's not so easy.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.860
That's not to say
senior operators aren't

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:13.650
highly motivated.

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:14.150
They are.

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:16.360
But they also have their
own self-interest at heart.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.840
They don't necessarily want to
be on a dangerous, difficult

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.448
route to operate.

01:02:20.448 --> 01:02:22.490
Now, the problem here,
which Fred will get into I

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:26.142
think next week, in terms
of the way the US transit

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.100
industry operates-- there
are lots of problems.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.040
But one of the problems in
terms of the way the US transit

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:35.010
industry operates, compared
with European industry,

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:39.280
is they rely very
heavily on seniority.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.890
So what does that mean?

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:45.580
It means the least
capable drivers, who

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.330
are the people who
are new in the job

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.500
and haven't got a
lot of experience,

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.630
have the most
difficult assignments.

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:56.550
That's almost
certainly not optimal.

01:02:56.550 --> 01:03:01.430
So it means you have
very poor drivers,

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:03.110
in terms of not
their capability,

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:05.630
but where they are on
the learning curve,

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:08.860
driving very difficult routes.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.550
And the European
approach to this

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:16.130
is typically to have
a rotating roster, OK.

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:23.720
And again, in the
US transit industry,

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.600
one of the main benefits
of more seniority

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.470
for a particular individual
is you get to pick your work,

01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:35.010
and you get to pick
your vacation time.

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:36.897
So if you get to 10
years at the MBTA,

01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:38.980
perhaps you never have to
work weekends unless you

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:42.180
particularly want it,
which you often won't.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:48.150
Whereas in most
European systems,

01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:50.670
you're assigned to a
roster that rotates.

01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:53.610
So you will all go through
the same experience

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:57.100
over the course of two months.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.023
I don't know how
JR-East does it, Kenji.

01:03:59.023 --> 01:04:00.190
AUDIENCE: Similar to Europe.

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:01.648
NIGEL HM WILSON:
Similar to Europe.

01:04:01.648 --> 01:04:04.405
That's really the
dominant model elsewhere

01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:05.950
that I'm familiar with.

01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:09.670
There are trade offs in this.

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:13.930
So one of the trade
offs is that if you

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:17.560
use that as your main
motivation for keeping people

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.715
on the workforce--

01:04:18.715 --> 01:04:20.590
you want to keep your
good operators working,

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:21.923
you don't have to replace them--

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:29.860
you can either pay a
wage rate incentive

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:35.960
for longevity, which is more
common in other agencies

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.110
around the world.

01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:39.070
But it's not very
common in the US.

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:45.680
And so you progress from the
entry level wage in the MBTA

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.690
to the top level
in about two years.

01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:54.520
OK, and that's not unusual
in the US transit industry.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.670
And so because that is
such a minimal incentive

01:04:57.670 --> 01:05:01.270
to hang around for
20 years, you want

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:02.800
to provide other incentives.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.090
And so seniority, picking your
work, picking your vacation,

01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:09.460
is the way the US transit
industry has followed this.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.348
Gabriel, you were going
to make a comment.

01:05:11.348 --> 01:05:13.890
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: It's
a half-comment, half-question.

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:14.100
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yeah.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.517
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
But when

01:05:15.517 --> 01:05:17.362
we discussed crew
scheduling, we briefly

01:05:17.362 --> 01:05:19.603
touched on rostering
and differences

01:05:19.603 --> 01:05:21.520
between North American
and European practices.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:21.860
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.860
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
And well, part of that

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:29.040
was that in European practice,
rostering is done sometimes

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.930
with some help of
alarm or helping

01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:35.283
them to make the different
rosters as even as possible.

01:05:35.283 --> 01:05:36.241
NIGEL HM WILSON: Right.

01:05:36.241 --> 01:05:37.658
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
And that

01:05:37.658 --> 01:05:40.295
is slightly different
from picking them.

01:05:40.295 --> 01:05:41.170
NIGEL HM WILSON: Yes.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.390
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Right, so in North American,

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:44.160
these rosters are
formed by people,

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.230
but then they assemble the
rosters from crew schedules.

01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:49.293
Is that correct?

01:05:49.293 --> 01:05:50.710
NIGEL HM WILSON:
Well, the roster,

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:56.110
as I'm describing the roster,
is the rotation, if any,

01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:58.510
of the work that's
done among individuals

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:01.390
over the course of a period,
maybe a timetable or two

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.070
months.

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:05.110
If you have a
rotating roster, that

01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:06.490
means everyone in
this group goes

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:09.490
through the same set of
driving responsibilities

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:12.100
over the course of a two-month
period or a timetable.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.910
In the US transit industry case,
you don't have any rotation.

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.590
You don't even have a roster.

01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:25.890
So you're there, you do
the same trip every day

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:27.330
if you show up for work.

01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:31.440
If you don't show up for
work, you don't do the duty.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:37.740
So it's a trade off.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.860
Personally-- maybe it's
my European roots--

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:44.200
I kind of tend to prefer a
European approach to this

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.960
than the US approach to this.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.460
OK.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:51.280
Let me quickly jump
into the tactical level.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.540
So here, we're going
into the summer timetable

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.890
the MBTA in about
a month's time.

01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:59.700
And so we'll be deciding.

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:04.700
We know how many drivers
we have on the property.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.850
What we're deciding
now is when to assign

01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:11.060
the work on a daily basis
and how many operators

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:17.270
to provide to Lynn versus Quincy
versus Arborway versus Cabot--

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:20.210
the different depots
in the system.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:23.380
And again, so we're
allocating the extra staff,

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:29.320
these floaters, by garage
and by day of week.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.510
And so we want to
know the absence level

01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:36.240
on a more detailed basis here.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.840
We have basically the same
sort of issues and concerns,

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.770
just at a more detailed
level of analysis.

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:46.290
And we can either use a
heuristic or optimization

01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:47.160
for this.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.470
And heuristics actually give
you a very good solution

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:50.970
because it's much simpler.

01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:54.490
This is real data from the
MBTA, again, from 20 years ago.

01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:57.600
So I'm not saying it's
exactly the same today.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:03.760
But I would bet it's not
that different from now

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.270
from what it was then.

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:09.470
So this is a single MBTA garage.

01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:12.770
This is the Cabot garage, which
is one of the biggest MBTA bus

01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:14.540
garages.

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:18.890
And for that garage, this
shows the mean number

01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:24.200
of open hours of work on a
daily basis over a timetable.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.250
So on Mondays, 259 hours
was the mean number

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:30.620
of hours you had to
cover because you

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.450
didn't have someone available.

01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:34.979
Standard deviation
of that was 36.

01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:38.240
So that's quite variable.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.109
Tuesday and Wednesday is
lower in terms of absences--

01:08:42.109 --> 01:08:44.210
also quite variable.

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:47.687
Thursday and particularly
Friday is much higher and also

01:08:47.687 --> 01:08:48.479
even more variable.

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:57.000
So following our
analysis principles,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.850
the cumulative density
function, then you

01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:04.630
would expect to want to
allocate your workforce,

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:10.180
your spare workforce,
reflecting the level of absence.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:10.680
But no.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:19.160
The MBTA was allocating their
extraboard exactly equally

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.380
across all weekdays--

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:25.350
20 extraboard operators on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:26.800
Thursday, Friday, Saturday--

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.270
Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, lower levels

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:33.290
on Saturday and Sunday, but the
same percentage, independent

01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:36.319
of the observed level
of difference in absence

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:40.060
or extra work required
on those days.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:45.550
The model showed that if
you optimally reallocated

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:50.090
the same level of resources,
basically the same level down

01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:52.729
here in terms of
operator days, you

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:58.430
provide more cover on
Fridays, on Mondays,

01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:03.570
and weekends, and less coverage
on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,

01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:06.720
and Thursdays, reflecting
the absence patterns.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.521
That's optimizing the daily
level for a particular garage.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:17.900
And at that point, they
weren't using part-timers.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:22.490
They were using part-timers,
but the part-timers

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:26.028
were not on the extraboard
and not being used in quite

01:10:26.028 --> 01:10:27.320
the same way that they are now.

01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:33.230
And what you get out of this
is the expected overtime

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:37.190
hours over the whole
timetable, recognizing

01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:40.940
the variability on
a particular day

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.340
is the expected
level of overtime

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:53.190
hours over the whole week is
140 hours versus 99 hours.

01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:58.760
So you're saving about 25% to
30% of your overtime costs,

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.910
just by reallocating your
existing workforce more

01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:05.500
effectively across
days of the week.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.130
This is not rocket science.

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:09.430
This is actually
pretty easy to do.

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:11.990
I mean, you can get these
absence figures quite easily

01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:15.800
and implement them.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.780
So the tactical level findings
are significant variation,

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:26.140
absence, and required extra work
by garage and by day of week.

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:31.060
So what would you
expect by garage,

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.920
in terms of absence rates?

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.080
You might expect--
and you'd be right--

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.750
that the most difficult garages
would have the highest absence

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:38.950
rates.

01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:40.670
Those are tough conditions.

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:44.110
So if you look at Cabot,
those are very tough routes.

01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:47.380
And so when you do a
system-wide pick that

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:52.266
allows the operators to select
the garage they work at,

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:56.610
so the most senior
operators will avoid Cabot.

01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:58.570
So it's the most
junior operators

01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:02.650
that wind up at Cabot on
the most difficult routes.

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:06.970
Not a great surprise your
absence rate is higher at Cabot

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:08.710
than it is at Lynn or Quincy--

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:10.360
nice, comfortable
suburban garages.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:15.342
Yeah.

01:12:15.342 --> 01:12:18.037
AUDIENCE: How do you
define a difficult route?

01:12:18.037 --> 01:12:19.250
What constitutes [INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:20.250
NIGEL HM WILSON: Oh, OK.

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:24.750
So there can be any
number of things--

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:29.390
very heavy traffic, danger of
accidents, danger of assault,

01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:34.650
crime, danger of
altercations among customers,

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:37.810
passengers on the bus,
altercations with the driver.

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:42.300
So a number of things like that.

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:48.480
And so I'm not saying all
the routes in the Lynn garage

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.950
are great routes.

01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:54.420
But compared with operating
in the inner city, which

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.370
is where the Cabot
routes typically serve,

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:57.468
there is a difference.

01:12:57.468 --> 01:12:59.760
And certainly in Quincy,
there will be a big difference

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.090
as well.

01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:00.590
Yes?

01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:06.510
AUDIENCE: So the workforce
would have differing levels

01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:09.860
of information about which
route or which garage would

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.163
be more difficult [INAUDIBLE]?

01:13:11.163 --> 01:13:12.580
NIGEL HM WILSON:
By word of mouth.

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:16.320
It's not a sort of a
conscious campaign.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.580
The idea is basically,
you say, hey,

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.210
we've got a seniority system.

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:25.860
So you'll get to know other
operators of different depots,

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:26.910
word of mouth.

01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:29.520
And you'll select, based
on what's available

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.520
when it gets to you of your
place in your seniority list,

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.170
where you want to work.

01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:36.330
And often, it's based
on where you live.

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:41.185
You don't want to have to
commute from Lynn to Quincy

01:13:41.185 --> 01:13:43.270
every day to do your work.

01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:46.380
So it's a question of
proximity to where you live

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:52.380
and the ease, the comfort
level you'll have on the routes

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.440
and the conditions that
you'll be operating on.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.360
OK?

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.300
And the policy of the
MBTA at this point

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:04.200
was to provide the same level
of cover at every garage.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:04.700
Why?

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.850
Their argument that
they articulated to me--

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:14.095
and obviously, I discussed
this with them extensively--

01:14:14.095 --> 01:14:17.110
they would not dispute the fact
that Cabot has a higher level

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:19.522
of absence than Quincy or Lynn.

01:14:19.522 --> 01:14:20.230
They accept that.

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:21.920
That's not in dispute.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.500
But their argument
would be, you're

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:29.450
rewarding the manager
of Cabot by giving

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:32.540
them more manpower if you
recognize the existing absence

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.350
level.

01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:36.700
So they're concerned
about this feedback loop.

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:40.350
If you have more absence,
you get more manpower.

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:42.450
To me, that's a
completely backwards way

01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:43.500
of thinking about this.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.080
You need to have
incentives for the managers

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.570
to do a good job, hopefully.

01:14:48.570 --> 01:14:51.570
But you shouldn't let
that be the motivation

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.370
for making bad
decisions about how

01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:55.440
you use your resources,
which is basically

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.460
what's happening here.

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.520
And they were arguing the same
thing in terms of day of week,

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.120
as well.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.930
So they were really
fighting that, that concept.

01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:11.540
And I wasn't successful
in persuading them

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:15.170
that they should really
separate out the management

01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:18.480
incentives from the efficiency
of the decisions they're

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:18.980
making.

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.660
OK.

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:25.160
All right.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.780
The final level--

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.850
I've got a few minutes left--

01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:30.840
is the operational level.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.520
So again, we've gone from
the one-year planning horizon

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:39.680
to the timetable planning
horizon for three or four

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.990
months, now down
to the daily level.

01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:44.120
OK.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.520
So the objective here is
pretty much the same thing.

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.782
We're trying to minimize
the weighted sum of overtime

01:15:48.782 --> 01:15:49.490
and missed trips.

01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:55.263
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:55.263 --> 01:15:56.930
I'm still at the
operational level here.

01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:04.830
Yeah, no this is right, sorry.

01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:11.430
So what we want to do here
is decide the report times

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:17.090
for any unassigned, extra
staff for the next day.

01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:20.110
So as I said, at
12 o'clock today,

01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:22.450
if there were five
operators who had not

01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:28.420
been assigned work for tomorrow
at Cabot, then the MBTA

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.530
manager--

01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:34.460
desk superintendent or whoever
you want to call him or her--

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:37.600
at Cabot will be
posting the report times

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.640
for those five people tomorrow.

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.070
You don't know what the
absence is going to be.

01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:43.570
You didn't have any
known in advance

01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:46.030
absence to give
them work to cover.

01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:47.950
But you want them
to be available

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:49.762
so that when you do
get the absences, which

01:16:49.762 --> 01:16:51.970
you don't know about, they
will be in a good position

01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:52.926
to cover them.

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:02.238
And so this gets into the
most detailed level of this.

01:17:02.238 --> 01:17:03.780
So it's not just a
question of having

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:08.630
the right number of drivers
available on a particular day.

01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:10.380
It's a question of
having the right number

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:14.960
of available drivers at
every time of that day.

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.860
That's the problem
we're dealing with here.

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.850
So again, much more
uncertainty about how

01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:27.070
the absence is at 9 o'clock
AM versus 5 o'clock PM.

01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:30.445
And what this is showing
is this glorious concept.

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:33.220
It used to be called
"slop overtime."

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:35.320
The MBTA didn't like the
term "slop overtime,"

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.810
so it's now "excess overtime."

01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:40.540
So you have regular
overtime, which is just,

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:44.690
you didn't have enough
personnel on the payroll.

01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:46.440
And so you had to buy
overtime if you were

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.220
going to deliver the service.

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:52.850
Excess overtime is where, in
theory you have enough people

01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:55.220
to cover the needs, but
they're not available

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:59.070
when you want them to be,
because you couldn't make

01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:02.370
perfect decisions about when
they should show up to make

01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:05.000
sure they're productive.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.240
So here, I'm showing,
here, this is

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.890
time of day from 5:00 AM to
1:00 AM the next morning.

01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:21.790
This shows the open run
profile, OK, like that.

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:29.320
Sorry, this is the open
run profile like this.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:32.260
And this is the available cover
profile, based on your report

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:36.160
time decisions, like this.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.710
And so what this shows is
that you have these periods

01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:43.900
here and here and
here, where you

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:50.290
had more operators available
than you had work to cover.

01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:53.940
And so that means that there
were other periods of the day

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.790
here and here and
here, where you

01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:58.140
didn't have enough operators.

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.270
You had the right
number on the whole day,

01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:04.020
you just didn't have them at
the right time in the day.

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:06.240
And it's not just you
made bad decisions,

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.090
it's that this is stochastic.

01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:10.568
You can't make
perfect decisions.

01:19:10.568 --> 01:19:12.110
So you've got to
expect there's going

01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:19.410
to be some excess
overtime built in here.

01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:22.470
And this is the
excess overtime curve.

01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:26.427
And I will wrap this up in
four minutes, I promise.

01:19:26.427 --> 01:19:27.760
I may not go through everything.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.630
But I'll cover most
of what we want.

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:34.650
So this, on the x-axis,
is the available cover

01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:36.540
minus the required cover.

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:41.070
So again, if it's
a perfect balance,

01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:42.990
excess cover minus
required cover

01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:47.340
is 0 because you
had a perfect fit.

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.620
But what that gives you
is the greatest number

01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:51.120
of excess overtime hours.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.710
Because unless you made
every decision perfectly,

01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:57.200
you're going to have
excess overtime hours.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.980
If you go way out here,
you had far more people

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:02.930
available than you needed.

01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:04.680
So you shouldn't have
any access overtime,

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.040
even if you make
lousy decisions.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.380
You put them out any
time, they'll be covered.

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:12.300
And you put them
out-- if you have

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:15.030
far fewer people available
than you require,

01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:16.050
you'll be out here.

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.900
And you shouldn't have any
access overtime either,

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.310
because you don't
have to be very

01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:25.310
good to make decisions which
will have these people be fully

01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:27.305
employed.

01:20:27.305 --> 01:20:30.100
OK.

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:33.970
So it's when you have
this exact balance,

01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:36.220
you have to make every
decision perfectly

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.617
to avoid excess overtime.

01:20:37.617 --> 01:20:39.034
And you're never
going to do that.

01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:47.530
OK, so I've got
some results here,

01:20:47.530 --> 01:20:51.670
which you can go
through on your own.

01:20:51.670 --> 01:20:56.410
And I don't think I need
to cover this specifically.

01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:59.760
But let me get to the
conclusion on this.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.980
The analysis we did on
this level of the model

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:10.860
shows, because of the natural
peaking in work requirements,

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.380
that you have much more
service in the peak

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.320
than in the middle
of the day, the base,

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.770
it doesn't matter that
absence rates are actually

01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:22.380
higher in the peak than they
are in the middle of the day.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.570
Because your
decisions are driven

01:21:24.570 --> 01:21:28.370
by the same underlying dynamic.

01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:33.770
And so you just can make
good report time decisions,

01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:42.090
based on the average absence
rate on that day at that depot.

01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:44.760
So you don't have to go into
super detailed analysis, which

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.510
is good news.

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:51.050
And in fact, you can
wind up with having

01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:56.420
a ranked list of report times
that the desk manager at Cabot

01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:59.550
can just work off that
list for tomorrow,

01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:01.580
based on the number
of unassigned cover

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.050
operators you have.

01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:05.540
And it will always give you
a good solution, as opposed

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:10.860
to the desk manager making
decisions de novo, every day.

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:17.450
This is a very simple decision
support tool that can help.

01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:19.010
So the operational
level findings--

01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:22.010
significant improvements
are possible,

01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:25.070
can reduce the overtime
and missed trips,

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:27.920
and a single set of report times
can be used across all weekdays

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.160
and seasons for each garage.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.430
Separate ranked report times
for Saturdays and Sundays,

01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:36.290
and constant absence
rates can be assumed

01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:37.870
by hour of day and day of week.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:40.330
Those are the main conclusions.

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:43.280
OK, sorry I raced
towards the end.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.380
But I'm available.

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:48.888
I am retiring, as
Gabriel well knows,

01:22:48.888 --> 01:22:49.930
at the end of the summer.

01:22:49.930 --> 01:22:54.110
This is probably my last lecture
as a non-retired MIT faculty

01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.980
member.

01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:58.310
It's been fun doing it with you.

01:22:58.310 --> 01:23:00.120
And I'm around.

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.960
And I will be around after
the end of the summer as well.

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.420
Just I won't be
being paid by MIT.

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.340
So if anyone wants to
discuss any of this

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.810
or go through any of
the background topics,

01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:12.080
please feel free to come see me.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:12.830
OK?

01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:13.730
Thanks very much.

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:17.080

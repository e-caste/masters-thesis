00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.950
HONG LIU: OK, good.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.590
So let me first remind
you what we did last time.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.860
So last time we discussed
that, for any operator,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.610
say some operator O
in the field theory,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.810
we expect this one to one
correspondence to some field,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.480
say, phi in the gravity side.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.770
And of course, the
quantum numbers of those,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.050
they should match because of
the four [? interpretations ?]

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.564
of some symmetry groups and
four [? interpretations ?]

00:00:55.564 --> 00:00:56.730
of the same symmetry groups.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.350
Of course, their quantum
numbers should also match.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.880
And, in particular, on
the field theory side,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.730
say if you have
such an operator,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.070
it's natural to
add the source term

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.650
and then to deform the
Lagrangian in such a form.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.890
And then we explained
that, this phi

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.340
may be considered as the
boundary value of phi

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.486
in the boundary of ADS.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.000
So the boundary value of phi,
and it's mapped to the-- if phi

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.570
have some boundary
value, then that

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.260
is corresponding to
your boundary series

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.250
Lagrangian have such a term.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.120
You know, Lagrangian.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:56.700
And then we also discussed
this for the vector field,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.840
and for conserved
current, say, the case

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.120
which is a conserved
current, then

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.250
that implies that, in a
particular example of this,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.699
if you have a conserved current
that that's corresponding to,

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.250
you must be dual
to a gate field.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.300
And in particular,
the stress tensor

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.871
must be to dual to the magic
deformation in the field series

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:23.370
site.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.570
So any questions regarding this?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.500
Good.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.200
OK.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.560
So now let's try to
develop more this relation.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.440
So this is normally called
the operator field mapping.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.810
And so let's look at this
relation a little bit more.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.570
So my immediate
question, one can

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.480
ask-- so the obvious
question is regarding,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.980
say, the spin of
the operator that

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.270
should map to the spin of
this operator, et cetera.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.460
But if you can see the conformal
theory, which is the scaling

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.510
variant, a very
important quantum number

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.095
for scaling operator is
the scaling dimension.

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:20.470
As we mentioned before, we
said, in the conformal theory,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.170
everything is scaling variant.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.730
And then you can
assign any operator--

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.200
any operator can
be transform under

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.930
appropriate representation
of the conformal symmetry

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.310
of the scaling dimension.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.900
That's one of the most
important quantum numbers.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.790
So now let's look
at how the scaling

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.620
dimension of this
operator are related

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.230
to the physical properties here.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.780
Because here, there
is no low scaling

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.410
dimension in the sense this
is just some gravity field

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.610
and here is isometric it's
not the scaling symmetry.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.330
And then we also can
try to understand

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.600
the worries of properties
of this phi, how

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.110
they are reflected
in O. So that's

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.770
the purpose of today's lecture.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.670
So for this purpose, now,
let's look at the gravity side.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.490
So as we said last
time, we always

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.880
work in the regime of the
semiclassical gravity.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:44.955
So on the gravity side-- OK.

00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:50.410
So what we will show is
that, actually, the dimension

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.500
of this operator can
be directly related

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.560
to the mass of the corresponding
field in the gravity site.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.610
And so this is normally called
a mass dimension relation.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:11.970
So now let's just consider,
on the gravity side,

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.640
so the action can generically
be written as the following.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.910
So everything is controlled by
the gravitational interaction.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.947
So now I have introduced a new
rotation, which we explain.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.370
So you have Einstein gravity.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.080
And then you have
some matter fields.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.882
OK?

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.130
You have some matter fields.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.320
Matter Lagrangian.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.890
So this is the
generic form, say,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.340
of action in the gravity side.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.170
So I've introduced this 2 kappa
squared, which is essentially

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.180
whatever is the Newton constant
in this d plus one dimension.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.770
So normally we put the 6
pi G Newton constant here.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.970
So d plus 1 just
means the Newton

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.230
constant in d plus 1 dimension.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.130
And I just now called this 2
kappa squared for convenience.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.390
And typically, the
matter fields, say,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.220
suppose you have a
scalar field, then

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:29.807
you will have-- say for inform,
plus, say, nonlinear terms.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.640
And if you have, say, if
you have vector fields,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.650
then you will have a
Maxwell actions, et cetera.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.920
So just whatever matter field
you have in the gravity side,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.130
and they just have
this-- so now let's

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:04.200
consider small perturbations
around the pure AdS.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.270
So pure AdS, you
only have a metric,

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.500
and all the matter field
is essentially zero.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:30.329
So now let's consider the small
perturbations around the AdS.

00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:31.870
Or maybe I should
say around the AdS.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.590
So first thing you notice is
that these 2 kappa squared

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.050
is multiplied over all action.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.990
So that means that all the
interactions here, essentially,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.460
are controlled by this
gravitational interaction.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.220
Yeah, it's all
controlled by kappa.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.950
And when you can see the
small perturbations, say,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.750
when you can quantize the
small perturbations, et cetera,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.882
it's convenient to use a
canonically normalized action.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.100
But if you look at
the matter field here,

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.560
the [INAUDIBLE] is this
1 over 2 kappa squared,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.180
which is a lot convenient.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:29.060
Actually, with that 2,
then I don't need 2 here.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.080
So let me just get rid of the 2.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:43.010
So it's convenient to use a
canonically normalized action.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:48.610
So it's considered a small
[INAUDIBLE] around AdS,

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:56.896
say, for convenient
to canonically.

00:09:03.337 --> 00:09:03.836
normalize.

00:09:06.697 --> 00:09:07.780
AUDIENCE: Excuse me, why--

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.904
HONG LIU: Yeah, one second.

00:09:08.904 --> 00:09:19.290
Normalize the kinetic term
of small perturbations.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:19.790
OK?

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.150
Which means it's convenient
when we can see, say,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.760
for example the series for
phi, when we consider scaling,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.880
they take phi-- say k, phi
equal to kappa phi prime,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.080
and then you can see
that in the phi prime,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.570
we'll have a canonical action.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.030
And say, for example, if you
can see the magic perturbations,

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:56.780
and then you can
write it as hmn.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.110
So this is the AdS matrix.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.740
OK?

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.590
Then the phi prime and hmn
will be canonically normalized.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.660
So later, we'll just
drop this prime.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.410
I will just call this phi.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.903
So we just do a
scaling operation.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.850
Yes?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.710
AUDIENCE: Why did the 1 over 2?

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.780
HONG LIU: Oh no, it's just
because there is 1 over 2 here.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.850
AUDIENCE: But what
path, you have r--

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.460
you say the r is in the
action and r should--

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.870
HONG LIU: No, I'm talking
about the matter field.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.570
AUDIENCE: But in the action,
you write the r minus 2

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.931
and the plus [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:46.931 --> 00:10:47.556
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:51.770
AUDIENCE: So ordinarily,
should it be r plus 1 over 2

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.060
[INAUDIBLE] something else?

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.870
HONG LIU: It doesn't matter.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.950
It's just how I
normalized things.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.680
You can normalize-- if
you worry about the 1/2,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.300
it doesn't matter.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.120
Here we're not
worried about 1/2.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.661
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.490
HONG LIU: Good?

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.089
So now here's the
important point.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.380
So here is the important point.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:22.590
And remember, when we have the
relation between the Newton

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:27.130
constants, so the Kappa
squared is a Newton constant.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.920
And remember, this is
proportional to our n squared.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.790
Remember what we
discussed last time.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:44.230
So that means,
under this scaling,

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:50.260
so kappa is actually
of all the 1 over n,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.420
kappa is the Newton
constant it's

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.780
a square of Newton constant.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.830
It's very small.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.885
So this is in units
of literature.

00:12:03.982 --> 00:12:05.940
And we always can see
that in the large N image

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.050
so that the Newton
constant is small.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.565
And so this is small.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.820
So in this regime,
if we keep phi--

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.460
so for canonically
normalized field, say,

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.250
if [INAUDIBLE] hmn
are of order 1,

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.991
then their perturbation
is naturally small.

00:12:29.991 --> 00:12:31.740
Then their perturbation
is naturally small

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:37.420
because they are essentially
controlled by the kappa.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:44.150
And it also means, if you
plug this into the action,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:49.560
so it expands also
long linear terms.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:13:03.146
So it also means
that nonlinear terms

00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:06.198
are order kappa or higher.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.720
So this is very
easy to understand.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:22.570
So let's consider, say, phi
cubed term come from here.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.080
So previously, we have
1 over kappa squared,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:33.350
phi cubed term, so
after this scaling,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.520
then I just have
kappa phi cubed.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.750
So for phi of all the
1, then the cubic term

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.830
will be suppressed compared
to the quadratic term

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.710
because the quadratic
term, after the scaling,

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.300
will be of all the
1, will be all the 1.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:14:03.350
So the lambda near term
will be suppressed or higher

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.196
and suppressed.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.145
So except if we are
interested in considering

00:14:17.145 --> 00:14:19.742
the contribution of
those higher order terms,

00:14:19.742 --> 00:14:21.950
then to leading order, we
can actually just consider,

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.910
for small fluctuations,
we can just

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.480
consider the quadratic action.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.961
This means that
to leading order?

00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:37.713
So we can consider
the quadratic action.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:50.120
So this means we can just-- so
this corresponding to quantize

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.637
the free series, OK?

00:14:52.637 --> 00:14:54.720
So this corresponding to
quantize the free series.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.200
Remember, we always
use h bar equal to 1.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.400
So for those matter fields,
h bar is always equal to one.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:12.340
And after you do the scaling
to get rid of the kappa,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.080
we just treat them as the free
field theory quantization.

00:15:18.532 --> 00:15:19.370
Good?

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.640
Any questions about this?

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.770
So now let's look at scalar
fields, just for illustration.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:35.758
Let's look at what's the
behavior of a massive scalar

00:15:35.758 --> 00:15:36.257
field.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:47.570
So now let's consider
a massive scalar field.

00:15:51.232 --> 00:15:51.940
for illustration.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.700
And we consider some scalar
field phi in the [? back, ?]

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.030
which is due to some scalar
operator O in the boundary.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.690
Just imagine.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.670
OK?

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.584
So now let's consider the
quadratic action for phi.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.400
So we can write down
the quadratic action.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:41.030
So after you have
scaled out this kappa,

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.660
and the quadratic action
can be written explicitly

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:53.574
as the following across
all the kappa terms.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.650
So this is just a free action.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.839
And of the GMA, just the AdS.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:09.099
So the quadratic order, this
just in the background AdS.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:17.240
So we'll use this notation
to denote the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.339
component of AdS.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:27.446
So we're most of the
time using this metric.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.210
This is my background
AdS metric.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.850
And this is my action.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.590
So we'll also use
of the notation

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:49.063
that the x m actually, I
should write this matrix here,

00:17:49.063 --> 00:17:50.480
but it doesn't matter.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.155
The x m should be
considered as z x mu.

00:17:54.155 --> 00:17:57.590
And x mu is the coordinates
parallel to the boundary.

00:18:06.707 --> 00:18:09.040
So do you remember how to
quantize the free field series

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.540
action?

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.830
So this is the time we
need to remember that.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.163
So the first thing is how you
solve the equation motion.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.470
So we actually don't
need to go to details.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:43.840
I will just mention a
few important features.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.600
OK, so this is just the
standard [INAUDIBLE] equation

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.270
for massive scalar fields
in the curved spacetime.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.425
And this gMN is just
given by this metric.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.830
So this is a
seemingly complicated

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.400
partial differential equation.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.910
But here we have
lots of symmetry.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.680
So there is a translational
symmetry along the directions

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.750
parallel to the boundary.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.150
Then we can just write
down a Fourier transform.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:29.210
So because of the translation
symmetries in x mu directions.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.620
So we can just do a
Fourier transform.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:38.596
We can write phi z x mu
in terms of, say, DDK.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.250
So this k.x is just the
standard Minkowski contraction

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.290
because of the t and x part.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:05.440
And essentially it's
slightly a Minkowski metric.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.375
So [INAUDIBLE] here, k.x is
just the standard Minkowski

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:10.875
contraction.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.980
So now it's the first transform.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:30.470
Then you just plug this in.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.220
Then this is very
easy to write down.

00:20:35.315 --> 00:20:39.800
The only derivative now would
be just in the z direction.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.750
Because then all the
derivatives in the t and x

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.190
can be replaced by k.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.530
And then the equation
becomes very simple.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:58.300
So it takes you a couple of
seconds to write it down.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.249
So let me just write it down.

00:21:01.249 --> 00:21:03.040
So it can be written
in the following form.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.000
And then the k squared
just is the standard one.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.542
Again, the k squared is
just as the standard Lorentz

00:21:37.542 --> 00:21:38.042
contraction.

00:21:41.416 --> 00:21:44.164
So omega would be the k
zero in the time direction.

00:21:44.164 --> 00:21:46.122
We're just do the standard
Lorentz contraction.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:53.420
So k mu.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.860
So now, this equation can
actually be solved exactly.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.470
So normally, when
you quantize it,

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.550
you solve the
equation motion, then

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.440
you find the complete
basis of solutions.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.620
Then you expand in terms
of that complete the basis,

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.350
the co-option of the expansion
would be your creation

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.240
and annihilation operators.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.890
And then that's how you
quantize this series.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.040
So this equation can
actually be solved exactly.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.860
So you can actually easily find
out the complete set of modes.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.080
But it would be
actually not needed

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.830
for the current
purpose right now.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.770
So maybe not solve it.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.760
So we'll leave it here.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.200
But what will be
important for us

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.810
is consider the symptotic
behavior of the phi,

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.742
the phi near the boundary.

00:22:51.742 --> 00:22:53.450
Now, let's consider
the behavior of a phi

00:22:53.450 --> 00:23:07.040
near the boundary, which will
be very important for us.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.526
Now let's just consider behavior
of phi near the boundary.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:18.280
So near the boundary,
z goes to 0.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.380
So this term
compared to this term

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.920
is always much smaller
because z goes to 0.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.910
m squared R squared is finite.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.540
So we can drop this term.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.130
But kinetic term, typically,
cannot drop because kinetic

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:38.630
term depends on 1.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:44.580
So we just throw away this term.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.590
So as z goes to 0,
and maybe also expand

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.350
this term more explicitly.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.880
Then what you find,
just drop this term

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.870
and then write in this
term more explicitly.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.036
Then you find the equation
can written as following.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:22.200
So this is only valid when z
equals to 0, leading order.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.120
So now this is equation
has a very nice form

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.320
because this equation
is homogeneous.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.550
So z squared, then
the partial z squared,

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.270
z partial z, and then
you have this thing

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.660
which there's no derivative.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.290
And so this is
not in some sense,

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.041
homogeneous in the derivative.

00:24:41.041 --> 00:24:42.540
Such kind of equation
you can always

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.620
solve it by some power of z.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.640
So this just write down answers.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.280
So assuming phi is
proportional z to some power.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.140
And this power, let
me call it delta.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.690
So you plug these answers
into this equation,

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.830
then you get
[INAUDIBLE] equation.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.970
So you can easily see,
from first term, you

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.560
get delta, delta minus 1.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.600
From the second equation, you
get 1 minus d times delta,

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.430
m squared r squared.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.660
And this is a simple
quadratic equation now

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.798
you can immediately solve.

00:25:29.426 --> 00:25:30.550
So you found two solutions.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.590
Find two solutions.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:47.270
So we are writing this in
the form 1/2 d plus minus nu.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.370
I will define this thing to be
my nu, so this is definition.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.320
So I will introduce
the following notation.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.880
I will take the plus sign.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.930
I call the plus sign delta.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:05.040
So from now on, delta
refers to plus sign.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.360
And sometimes I use
the notation called

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.380
delta minus, which is
the minus sign, which

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.920
is also equal to d minus delta.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.410
So this is the definition.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.010
So now I use this
as the definition.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.010
So from now on,
my delta is always

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.568
d divided by 2 plus this number.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:43.570
So now what we have
found is that as z

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:57.490
go to 0, what we have found
is that as z goes to 0,

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.370
that destabilizes.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:08.090
So as z goes to 0, the phi kz
has the following behavior.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.260
So you have two
independent solutions.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.920
So then I can put
arbitrary [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:21.390
z d minus delta to
exponents, and another one

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.830
is Bk z to the delta.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.826
Then plus have all
the corrections.

00:27:26.826 --> 00:27:27.326
OK?

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:36.460
So this is two leading behaviors
in z goes to the zero limit.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.290
And of course, I can also
go to the coordinate space.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:55.758
Then this is just the x, z,
which is Ax x z d minus OK?

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:10.460
So first notice that this
exponent, this d minus delta

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:17.760
exponent is always
smaller than delta.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.010
So this term always dominates.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.880
So this is the leading behavior.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.820
And this is the
sub-leading behavior.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.480
So keep this in mind.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.815
So now we have found the
fourth symptotic behavior

00:28:32.815 --> 00:28:33.523
of the solutions.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.190
And now we can discuss physics.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.860
Now we can discuss some physics.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.986
Now let me make remarks.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:54.110
For the first remark--
any questions so far?

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.700
Good.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:10.540
So the first remark, you
notice that this exponent

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:20.370
are real if m squared R
squared greater than d minus 4.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.470
Then you say, ah, for sure,
these exponents are all real.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.120
Because normally,
we only consider

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.320
the positive mass squared.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.036
But [INAUDIBLE] idea is
something very interesting

00:29:41.036 --> 00:29:41.536
happening.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.150
It's actually, in AdS,
the [INAUDIBLE] mass

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.490
squared also makes sense.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:55.460
In fact, you can show, as far
as those exponents are real,

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.360
means that, as
far as, so one can

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:21.376
show, as far as the
star is satisfied,

00:30:21.376 --> 00:30:22.876
the theory is
actually well defined.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.240
So in AdS, you
are now-- you have

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.840
an [INAUDIBLE] mass squared.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.970
But if you violated this,
then you find instability.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.470
This is a very nice story,
but I don't have time

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.260
to discuss in detail here.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.720
But my former student
[? Nabil Ackbar ?],

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.540
when he was doing
TA for me last time,

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:57.190
he wrote a very nice note
explaining how this works.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:01.960
And I put that note on the web.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.530
So this equation is
called the BF bound.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.660
F is of our colleague Freedman.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:14.030
And the B is a very complicated
name I always pronounced wrong.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.450
So maybe not try here.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:22.456
Anyway, so [? Nabil ?] gave
a very nice explanation

00:31:22.456 --> 00:31:25.640
of where this comes from.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.830
And he shows that
when you violate this,

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.800
you actually get instability.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.930
And this maps into a very
nice quantum mechanics

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.086
problem, the quantum
mechanics problem of minus 1

00:31:36.086 --> 00:31:36.710
over x squared.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.060
Some of you may have
experience with that problem.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.670
Anyway, so please
take a look at those.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.090
I put it on the web.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.600
And it's a very
instructive discussion.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.090
But we'll take a
lecture to do that.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.140
Anyway, so now I
just make the claim.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.327
It's that, as far as
those exponents are real,

00:32:02.327 --> 00:32:03.410
the theory's well defined.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:03.910
OK?

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.100
But if this exponent
is violated,

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.070
then there exist modes
which are exponentially

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:17.570
growing in time indicating
the system in unstable.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.673
So this star is
called the BF bound.

00:32:26.819 --> 00:32:27.360
The BF bound.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.270
So it's actually using
instructive to compare

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:39.800
with a standard-- actually, I
forgot to use this blackboard.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.691
Anyway.

00:32:40.691 --> 00:32:41.190
Yeah.

00:32:52.540 --> 00:33:00.050
So [INAUDIBLE] to compare
with Minkowski spacetime,

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:04.640
so this compare
with Minkowski case.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.830
So, in the Minkowski case,
if you have a free particle,

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.380
say, if you have a free massive
scalar field-- so of course,

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:16.330
we know this is our
equation motion, OK?

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.840
And from here, if you go
to the Minkowski space,

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.393
every direction is
translation variant,

00:33:23.393 --> 00:33:25.184
then you just get this
dispersion relation.

00:33:29.047 --> 00:33:30.630
You just get this
dispersion relation.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:36.846
You can write phi equals
to mass at omega t.

00:33:36.846 --> 00:33:40.080
Let me just write it
more carefully here.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:46.140
You can write phi
[INAUDIBLE] omega t plus ikx.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.480
Then plug it in.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.870
Then you find for omega
squared equal to m

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.645
squared plus k squared.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:03.320
So in Minkowski
spacetime we don't

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:10.320
allow m squared to be smaller
than 0 because if m squared is

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:18.110
smaller than 0, then that
means, for certain range of k,

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:24.770
say for k, for those values
of k which are smaller

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.981
than the absolute value
of m squared, then

00:34:28.981 --> 00:34:29.897
this will be negative.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.712
So for those things, the omega
will be purely imaginary.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.860
You can be plus minus
purely imaginary.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.350
And then you plug it in here.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.510
Then you find it in
phi and typically

00:34:54.510 --> 00:35:01.840
have exponential omega t plus
exponential minus omega t.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.390
So the phi can have
these two behaviors.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:08.410
And then, of course, this
will exponentially grow.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:11.350
So this tells you that
the magnitude of phi

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.500
will exponentially
grow with time.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.790
And so that indicated
this instability.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.370
So this is the same as the
analog I said earlier before.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:27.030
In the Minkowski spacetime,
if you have a mass squared,

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:31.680
and then your scalar field
one wants to slide down,

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.325
and this just tells you the
behavior wants to increase.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.040
So this the phi.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.510
So this is V phi.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.110
Then the phi wants to increase.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:49.015
So this is phi to 0.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.980
But in AdS, something
nicer happens.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:05.830
So in AdS, the instability only
sets in if the mass squared

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.579
becomes sufficiently
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:07.579 --> 00:36:09.620
So if you just have the
[INAUDIBLE] mass squared,

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.160
if it's greater than this
value, it's still OK.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.890
It's still OK.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.680
So the reason is
actually very simple.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.010
So the reason is very simple.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.610
You can try to convince yourself
by looking at the equations.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.100
And you can see the
physics from the equations.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.570
But the basic physical
reason is following.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:39.930
In AdS, so you can just
look at that equation.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:53.910
Because of the
spacetime curvature--

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.620
so the constant modes
are not allowed.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.600
So you see here, the
most dangerous modes

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.260
are the constant modes.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.070
And when you have
constant modes,

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.740
and then m squared becomes--
no matter how small it is,

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:11.446
no matter how small m squared
is, if you have constant modes,

00:37:11.446 --> 00:37:14.070
and constant mode means
k equal to 0, then

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:18.650
that means that omega squared
will always be negative.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:21.880
As far as m squared is
nonzero in the negative,

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.860
there's always constant
mode which is unstable.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.975
But in AdS, because of
the spacetime curvature,

00:37:26.975 --> 00:37:28.350
the constant mode
is not allowed.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.230
So you always have some kind
of kinetic term in the sense

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.440
that you always have some
kind of kinetic energy.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:55.550
So a field is forced to have
some kinetic energy, which

00:37:55.550 --> 00:38:06.670
can compensate this
negative m squared.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:24.390
But this won't happen when
the mass becomes too negative.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:27.061
And then you have instability.

00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:28.144
Then you have instability.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:36.950
I suggest to you-- so
this is just words,

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.340
but those words can be
reflected by looking

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.300
at the structure
of those equations

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:47.860
and try to get some
feeling about these

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:52.190
by looking at those equations
a little bit more carefully.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:55.120
OK, so this is the first remark.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.520
This is the first remark.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.120
So the second remark,
is that we know

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.435
that the AdS have a boundary.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:22.070
And the light array
which of the boundaries

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.900
in the front of time.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.510
So this is the one
important feature

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.710
we discussed at the
beginning, which

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:32.120
is the boundary in
the finite time.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:40.320
In fact, in the AdS, it's just
pi over 2 in the finite time.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.470
So that means,
actually, energy can

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:49.953
be exchanged on the boundary.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.270
Essentially, you can send
stuff in or send things out.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:14.560
And so we actually need to
impose the-- so in order

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.615
to have a sensible
physical system,

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:19.240
you need to impose
appropriate boundary

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:29.707
conditions between appropriate
boundary conditions.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:42.020
So the most important
basic criterion-- again we

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.130
are not going to the detail.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:47.310
And again, [? Nabil's ?]
notes discussed this

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:50.670
because he has to-- in order
to discuss instability,

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:54.330
he has also to discuss the
boundary condition, et cetera.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:57.190
And you can look at
[? Nabil's ?] notes.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:04.120
So basic criterion to impose
a right boundary condition is

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.940
to make sure that your
energy is conserved

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.650
and that your energy don't
dissipate into nothing,

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:14.708
don't dissipate at the
boundary so that you

00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:15.833
have a well-defined system.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.720
Good.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.730
So now.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:39.140
So when you do
canonical quantization,

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:44.010
then what do you do
is that you expand phi

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:57.091
in terms of a complete
set of normalizable modes.

00:42:01.315 --> 00:42:05.724
Of course they also have to be
no normalizable as, normally,

00:42:05.724 --> 00:42:13.840
in the quantum mechanics,
normalizable modes which

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:21.195
satisfies the appropriate
boundary condition.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:36.240
So before talking about the
explicit boundary condition,

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.160
let me first mention that
issue of normalizability.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.968
So to talk about
normalizability,

00:42:41.968 --> 00:42:43.426
you have to devalue
in the product.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.809
So here we have the standard
inner product for quantum field

00:42:51.809 --> 00:42:53.100
series in the curved spacetime.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.970
So here we have the
standard inner product.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.220
And let me just write it down.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.180
So this is not specific to AdS.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:12.270
This just works for any
quantum field theory,

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.440
for any free scalar field
series in the curved spacetime.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.820
So, for that series,
you can define

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.100
an inner product that follows.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.130
So consider.

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.580
You have two modes, phi1, phi2.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:30.270
And then the inner product can
be defined as the following.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:34.180
You choose a constant
the time slice.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.840
You have to choose
a constant time

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.540
slice, which I called sigma t.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:43.043
So this is a constant slice.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.710
By time, I really
mean this time.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:51.310
You choose a
constant time slice.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:53.240
And then, of course,
you integrate

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.110
over spatial coordinates on
these constant time slice.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.167
So this is the inner product.

00:44:22.167 --> 00:44:23.750
So this is the
standard inner product.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:30.440
And you just plug in the
AdS metric that gives you

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.401
the explicit form for the AdS.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:41.590
So if you're not
familiar with this,

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:44.930
and you can check
that this makes sense,

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:54.690
that by showing that, actually,
this thing is actually

00:44:54.690 --> 00:45:02.520
independent of t, so
it does not depend,

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.340
actually, your time slice.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.892
Because you don't want to your
definition of inner product

00:45:08.892 --> 00:45:10.350
depend on specific
time you choose.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.380
Then the normalizable would
be the standard condition,

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:25.830
whether this thing is finite,
or infinity, et cetera.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.020
And you plug-in some
modes with itself.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.879
And if it is finite,
then it's normalizable.

00:45:31.879 --> 00:45:33.920
And if it's infinite, then
it's not normalizable.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.156
So now this is our
symptotic behavior.

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:51.090
And you can check yourself,
you can also convince yourself

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:56.520
that the most dangerous behavior
because the metric diverges

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.700
near the boundary.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.370
So the most dangerous
part of this integral

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:07.960
is near the boundary because
your metric diverges there.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.490
And you can just
plug this behavior

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:13.060
and this metric behavior.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.742
And then just pay attention to
the behavior near the boundary.

00:46:16.742 --> 00:46:18.700
Then you can decide which
mode is normalizable,

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.750
which mode is non-normalizable.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.550
Then you find, again, this
takes you a few minutes to do.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:26.670
So you'll not do it here.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:33.160
So I will only talk
about the real nu.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.790
From now on.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.610
Just real nu.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.550
It means that we always
satisfy that bound.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:51.800
So we find that, for that mode,
so this mode always goes to 0.

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.147
So you have these two modes.

00:46:53.147 --> 00:46:55.230
This mode always goes to
0 because delta is always

00:46:55.230 --> 00:47:00.110
positive because nu is
positive, and nu is non-active,

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:02.970
and d minus t over
2 is positive.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:06.277
So this is always goes to 0.

00:47:06.277 --> 00:47:08.360
And you can show that this
is always normalizable.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.130
OK.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:23.510
So there's no divergence
at the boundary.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:33.690
But for these
modes, you're going

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.080
to see these modes
become dangerous when

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.380
the mass become very large.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:43.850
When the mass becomes very
large, then the nu is big.

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:49.480
When nu is big, eventually
the delta can be pretty big.

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.080
And then can be greater than d.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.950
And then this will be
an active exponent.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.230
And then this will blow up.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:06.526
So it turns out this is actually
non-normalizable indeed.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:14.540
So this is non-normalizable
for nu to be greater than 1.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.510
You actually don't
need to for, mass

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:18.149
to be very large,
because for nu to be

00:48:18.149 --> 00:48:20.690
greater than or equal to 1, this
is already non-normalizable.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.860
But it's an interesting thing.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:31.180
You said this mode
is also normalizable

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.580
when nu is in this range.

00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:52.470
Good.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:53.117
Any questions?

00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:00.600
Yes

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:04.540
AUDIENCE: Can we define
inner product some other way?

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.610
HONG LIU: No, this
is the only way.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:09.240
This is the canonical way,
just generic for quantum field

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.830
theory in the curved spacetime.

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.180
This is not specific AdS.

00:49:15.804 --> 00:49:18.220
Yeah, essentially, this is a
unique one, yeah I would say.

00:49:20.435 --> 00:49:22.810
AUDIENCE: So I'm just trying
to understand inner product.

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:26.672
In the case that I take,
make it a norm in the sense

00:49:26.672 --> 00:49:28.630
that I take inner product
of a field by itself.

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:33.170
So why, for example,
should this be positive?

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:37.100
HONG LIU: No, no this is
in general not positive.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:43.400
In general, this is a what we
know in the Klein-Gordon field,

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.270
say, if you do in the Minkowski
spacetime, this in general, not

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.200
positive definite.

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.600
AUDIENCE: Right, sure.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.630
HONG LIU: Yeah, same thing
in the Klein-Gordon fields.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:58.950
Yeah, but the
[INAUDIBLE] is, so that

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.520
means this thing
does not make sense

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.440
to interpolate as a probability.

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.415
But you can still use this as a
definition of normalizability.

00:50:06.415 --> 00:50:08.040
AUDIENCE: So it still
does the property

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:12.604
that something will
only have so it's not

00:50:12.604 --> 00:50:14.520
a semi-norm in the sense--
like it is actually

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.395
a good inner product?

00:50:15.395 --> 00:50:17.257
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:50:17.257 --> 00:50:18.715
AUDIENCE: Isn't it
this it just the

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:22.680
generalization of probability
current of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.180
HONG LIU: Yeah, no,
this is the same

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.388
as the Klein-Gordon equation.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.310
This is the same
inner product as you

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:38.610
would define for the
Klein-Gordon field,

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:41.600
a free massive scalar field
in Minkowski spacetime.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.310
And that this is just
the generalization

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:44.560
to a general curved spacetime.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.320
Good.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:56.170
So now, yeah, so we see that
this is always normalizable.

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:58.780
And this sometimes is
normalizable and sometimes not

00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.542
normalizable.

00:50:59.542 --> 00:51:01.625
So now, let me talk about
the boundary conditions.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.890
So for the time
reason, I will not

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:21.090
show that the boundary condition
I'm going to talk about

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.370
will give you a well-defined
energy in the sense

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:27.310
that there's no energy
exchange at the boundary.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:32.010
And for that, take a look
at [? Nabil's ?] notes.

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:34.390
I will not go into
detail on that.

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:38.026
But the boundary condition I
say will satisfy that property.

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:45.340
So let's first look at when nu
is greater than or equal to n.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:48.360
In this case, the
answer is obvious.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.530
You don't even need to check
the energy conservation.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:55.900
Because you only have one
possibility because this mode

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.200
is non-normalizable.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.302
And a non-normalizable mode,
you cannot keep them when you do

00:52:01.302 --> 00:52:02.010
the quantization.

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.064
Quantization, you have to
use normalizable modes.

00:52:04.064 --> 00:52:05.480
So the boundary
condition you have

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:11.260
to choose in order that conical
quantization is equal to 0.

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:18.535
So you should only keep this
mode of a nu equal to 1.

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:19.910
Because this is
non-normalizable.

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:32.694
So now, when nu
is in this range,

00:52:32.694 --> 00:52:35.110
so both modes are normalizable,
but you cannot choose both

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:35.610
of them.

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:38.580
You cannot allow both of
them because then it leads

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.210
to the non-conversation.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:44.400
You need to put some
boundary conditions there.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.889
So then, naturally, the equal
to 0 also works in this range.

00:52:48.889 --> 00:52:50.722
So this is called the
standard quantization.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:02.760
You can still impose, even
though the A modes become

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:06.630
normalizable, you can
still impose A equal is 0.

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:11.384
So tentatively you can
also impose B equal to 0.

00:53:11.384 --> 00:53:12.300
Just take one of them.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.170
Because A now is normalizable.

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:18.755
So this is called the
alternative quantization.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:33.680
So sometimes, it's also possible
to impose the mixed boundary

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.290
condition between them--
to impose a mixed boundary

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:38.260
condition.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.120
I will not go into there.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.790
Anyway, so for example, if you
look at [? Nabil's ?] notes,

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:50.350
you can easily check for
those boundary conditions

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:52.940
that there's no energy
flux, through the boundary.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:54:00.034
So, from now on, I will use
the following terminology.

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.697
From now on, we'll use
the following terminology.

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:26.820
So from now on, when
I say normalizable,

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:31.510
I always say the mode which
are picked by quantization, OK?

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.760
So when I say normalizable,
in this case, of course,

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.550
this is normalizable.

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:41.810
When I say normalizable,
for nu greater than 1,

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:43.460
it's no ambiguity,
just the B mode.

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:50.770
And when nu is between 0
and 1, the normalizable

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:54.330
refers to the mode which
you choose to quantize.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:57.790
And then the other you consider
to be non-normalizable.

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.780
Is it clear, the terminology?

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:05.420
So in the standard quantization,
the B-mode is normalizable,

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.570
and the A is non-normalizable,
even though, mathematically, A

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:10.070
is normalizable.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.450
And in the alternative
quantization,

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:15.450
the B is non-normalizable,
even though, mathematically, it

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:16.340
is normalizable.

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:30.970
So normalizable would mean,
the behavior specified.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:41.240
I'll call the other modes
non-normalizable modes.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.470
So with this
terminology, I always

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:45.980
have 1 normalizable mode,
one non-normalizable modes.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:05.620
OK, let's move on
a little bit more.

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.670
So this is the second remark.

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:12.300
And the third remark--
let me just erase this.

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:22.350
So the third remark,
so normalizable modes,

00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:30.760
by definition, is the one we use
to do a canonical quantization.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.578
And it's the one we use to
build up of the Hilbert space.

00:56:52.852 --> 00:56:55.060
But now, since we have an
equivalence between the two

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:58.900
series, the Hilbert
space of the two series

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:02.377
will be the same because,
otherwise, the state of the two

00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:03.460
series should be the same.

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.960
Otherwise, we cannot talk
about the equivalence.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:11.430
So that means that any
normalizable mode, so anything

00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:16.640
which fall off, say,
as, for example,

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:20.960
in the standard quantization,
like z to the powers delta

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.740
at infinity near
the boundary, you

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:30.420
should consider as mapped to
some states of the boundary

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:30.920
theory.

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.630
So this is, actually, a
very general statement.

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:52.490
So this will also work if you
include those higher order

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:54.360
corrections which are
suppressed by kappa.

00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:01.300
So, in general, you can
apply it to a complicated

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:04.770
interacting nonlinear
series in the gravity side.

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:07.080
And the normalizable
modes are always

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.150
the modes which are in your
Hilbert space in the gravity

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:11.480
side.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.530
And so that means the
mass corresponding

00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:16.630
to some states in the
boundary field series.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:21.724
Good.

00:58:21.724 --> 00:58:23.390
So now, let's look
at the interpretation

00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:24.837
of the non-normalizable modes.

00:58:44.869 --> 00:58:46.410
Non-normalizable
modes, suddenly they

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:47.925
are not part of
the Hilbert space.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:20.445
So if they are present,
in particular--

00:59:20.445 --> 00:59:22.100
let me just finish this.

00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.850
then we'll say it.

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:30.460
So, if present, it should be
considered-- so sometimes,

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:33.620
they're just not present.

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.590
But, if in some situations,
they are present,

00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:37.760
then you should view
them, view such kind

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:51.746
of non-normalizable modes--
if I'm in the background.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:14.021
So by background, for
example, the AdS, pure AdS,

01:00:14.021 --> 01:00:16.020
which we are expanding
around is our background.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.310
Yeah.

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:25.140
So you can imagine,
say, [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.755
non-normalizable
modes deform the AdS,

01:00:27.755 --> 01:00:32.170
then you have a new background,
then you have a new background.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:34.010
And in that
background, you're not

01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:36.990
supposed to quantize
the cell, because these

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.790
are non-normalizable modes.

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:41.368
These are
non-normalizable modes.

01:00:41.368 --> 01:00:43.320
AUDIENCE: Yes, sorry,
I guess I didn't quite

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.700
get the terminology
normalizable for 2, I guess?

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.222
You mentioned it, but
could you repeat it?

01:00:51.222 --> 01:00:51.888
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:00:51.888 --> 01:00:53.880
AUDIENCE: Normalizable,
not normalizable.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.420
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.830
Normalizable means the behavior
specified by the quantization.

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:05.075
AUDIENCE: So I don't think--
I don't quite understand--

01:01:05.075 --> 01:01:07.240
HONG LIU: Yeah,
let me just repeat.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.560
For nu greater than
1, normalizable, it's

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.730
just normalizable, because
there's only one normalizable

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:15.300
mode.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:21.030
For nu between 0 and 1,
mathematically, both modes

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:22.780
become normalizable.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:27.290
But when we quantize them, and
we [INAUDIBLE] one of them.

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:29.510
OK?

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:32.950
As I said, in order to preserve
the energy conservation-- so

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:35.160
we have to select one of them.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.730
So there are two possibilities.

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:39.056
You select the
standard quantization,

01:01:39.056 --> 01:01:40.430
which you said A
equals to 0, you

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.150
said, the alternative
quantization

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:44.500
you set B equal to 0.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.960
So the 1 you set 0
is considered to be

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.660
non-normalizable in
this terminology.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:55.990
And the 1 you
allowed, which means

01:01:55.990 --> 01:02:00.240
the one you are used to expand
as a canonical connotation

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.698
are called normalizable.

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:17.550
I will elaborate this
a little bit more.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.050
Yeah.

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:28.330
Yeah, after five minutes,
then you will see.

01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:29.167
Yes?

01:02:29.167 --> 01:02:31.625
AUDIENCE: What do you mean by
the other ones being present?

01:02:31.625 --> 01:02:36.200
If we don't quantize
them, have they appeared?

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:39.580
HONG LIU: Yeah, they can appear.

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:43.810
I will, again,
explain in one minute.

01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:50.370
So now, I'm going to make a
connection for this statement

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:52.220
to the statement we
are making last time.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.630
We're making last time.

01:02:56.630 --> 01:03:06.620
So last time we said, if a
gravity field has a boundary

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.680
value, then this
boundary value can

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.770
be considered as a source
multiply the operator which

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:18.830
you can add to a Lagrangian.

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:20.960
You can add to the action.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.880
And so this is
precisely like that.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.110
It's precisely like that.

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:29.030
So let me just repeat.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.670
Say, let's consider the
standard quantization just

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:41.705
to be specific and say
standard quantization.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.960
In this case, the
non-normalizable mode

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:54.180
corresponding to
A not equal to 0,

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.250
so if the non-normalizable
modes are present,

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:03.356
and this is corresponding
to A not equal to 0.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:13.290
And we see from here,
this term, A term,

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:17.250
always dominated the other term.

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:19.500
So, in other words, when you
go to the boundary limit,

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:23.813
it's the A which determines the
boundary value of the field.

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:31.500
Let me just say.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.486
The A, which is determined
boundary value of the field.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.385
I put the code.

01:04:44.117 --> 01:04:45.033
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:51.147 --> 01:04:53.730
HONG LIU: A equal to 0 when you
do the canonical quantization.

01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:55.370
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK. [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:57.160
HONG LIU: But A
equal to 0, you mean

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.566
this is the condition in
the normalizable modes.

01:05:00.566 --> 01:05:02.440
So here, we are discussing
the interpretation

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.160
of the non-normalizable mode.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.220
So, now, suppose A is nonzero.

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.230
Suppose a non-normalizable
mode is non-zero.

01:05:12.322 --> 01:05:13.947
Suppose, now, the
non-normalizable mode

01:05:13.947 --> 01:05:15.630
is non-zero.

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.350
We are down with
normalizable modes.

01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:19.480
This is a condition for
the normalizable modes.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:19.980
OK?

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:30.930
So since this term
dominates, the A

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:35.190
should be interpolated as a
boundary value of the fields.

01:05:35.190 --> 01:06:04.060
And if you have a non-zero A,
so if you have a non-zero A,

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:10.630
say, if A x is
equal to some phi x,

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:16.000
according to what we
discussed last time,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.110
now up to this kinematic
factor, this thing,

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.790
which you need to strip away
because this just determines

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:27.300
your equation motion.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.420
So if A equal to
5 equal to 0, that

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:38.260
implies that the boundary series
action should contain the term.

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:01.810
So what this means is
that the non-normalizable,

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.880
there are certainly not
part of the Hilbert space.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.260
If they are present,
they actually

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:14.890
determine the boundary
theory itself.

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:34.882
So the non-normalizable modes
determine the boundary theory

01:07:34.882 --> 01:07:35.382
itself.

01:07:45.174 --> 01:07:53.540
So we will later see
examples of this.

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:04.080
But let me just repeat, so
if you look at the gravity

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.610
solution, then you look
at its symptotic behavior

01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:12.190
near the boundary.

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:17.149
And if you see-- let's,
say, consider two solutions,

01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:19.370
two different solutions.

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.359
If the two different
solutions have

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:26.279
the same non-normalizable
behavior--

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:31.990
say the non-normalizable
modes are the same, but only

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:34.700
the difference in the
normalizable modes,

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.029
then you will say these
two solutions describe

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:42.300
two states of the same theory.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.410
Because they only differ
by normalizable modes.

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:48.700
Then it describes the different
states in the same theory.

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:53.279
But now, if I look at
two such solutions,

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:56.670
and these two solutions
differ by the behavior

01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:00.870
of the non-normalizable
modes, then we would say,

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.569
these two solutions
corresponding

01:09:03.569 --> 01:09:07.189
to two different
series because one

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:09.090
is due to two different series.

01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:13.429
Because non-normalizable modes
needs to add additional terms

01:09:13.429 --> 01:09:14.720
to your boundary theory action.

01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:21.147
Have I answered your questions?

01:09:21.147 --> 01:09:25.464
AUDIENCE: So basically, you
just assume any field which is

01:09:25.464 --> 01:09:29.160
a type of-- maybe a
combination of those two modes,

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.550
but if the--

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:33.451
HONG LIU: Forget about linear
combination of the modes.

01:09:33.451 --> 01:09:36.979
Just say, if you consider two
solutions, which if there only

01:09:36.979 --> 01:09:39.180
differ by normalizable
modes, then they

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:42.160
correspond to different
states of the same theory.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.239
And if they differ by
non-normalizable modes,

01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:46.944
that means they describe
different theories.

01:09:46.944 --> 01:09:48.860
Even the theories they
describe are different.

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.440
And so that's why we
call this background.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.300
We call this background because
the symptotic conditions

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.610
at infinity has changed.

01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:06.450
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:09.828
So, in the alternative
standard upon the quantization

01:10:09.828 --> 01:10:13.666
case that-- which
would be equal to 0.

01:10:13.666 --> 01:10:14.960
HONG LIU: Right.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.120
AUDIENCE: But we know that
the d minus delta is always

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.660
larger than delta.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:23.590
But in that case, it
seems near the boundary.

01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:25.482
The boundary determines,
not the number.

01:10:25.482 --> 01:10:26.440
HONG LIU: Right, right.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:26.610
Yeah.

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:28.030
That's a very good question.

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:30.490
So that, you have to
stretch a little bit.

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:31.210
Yeah.

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:32.160
Yeah.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.370
Yeah.

01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:33.870
Good?

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:41.620
So let me finish my last
equation before we break.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:47.380
So more precisely,
because of this z term,

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:52.060
so in the standard
quantization, yeah

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.715
let me just write it
there, so write it here.

01:10:58.827 --> 01:11:00.035
Let me just replace this one.

01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:06.350
In the standard
quantization, if you

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:12.630
have such a term in your
boundary series Lagrangian,

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:20.510
that's corresponding to this
phi x is equal to limit z

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:28.560
goes to 0, z to the power
delta minus d phi zx.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.270
So I have to multiply a
power so that it will just

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:36.785
extract this A factor from
the behavior of the phi.

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:42.844
And the so this is the relation.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.500
So this is the
important relation.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:51.254
So, last time, we
only said that phi

01:11:51.254 --> 01:11:53.670
should corresponding to the
boundary value of this capital

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:54.300
phi.

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.300
But now, by working out
the symptotic behavior,

01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.490
we have refined that statement.

01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:01.600
Now it's a really precise
mathematical statement.

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:11.185
Any questions regarding this?

01:12:11.185 --> 01:12:13.672
AUDIENCE: Is it a guess or--

01:12:13.672 --> 01:12:15.380
HONG LIU: No, this is
just a [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:27.180
This limit precisely
extracts this A term.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:30.970
This term, because that opposite
power to this one, and this one

01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:33.010
will be smaller.

01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:37.160
This one will be smaller because
that multiplier, this one, when

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.070
z goes to 0 will go to 0.

01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:41.585
So you automatically
extract this term.

01:12:41.585 --> 01:12:42.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:46.732 --> 01:12:48.190
HONG LIU: It's just
this statement.

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:51.440
The A is related to this.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:51.940
OK.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.920
AUDIENCE: No, this statement
is a guess from the example

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.850
we discussed last time.

01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:02.660
So last time, by looking
at this line example,

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:07.480
we deduce that the
boundary value of a field

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.740
should be related to the source.

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.550
The boundary value of
a [INAUDIBLE] field

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:17.260
should be related to the
source of a boundary operator.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.890
And at that time, we don't
know what we mean, precisely,

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:22.280
by boundary value.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.810
And now we have worked out a
precise symptotic behavior.

01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:28.490
And now you can talk about what
you mean by boundary behavior.

01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:31.060
And then that refines
that statement

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:34.220
to that precise
mathematical statement.

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:34.720
Good.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.355
So let's start.

01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:48.525
So let's see what we can
deduce from this relation.

01:13:51.114 --> 01:13:53.530
So turns out that there's a
very important information you

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:57.880
can deduce from this equation.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.130
And this is my number five.

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:06.085
So let me call
this equation star.

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:14.590
So this equation
star, relation star,

01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:29.490
actually tells you that this
delta, which defined before,

01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:31.970
in this way, and appears
in your symptotic formula

01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:36.140
like this, this
delta is actually,

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:49.140
it's the scaling dimension of
the operator dual to phi of O.

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:53.230
So we're assuming this phi
is due to some operator

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:55.570
O in the boundary.

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:57.910
And so this is actually
this precise in the scaling

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:01.654
dimension of O. So now,
let me explain that.

01:15:10.477 --> 01:15:12.435
So before I do this, do
you have any questions?

01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:16.440
Good.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:21.110
OK, so let me first
remind you how

01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:23.150
we define the scaling
dimension of an operator

01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:26.950
in conformal field theory.

01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:29.890
So if you have a scaling
[INAUDIBLE] theory,

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:35.940
then the overall
scaling is a symmetry.

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:38.630
So such a scaling is a symmetry.

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.320
And so under such
symmetry transformation,

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.450
say, operator, we call
it a scaling operator

01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:49.800
if you transform.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.860
And under this symmetry
has the following.

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:55.220
So transform into a
new operator prime.

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.630
And evaluated at
the new x prime is

01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:02.060
equal to just
differ by a scaling

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:03.602
from the previous operator.

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.690
OK, so we pause.

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:13.900
So the operator, with such
property, a scaling operator.

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:23.680
So good operators, which
are representations

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.630
of the conformal symmetry
always have this behavior.

01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:31.500
And this delta defines
the scaling dimension.

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.405
So this delta is the
scaling dimension.

01:16:34.405 --> 01:16:36.530
So this is the definition
of the scaling dimension.

01:16:42.075 --> 01:16:44.345
So this is almost similar
to a scalar field.

01:16:44.345 --> 01:16:46.659
So a scalar field means
that the new scalar field,

01:16:46.659 --> 01:16:47.950
you evaluate it at a new point.

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:51.500
It should be the same as
your old scalar field.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.060
You evaluate it
at the old point.

01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:57.100
And here the difference
is just of a pre-factor.

01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:02.620
And this number defines
the scalar information.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:04.900
Good?

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:12.690
So now I will derive that
this relation implies

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:16.440
that this operator
transforms precisely

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.440
according to this delta.

01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:34.050
So let me first I remind you
that the boundary scaling x mu

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:38.410
goes to x mu prime
equal to lambda

01:17:38.410 --> 01:17:44.940
x mu is related
to the bark, also

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:51.270
to isometry, which is the x
mu prime equal to lambda x mu.

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:53.860
But, at the same time,
you also scale z.

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:03.180
So this scaling
symmetry, the counterpart

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.086
of this scaling in
the gravity side

01:18:05.086 --> 01:18:06.752
is that you scale
both of them together.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.700
And the gravity metric
is invariant under this.

01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:30.600
So now let's consider
transformation.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.820
So now let's consider the
relation between the phi x

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:35.052
z and the O x.

01:18:38.610 --> 01:18:43.136
So let's consider such a
transformation on both sides.

01:18:43.136 --> 01:18:45.010
So on the gravity side,
such a transformation

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:46.293
leads to a new field.

01:18:50.370 --> 01:18:53.530
And this should be dual
to transform the field

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:55.550
on the field theory side.

01:19:06.485 --> 01:19:07.610
AUDIENCE: Which [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:13.392 --> 01:19:14.600
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's right.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.100
Yeah.

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.030
Yeah.

01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.640
That's right.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.560
Now, this is [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.351
This is a boundary.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.020
OK?

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:25.129
But I think, since
this is a symmetry,

01:19:25.129 --> 01:19:27.670
so this transformation of both
symmetries in the field series

01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:32.380
side on the gravity side, that
should have low consequences.

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.680
That should have
low consequence.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.347
That means.

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:39.598
That means.

01:19:57.130 --> 01:20:01.950
And the phi prime, this mu
phi is the boundary value

01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:06.680
of the corresponding
capital phi, OK?

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.674
This should still be the same
because your physics should not

01:20:10.674 --> 01:20:11.590
be changed under this.

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:22.400
So now let me remind you
that phi is a scalar field.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:26.090
In the gravity side,
this is a scalar fields.

01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:27.810
So scalar fields
transform, under such

01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:33.900
a coordinate transformation,
transforms as phi prime,

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.720
X prime, z prime.

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.484
You go to phi x z.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.340
So this is just the
definition of the scalar

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.460
field in the gravity site.

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:53.200
And now let's apply this
to the boundary value.

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.780
Then we find that the phi prime
x, which is a boundary value

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:14.560
capital phi prime, so this
should be equal to that.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.540
So now we use that this relation
of z prime is lambda times Z.

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.280
And this is just equal to that.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.670
So this just becomes lambda
to the delta minus t phi x.

01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:38.190
Clear?

01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:45.990
So now you can just plug
this back into here.

01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:50.620
So there's a factor of
lambda minus delta minus d.

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:56.210
And this comes with a factor of
lambda to the power d and then

01:21:56.210 --> 01:22:01.985
tells you that O prime
x prime equal to lambda

01:22:01.985 --> 01:22:03.266
minus delta O x.

01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:11.530
And we show that this
delta, which appears here,

01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:15.150
or, whatever, here,
is that delta.

01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:17.742
It's the dimension
of the operator.

01:22:17.742 --> 01:22:20.718
AUDIENCE: But in
standard quantization,

01:22:20.718 --> 01:22:22.710
you mentioned that--

01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:25.030
HONG LIU: No, this is a
standard quantization.

01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:29.410
AUDIENCE: A equals 0 in
standard quantization.

01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:32.599
HONG LIU: No, no, we're
talking about the source.

01:22:32.599 --> 01:22:34.390
We're talking about
non-normalizable modes.

01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:36.680
We're not talking about
canonical quantization.

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.638
We're not talking about
canonical quantization.

01:22:38.638 --> 01:22:42.020
We're talking about attending
non-normalizable modes,

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.452
because when we're adding
on such a term to action.

01:22:46.452 --> 01:22:49.368
AUDIENCE: But isn't that a
field operator correspondence?

01:22:49.368 --> 01:22:50.340
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.270
AUDIENCE: Isn't that a field
operator correspondence?

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:54.650
HONG LIU: Yeah, this is.

01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:56.358
AUDIENCE: But these
are non-normalizable.

01:23:00.305 --> 01:23:02.410
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's
what we, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:03.230
Yeah.

01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:05.740
So we're talking about the
non-normalizable modes.

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:08.490
And the non-normalizable
modes corresponding

01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:11.290
to [INAUDIBLE] operator,
and [INAUDIBLE] source

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:14.090
into an operator in
the boundary series.

01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:19.292
And just this relation shows
that delta is this dimension.

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.024
Any other questions?

01:23:26.024 --> 01:23:28.464
AUDIENCE: So then, when
we quantize everything,

01:23:28.464 --> 01:23:31.757
this operator O is dual to
normalizable [INAUDIBLE],

01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:32.590
or non-normalizable?

01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:36.320
HONG LIU: No.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:40.830
Here we are talking
about the question-- here

01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:43.460
we're talking
about this relation

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:47.580
that if there is a boundary
value of capital phi, which

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.310
is this boundary
value, then that's

01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:53.180
corresponding to add such
a term to your Lagrangian.

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.720
And under such a
correspondence, then we

01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:03.030
deduce that this delta is the
dimension of this operators.

01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:04.800
It's the dimension
of this operator.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:08.520
And this is deduced from the
non-normalizable perspective.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:13.910
And in indeed, you
can ask, say, suppose

01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:20.700
I create normalizable
modes using this O,

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.550
whether that is
consistent with that.

01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:26.550
Indeed, that you
can double check.

01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:27.396
Is it clear?

01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:45.477
Anyway, so this is
what we have right now.

01:24:45.477 --> 01:24:47.310
So later, we will discuss
the correspondence

01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:50.040
for the normalizable modes.

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.517
And we worry about later.

01:24:51.517 --> 01:24:53.350
Later, we will talk
about the correspondence

01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:54.530
for normalizable modes.

01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:58.056
And then you will see it's
compatible with this relation.

01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:16.090
So now we find, for scalar,
for a standard quantization,

01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:28.330
for scalar, in the
standard quantization,

01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:32.890
for scalar in the
standard quantization,

01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:35.080
that the dimension
of the operator

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.327
related to the mass
in the gravity side

01:25:38.327 --> 01:25:39.410
by the following relation.

01:25:46.929 --> 01:25:48.762
[INAUDIBLE] to [INAUDIBLE]
by this relation.

01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:56.170
So we have found that
explicit relation

01:25:56.170 --> 01:26:03.134
between the conformal
dimension and the mass.

01:26:08.010 --> 01:26:13.910
So now, let me elaborate a
little bit on this relation.

01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:21.358
So let's consider,
suppose the m equal to 0.

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:30.777
Well, m equal to 0, then you
find the delta equal to d.

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:39.797
So delta equal to d, on
the field theory side,

01:26:39.797 --> 01:26:48.140
this is a marginal
operator, and so we

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.890
see that the massless
field on the gravity side

01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:56.430
is mapped to a
marginal operator.

01:27:00.922 --> 01:27:03.130
So are you familiar with
the terminology of marginal,

01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:04.890
operator, relevant operator?

01:27:04.890 --> 01:27:05.990
Et cetera.

01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.973
Good.

01:27:06.973 --> 01:27:11.810
AUDIENCE: Wait, can you
remind us what is it?

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:13.990
HONG LIU: This is defined
in terms of the RG flow.

01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:16.467
Are you taking the
quantum field theory too?

01:27:16.467 --> 01:27:17.050
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:27:17.050 --> 01:27:18.841
We haven't quite gotten
there. [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:18.841 --> 01:27:22.132
HONG LIU: Yeah, then you
will get there, maybe,

01:27:22.132 --> 01:27:22.840
in a week or two.

01:27:25.182 --> 01:27:27.015
Yeah, certainly by the
end of this semester.

01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:34.420
Yeah, so let me
just say one-- yeah

01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:36.990
I will say a few more words.

01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:39.240
And then you will
see what it means.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:43.040
Yeah, just I will
say a few more words.

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:48.820
Anyway, so will m
squared smaller than 0,

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:49.750
then he is negative.

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:57.030
Then this is d squared
over 4 matter something.

01:27:57.030 --> 01:28:00.220
So that means the delta
is smaller than d.

01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:04.700
When the dimension
of the operator

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:08.020
is smaller than the
spacetime dimension,

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.296
so that, from field
theory, according to you,

01:28:10.296 --> 01:28:16.180
is called the relevant operator.

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:22.360
And now, when m squared
is greater than 0,

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.800
it's mapped to delta
greater than d,

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.950
so this is mapped to
an irrelevant operator.

01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:39.410
AUDIENCE: Why do they
have [INAUDIBLE]?

01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:41.640
HONG LIU: Why do they
have these names?

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.580
Marginal, relevant,
or irrelevant?

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:46.070
Yeah, I will say a
little bit about that.

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:47.946
Just wait one second.

01:28:53.470 --> 01:29:00.590
So now, let's say what this
means from the perspective

01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:01.356
of this relation.

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:11.510
So from the field
series side, we

01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:18.320
have phi x O x mapped into-- so
this phi should be identified

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:23.400
we A. So this is identified
with this term, d minus delta.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.770
OK, leading term.

01:29:31.770 --> 01:29:33.360
OK, so now let me
remind you what

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.806
this marginal and
relevant, irrelevant means.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:48.880
So operator marginal means,
when you add such a term

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.490
to your Lagrangian, the
effect of such a term

01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:54.380
does not change with scale.

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:56.390
So whether you're looking
at a very high energy,

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:58.150
looking at very low
energy, the effect

01:29:58.150 --> 01:30:00.770
does not change very much.

01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:02.940
OK, so that's why it's
called a marginal operator.

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:07.540
So in the regulation group,
there's a very simple scaling

01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:10.310
argument to show that, when
the delta is equal to d,

01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:13.010
and then the effect
of the operator

01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:16.758
does not change with the scale.

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:27.330
In particular, when you go to
the UV, this does not change.

01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:28.330
For a marginal operator.

01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:36.950
When you go UV, say, when you go
to higher and higher energies,

01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:41.980
the effect of these operators
remains the same, roughly.

01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:45.930
So now, we know from
this UV connection,

01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:48.242
UV mapped on the
gravity side to z

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:52.490
goes to 0 means we are
approaching the boundary.

01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:56.390
And now we see, precisely
for d equal to delta,

01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:58.740
this term is actually constant.

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:02.470
So go to smaller and smaller
z, and the effect of this term

01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:03.420
does not change.

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:04.990
It's just a constant.

01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:06.398
So again, does not change.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:15.024
So now, let's look at
the relevant operator.

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:22.380
So the relevant operator,
so in the field theory,

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.180
when you do the RG, the
relevant and the irrelevant

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:33.464
means, whether this term becomes
relevant when you go to the IR.

01:31:33.464 --> 01:31:36.130
By relevant, means that the term
becomes more and more important

01:31:36.130 --> 01:31:39.480
when you to the low energies.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.700
So that means that, for
the relevant operator, when

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:44.320
you go t higher
energies, it becomes

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.580
less and less important.

01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:48.380
By definition, the
relevant operator means,

01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:49.530
when you go to low
energies, it becomes

01:31:49.530 --> 01:31:50.550
more and more important.

01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:52.425
And it means, when you
go to higher energies,

01:31:52.425 --> 01:31:54.220
it become less and
less important.

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:56.390
So it means that,
when you go to UV,

01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:58.700
the relevant operator becomes
less and less important.

01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:09.032
So now, let's look at this side.

01:32:09.032 --> 01:32:10.490
The relevant operator
corresponding

01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:14.070
to delta smaller than d, then
you have a positive power.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.510
And that means, when z goes
to 0, when you go to UV,

01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:23.260
actually, this term goes to 0.

01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:25.520
So this is precisely compatible
with the field theory

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:29.090
behavior we expect when you add
such a term to a Lagrangian.

01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:30.590
And the effect of
such a term should

01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:34.980
be less and less important
when you go to higher energies.

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:38.160
And here, we see a
precise counterpart here.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:47.120
And similarly, now, if you
go through the irrelevant

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:47.680
operator.

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:50.796
Irrelevant means irrelevant
when you go to IR.

01:32:50.796 --> 01:32:53.260
When you go to UV means
more and more important.

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:06.180
So that means-- but here,
when delta is greater than d,

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:09.080
then these here
have elective power.

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.270
So here, goes to
infinity, become

01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:13.580
bigger and bigger
and, indeed, this term

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:16.390
becomes more and more important.

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.200
So we see a very
nice correspondence

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.750
between this behavior
we expect just

01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:26.450
from the ordinary RG and
the behavior of this term

01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:28.300
in the gravity side.

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.500
So this is a very important
self consistency check

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:39.318
of our matching, both of this
relation and of this relation.

01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:56.760
Any questions on this?

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.902
Yes.

01:33:57.902 --> 01:34:00.698
AUDIENCE: What's the
topology of AdS boundary?

01:34:00.698 --> 01:34:01.630
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:03.680
AUDIENCE: What's the
topology of AdS boundary?

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.580
HONG LIU: It's a
Minkowski space.

01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:11.704
AUDIENCE: But it's 5--
it's 5 times something.

01:34:11.704 --> 01:34:13.120
HONG LIU: It is a
Minkowski space.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.880
Boundary of AdS is
just Minkowski space.

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.380
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:27.630
[INAUDIBLE] in RG
why [INAUDIBLE]

01:34:27.630 --> 01:34:30.800
HONG LIU: That take
some story to do.

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.860
Yeah, that you have to do in
the quantum field theory too.

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:44.830
Yeah, but it's very
easy to understand

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:50.810
if you just know a little
bit of free field theory.

01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:52.930
And in the field
theory point of view,

01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:55.610
when the dimension
of this operator

01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:57.950
is smaller than the
dimension of this operator,

01:34:57.950 --> 01:35:00.140
and then this is
dimensional, then this

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.020
has a positive mass dimension.

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:03.969
And this is, like, mass term.

01:35:03.969 --> 01:35:06.010
And the mass term becomes
more and more important

01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:09.374
when you go to lower energies.

01:35:09.374 --> 01:35:11.415
And that's important
because the higher energies.

01:35:11.415 --> 01:35:13.712
Yeah, just from
dimensional analysis.

01:35:13.712 --> 01:35:17.000
Yeah, it takes
maybe five minutes

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.390
to explain very clearly.

01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:21.160
But we don't have
these five minutes.

01:35:26.170 --> 01:35:29.070
OK, so let me just summarize.

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:38.612
So we have this relation.

01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:45.375
Let me maybe just
summarize here.

01:35:45.375 --> 01:35:46.625
So we have the other relation.

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:49.980
So summary.

01:35:56.530 --> 01:36:01.560
So we have phi due
to go to some O.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:08.670
So here, normalizable
modes should

01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:11.879
be considered different
normalizable modes

01:36:11.879 --> 01:36:13.295
corresponding to
different states.

01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:31.532
And here, non-normalizable modes
is mapped to different actions.

01:36:31.532 --> 01:36:33.490
So you have a different
non-normalizable modes,

01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:34.906
then you map to
different actions.

01:36:34.906 --> 01:36:37.010
You map to different series.

01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:40.204
So in other words, map
to different series.

01:36:45.362 --> 01:36:47.320
So when you turn on the
non-normalizable modes,

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.530
you are deforming the theory.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:56.680
So just to elaborate,
just more precisely,

01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:04.500
in the standard
quantization, which

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:17.660
is A modes are non-normalizable,
when the A-modes are

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:21.290
non-normalizable, then A x.

01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:28.035
On the gravity side, is mapped
to this last term on the field

01:37:28.035 --> 01:37:29.900
theory side.

01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:34.560
If you have a non-0 x, A x
mapped to the following term

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.470
in your action.

01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:41.450
And then your mass, we
deduce that this side

01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:45.440
is mapped to the dimension,
give the delta dimension

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.280
of this operator O.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.440
So later we will explain, as
part of this normalizable mode

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.090
story, so this B-- so
A is non-normalizable

01:37:57.090 --> 01:38:00.000
but B is normalizable.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.305
So later, as we will explain,
in the normalizable mode story,

01:38:05.305 --> 01:38:09.660
is the B x here, we
are actually mapped

01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:13.760
to the expectation value of O.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.620
So B is a normalizable
mode, then, actually,

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:19.251
that maps to a
expectation value of O

01:38:19.251 --> 01:38:20.417
in the corresponding states.

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.630
So A mapped to how
you deform the theory,

01:38:27.630 --> 01:38:30.030
and the B just mapped
to the state which

01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:32.190
specify your expectation value.

01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:33.656
So this, we'll see later.

01:38:36.712 --> 01:38:39.170
And in alternative quantization,
you just do it oppositely.

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:50.220
In alternative quantization,
you just switch A and B.

01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:57.520
In alternative quantization,
you just switch A and B.

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:10.770
So now B maps to B x O. And A x
maps to the expectation value.

01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:13.980
And m now maps to d minus delta.

01:39:16.630 --> 01:39:18.990
So now, the dimension of the
operator is d minus delta

01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:21.090
rather than delta.

01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:23.710
So now, because you just
take the different exponents.

01:39:23.710 --> 01:39:26.285
It's the same thing, just
take different exponents.

01:39:26.285 --> 01:39:30.505
So now, the dimension of the
operator is d minus delta.

01:39:34.089 --> 01:39:36.130
So now, let me also make
you some other examples.

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.940
So you can consider
gauge fields.

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:48.780
You can consider, say, a Maxwell
field in the gravity side.

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:52.250
Then that's [INAUDIBLE] dual
to some conserved currents,

01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:55.520
so besides earlier.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:58.079
And then you can
check, then again, you

01:39:58.079 --> 01:40:00.120
just solve the Maxwell
equation, which I will not

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:01.300
have time to do it here.

01:40:04.130 --> 01:40:07.020
But I may ask you to
do it in your p set.

01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:09.880
It said A mu as z
goes to infinity

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.960
becomes-- so the path of
A parallel to the boundary

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.970
goes to a constant.

01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:17.780
There's no z.

01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:23.010
It's really a constant plus
b mu some number to the z

01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:23.990
to the d minus 2.

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:32.050
So this is a leading behavior
in the case of the vector field.

01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:34.320
So using the very
similar scaling argument

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.410
I was doing there,
you can deduce

01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:42.780
that the operator due to A
must have dimension d minus 1.

01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:45.370
This I will leave to
you as an exercise.

01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:49.100
Just exactly parallel
statement for the scalar case.

01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:53.000
And with this symptotic
behavior, you can show,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.660
just using the
argument, you can show

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:58.790
that the operator dual to A
must have dimension d minus 1.

01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:04.335
And this is precisely
the dimension

01:41:04.335 --> 01:41:07.420
a conserved current must have.

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.520
So conserved current
because it's conserved.

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:14.052
So its dimension, it's
actually protected.

01:41:14.052 --> 01:41:15.760
So no matter in what
kind of interaction,

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.718
no matter in what kind
of case, you always have

01:41:17.718 --> 01:41:20.580
the same dimension d minus 1.

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:23.650
So this precisely
agrees with that.

01:41:23.650 --> 01:41:24.833
So do you understand why?

01:41:29.890 --> 01:41:31.900
AUDIENCE: Why.

01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:33.570
HONG LIU: Yeah, the
reason is simple.

01:41:33.570 --> 01:41:42.186
It's just because j0,
the dimension of the j0.

01:41:42.186 --> 01:41:43.560
You can understand
the following.

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:46.115
The j0 is the charge density.

01:41:46.115 --> 01:41:47.990
And the charge density
charge, by definition,

01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:49.780
does not have a dimension.

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:52.670
And by definition the
density will always

01:41:52.670 --> 01:41:55.670
have a dimension
minus 1, d minus 1.

01:41:55.670 --> 01:41:57.777
And then the other
components, they just

01:41:57.777 --> 01:41:58.902
follow by the conservation.

01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:08.886
Yes, so, indeed, this is, again,
this is a consistency check.

01:42:08.886 --> 01:42:10.260
AUDIENCE: So for
this case, there

01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:12.084
is no choice of quantization?

01:42:12.084 --> 01:42:14.500
HONG LIU: Yeah, there's no
choice for quantization, right.

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:21.412
Actually, in AdS four, in
some special dimensions,

01:42:21.412 --> 01:42:23.120
you can also do a
different quantization.

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:26.810
But the story is a
little bit subtle.

01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:30.740
In some special dimensions,
sometimes you can do it.

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:36.080
Yeah, in AdS four, you can do
a different boundary condition.

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.530
So now let me also
mention the stress tensor,

01:42:38.530 --> 01:42:41.764
which is the other
important one.

01:42:41.764 --> 01:42:43.430
And we mentioned that
the stress tensor,

01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:52.730
which is due to the perturbation
of the metric component.

01:42:52.730 --> 01:42:58.170
So if you write the AdS
metric as some function times

01:42:58.170 --> 01:43:04.330
dz squared plus g
mu mu dx mu dx mu,

01:43:04.330 --> 01:43:06.190
so this is the part
of the metric parallel

01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:12.460
to the boundary,
then we discussed,

01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:15.110
last time, if g mu mu goes
to the boundary as something

01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:22.980
like this, then eta mu mu
plus some perturbation,

01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:27.060
then that means that, in
the field theory site,

01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:32.540
you're turning on a stress
tensor perturbation.

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:35.080
So that's what we
argued last time.

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:42.590
If the boundary value of
your [INAUDIBLE] metric, say,

01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:48.874
is perturbed, away from
the Minkowski metric,

01:43:48.874 --> 01:43:51.165
then corresponding from the
field theory point of view,

01:43:51.165 --> 01:43:54.100
we turn on a source
for the stress tensor.

01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.840
So again, by using
this relation,

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.620
you can deduce that
the stress tensor must

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:03.890
have dimension, the
corresponding operator must

01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:05.530
have dimension d.

01:44:05.530 --> 01:44:07.910
Again, this gives you
exercise for yourself.

01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:10.850
And again, that is
precisely the stress tensor.

01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:12.850
The dimension should
satisfy that stress tensor.

01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:14.120
And again, because
the stress tensor

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:15.650
is a conserved
current et cetera,

01:44:15.650 --> 01:44:17.875
always, no matter in what
kind of series always

01:44:17.875 --> 01:44:18.583
have dimension d.

01:44:24.450 --> 01:44:26.780
So now, after I have
discussed this relation,

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:30.790
let's now discuss how to compute
the correlation functions.

01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:45.580
So let's discuss how to
compute correlation functions.

01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:49.540
So the basic observable
in the field theory,

01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:52.330
even more so in the
conformal field theory,

01:44:52.330 --> 01:44:55.010
is just correlation
functions of local operators.

01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:57.450
It's an important part
of the [INAUDIBLE].

01:44:57.450 --> 01:44:59.180
And in the field
theory, typically,

01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:01.690
when we can see the correlation
function of local operators,

01:45:01.690 --> 01:45:04.305
we use something called a
generating function, though.

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:10.410
I hope you're
familiar with this.

01:45:10.410 --> 01:45:16.530
Say, again, in the
rating function,

01:45:16.530 --> 01:45:18.957
though-- so now let's
consider Euclidean,

01:45:18.957 --> 01:45:20.206
which is a little bit simpler.

01:45:23.857 --> 01:45:26.440
So essentially, it's a Euclidean
creating correlation function

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.593
by adding such a term
to your field theory.

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:41.350
And if you want to calculate
correlation functions of O,

01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:43.710
then just take
derivative with phi

01:45:43.710 --> 01:45:45.730
and then satisfy equal to 0.

01:45:45.730 --> 01:45:47.620
Then you get the
correlation function of O.

01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:49.161
So I hope you are
familiar with this.

01:45:54.110 --> 01:45:59.710
so here, you should think of
phi and O as just some, really,

01:45:59.710 --> 01:46:02.140
I have a collection of
all possible operators,

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.930
even though I just
write the single one.

01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:07.100
You should think of them as a
collection of all operators.

01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:09.470
You can put anything
here, stress

01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:11.900
tensor, conserved current,
any scalar operator,

01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:12.650
any spin operator.

01:46:12.650 --> 01:46:14.024
Yeah, you can put
anything there.

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:25.210
So in a simpler
situation, you just

01:46:25.210 --> 01:46:27.740
don't turn on any operator.

01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:32.199
You just take phi equal to 0.

01:46:32.199 --> 01:46:33.490
So this is a simpler situation.

01:46:33.490 --> 01:46:36.870
Then you just have the
partition function.

01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:39.500
So this correlation function is
defined by the Euclidean path

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.067
integral, for example.

01:46:41.067 --> 01:46:43.400
And you just insert this in
the Euclidean path integral.

01:46:46.412 --> 01:46:48.870
And when phi is equal to 0,
this is just the Euclidean path

01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:51.242
integral.

01:46:51.242 --> 01:46:53.200
And this is just gives
you a partition function

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:56.580
of the whole system.

01:46:56.580 --> 01:47:00.470
And since we believe
the duality should be 2,

01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:02.090
then this partition
function should

01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:03.360
be exactly the same
as the partition

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:04.568
function on the gravity side.

01:47:08.199 --> 01:47:09.740
Suppose you can
compute the partition

01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.079
function from the gravity side.

01:47:11.079 --> 01:47:12.120
Then it must be the same.

01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:15.820
Otherwise, there's
no equivalence.

01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:18.150
So this is the partition
function of the gravity side.

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.830
So these have to be true.

01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:42.830
So now, with this
relation, again, we

01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:46.340
are right in the heuristic
form that some operator O

01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:50.820
is due to some [INAUDIBLE] phi.

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:56.180
And the source for the O is due
to the boundary value of phi--

01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:58.382
again, I write in
the heuristic form.

01:47:58.382 --> 01:47:59.840
So the boundary
value of phi should

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.300
be understood in that limit.

01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:08.760
Because of this,
then that means we

01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:19.730
must have-- if we turn on
a [INAUDIBLE] or a phi,

01:48:19.730 --> 01:48:22.480
deforming the
series by this phi,

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:25.890
the mass corresponding to the
gravity side of the partition

01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:33.460
function, with this phi,
have the boundary value

01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:36.370
given by phi.

01:48:36.370 --> 01:48:44.720
Then it must be the same
because we have identified

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.770
turning on the boundary value
to turning on the operator,

01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:53.660
turning on this thing
in the field series.

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:58.880
So we have now
related the generating

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:04.450
functional to the
gravity partition

01:49:04.450 --> 01:49:06.430
function with some
non-normalizable boundary

01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:06.930
conditions.

01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:25.370
So, in general, give
me one more minute.

01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:30.387
So in general, this
equation is actually empty

01:49:30.387 --> 01:49:32.595
because we don't know how
to define the gravity site.

01:49:36.190 --> 01:49:38.920
Full quantum gravity
partition function.

01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:40.870
What are you talking about?

01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:43.340
If you don't know
how to do that.

01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:56.590
But we know how to compute this
guy in the semiclassical limit,

01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:58.981
which is the string
coupling goes to 0,

01:49:58.981 --> 01:50:00.480
and the other prime
goes to 0 limit.

01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:09.270
So in this limit,
we can just write

01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:14.060
the gravity path in
function, essentially

01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:16.812
as the Euclidean path integral
of all gravity fields.

01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:21.750
Again, I'm using
this heuristic form

01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:23.083
to write the boundary condition.

01:50:23.083 --> 01:50:25.135
But it should be
understood in that form.

01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:31.520
And again, I'm by
integrating over phi,

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.354
you should imagine integrating
of all gravity fields.

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:44.030
So now, in the limit, so
this SE is proportional to 1

01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:47.610
over kappa squared, which
is the Newton constant.

01:50:47.610 --> 01:50:49.790
So in the semiclassical
limit, in this limit,

01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:52.542
the kappa squared goes to 0.

01:50:52.542 --> 01:50:54.500
So you can actually
evaluate this path integral

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:55.958
using the site
point approximation.

01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:11.200
So as the leading
order, so this gravity

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.240
can actually be evaluated.

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.650
So leading order in the
semiclassical limit,

01:51:15.650 --> 01:51:18.130
you can just evaluate it by
site point approximation,

01:51:18.130 --> 01:51:20.950
then this is just given by SE.

01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:35.130
Evaluate it as a
classical solution

01:51:35.130 --> 01:51:38.350
which satisfies the appropriate
boundary conditions.

01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:42.320
So that means,
actually, in this limit,

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:46.170
we can actually evaluate
this explicitly.

01:51:46.170 --> 01:51:47.660
And the nice thing
is, as we said

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:49.330
before, the semiclassical
limit actually

01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:54.200
corresponding to the [INAUDIBLE]
limit in the field theory.

01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:58.480
So we can actually
compute explicitly

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.540
the generating functional
in the [INAUDIBLE]

01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:03.510
of the limit over
the field theory.

01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:05.060
So let's stop here.

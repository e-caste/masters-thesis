WEBVTT

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.390
PHILIP GREENSPUN: We're going
to talk about meteorology.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.240
So as pilots, we're just trying
to understand the basics.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.280
And in terms of
passing the exam,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.340
you don't need to
be a physicist.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.210
You just mostly
are trying to learn

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.060
stuff that will help you fly
within the VFR weather minimums

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.230
and predict when those minimums
aren't likely to be met

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.990
or when there's going to
be really serious hazards,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.550
such as thunderstorms.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.160
All right, this
will be on the test.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.620
You have to memorize
all of this.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.710
Well, you kind of do.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.530
Anyways, they want you--

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.310
you will have to learn some
of this stuff for the exam.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.730
In reality around here,
almost all airspace

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.380
is at least class echo.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.680
That's controlled airspace.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.880
It means controllers
could give you a clearance

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.180
to fly on instruments
and separate you

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.340
from other aircraft.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.500
So they want you to be
well separated from clouds,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.870
1,000 feet above, 500 feet
underneath, 2,000 horizontally.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.700
That way, if an aircraft under
IFR comes out of the clouds,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.550
there'll be some time
for the two of you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.740
to see and avoid each other.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.960
You can see the weather minimums
are different in class Golf

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.150
airspace.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.670
And, actually, in
uncontrolled airspace

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.870
like up in Alaska, if you're
flying on instruments,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.200
you don't have a clearance.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.170
So you'll say, well,
how is that possible?

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.462
You can be instrument rated,
have an instrument capable

00:01:54.462 --> 00:01:57.633
airplane, and fly from airport
to airport in the clouds.

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:00.300
But the air traffic controllers,
they can't give you a clearance

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.450
and guarantee you separation
from other aircraft

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.830
because they don't have radar.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.288
They don't even
have the authority.

00:02:06.288 --> 00:02:08.610
It's not controlled airspace.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.190
I've done some flying up
there in little airplanes,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.780
and you have to be very patient.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.780
Another interesting thing
to notice about this--

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.850
we'll talk about it
more again later--

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.250
is notice how class
Bravo airspace

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.140
has lower minimums than
ordinary class Echo airspace.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.237
So we have to be 1,000
feet from the clouds here.

00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:32.070
Here we just have to
be clear of the clouds.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.340
Why are the minimums reduced
right around Logan Airport

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.558
and JFK and LAX than they are--

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:44.808
AUDIENCE: Because everyone's
in contact with the tower

00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:47.178
so the tower knows
where everyone is.

00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:48.720
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Yeah, great answer.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.720
So her answer is that
air traffic control

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.840
is in contact with everybody
in class Bravo airspace

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.183
and knows where they are.

00:02:56.183 --> 00:02:57.600
And in fact, they're
on clearances

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.042
in class Bravo airspace, so
they're being told what to do.

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:00.750
Fly this heading.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.860
Fly that heading.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.490
Maintain this altitude.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.740
Great answer.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.260
All right, so how do we know
if the weather minimums are

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.120
going to be maintained?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.010
Let's talk about weather theory.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.670
So raise your hand if
you're a science major here

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.570
as opposed to engineering?

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.210
Where are the smart scientists?

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.660
All right, Francis.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.930
So the science
approach to this task

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:34.160
would be to say if we could just
assume that humans are only 4

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.970
inches tall, then we could build
some really great aircraft.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.120
And we'll get into
that in a moment.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.100
Just think about that.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.570
If you're a scientist,
how much flexibility

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.440
can you have compared
to being an engineer?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.960
All right, so let's look at
the atmosphere that we do have.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.920
Mostly, the troposphere
tops out around 40,000 feet

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.140
according to this chart.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.200
And that's where most
of the water vapor

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.500
is and, therefore, most
of the weather, also

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.650
the higher temperatures.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.630
You can see it actually does
get warm again way up high

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.940
in the thermosphere.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.500
This is in kilometers
on the left.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.550
So you can see that part of the
earth that we're flying through

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.280
is really just, I don't know,
probably around 20 kilometers

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.110
and down.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.990
What did I say?

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.690
Said he could go up to
65,000 feet in this F-22.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.820
So that's what?

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.830
That's a little over 10 miles.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.110
Yeah, it's about 20 kilometers,
somewhere in that neighborhood.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.850
Anyway, so not too many
people are going higher

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.370
than just the bottom 0
through 20 on this chart.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.580
All right, who's concerned
about global inequality?

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.140
Raise your hand.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.440
Awesome.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.930
Well, you'll be pleased to
know that so is the FAA.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:17.550
And this figure here shows you
why it's warmer at the equator

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.130
than up at the North Pole.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.880
There's the same amount--

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.630
we're missing a little bit
of tilt here, but that's OK.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.090
There's the same amount of
incoming solar radiation,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.815
but it gets spread out over
a larger portion of the earth

00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:31.565
up near the poles.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.350
All right, so this is where
guys like Francis have it easy.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.510
If you want to
understand something,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.670
you just say, well, you
know, I've got an earth,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.400
and it's pretty much the
same as the existing earth.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.810
It just doesn't have
any water on it.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.800
And it doesn't
rotate, and it's not

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.270
tilted with respect to the sun.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.977
So now I'll do my analysis.

00:05:58.977 --> 00:06:00.060
And I'll publish my paper.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.640
And I'll get tenure, and
your problem is solved.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.020
Let's see.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.270
What would happen here?

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.700
In a non-rotating,
non-tilted waterless earth,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.700
it would get hotter
at the equator,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.340
and the air would
rise up from the heat.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.710
So we can see that here.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.760
So we would have low pressure
right there at the equator.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.850
And then the air
would circulate up,

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.736
and we would have high
pressure up at the polls.

00:06:28.736 --> 00:06:31.206
Does that makes
sense to everybody?

00:06:31.206 --> 00:06:32.760
All right, great,
problem solved.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.160
We can go home.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.940
Unfortunately, as
engineers, we have

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.130
to deal with the real
world a little bit more.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.540
So if we're spinning
around the Earth,

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.150
We're going to end up
with these three cells

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.220
and in each hemisphere.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.830
And in this case,
you end up still

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.140
with a low pressure
at the equator.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.530
But then you get a high pressure
with all the air sinking down

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.700
here.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.440
And you get still low pressure--

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.770
you still get high pressure up
at the polls and low pressure

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.310
down here.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.200
See if I got that right.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.000
High.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.200
I should be high.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.725
It says high pressure
at 30 degrees North.

00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:27.100
Oh yeah, high,
high, that's good.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.260
And, yes, and low and low.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.480
All right, we got that right.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.626
It gets more
confusing as you see.

00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:37.750
OK, so the
circulation-- one thing

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.400
that the FAA wants
you to know is

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.670
that it's heat exchange
that drives the weather.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.120
So the weather is basically a
function of the sun heating up

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.080
the earth.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.270
And then it's not
uniform, so the heat

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.320
gets pushed from one part
of the earth to another.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.890
And all of this
unequal heating is

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.060
responsible for the
altimeter varying,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.000
for wind blowing around.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.540
Pretty much every phenomenon
that is of interest to pilots

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.730
is caused by heat trying
to move from the hotter

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.030
parts of the earth to the
colder parts of the earth.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.020
We'll talk a little
bit more about these.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.870
But notice there's
parts of the earth

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.520
that are windier than others.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.580
Unfortunately, we're in
one of the windier parts.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:33.140
OK, so you also have to know as
a pilot just what an isobar is.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.980
That's a line of equal pressure.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.130
And that tells you--

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.539
that gives you an idea of how
the wind is going to move.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.770
We'll see that in a minute.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.600
The tighter the isobars,
the more dramatic

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.720
the pressure change in a region.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.330
And it's the pressure
gradient force

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.240
that's causing the wind
to flow from the high

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.610
to the low pressure.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.150
So you might think
on this chart,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.460
for example, that wherever
you see an L and an H

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.370
that you would just draw a
vector of wind from one place

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.110
to the other, right?

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.950
That kind of makes sense.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:19.410
However, there is
Coriolis force.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.232
This is for Francis,
the science major.

00:09:21.232 --> 00:09:22.440
Francis, what course are you?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.328
AUDIENCE: I'm course
9, so [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:29.250
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Oh.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.210
All right, so scientists
wear lab coats.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.980
Coriolis force is a fake
news force formerly known

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.194
as fictitious.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.820
So you can see they're
throwing the ball straight.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.060
But because they're on
a rotating platform,

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.430
it's apparently curving.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.680
So camera is mounted
to the ground,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.360
and we'll see the
ball going straight.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.786
They're going to draw you a
little dash line at one point

00:10:08.786 --> 00:10:11.040
so you can see the path
is actually straight.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.815
So the ball has an inertia.

00:10:18.815 --> 00:10:20.190
Basically, once
it's launched, it

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.800
wants to keep doing
whatever it was doing.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.600
And this guy's white
lab coated colleague

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.730
just moves away from
where the ball was going.

00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:39.556
Whoa.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.010
All right, everybody's got that?

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.510
That's Coriolis force for you.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.620
What happens when we
do this on the earth?

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.400
So think about it.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.260
You have a parcel
of air that's moving

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.430
with the earth at the equator.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.300
If you displace it up
to a higher latitude,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.230
it still has that velocity.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.690
But now the Earth
isn't spinning as fast.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:19.060
So it ends up essentially moving
a little bit to the right.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.355
That is the fundamental insight
just as you saw in that video.

00:11:22.355 --> 00:11:24.730
You'll have to go home and
think about that a little bit.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.240
But, basically, I think
the most effective way

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.150
to think about it is just
that a parcel of air that

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.180
was the equator wants to keep
moving as if it were still

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.460
at the equator, but
it's not there anymore,

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.170
so it moves relative to
the underlying earth.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.420
If you combine the Coriolis
force and the pressure

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.050
gradient, then you get
the actual wind direction.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.350
And the trend as seen here--

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.240
eventually, there's
so much Coriolis force

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.640
over so much time
that the wind actually

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.495
moves exactly 90 degrees to
where you think it should move.

00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:08.920
It flows along the isobars
instead of perpendicular

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.520
across them.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.280
So there you have a
couple pressure systems

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.360
and you see that the wind is
circulating around these lows

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.890
and highs rather than flowing
directly from one to the other

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:24.670
as you'd expect.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:35.180
All right, who would like to
become a helicopter test pilot?

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.970
Raise your hand if that
sounds like a fun job.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.900
OK, so when you're developing
the manual for your Sikorsky

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.270
helicopter, you've
got to go somewhere

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.670
where the wind is calm.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.340
Where would you all
suggest going now

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.693
that you've seen this chart?

00:12:51.693 --> 00:12:52.610
What's your name, sir?

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.260
Sorry.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.020
AUDIENCE: Jeremy.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.560
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Jeremy,
where do you want to go?

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.550
You're going to take
your Sikorsky helicopter

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.967
and you're going
to write the POH.

00:12:59.967 --> 00:13:01.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Florida.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.390
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Florida.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.810
Sikorsky, which is
headquartered in Connecticut,

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.760
they have a big
flight test facility.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.340
I believe it's in Palm Beach.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.355
So there you have it.

00:13:12.355 --> 00:13:15.200
They thought just along
the same lines as you,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.540
and they'll be in
the horse latitudes.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.150
There's a whole bunch of--

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.520
nobody really knows why it's
called the horse latitudes.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.862
One idea is that the ships--

00:13:24.862 --> 00:13:26.570
since there's no wind
in those latitudes,

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.340
they have to find a
current, and then they

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.950
get pulled along by the current
as if they were on a horse.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.710
All right, surface friction
is a little bit complicated.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.770
It tends to drag down the wind.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:44.060
You'll have to study this
vector diagram on your own.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.300
But, really, from the
FAA's point of view,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.130
they just want
you to know mostly

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:53.920
that the wind 2,000
or 3,000 feet up is

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.200
going to be different from
the wind on the surface.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.020
Because of surface
friction, it will

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.046
be less intense and in a
slightly different direction.

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:06.650
OK, vertical
circulation of the air.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.940
I think you're going to be OK
if you just remember that warmer

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.575
air is lighter than colder air.

00:14:12.575 --> 00:14:14.450
That's all that you
pretty much need to know.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.640
OK, local wind patterns.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:26.250
If you heat up the shore line,
the air will rise off the shore

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.930
and pull in air from the
ocean during the daytime

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.840
so you get that sea breeze.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.808
And then at nighttime,
the opposite happens,

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:35.850
so you get a land breeze.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.980
So there are some of these
predictable local weather

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:39.480
patterns.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.990
The bigger ones have to do
with atmospheric stability.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.430
If you have a stable
atmosphere, meaning

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.120
that a displaced parcel of air
tends to get pushed back down

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:02.390
to wherever it was, then you get
these weather characteristics

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.480
where you're not going to be
bumped around in your aircraft.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.360
You're going to
have trouble seeing,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.000
and you're going to see clouds
that are basically flat,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.670
these stratiform clouds here
that you see on the right.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.740
If it rains, it's just
going to rain all day.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.500
It's going to be a typical
miserable New England

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.910
day where it rains all the
time, or Seattle, I guess,

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.130
is like that as well.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.620
Well, what about if
the air once displaced

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.350
tends to want to
keep being displaced?

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.870
If it rises up a little
bit, it keeps rising.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.840
Then you have these clouds
with vertical development.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.182
And the good news is
you can see really well.

00:15:42.182 --> 00:15:44.390
You're not going to have an
obstruction to visibility

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.720
unless you're in heavy rain.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.810
And the rain won't be
all day, every day.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.930
It'll be showery, but
it'll be very turbulent

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.750
if you get into that
cloud or maybe right

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.955
underneath that cloud.

00:15:58.955 --> 00:16:07.200
OK, what about the
profile of the atmosphere?

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.470
Let's have a look at this.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.210
So on the right--

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.640
I wonder if this is
actually my newest

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.840
version of the presentation.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.010
We'll see.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.840
I corrected an error.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.380
On the right, you can see that
for every 1,000 feet you go up.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.230
So we go from 0
to 1,000 feet up.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.060
The temperature is gone
from 18 Celsius to 15,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.450
so it's lapsed by 3 degrees.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.981
And the dew point has gone
down by half a degree.

00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:37.400
Does that makes sense?

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.070
The air goes up,
it's lower pressure.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.270
This is called an
adiabatic process.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.710
I was not a chemistry
major, but I

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.240
think that means that we're
not adding or taking away

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.530
heat from the air.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.980
We're just moving it.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.530
So the temperature
and dew point spread,

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.240
actually does get narrower.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.780
You can see as we rise up to
5,000 feet that the spread has

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.380
gone down to 2 and 1/2 degrees
because the dew point is not

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.529
falling nearly as fast as
the overall temperature.

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:11.404
Does that make sense?

00:17:11.404 --> 00:17:14.990
So I think this conceivably
could be an FAA test

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:21.430
question that the dry adiabatic
lapse rate is 3 degrees.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:26.589
OK, then the moist air is
lapsing only at 2 degrees.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:32.690
So this figure shows you
going from 0 to 1,000 feet,

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.500
and from 1 to 2,000
feet, we were dropping

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.830
3 degrees per thousand feet.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:44.070
After that, we're dropping only
2 degrees per thousand feet.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.790
And once the temperature
dew point spread goes to 0,

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.050
that's when a cloud happens.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.900
So the air can't hold
anymore water vapor.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:58.320
And when the temperature
and dew point meet,

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.055
the water vapor
turns into water,

00:18:00.055 --> 00:18:03.200
and now you've got a cloud.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.690
All right, so you might
ask yourself, well,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.540
why is this air moving at all?

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.130
Why does it start moving?

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.380
One thing that can start it
moving is a mountain range.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.090
So the air gets pushed
by a wind coming

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:23.050
from the left side of the slide
up the top of the mountain.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:27.760
And at that point, it will
condense into a cloud.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.000
Just let you absorb that
cloud here for a minute.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.880
Notice also that
relative humidity is just

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.340
another way of stating the
temperature dew point spread.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.880
So here temperature and
dew point are pretty close,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.400
10 and 15 or 15 and 10.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.010
So we've got relative
humidity of 80%.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.610
Over here, they're
quite far apart.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.760
The temperature is 23, and
the dew point is minus 2.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.790
So the relative humidity is low.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.270
OK, you've heard that there's
a cold front coming in

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.040
and we have all
these thunderstorms.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.790
Well, this is why.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.490
The cold air is denser
than the warm air.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.980
So it pushes the warm air up.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.490
And at that point, you
get clouds forming,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.860
and you get thunderstorms
all along the line

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.860
of the cold front.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.230
OK, so what if you
have stable air?

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.370
Let's have a look at this.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.750
You end up--

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.160
Let's see.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:46.390
We've gone from 0, to
1, to 2, and we're only

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.370
dropping-- actually,
we're not dropping at all.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.328
And then we're back up.

00:19:49.328 --> 00:19:50.590
This is an inversion.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.350
OK, so, basically,
the air temperature

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.780
is pretty constant as we go up.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:11.260
So if a parcel of air rises
up into the atmosphere,

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.330
it's not going to be warmer
than the surrounding air,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:20.340
so it doesn't want
to keep rising.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.920
OK, what if it's unstable?

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.740
So look at this by contrast.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.210
The environmental
air temperature

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.790
is lapsing at a higher
than standard rate.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.250
It's going down 4 degrees
Celsius per thousand feet.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.810
And this parcel of air
that was in equilibrium

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:49.120
down at sea level is still
warmer than the surrounding

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.340
air, and, therefore, it
wants to keep rising.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.720
Does that make sense?

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.030
So, basically, if it goes up
and it wants to keep going up,

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.090
that's unstable and
a perfect situation

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.950
for forming thunderstorms,
which we'll talk about shortly.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.520
Temperature inversion like
we saw on that earlier slide

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.560
where it was actually a
little bit warmer here,

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:21.310
that tends to keep
air where it is,

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.470
and, therefore, you end
up with poor visibility

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.660
and haze because
all the stuff that's

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.430
obscuring your visibility
is just staying

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.833
underneath the inversion.

00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:30.250
It's kind of a
common phenomenon I

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.800
think in some of these
basins like Los Angeles.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.035
Talk about an inversion,
and ordinary people

00:21:36.035 --> 00:21:38.410
think about that, and hear
that term, and worry about it.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.680
Most frequently-- you're going
to I think see this on a test

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.570
maybe--

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:53.350
is phenomena having to do with
the ground radiating back heat

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.440
into the atmosphere or
into space at night.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.990
Tends to make the
ground cold and the air

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.560
right next to the ground cold,
whereas the air just slightly

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.750
higher than that, a
couple thousand feet up,

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.430
hasn't changed the
temperature too much.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:12.400
So the terrestrial radiation
on a clear still night

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.400
can cause a
temperature inversion.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.380
We talked about this earlier
when the temperature and dew

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:26.130
point meet, and that's when
the water vapor will condense.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.030
Frost.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:32.740
When the dew point
is below freezing

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:38.190
and you have a surface that's
cold, then you will get--

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.860
maybe it's cold because
it radiated its heat

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.260
back out into space
at night, for example.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.260
That's when you
get frost forming.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.630
And you want to definitely
clear that off your aircraft

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.580
before you go anywhere
because it messes

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.080
with the smooth flow of the air,
so the wing becomes much less

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.220
efficient even if the shape
hasn't changed that much.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.095
All right, let's look
at the kinds of clouds.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:14.520
You've got basically--
the prefix to the cloud

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.630
tells you what height it is.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.360
And then the second
part of the word

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.930
tells you kind of the
shape of the cloud.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.430
So I'll just let you
absorb this a little bit.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:34.460
If it says nimbo, yeah,
cumulonimbus or nimbostratus,

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.550
that means it's raining.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:42.260
Towering cumulus is bad
if they talk about that.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.790
And cumulonimbus is the worst.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.620
That's just another fancier
way of saying thunderstorm.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.580
OK, so here's your
Latin lesson for today.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.200
Unfortunately, I
didn't study Latin.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.890
It would have been
nice when I went

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.810
to Peru to be able
to communicate

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:05.060
with the locals
in Latin America.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.320
OK, that wasn't funny I guess.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:18.320
If you have low clouds, the
main hazard to worry about

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.180
is the icing.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.800
If the water is supercooled,
that's the worst.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.717
You can usually get
a forecast of that.

00:24:27.717 --> 00:24:29.300
You'll get AIRMETs
for icing, and they

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.545
might talk about supercooled
water is a hazard.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.720
I guess this might
be an exam question.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.850
Stratus clouds form when moist,
stable air flows upslope.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:49.310
But just remember stable
usually means the flat clouds,

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.740
stratiform clouds.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.745
And unstable is where you
get the cumuliform clouds.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.230
So same deal.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.880
Those altocumulus
are going to be

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:13.690
much more turbulent and probably
more severe icing potential.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:19.390
The high clouds-- it's so
cold in the high atmosphere

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.720
that the maximum amount of
water that can be stored

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.570
is pretty low,
and, therefore, you

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.780
don't tend to get
ice when it's below

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.260
say minus 15 degrees Celsius.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.110
There just isn't a whole lot
of moisture to begin with.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.910
OK, so this is
what as a GA pilot

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.608
you're more likely to
have to worry about.

00:25:44.608 --> 00:25:46.650
You're probably not going
to be up at 25,000 feet

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.360
in your Piper Warrior.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:57.038
But you could be
underneath a cumulus cloud.

00:25:57.038 --> 00:25:58.830
I will tell you that
if you have passengers

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.470
and there is low cumulus
clouds, you desperately

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.860
want to get above those.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.700
So let's say there's a bunch
of cumulus clouds at 4,000

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.290
or 5,000 feet.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.500
You can climb probably
to 8,000 or 10,000 feet

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.120
in a light airplane, and
that'll be much, much smoother.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.470
So as soon as you get
above the cumulus clouds,

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.750
that's where the air
tends to smooth out,

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.180
and it'll be much
more comfortable.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.730
But if it's a towering
cumulus cloud,

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:29.130
they may go up to as high as
60,000 feet down in Texas.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.660
And you really
can't get over them

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:36.870
in anything short of an
SR-71 or maybe last as F-22.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:41.970
Even the latest Gulfstreams
only go to 51,000, I believe.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.750
OK, so thunderstorms
are the worst hazard.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.700
Even the airliners get in
trouble and thunderstorms

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:55.790
with hail smashing into the
windshield and turbulence that

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.930
can bend stuff.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:08.500
So how do you predict
if you're flying along--

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.580
well, if you're preparing
to go on a flight,

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.788
how do you predict where
the clouds are likely to be?

00:27:12.788 --> 00:27:16.130
One thing you do is look at the
temperature dew point spread.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:21.255
The FAA tells you to use a lapse
rate of 2.5 degrees Celsius

00:27:21.255 --> 00:27:22.880
to figure out where
the clouds will be.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:28.240
So if there is a 10 degree
temperature dew point spread,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.740
then you should expect
the clouds to have

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.480
a base at about 4,000 feet.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.780
There's a typo in the slide.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.760
Sorry about that.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.340
I thought we had the new
version in the Dropbox.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:42.590
The temperature lapses at 3
for the dry adiabatic air.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:43.590
You remember that?

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:45.415
And the dew point's at 0.5.

00:27:45.415 --> 00:27:46.790
So if we go back
to that figure--

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.690
I think it was our-- yeah.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.640
Yeah, if we go back
here, you remember this?

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.530
We went from 18, to 15, to 12.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:05.260
And the dew point, meanwhile,
is falling from 3, to 2 and 1/2,

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.430
to 2.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:07.270
So that's why.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.060
It's 2.5 as a rule of thumb.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.300
That's not great, but
you can actually--

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.843
Just look at METARs
around the country,

00:28:19.843 --> 00:28:21.760
and I think you will see
because they give you

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.130
the basis of the clouds
and the ceilings.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.260
I think you usually
will see that it's

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:31.810
reasonably close to this formula
but almost never spot on.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:38.620
OK, this is worth studying.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.300
I'm not going to cover
it completely here.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.540
But some of these
are exam questions.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.420
Advection fog-- I
think I remember

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.590
they like to ask about that,
when the warm moist air moves

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:55.253
over a cool surface
along coastlines.

00:28:55.253 --> 00:28:56.420
So I think that makes sense.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.520
Maybe that's what they're
having in California

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.650
a lot of the time.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:05.455
They have the fog over
the coastal areas.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.810
And radiation fog-- also,
in the Western deserts,

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.850
oftentimes, there's
fog in the morning.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:23.160
So I think you're advection fog
would be a coastal phenomenon.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.520
And the radiation
fog, something they

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:32.750
can have in a place like
Arizona or Palm Springs.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.610
OK, the FAA loves this.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.880
If you see ice pellets, you
probably shouldn't be flying.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.110
But they want you to know that
if you do see ice pellets,

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.260
how did they arrive?

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.050
Well, they had to be
freezing rain up higher.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.360
So don't climb in hopes
of getting out of the ice

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.050
pellets because then you'll have
freezing rain on your airplane

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.960
which is probably the worst
kind of icing-related hazard.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.170
OK, airmasses.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.790
You can just have a look here.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.460
If you hear that there's
a polar airmass coming in,

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.800
it's going to be cold,
not too exciting.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.890
Might be a question.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.650
Fronts, they do
want you to see--

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.970
be able to read
one of these maps.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:25.910
They may occasionally
asked you a question.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.090
So one thing to remember
is the cold front

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.260
has the pointy
spikes like icicles.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.140
So if you can remember
that, you'll be pretty good.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.410
There's a cold front.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:44.690
Again, you can just read this
and study it at your leisure.

00:30:48.115 --> 00:30:49.740
I guess they might
want you to remember

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:54.950
that the front is the boundary
between two air masses.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.560
OK.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.440
Here's a typical
drawing where they'll

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.420
show you the cold fronts
and the warm fronts.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.188
When there is a
front, how do you

00:31:05.188 --> 00:31:06.730
know when the front
has gone through?

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.000
Well, the temperature's
changed and the wind's changed,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.750
simple as that.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:18.250
Here's a little explanation
of what you can expect

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.860
when a cold front goes through.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.792
Everybody is happy with that?

00:31:35.792 --> 00:31:37.610
OK.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:43.030
When a warm front goes through,
it gets warmer afterwards.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:46.520
Yeah, so the warm front
produces, as you can see,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:53.332
light to moderate rain,
drizzle, visibility is bad.

00:31:53.332 --> 00:31:55.040
That's actually the
important thing here.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.960
The visibility gets poor.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.760
And then it becomes
fair and haze,

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:06.887
whereas the visibility becomes
really good after a cold front

00:32:06.887 --> 00:32:07.470
comes through.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:16.984
Occluded fronts-- same
deal, bad visibility.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.220
All right.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.400
Let's talk about hazards.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.200
This is more important.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:34.940
So this is a summary
of where heat

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:39.860
is released into the atmosphere
versus absorbed by water.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:48.650
So as the water goes, for
example, from vapor to liquid,

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.145
it releases heat.

00:32:50.145 --> 00:32:51.770
So that's exactly
what's happening when

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.170
it's raining in a thunderstorm.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.590
And that's not a good thing.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:01.550
All right.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:08.390
So here's the FAA's chart
of a cumulus cloud forming.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.480
So you can see the
lapse rate over here

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.270
in the ambient atmosphere.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:19.550
It's going from 28
to 24 down to 21.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:25.070
So it is, at least
initially, higher

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.050
than standard lapse rate.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.450
So this warm air--

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.820
it starts at 28.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.280
And then it drops only to 25.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.830
So it's still warmer
than the surrounding air.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:42.930
So it goes into becoming
this big, nasty cloud.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:47.270
There's this-- you
can see-- if you don't

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.880
want to look at the summaries
of weather forecasts,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.170
you can look at these
shards of lifted index.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:59.510
Here, it shows the difference
between minus 18 and minus 11,

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.200
minus 7.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.898
That gives you a measure of
the thunderstorm potential.

00:34:03.898 --> 00:34:04.940
There are charts of that.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.620
But as pilots, this
is more what we

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.750
deal with on our practical
day-to-day basis.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.760
We just look at
the next rad data

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.130
from the radar stations that
are strewn around the country.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.287
And if it's red, we try
to find a path around it,

00:34:22.287 --> 00:34:23.870
because there's just
not much else you

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.659
can do in a little aircraft.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:31.520
It's possible that you could
get over this entire front

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.570
if you were in a jet
that could climb up

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.610
to 40,000 feet or higher.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.397
But in a Piper or
Cessna or Cirrus,

00:34:40.397 --> 00:34:42.230
you're just not going
to be able to do that.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:46.350
OK.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:51.560
The thunderstorm lifecycle--
this is, I think,

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.850
my favorite test question.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.650
How do you know that
the thunderstorm

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.600
has reached its mature stage?

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.230
Well, it's raining,
simple as that.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.300
If it's raining, it's mature.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:09.640
If it's dissipating, you're
going to get these downdrafts.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.040
If it's building,
you get updrafts.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:17.720
So everything comes up,
and then it all comes down.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.490
OK.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.267
Look at that nasty thunderstorm.

00:35:22.267 --> 00:35:24.350
You're going to get
turbulence right on top of it.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.630
If you can clear that
thunderstorm by 5,000 feet,

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.520
it'll probably nice and smooth.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.272
So this is your good argument
for a plane that can go to 51

00:35:33.272 --> 00:35:35.690
[INAUDIBLE] or 510.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.020
Airliners don't go that high.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.640
The latest these jets go
much higher than airliners.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.630
All right.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.190
The hazard-- we're
going to hear more

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.190
about this tomorrow
from [? Dojo, ?]

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.950
from the Brazilian Air Force.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:59.190
But there is this chart here
that shows you how much load

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.290
factor-- that's in g's.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:09.200
If you're going pretty
fast, you can pretty quickly

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.350
get into the structural
damage range.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.020
So that's why they tell you--
this these lines here are

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:19.860
basically--

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.200
this is how many g's you
can get on the aircraft

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.800
with either extreme
movements on the controls

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.470
or extreme movements
that are imposed on you

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.450
by a thunderstorm or something.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.450
So the takeaway
from this diagram

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.840
is slow down if you get
into heavy turbulence,

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.630
because then the airplane
will stall before it bends.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:51.650
And stalling can be corrected
by pushing the nose down.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:52.150
OK.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.580
So these are all of the
hazards from thunderstorms.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.710
Again, it's a lot better--

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.710
in this day and age,
there's so much information

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:02.440
out there and datalink
available in the cockpit

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.890
that going through thunderstorms
is just much less common

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.060
than it used to be.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.860
And therefore, don't really
have to remember too much, other

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.330
than don't fly through
a thunderstorm.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:18.390
Microburst-- however, if
you're trying to land and beat

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.465
the thunderstorm,
you can actually

00:37:20.465 --> 00:37:21.840
get into a little
bit of trouble,

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:28.380
because the wind right before
a thunderstorm or right

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:36.890
after can be pretty squirrelly
and cause you some difficulties

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:39.350
here.

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:39.850
Let's see.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.040
What do we have?

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.330
So here, this airplane is
getting a performance boost

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:45.580
from a strong headwind.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.040
Now, not much is
happening, except that it's

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:53.270
getting pushed down, maybe
faster than the airplane can

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.200
climb.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.110
And at this point, you're
getting a performance reduction

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.145
from this big tailwind.

00:37:58.145 --> 00:38:00.520
So that's reducing-- you might
think, well, that's great.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.390
I'm getting pushed
along with a tailwind.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.810
But if it's suddenly
taking away your airspeed,

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:09.920
then that's not a
performance boost.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.670
All right.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:16.280
So the thunderstorm
emergency procedures

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.320
are, again, probably
a little bit

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.090
less relevant now
that we're living

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:27.380
in this world of constant
datalink and NEXRAD data.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.850
2006, there was a famous
accident with a former test

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:34.580
pilot, Scott
Crossfield, who maybe

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.180
didn't get the best advice
from air traffic control.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:44.060
And I don't think he had
datalink in his cockpit.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.400
The Boeing B 29 bomber
crews, they would fly,

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.800
I think, seven or eight hours
from an island in the Pacific

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.090
over to Japan.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:55.040
And during those
eight hours, they

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.140
had satellite data, no
data from a ground station.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.390
So they just had no idea
what they were going through.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.620
And they didn't go as high
as the designers thought

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.770
that airplane was designed
to go, super high.

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:09.083
But they were so loaded
up with fuel and bombs,

00:39:09.083 --> 00:39:11.000
they couldn't practically
climb all that high.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.410
So they were going at
10-15,000 feet over the ocean.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:20.300
And at those altitudes,
you can't really see--

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.820
you may get into an
embedded thunderstorm.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:27.140
Today's airliners, they go so
high that you really are never

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.600
in a position where
you blunder into stuff,

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.240
or almost never, because
you're in the clear,

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.300
and you can just see
the towering cumulus

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.480
and not fly there.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.290
You just back
yourself around them.

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.600
So I guess-- yeah,
the final statement

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.640
there is, get-there-itis
hasn't been cured.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.000
So as a pilot, the
safest thing you can do

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.850
is really fight that
tendency to want

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.740
to complete the
mission as planned

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.230
and overcommit to
your plan of action.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.330
All right.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:02.010
There are three other categories
of turbulence to worry about.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:13.540
Probably the worst is due
to terrain, like mountains.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:18.340
This low level turbulence
from thermals is not crazy.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.430
But as I said, if you get above
the clouds, that plane on top

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:25.190
is going to be in
a nice, smooth air.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:28.920
Wake turbulence [INAUDIBLE] is
also another thing to consider.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.270
Let's look at that.

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:42.120
So if you're taking off behind
an airplane, so look at that--

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.120
heavy, slow and in
clean configuration.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.220
So airplanes will tend
to retract their flaps,

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.590
and therefore be in
a clean configuration

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:55.080
shortly after takeoff,
whereas, if they're landing,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.112
the flaps are down.

00:40:56.112 --> 00:40:58.320
They're not generating quite
as much wake turbulence.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.500
Although, still if you land
behind a Boeing, in your little

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.850
Cessna, you will notice that.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.500
The solution here--
and I think this

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.190
is a test question--
is you land or take off

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:17.220
beyond the touchdown
point of a large aircraft.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.870
So if the large aircraft--

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:26.820
let's say the large aircraft
landed right here in front

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.380
of the laptop on the runway.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.510
You just fly a
little bit higher.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:33.290
And you land maybe in
the middle of the runway.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:36.000
And that way, you can't possibly
get into wake turbulence,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.880
because it will have sunk below
that big aircraft's flight

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.840
path.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.270
Controllers at a
towered airport,

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:45.210
they'll also separate you by
the necessary number of minutes.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:48.810
They have a bunch of regulations
about how much separation

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.630
they have to have
between aircraft.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.500
And then similarly,
for liftoff point--

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.790
so if the big airplane--

00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:01.290
again, this is not really that
much of a practical problem,

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:04.320
because so little runway
is used by light airplanes.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.610
But if the big airplane rotated
and took off and started

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.280
climbing here, well,
then you take off

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.740
and start climbing earlier.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.187
Of course, the climb
rate of the big airplane

00:42:16.187 --> 00:42:17.770
is probably a lot
better than you are.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.460
So you've got to think about
which way the wind is going

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.290
and maybe try to
turn away from it.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:25.710
I've only really been
stuck in weight turbulence

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.540
once that I can think about.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.040
It was at Hanscom Field.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.100
And there was a
heavy helicopter that

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.080
was cleared to
land on the runway,

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.090
and then transitioned sideways.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.292
And I was in the Cirrus.

00:42:37.292 --> 00:42:39.000
And I think the
controllers didn't really

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.800
think about, well, how
much wake turbulence can

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.640
a helicopter generate.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.530
So I was trying to land.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.110
And maybe about 200
feet above the ground,

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:53.820
there was a sharp
wing dip that I--

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.180
the good news is you don't have
to be heroic to correct it,

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.490
because, if your
airplane is banked,

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.050
the natural tendency is to
want to take the bank out.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:03.630
So whenever your
natural tendency

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:09.430
is to do the safe thing, that's
usually not much of a problem.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.930
Oh yeah.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:13.753
So anyway, here's
the FAA question.

00:43:13.753 --> 00:43:14.920
Who wants to give an answer?

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.580
Shout it out.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.360
A, B, or C?

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.553
AUDIENCE: A.

00:43:25.553 --> 00:43:26.470
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yay.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.680
All right.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.330
So this is a practical
issue, especially for anybody

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:39.960
who wants to fly out west.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.790
You have the Sierra Mountains.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.100
You have the Rocky Mountains.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.680
And you have to be very careful
when crossing these mountain

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.530
ranges.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:52.770
If the wind aloft forecast
is more than about 30 knots

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.130
for the time that you're
planning on crossing,

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.640
you can expect this kind of
turbulence on the lee side

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.680
or the eastern side of
those mountain ranges.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.200
So when I've crossed those
mountains in light airplanes,

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.100
I have usually done it first
thing in the morning basically.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:15.420
So I arranged to shut down
just short of the mountains

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.330
the night before, and then
cross early in the morning

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:21.330
when the winds are
typically calm.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:25.470
So you can look for
these lenticular clouds.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.690
But again, if you
saw the winds aloft

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:30.660
forecast that it was going to
be blowing 50 knots at 12,000

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.580
feet, you can be
pretty sure that it's

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.580
going to be turbulent.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.080
All right.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:43.610
Structural icing-- you can
get rime, clear or mixed.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:47.720
I'll just let you look
through the conditions that

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.380
lead to this.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.350
Clearing rime-- probably
rime icing is more common.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:06.760
What happens?

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.713
Everything gets worse
about your aircraft.

00:45:09.713 --> 00:45:11.130
Especially if
you're on autopilot,

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.890
it's a challenge to recognize
when icing is occurring.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:18.070
You can be in the air,
fat, dumb, and happy

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:22.110
while the airplane gets iced up.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:27.870
So the worst part of it, I
guess, is that you can't climb.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:30.720
Basically, when your airplane
has all this performance

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.630
reduction, you can
summarize this all--

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:38.070
if it's only moderate
icing, basically you

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:39.570
have an aircraft
that can't climb.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.130
All you can do is descend.

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:45.900
So a good practical tip is, if
you're-- well, first off all,

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.760
the good news is, if
you're a VFR pilot,

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.620
like you guys are
going to become,

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.020
initially you shouldn't
have to worry about icing,

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:55.200
because it's a phenomenon that
occurs when you're in a cloud.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.840
So you shouldn't be in a
cloud if you're a VFR pilot

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.820
to begin with.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.110
So how did you get ice?

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.300
The exception might be
freezing rain, if you somehow

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.410
drive through freezing rain.

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:08.370
But if you are instrument-rated
and you are going somewhere--

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:12.960
I'm planning on going to New
York next week in the Cirrus.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:19.350
So if it's cloudy, even if
there's no icing forecast,

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:22.620
I know that there is a risk
of getting ice on the wings.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.885
So in the wintertime,
I just say,

00:46:25.885 --> 00:46:28.260
well look, I'm not going to
go unless it's above freezing

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.900
on the surface, because,
if I get iced up,

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:36.330
then inadvertently I
need an escape route.

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:40.200
And if it's going to be above
freezing at, say, 3,000 feet,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.340
well, that's fine.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.710
I know that I probably
won't be able to climb

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:48.060
if I get moderate icing, but
I will be able to descend.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.920
Even a brick can descend.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.087
So descend down to 3,000 feet,
and all the ice will melt off.

00:46:53.087 --> 00:46:53.920
That would be great.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.780
But if it's below
freezing on the surface,

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.610
then it's basically a no-go.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:02.310
I've definitely had
icing a few times.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:03.360
And it's pretty scary.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:09.470
I was out on a day when
with an instrument student.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.270
And it seemed like
a perfect day to go

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:13.700
practice instrument flying.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.530
There was no turbulence.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:17.840
There was just
clouds everywhere,

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.747
about 800 feet of ceiling.

00:47:19.747 --> 00:47:21.830
So you could be in the
clouds, do real approaches,

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:25.190
get experience with actual IMC.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:27.920
And halfway through
the flight, I

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.970
started criticizing this guy
for using way too much power.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:35.990
The power settings were all off.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:37.142
What are you doing wrong?

00:47:37.142 --> 00:47:38.600
And then I looked
out on the wings.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.520
And I saw they were all frosted.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.020
So we descended.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:46.280
We managed to complete an
ILS approach into Lawrence

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.750
and pulled the airplane
into a warm hangar

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.640
and got it warmed up.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.790
So actually, as we
were as we were flying,

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.480
the FAA issued an
AIRMET for icing,

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.370
but the controllers
never told us about it.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:02.600
All right.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.370
Requirements for
icing formation--

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:12.570
near freezing temperatures,
minus 10 to 0, is the worst.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:16.080
You have to have a surface
on which the ice can form.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.750
And you have to be invisible
moisture, basically.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:22.530
So again, if you're flying in
the clear with your VFR pilot

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:25.510
certificate, icing should
not be a factor for you.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:30.810
Yeah.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:34.860
So as I said below, go
through a cold cloud

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.910
only if you have an escape
route of warm air below.

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:46.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] for
the engine [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:51.502
as far as getting the icing
in the carburetor [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:51.502 --> 00:48:52.460
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:55.960
So the question is, what
about icing in the engine?

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.810
So you can get carb ice
that we talked about.

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:02.490
You can get carb ice when
it's 50 degrees outside,

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.220
as long as it's humid.

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.440
So it's slightly unrelated.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.350
The main problem with
engines is that you

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.400
can get ice in the induction.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.930
So if the intake for the engine
where it's trying to breathe

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:19.260
gets iced over, then there's
an alternate-- again,

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.870
they're relying
on the hero pilot.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.990
Some airplanes actually,
it'll just open automatically,

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.870
the vacuum of trying to suck the
air through the intake that's

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:32.180
not working will cause
some backup door to open.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.930
And a lot of--

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:38.310
most IFR-certified aircraft have
an alternate air lever that you

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:44.380
can pull and have air pulled
from somewhere inside the--

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.430
it's a little more protected
inside the airframe.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.280
Does that answer your question?

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:49.900
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.290
So I guess you're saying as
long as the heat's working

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:56.723
your [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:56.723 --> 00:49:58.390
PHILIP GREENSPUN: As
long as which heat?

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:03.873
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:03.873 --> 00:50:05.290
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
You're not going

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.660
to get carb icing and airframe
icing at the same time

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:08.230
probably.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:11.535
I think, at that point,
it's probably too cold.

00:50:11.535 --> 00:50:12.410
I'm not I'm not sure.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.530
Well, the other issue is
you're probably not going

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.420
to fly a carburated
airplane into the clouds,

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.600
because the real IFR airplanes
that people use to travel,

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.340
like Cirruses and
Bonanzas and stuff,

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.910
in challenging conditions, those
are almost all fuel injected.

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:29.410
But you do have to worry about
induction icing, like I said.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:32.810
OK.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.640
Icing layers are
usually pretty thin.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.050
So if you're in a jet, you
just add power and climb up

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:44.390
another few thousand feet
and you're out of it.

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.560
Again, one of the
effects of icing

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.940
is to dramatically reduce
your climb performance.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:55.030
So this best approach
of climbing out of it

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:56.440
is not always available.

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:05.800
You will end up using more
power on the final approach.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.460
And you'll add speed as
well, because the stall

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.480
speed may have gone up.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.530
And you can't really be
sure, since it hasn't

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:18.170
been quantified and tested.

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.830
You probably won't use flaps.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:24.670
And you'll not
make severe turns.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:28.870
So there's a good NASA video
that I encourage you to watch,

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:34.150
especially as you work on higher
performance aircraft and IFR.

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:37.460
NASA has this great
video about icing.

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:38.410
OK.

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:41.830
How do the transportation
class airplanes handle this?

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:46.990
One approach is to push
antifreeze out onto the wings.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.370
That used to be called TKS.

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:51.040
Now, it's called CAV.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.460
It's just a brand name.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.540
So if you go to a flight school
and you see a modern Cirrus,

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:58.510
like the SR22s, the
leading edges of the wings

00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:59.710
will be metal.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.660
And they'll have little
tiny holes in them.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:05.140
And that's for this
antifreeze to come out.

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:08.650
If you have a very light
jet or a turbo prop,

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:12.250
you may have rubber boots on the
wings and on the tail surfaces.

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:15.310
And those inflate to
crack the ice off.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:18.190
The jets are really
the ultimate--

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:22.780
the bigger jets
all have bleed air.

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.220
Remember, the jets
are compressing

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.060
air so much that it becomes
really hot even before it's

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.030
burned.

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:30.490
So you pull the bleed
air off the compressor,

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:34.550
and you run it out into the
leading edges of the wings.

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:37.720
And that just melts the ice off.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:46.150
The transporter aircraft, they
also heat the windshields.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:47.890
So you'll be able
to see when you do--

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:50.920
if it's not above
freezing at the airport,

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.580
you'll have a clear windshield,
so you can leave the runway.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.390
Even in very basic
airplanes like a Cirrus,

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:03.040
if they're IFR-certified,
the pedo tube

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.180
is going to be heated.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.740
There will be pedo heat.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.810
OK.

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.630
You can learn a whole
bunch more about this.

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:13.310
I think everything
you know to pass

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.440
the test is pretty much
in the Pilot's Handbook

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.390
of Aeronautical Knowledge.

00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:20.120
There's a little bit in the AIM.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.480
If you want to dig deeper
and understand more of it,

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.150
then I would encourage you
to look at these FAA weather

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:27.790
publications.

00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:31.940
One is about weather theory
and one is about information

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.280
that you can get
from various sources.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:38.450
There's also these videos that I
would encourage you to look at.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:41.830
One of them is called
"Ambushed by Ice"

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:44.390
and "Into Deep--"
these particular links,

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:47.300
don't write those down, because
I fixed them last night,

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.490
but the Dropbox
didn't update yet.

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:52.500
Do they have real-time
weather data?

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.700
So the question is, in your
basic trainer airplane,

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:58.770
do they have real-time
weather data?

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:02.300
So let's just talk about
East Coast Aero Club

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:07.010
is a typical higher
end flight school.

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.430
About maybe 10 years ago,
almost all the aircraft

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:15.050
had a Garmin IFR-certified
GPS put in, a Garmin 430.

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:18.770
So at that point, you
had a really good GPS.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:22.700
But they did not have XM weather
pulling data from satellites,

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:25.670
which we'll talk
about in a little bit,

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:30.710
because it's a $500 a year
subscription and a $10,000 box.

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:32.990
So people didn't want to do it.

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:37.220
With ADS-B, the FAA is now
providing some of the same data

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:41.240
that XM was providing
for free, as long

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.380
as you have an ADS-B
in transponder.

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:47.720
And the East Coast
Aero-- well, everybody

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.780
has to upgrade to ADS-B by 2020.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.940
Not everybody has
to have ADS-B in,

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.800
but I think East Coast
Aero Club's probably

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:57.830
fairly typical of the
better flight schools.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.980
They've put-- or they're
gradually putting in a ADS-B

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:03.600
in and out transponders
in all their aircraft.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.487
It won't display in the cockpit.

00:55:05.487 --> 00:55:07.820
You'll have to have your
phone, your iPad, or something.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:11.180
But you'll be able to see--

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.460
you'll be able to see
NEXRAD radar picture.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.110
You'll be able to
get METARs and TAFs.

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:16.280
You'll get all of that.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:16.940
So I think--

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.120
TINA: But if you don't want
to rely on someone else--

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.440
this is MIT.

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.960
You can actually get
that data yourself.

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.810
So when we talk about
weather data today,

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:28.310
we're going to
also talk about how

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:34.160
you can do it yourself,
build your own Stratux ADS-B

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.670
receiver.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:36.930
And I've actually done this.

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.340
It was really fun to do.

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.210
It's very easy, actually.

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:45.260
Basically, based on a Raspberry
Pi with a couple of antennas,

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:48.740
with a little cooling fan, you
can build a little box that

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.750
can receive that weather data.

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:53.610
And it actually-- the
software is open source.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.820
And it can sync with
your other tools.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.280
So I have it synced
with my Foreflight app.

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.490
So when I'm flying,
I plug that in, I

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:02.030
bring a backup battery for it.

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:05.420
And it gives me weather data
and some other traffic data.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.573
And we'll be talking about
that in a couple hours.

00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:09.490
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah,
I should have noticed.

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:12.560
As Tina said, a lot of
flight school customers

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.650
for the last five years would
bring little battery powered

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:21.300
boxes and stick them to the
windshield of whatever they're

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:21.800
flying.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:24.920
And they would get a whole
bunch of more modern services.

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.780
I personally don't love that.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.720
When I started out
in my flying career,

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.470
I had my big flight
bag with all the stuff

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:32.330
I was going to bring
into the airplane.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:34.427
And now, I have the
philosophy that I

00:56:34.427 --> 00:56:36.260
don't want to bring
anything into the CIrrus

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:37.430
other than a pencil.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:41.140
I want everything that I
need to be in the panel.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.150
But yeah, I definitely think,
in the older airplanes,

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:45.950
it's become
conventional for people

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:52.090
to bring some sort of ADS-B
receiver and get that data.

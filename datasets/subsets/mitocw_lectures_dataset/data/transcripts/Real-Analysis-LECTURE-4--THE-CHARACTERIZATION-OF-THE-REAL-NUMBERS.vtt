00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.309 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: OK, so
let's finish the proof

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that we started at the end
of the lecture last time.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I usually don't end lectures
in the middle of a proof.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But since this lecture
and the lecture

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:84%
before will come to
you at the same time,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel so bad about it.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we were
trying to prove this theorem

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that if there's a rational
number so that it's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
equal to the
supremum of the set,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
then x is bigger than or equal
to 1 and its square gives me 2.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And so far, what we've
shown is that if I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
have an element, a
rational number that

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:84%
is given by the supremum, then
it's bigger than or equal to 1

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and x squared has to be
bigger than or equal to 2.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we would like to
show that, in fact, x squared

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.550 align:middle line:90%
equals 2.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, since x squared is
bigger than or equal to 2,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:84%
it's either equal to
2 or bigger than 2.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And we want to show that the
second possibility is not

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to prove that
the second possibility is not

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:90%
possible by contradiction.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that the thing
that we say cannot happen does

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
happen and we're going to
derive a false statement.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:90%
So define h.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be x
squared minus 2 over 2x

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And so note a couple of
things that since x squared

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:12.720 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than 2, this implies h
is bigger than 0, which implies

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:90%
x minus h is less than x.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
contradiction going to be?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be that
this element x minus h is,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:84%
in fact, an upper
bound for the set E.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And this will contradict the
fact that x is the supremum.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
the least upper bound

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
for the set E. There's
no upper bound for E that

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:90%
can be less than x.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.188 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.188 --> 00:03:02.020 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we now
prove that x minus h

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is an upper bound
for this set E. Now,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look at
x minus h squared.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.365 align:middle line:84%
Then this is equal to x squared
minus 2xh plus h squared.

00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, just given
by if we just plug

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
in what h is, this
is equal to x squared

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.481 align:middle line:90%
minus x squared minus 2.

00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's putting h in.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the 2x here
cancels with the 2x there.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So I just get x squared
minus 2 plus h squared, which

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:90%
equals 2 plus h squared.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, h is
a positive number.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.845 align:middle line:84%
So 2 plus a positive number,
this is bigger than 2.

00:04:09.845 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So x minus h squared
is bigger than 2.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:90%
So now, I want to show--

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use this
to show that x minus h

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
is an upper bound for E So
let q be in E. q squared

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.210 align:middle line:90%
is less than 2.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Then I have q squared is less
than 2, which is less than x

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
minus h squared by what
we just proved here.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So let me write this
out or just summarize

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
that what we proved here
was x minus h squared

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than 2.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So we have q squared is
less than 2 is less than x

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:90%
minus h squared.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.525 align:middle line:84%
So that means 0 is bigger
than x minus h squared minus q

00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:16.025 align:middle line:90%
squared.

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:19.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:84%
q squared is less than this
so than if I just subtract it

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:90%
I get this inequality.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So that implies that
0 is bigger than--

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
now, this is the
difference of two squares.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So I can write this as x
minus h plus q minus q.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I just write
out what x minus h

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:84%
is using the
definition of h, this

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
is equal to x squared plus
2 over 2x plus q over x

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:90%
minus h minus q.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the product of these
two numbers is positive.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.460 align:middle line:84%
This number is positive
because q is positive.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that means
their sum is positive.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So I have something
positive times this.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So I can divide by this positive
thing and keep the inequality.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So that implies that
0 is less than x

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
minus h minus q, which implies
that q is less than x minus h.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we started
off with an element of E,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.630 align:middle line:84%
an arbitrary element of E. And
we proved that q is less than x

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.245 align:middle line:90%
minus h.

00:06:57.245 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Thus, for all q in
E, q is less than x

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
minus h, which
implies that x minus h

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:32.870 align:middle line:84%
is an upper bound for E. So
let me keep that board for now

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
while I write the last
sentence or so of this proof.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.790 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So we stated that x minus h
is an upper bound for E, which

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:84%
implies since x is
the supremum of E,

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:84%
it should be less than or equal
to all upper bounds, which

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
implies h is less
than or equal to 0.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
But this is a
direct contradiction

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:90%
to h being a positive number.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is the false
statement we ultimately prove.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that if x
squared is bigger than 2,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:90%
you can find a lower bound--

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean an upper bound,
which is strictly

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:84%
smaller than x, which
contradicts the fact that x

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest
lower bound for E.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But remember, what was our
original assumption to begin

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:90%
with in this line of reasoning?

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
That was that x squared
is bigger than 2.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.705 align:middle line:90%
And that concludes the proof.

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this was
a statement about just

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
if I have some element
that's a rational number

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's equal to the supremum,
then it's square has to be 2.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to prove that
basically no such element

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:84%
exists, and therefore that
the rational numbers do not

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:84%
have the least upper
bound property, which

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:84%
was the discussion
above those two

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:84%
lines in that circle
on that board up there.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So what's the theorem
we're going to prove?

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:90%
The set E as before.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is a rational number
such that q is bigger than 0.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:90%
q squared is less than 2.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:39.804 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.804 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It is bounded above and
has no supremum in Q. So

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.985 align:middle line:90%
I'm not just saying that--

00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:57.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
so this set E sits
inside my ordered set,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:84%
which is my universe Q. I'm
not saying that it doesn't have

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
a supremum in E. I'm
saying it doesn't

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
have a supremum in the
universe where it sits.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
rational numbers

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:84%
do not have the least
upper bound property

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
because this set is a set
which is bounded above

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle line:90%
and has no supremum in q.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I want to show

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.565 align:middle line:84%
is that this set E
is bounded above.

00:11:35.565 --> 00:11:43.098 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.098 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Let q be in E. Then q
squared is less than 2,

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:90%
which is less than 4.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So this tells me
4 minus q squared

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
is positive, which
tells me 2 minus

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:90%
q times 2 plus q is positive.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, since 2 is positive
and q is positive,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:90%
2 plus q is positive.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So I can divide both
sides of this inequality

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
by this, 2 plus q,
without changing

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:90%
the inequality, which implies--

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
flip this inequality.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Thus, for all q in
E, q is less than 2.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So 2 is an upper
bound for the set E.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that proves that
the set E is bounded above.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm going to prove
that no supremum mom exists

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:84%
by using the previous
theorem, which

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
says if I have a supremum,
then its square must be 2.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, we show that
the sup of E does not exist.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.835 align:middle line:90%
And we do this by contradiction.

00:13:52.835 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know it seems like a
lot of the proofs we're doing

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:90%
are by contradiction.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
This should not give
you the impression

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
that all proofs should
be done by contradiction.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Many proofs that you
will do in the homework

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:84%
can be done directly,
meaning not by contradiction.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, this
first little proof

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:84%
that E is bounded above, this
is a direct proof, meaning I

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
prove directly that
it's bounded above.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I do not assume that
it's not bounded above

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.880 align:middle line:90%
and arrive at a contradiction.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:84%
But proof by contradiction
is very tempting

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:84%
because it at least gets
you going somewhere.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
If you can assume
not, then you get

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to a next step, which
this assumption implies

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.830 align:middle line:90%
something else.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.622 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, you can
keep going until you

00:14:47.622 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:90%
arrive at something false.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.783 align:middle line:84%
But many theorems that you want
to prove can be done directly.

00:14:54.783 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:90%
All right, but not this one.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, we show the supremum
of the set does not exist.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So by contradiction, so we will
assume that such a supremum

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:90%
does exist.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So suppose the supremum
exists and call it x.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.110 align:middle line:84%
All right, so x is the
supremum arm of the set.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, so by the previous
theorem, since x

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:84%
is an element of the
rational numbers,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:90%
whose square gives me--

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.500 align:middle line:84%
which is the
supremum of the set,

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.866 align:middle line:84%
then x is bigger than or equal
to 1 and its square is 2.

00:16:00.866 --> 00:16:04.970 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
By the previous theorem, x
is bigger than or equal to 1

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:90%
and x squared equals 2.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, x has to
be bigger than 1.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
It cannot equal 1 because the
square would give me 1 not 2.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I can
make that statement

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that x is, in fact,
bigger than 1,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.760 align:middle line:84%
not just bigger
than or equal to.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, so thus, since
x is a rational,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:58.020 align:middle line:84%
there exists m in
natural numbers

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
such that m is bigger than n
and x is equal to m over n.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So that just--
that's what it means

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
for x to be a rational number
and for it to be bigger than 1.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Thus, there exists an
n such that n times

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:90%
x is a natural number.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:84%
All right, just
multiplying through by n,

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.137 align:middle line:84%
that means that n
times x is equal to m,

00:17:43.137 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:90%
which is a natural number.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So let S be the set
of natural numbers

00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
so that when I multiply x
by k I get a natural number.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what we've shown,
just based on our assumption,

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:84%
is that S is non-empty
because n is in S

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a subset
of natural numbers.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
So by the well-ordering
property of N,

00:18:34.380 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:84%
this set S has a least element,
which we'll call k0 in S.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to show is
that, in fact, this little guy

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
k0 is not, in fact, the
least element of this set S,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.625 align:middle line:84%
which would contradict
exactly how it's defined.

00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So define k1 to
be k0 x minus k0.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:37.270 align:middle line:90%
And note this is an integer.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Because k0 times x-- so k0 is
in the set S, meaning k0 times

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:90%
x is a natural number.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's an integer.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.820 align:middle line:90%
k0 is a natural number.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So the difference of two
integers is, again, an integer.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:90%
So k0 is a natural number.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:90%
k0 times x is a natural number.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So the difference of two natural
numbers gives me an integer.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it's
a natural number.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.295 align:middle line:90%
So it's a natural number.

00:20:24.295 --> 00:20:31.608 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.608 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:90%
So let's go over here.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So far, we have that
k1 is a natural number.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to prove that
k1 is actually less than k0.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.310 align:middle line:90%
So since x squared equals 2--

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:90%
I should say--

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:20.005 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's write it this way.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Since x squared is
equal to 2, this

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:84%
implies that 4 minus
x squared is positive.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I just wrote down 2.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:90%
4 minus x squared is just 2.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So this tells me, taking
the difference, 2 minus x

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:90%
times 2 plus x is positive.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:90%
2 and x are positive.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So I can divide this
inequality through by this term

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and maintain the
inequality, which

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:90%
implies 2 minus x is positive.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, x is less than 2.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:90%
So x is less than 2.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:90%


00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Then k1, which remember
is k0 times x minus 1,

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:90%
is less than k0.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:90%
So k0 is a natural number.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It's positive. x minus 1 is
bounded by 2 minus 1 equals k0.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So what we've shown so far
is that this number, k1,

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.325 align:middle line:90%
is a natural number.

00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:41.890 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's less than k0.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I don't have to
write this positive part.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's remember what
k0 was supposed to be.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:84%
k0 is supposed to be the
smallest element of this set

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
S. It's the smallest
natural number so

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that when I multiply it by x
I get another natural number.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And from this k0, I constructed
a new natural number

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:27.020 align:middle line:84%
called k1, which is less than
k0 and it's a natural number.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.165 align:middle line:90%
But here comes the fun part.

00:23:29.165 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:84%
If we compute what
x times k1 is,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
this is, by definition, x
times x times k0 minus k0.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to x squared
k0 minus x times k0, which

00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
equals 2 k0 minus x times k0
because x squared equals 2.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And this last part, this
is equal to k0 plus k0

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:29.255 align:middle line:90%
minus x k0, which equals k1.

00:24:29.255 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a natural number.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.440 align:middle line:90%
That's a natural number.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:84%
This natural number is bigger
than this natural number.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, their difference
is, again, a natural number.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So this says that x times
k1 is a natural number.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:90%


00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Thus, k1 is in S and
k1 is less than k0,

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:25.250 align:middle line:84%
which implies k0 is not the
least element in S, which

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:30.530 align:middle line:84%
is a contradiction
to the fact that it

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:90%
is the least element of S.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So what we've shown is
assuming that this set

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
E has a supremum in
the rational numbers,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:84%
then we arrive at
a contradiction.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So our original
assumption must be false.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:08.005 align:middle line:90%
Thus, sup E does not exist.

00:26:08.005 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this proof is
maybe a little different than--

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.170 align:middle line:84%
if you've seen a proof of the
fact that the square root of 2

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.662 align:middle line:84%
is not a rational
number, there's

00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:38.870 align:middle line:84%
a different proof that maybe
is a little bit simpler.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But this one uses ordering
instead to prove it,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:90%
which I thought was pretty cool.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's originally
due to Dedekind.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.240 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we've discussed one
aspect of the real numbers that

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.900 align:middle line:84%
was in that theorem
that I stated earlier,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:84%
which I'll restate
in a minute, namely

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that it is a set that has the
least upper bound property.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So I stated that as a theorem.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
prove that theorem.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
We just want to
understand exactly what

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.245 align:middle line:90%
sets the real numbers apart.

00:27:22.245 --> 00:27:24.820 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And one aspect of that--
there were two things.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:84%
One is that it's
an ordered field.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And two is that it has the
least upper bound property.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So we've now discussed what
the least upper bound property

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:90%
means.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to
fill in one other part

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:84%
about the real numbers,
which is the fact that it's

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.615 align:middle line:90%
an ordered field.

00:27:42.615 --> 00:27:45.910 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I've said before, Q
is also an ordered field.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:84%
R is not special
in that respect.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:59.830 align:middle line:84%
But as the theorem stated at
the middle of the last lecture,

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that R is, in fact, the
unique ordered field

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:84%
with the least upper
bound property.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.757 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we've just proven that
Q does not have the least upper

00:28:06.757 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:90%
bound property.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.775 align:middle line:84%
So in some sense,
Q is missing stuff.

00:28:09.775 --> 00:28:12.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:90%
It's missing stuff.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:84%
It's missing square
roots of 2, which

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:84%
is kind of an
algebraic thing, namely

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't solve the
equation x squared minus 2

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.840 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 in the
rational numbers.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
it's missing, that you

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:84%
have this kind of
algebraic defect

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:84%
manifests itself in this fact
that Q is also missing things

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.230 align:middle line:90%
with respect to an order.

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So Q, in short,
this is me saying

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:50.540 align:middle line:90%
that has holes and R does not.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:59.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is probably
the most basic statement

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:84%
one can make about
R. And perhaps you

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.200 align:middle line:84%
heard in high school
calculus and you're

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
hearing repeated now, but in a
nutshell, I mean, Q has holes

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:90%
and R does not.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But this means something
very specifically

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:84%
that R has the least upper
bound property and Q does not.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let me talk
about what ordered fields are.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So first off, I need to
define what a field is.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So a set F is a field if
it has two operations--

00:29:49.420 --> 00:30:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:07.670 align:middle line:84%
plus-- and I'm going to put
a dot here in the middle--

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:12.770 align:middle line:84%
times basically,
such that you have

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
a list of properties
that hold with respect

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:90%
to these operations.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:90%
The first is with respect to--

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.950 align:middle line:90%
so this is plus, this is times.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.380 align:middle line:84%
This is addition,
multiplication.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So the first condition is that
the set is closed with respect

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:31.740 align:middle line:90%
to taking sums.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So if x y is in F,
then x plus y is in F.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:49.860 align:middle line:84%
This operation of additions
should be commutative.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Commutativity, I hope
that's how you spell it.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:08.720 align:middle line:84%
This means that for all x y in
F, x plus y equals y plus x.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Associativity, so this is a
condition that for all x, y,

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:26.690 align:middle line:84%
z in F, if I add x
and y and then add ,

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to adding
x to the sum of y and z.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:37.230 align:middle line:90%


00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.680 align:middle line:84%
The fourth is that
we have what's

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:47.170 align:middle line:84%
called an identity element,
an additive identity element.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:84%
There exists an element which
I'll label 0 in the set F

00:31:52.450 --> 00:32:02.805 align:middle line:84%
such that for all x in
F, 0 plus x equals 0.

00:32:02.805 --> 00:32:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And we also have additive
inverses, namely for all x in F

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
there exists an
element which I call--

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:84%
which I label minus x in F such
that x plus minus x equals 0.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
conditions on addition

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.850 align:middle line:84%
that should be
satisfied for a field.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:47.750 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's about addition.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:53.738 align:middle line:84%
So the conditions for
multiplication are similar.

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Namely, it needs to be closed
with respect to multiplication.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So if x y is in F,
then x times y is in F.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Multiplication should
also be commutative.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.130 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to abbreviate
that commutative as comm.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:84%
For all x y in F, x
times y equals y times

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.300 align:middle line:90%
x We also have associativity.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:90%


00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's not shorten it by that.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.930 align:middle line:84%
For all x, y, z in F,
if I multiply x times y

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and then multiply it by
z, it's the same as taking

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:84%
x and multiplying
it by y times z.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:57.806 align:middle line:90%


00:33:57.806 --> 00:34:00.770 align:middle line:84%
The fourth property
is the existence

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:90%
of multiplicative identity.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:13.610 align:middle line:84%
There exists an element which
I label as 1 in the set F

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:18.545 align:middle line:84%
such that for all x in
F, 1 times x equals x.

00:34:18.545 --> 00:34:21.520 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:84%
And then I also have
multiplicative inverses

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:29.710 align:middle line:90%
for non-zero elements.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:84%
For all x in F, take away 0--
so for everything in the field

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.400 align:middle line:90%
that's non-zero--

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:42.699 align:middle line:84%
there exists an element which I
call x to the minus 1 in F such

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that x times x to
the minus 1 equals 1.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.239 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are statements
about the two operations.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:57.420 align:middle line:84%
There's one last assumption
in the definition

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.470 align:middle line:90%
that connects the two.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
distributive law, namely

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:18.910 align:middle line:84%
that for all x, y, z in F,
if I take x plus y times z,

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:25.540 align:middle line:84%
this is x times
z plus y times z.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.660 align:middle line:90%
So all these conditions--

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.570 align:middle line:84%
so a field is a set with two
operations, plus and dot,

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.860 align:middle line:90%
meaning multiplication.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And these two operations need to
satisfy all of these conditions

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:90%
for my set to be called a field.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So the clearest
example is, of course,

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
rational numbers with
the usual plus and minus,

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean plus and
multiplication defined

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:02.235 align:middle line:90%
as you learned as a child.

00:36:02.235 --> 00:36:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's a non-example?

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:13.790 align:middle line:90%
The integers.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So the integers come with
plus and multiplication.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:24.910 align:middle line:84%
However, it doesn't satisfy
the existence of inverses,

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.550 align:middle line:84%
of multiplicative
inverses in 5, but it

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.290 align:middle line:90%
does satisfy everything else.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And typically, one
would call z what's

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:47.780 align:middle line:84%
called a commutative
ring, commutative

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:84%
because multiplication
is also commutative.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But a ring in general
does not necessarily

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:90%
have to satisfy multiplication.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Being commutative, for example,
the set of say 2 by 2 matrices

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.340 align:middle line:90%
form a ring.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:90%
What's an example of another?

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:84%
What's another
example of a field?

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have-- maybe I should
have given this one first--

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.645 align:middle line:84%
Z2, which is the
simplest field there is.

00:37:19.645 --> 00:37:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just the element
of two-- it's just

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
a set of two elements,
0 and 1, where

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:35.395 align:middle line:84%
I need to define what 1 plus 1
is, 1 plus 1 defined to be 0.

00:37:35.395 --> 00:37:39.870 align:middle line:90%


00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.630 align:middle line:90%
And 1 plus 1 is 0.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, that's it.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:48.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, 0 times 0 would be 0.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.580 align:middle line:90%
0 times 1 would be 0.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.500 align:middle line:90%
0 plus 0 would be 0.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And that gives you
all of the rules

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:84%
you need to know to be able
to define multiplication

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and addition on this set
of these two elements.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a field because
what is the inverse of 1?

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's just 1.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can check that
if I define addition

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:16.680 align:middle line:84%
by this rule along with
the other rules that--

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and along with-- that
these defining plus

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.077 align:middle line:84%
and multiplication this way
satisfies all the conditions

00:38:38.077 --> 00:38:38.785 align:middle line:90%
of being a field.

00:38:38.785 --> 00:38:43.494 align:middle line:90%


00:38:43.494 --> 00:38:51.910 align:middle line:84%
A more non-trivial example
would be, let's say, Z3.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:55.900 align:middle line:90%
This is a set 0, 1, 2.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Only now, the arithmetic-- so
I didn't use such a fancy word

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.030 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But arithmetic is
done mod 3 here.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Here, it was mod 2, meaning
if I want to add two elements,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I add them, and then I take
the remainder of that sum

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.520 align:middle line:90%
after dividing by 3.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So here, addition
is defined mod 3.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So if something is a multiple
of 3, then I equate it to 0.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So for example, 1 plus
2, which gives me 3,

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:90%
it's a multiple of 3.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.015 align:middle line:90%
This is defined to be 0.

00:39:41.015 --> 00:39:44.210 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:49.340 align:middle line:84%
2 times 2, which equals 4, which
equals 3 plus 1, multiples of 3

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:90%
are 0.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:50.990 align:middle line:90%
So that gives me 1.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:84%
In particular, this tells
me that in this field,

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:90%
2 times 2 equals 1.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So the multiplicative inverse
of 2 is given by itself, 2,

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.900 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And a times b equals, let's
say, d mod 3, all right?

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:14.200 align:middle line:90%


00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.255 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's another
example of a field.

00:40:16.255 --> 00:40:27.100 align:middle line:90%


00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.363 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you take mod
p where p is a prime,

00:40:30.363 --> 00:40:31.280 align:middle line:90%
you get another field.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:90%
You get a finite field.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So these are examples of
what are called finite fields

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.610 align:middle line:84%
because exactly
that-- they are fields

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.360 align:middle line:84%
and they have a finite
number of elements.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, OK, based on
just these assumptions

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that you assume your
field to satisfy--

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for it to
be a field, you

00:40:53.420 --> 00:41:01.290 align:middle line:84%
can prove all of the
simple algebra statements

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever known simply
from these axioms of fields.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:10.810 align:middle line:90%


00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let
me just give you

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.290 align:middle line:84%
the silliest example of a
statement you can prove just

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.450 align:middle line:90%
using these elements--

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these axioms.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:26.920 align:middle line:84%
You can prove the statement
that for all x in F--

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:90%
so F is a field here.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.150 align:middle line:90%
So F throughout will be--

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:38.394 align:middle line:90%


00:41:38.394 --> 00:41:45.750 align:middle line:84%
if x is a field, then for
all x in F, 0 times x is 0.

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:50.500 align:middle line:84%
All we know about 0 is
that, when you add it to x,

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.360 align:middle line:90%
you get x back.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this
should have been--

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.805 align:middle line:90%
yeah, yeah, this is wrong.

00:41:55.805 --> 00:41:56.805 align:middle line:90%
This should have been x.

00:41:56.805 --> 00:42:03.904 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.904 --> 00:42:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Let me make sure
there's no other errors.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't think there are.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:12.300 align:middle line:84%
That's another danger
about not being

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:19.640 align:middle line:84%
able to lecture in person,
is that errors on the board

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.150 align:middle line:90%
persist.

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:27.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you can prove this
blockbuster theorem just using

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:29.890 align:middle line:90%
these axioms.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's do a quick
proof of this.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:40.820 align:middle line:84%
If x is in F, then 0
is equal to 0 times

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.810 align:middle line:84%
x plus the additive
inverse of 0 times

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.700 align:middle line:84%
x because that's
just the definition

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.930 align:middle line:90%
of the additive inverse.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Every element has
an additive inverse.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And now, 0 is equal to
0 plus 0 times x plus,

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.890 align:middle line:84%
again, the additive
inverse of x.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And now, I use the
distributive law.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:12.770 align:middle line:84%
This is 0 times x plus 0 times
x plus the additive inverse of 0

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.120 align:middle line:90%
times x.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And that cancels with that.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.690 align:middle line:90%
And I get 0 times x.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So I started off
with 0 and I arrived

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.660 align:middle line:84%
at it's equal to 0
times x, all right?

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.860 align:middle line:90%


00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can prove other
simple algebraic statements

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:90%
using these axioms as well.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll put it
in the assignment.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:50.650 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just state you can
also prove things like--

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:59.880 align:middle line:84%
if I want to look
at minus x, then

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:04.470 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to the additive
inverse of 1 times x.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is like--

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.450 align:middle line:84%
it's not terribly
interesting at the start.

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:16.700 align:middle line:84%
There are essentially some
very deep theorems in algebra

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that you learn at another
point in your life,

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.095 align:middle line:90%
but that won't be in this class.

00:44:21.095 --> 00:44:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Actually, today is
probably all we're

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.750 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about fields,
which are algebraic things.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.810 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Algebraic things
are, to me, nice

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.980 align:middle line:84%
because somehow you
always deal with equality.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So how hard could
it be to prove two

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.070 align:middle line:90%
things are equal to each other?

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Yet, analysis deals a lot
with inequality, which

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.790 align:middle line:90%
somehow is much more subtle.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.725 align:middle line:90%
But that's just a little biased.

00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:57.456 align:middle line:90%


00:44:57.456 --> 00:45:00.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is what a field is.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.250 align:middle line:84%
A field is just, again, a set
that has these two operations.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:05.480 align:middle line:90%
What is an ordered field?

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:90%


00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's a field, first off, and
which is also an ordered set--

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.845 align:middle line:90%
but it can't just--

00:45:40.845 --> 00:45:44.610 align:middle line:84%
you can't have two
different structures

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.650 align:middle line:84%
on your field and them
not interact for that

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:49.360 align:middle line:90%
to be interesting--

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:59.270 align:middle line:84%
so such that the algebraic
structure and the order

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:03.920 align:middle line:84%
on the field are
cohabitating nicely,

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning you have two conditions
for all x, y, z in F.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:19.390 align:middle line:84%
If x is less than y, then x
plus z is less than y plus z.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.660 align:middle line:90%
And one other condition--

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:90%
x is positive.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Or if x is bigger than 0
and y is bigger than 0,

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.665 align:middle line:90%
then x times y is bigger than 0.

00:46:37.665 --> 00:46:41.030 align:middle line:90%


00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just use that
terminology anyways right now.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But for an ordered field F, if
an element is bigger than 0,

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.520 align:middle line:90%
then we call it positive.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.800 align:middle line:90%


00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's bigger
than or equal to 0,

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:11.822 align:middle line:84%
we say x is positive and
respectively non-negative.

00:47:11.822 --> 00:47:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So non-negative if x is
bigger than or equal to 0,

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:24.320 align:middle line:84%
positive x is bigger than 0,
and then likewise with negative

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.880 align:middle line:90%
and non-positive.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.620 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.658 align:middle line:84%
And so the most
basic example, again,

00:47:32.658 --> 00:47:37.620 align:middle line:84%
is Q. Q is an ordered
field with the usual order

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and with the usual
algebraic structure on Q.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:55.210 align:middle line:84%
What is not an example is
either one of the two fields

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.520 align:middle line:90%
I wrote down just a minute ago.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:15.810 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So a non-example is
this field here, 0, 1.

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So if I put an order on
this, either 0 is less than 1

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:41.760 align:middle line:90%
or 1 is less than 0.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So remember, order does not
have to necessarily correspond

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that 0 you
connect to 0 in the integers

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and that 1 you connect
to 1 in the integers.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are just
two elements of a set.

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And an order would
be saying either

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.070 align:middle line:84%
that element is less
than that element

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:02.230 align:middle line:84%
or that element is
less than that element.

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider
either cases and suppose

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:11.850 align:middle line:84%
we have that order on this set
and show that it does not turn

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.335 align:middle line:90%
this set into an ordered field.

00:49:13.335 --> 00:49:16.440 align:middle line:90%


00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:35.675 align:middle line:84%
So then either 0 is less
than 1 or 1 is less than 0.

00:49:35.675 --> 00:49:38.860 align:middle line:90%


00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's do the first
case, 0 is less than 1.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:51.240 align:middle line:90%


00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:59.580 align:middle line:84%
If 0 is less than
1, then what happens

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.050 align:middle line:90%
if I add 1 to each side?

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:11.960 align:middle line:90%


00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.940 align:middle line:90%
So 1 plus 0 would give me 1.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:15.410 align:middle line:90%
1 plus one would be 0.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it is not
so less than 1 plus 1.

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So it does not satisfy
the first property.

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So if I have an order on Z2,
two possibilities-- either 0

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is less than 1 or
1 is less than 0.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:52.830 align:middle line:84%
If 0 is less than 1, then,
by the definition of addition

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:57.000 align:middle line:84%
on this set, if I
add 1 to 0, I get 1.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.040 align:middle line:90%
If I add 1 to 1, I get 0.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if I were
to add 1 to both sides,

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.200 align:middle line:84%
I would not get
a true inequality

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.780 align:middle line:84%
because I'm assuming
0 is less than 1.

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So this condition, number 1,
does not hold for this order.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.915 align:middle line:84%
And neither does it hold for
choosing 1 is less than 0.

00:51:15.915 --> 00:51:20.570 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:23.375 align:middle line:90%
By the same logic, then 1--

00:51:23.375 --> 00:51:31.750 align:middle line:90%


00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:35.875 align:middle line:90%
so 1 plus 1 is not less than--

00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:41.730 align:middle line:90%


00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:44.190 align:middle line:90%
so this set is not--

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:47.740 align:middle line:84%
this field cannot be turned
into an ordered field.

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, the same thing
that I've done here shows that

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:58.510 align:middle line:84%
you cannot have any
finite ordered field.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.185 align:middle line:84%
So in general, there are
no finite ordered fields.

00:52:20.185 --> 00:52:26.340 align:middle line:90%


00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, just like we proved
the blockbuster statement

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:42.620 align:middle line:84%
that 0 times anything
in the field equals 0,

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:48.200 align:middle line:84%
we can also prove all of the
manipulations of inequalities

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that you use without
fear simply from, again,

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.490 align:middle line:84%
these axioms about an
ordered field being a field

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and also satisfying
these two inequalities--

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:10.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these two
conditions here for it

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.590 align:middle line:90%
to be an ordered field.

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if F
is an ordered field,

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.510 align:middle line:84%
then if x is an element
of f and x is positive,

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:52.240 align:middle line:84%
this implies its additive
inverse is negative and vice

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.950 align:middle line:90%
versa.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:54:01.510 align:middle line:84%
If x is less than 0,
then minus x is positive.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So I know it's tempting
to think, well yeah, just

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:13.080 align:middle line:84%
multiply this inequality by
minus 1 to get this inequality.

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But remember, this
is really a statement

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.965 align:middle line:90%
about the additive inverse of x.

00:54:16.965 --> 00:54:29.580 align:middle line:90%


00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.705 align:middle line:90%
So the proof is not hard.

00:54:30.705 --> 00:54:34.320 align:middle line:90%


00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.600 align:middle line:90%
If x is positive, then--

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:42.346 align:middle line:90%
well, I could write it this way.

00:54:42.346 --> 00:54:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I can write it as
0 is less than x.

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:47.930 align:middle line:90%


00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Then by property number 1, I
can add anything to both sides

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and get the same inequality--
and preserve the inequality.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, minus x plus 0 is
less than the additive inverse

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.540 align:middle line:90%
of x plus x.

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the fact that 0 is
the additive identity, a4,

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.910 align:middle line:84%
the left side, is
going to be minus x.

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And by the definition of
the additive inverse of x,

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:23.500 align:middle line:84%
The right-hand side
is going to be 0.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So what's going in here
is this is by a4 and a5.

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:40.530 align:middle line:90%


00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And this previous statement is
by 1 in this definition before.

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to prove
this statement as well.

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the essentially
the same proof.

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I add minus x to both
sides, which I can do by 1.

00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I use a4 and a5
to conclude that x is--

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.658 align:middle line:90%
that minus x is positive.

00:56:03.658 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Let me just say See
Proposition 1.1.8 in textbook

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:46.850 align:middle line:90%
for the other--

00:56:46.850 --> 00:57:04.970 align:middle line:84%
let's say for the other
proofs of standard inequality

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:06.170 align:middle line:90%
manipulations.

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:16.680 align:middle line:90%


00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.690 align:middle line:90%
So Q is an ordered field.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And as I stated before
about R, R will also--

00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.320 align:middle line:90%
R is also an ordered field.

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But it has a least
upper bound property.

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you are
asking yourself, how

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:40.900 align:middle line:84%
about some sort of greatest
lower bound property?

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.960 align:middle line:84%
The least upper bound
property is about sups.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Can we make a similar
property about infs?

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Are there sets that have the
least upper bound property

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that don't have, say, a greatest
lower bound property, meaning

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:02.580 align:middle line:84%
does there exist something
has the greatest lower bound

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:08.430 align:middle line:84%
property if every non-empty
set which is bounded below

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:09.605 align:middle line:90%
has an infimum?

00:58:09.605 --> 00:58:11.730 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what I'm
referring to, even though I

00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:12.730 align:middle line:90%
haven't written it down.

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:16.600 align:middle line:90%


00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.460 align:middle line:90%
OK, what is that leading up to?

00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:22.045 align:middle line:84%
In the setting of
ordered fields,

00:58:22.045 --> 00:58:24.170 align:middle line:84%
there really is no difference
between a least upper

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:27.610 align:middle line:84%
bound property and a greatest
lower bound property.

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:31.210 align:middle line:84%
If I have an ordered field
which satisfies the least upper

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:33.820 align:middle line:84%
bound property, then
it also satisfies

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:48.342 align:middle line:84%
a greatest lower bound property,
which I'll state as a theorem,

00:58:48.342 --> 00:58:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll prove.

00:58:51.850 --> 00:59:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Let F be an ordered field with
the least upper bound property.

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to prove
that it has, if you like,

00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:18.280 align:middle line:90%
a greatest lower bound property.

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Then if A is a
subset of F, which

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:46.990 align:middle line:84%
is non-empty and bounded
below, then inf A exists in F,

00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:56.760 align:middle line:84%
meaning A has an
infimum in the set F.

00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:01.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the proof of
this is basically--

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.530 align:middle line:84%
in some sense, we
did something similar

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:10.350 align:middle line:84%
when we proved that one set
given by all the minus 1,

01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:13.320 align:middle line:84%
minus 2, minus 3 had
the greatest upper bound

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.710 align:middle line:84%
property or the least
upper bound property

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:20.310 align:middle line:84%
by taking its minus
and then using,

01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:22.860 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, the greatest
lower bound property

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
of the natural numbers, this
well-ordering principle,

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:30.565 align:middle line:84%
to conclude that that set had
the least upper bound property.

01:00:30.565 --> 01:00:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
going to do here,

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:36.040 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to take a
set which is bounded below,

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:43.330 align:middle line:84%
take its minus, if you like,
which is now bounded above,

01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:45.340 align:middle line:84%
take the sup of that
set, which we can do,

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and show that that's
the infimum of that set.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.030 align:middle line:90%
So let me write over here.

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:58.180 align:middle line:84%
This should be not part of
the proof, but some intuition.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:02.910 align:middle line:90%


01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'll draw it like F is
a real number line, which

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
it is because part
of the statement

01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
about the real
numbers is that it's

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
the unique ordered field with
the least upper bound property.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
But don't worry
about that for now.

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine we have a
set A. And for now, I'll

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
draw it like it's an interval,
which is bounded below.

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.390 align:middle line:90%
So it stops after some point.

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:41.520 align:middle line:90%
And there's nothing there.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's bounded below,
then if I look at minus A--

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:53.190 align:middle line:90%


01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:54.990 align:middle line:90%
so here, I'm drawing 0.

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
If I look at minus A, which
is the set of elements--

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.525 align:middle line:84%
the set of the
additive inverses of A,

01:02:00.525 --> 01:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I now have a set which
is bounded above.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So if this is a
lower bound for A,

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
then minus B will be an
upper bound for minus A.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, minus A has
a least upper bound which,

01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:18.570 align:middle line:84%
in this picture I'm
drawing, looks like x.

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:23.085 align:middle line:84%
And so then my goal
is then to show that--

01:02:23.085 --> 01:02:29.180 align:middle line:90%


01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
so here, let's go
back to B. Here's A.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And here's now minus
x to show that minus x

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:43.870 align:middle line:84%
is an infinum of A. So that's
the basic intuition on why

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%
this holds.

01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
We're using the
ordered field property

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:51.310 align:middle line:90%
to be able to take minuses.

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:53.230 align:middle line:84%
That's where the field
property is coming in.

01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And that minuses-- although
we didn't prove this,

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:56.650 align:middle line:90%
it is one of those--

01:02:56.650 --> 01:03:02.510 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
essentially, we did prove
this, that if I have something

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
positive and I multiply it
through by minus 1 using this

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
as well, then that
reverses the inequality.

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:14.750 align:middle line:90%
But again, these are short--

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:18.510 align:middle line:90%


01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:21.840 align:middle line:84%
unless I'm telling you to
prove a certain inequality,

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
simple inequality statement
like of this type, just

01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
freely use the
inequality facts that you

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.970 align:middle line:90%
remember from high school.

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:39.800 align:middle line:90%


01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And just know that these
persist for ordered fields

01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:43.580 align:middle line:90%
with the least--

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.040 align:middle line:90%
or ordered fields in general.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's turn this
intuition into a proof.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:01.000 align:middle line:90%


01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Suppose A-- so I am
not stating it here,

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
but F is an ordered field with
the least upper bound property.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I'll go ahead and state it.

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:12.380 align:middle line:90%


01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
F is an ordered field with the
least upper bound property.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:27.680 align:middle line:90%


01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Let A be subset
of F, A not equal

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
to an empty set,
A bounded below.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:49.430 align:middle line:90%


01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Then that means there exists
an element b in F such

01:04:56.590 --> 01:05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that b is less than
or equal to a such

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that, for all a in capital A,
b is less than or equal to a.

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:20.370 align:middle line:90%


01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, the proof
is essentially there

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and you just need to
turn it into English

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:32.082 align:middle line:90%
because we're in Massachusetts.

01:05:32.082 --> 01:05:33.540 align:middle line:84%
If you were in a
different country,

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
you'd turn into the language
that's spoken there.

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
You just need to turn
it into written word.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So there exists a
lower bound for A.

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Let me just note another
set called minus--

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:57.570 align:middle line:84%
which I'll label minus A. This
is the set of all elements

01:05:57.570 --> 01:06:02.205 align:middle line:84%
in F of the form minus the
additive inverses of A,

01:06:02.205 --> 01:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
as a is in capital A. So
it's the additive inverse

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:15.050 align:middle line:84%
of all elements
in capital A. Then

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:21.630 align:middle line:84%
the fact that I have
for all a in A b

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to a
implies for all a in A, minus a

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to minus
b because multiplying through

01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:39.510 align:middle line:90%
by minus 1 flips the inequality.

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:44.140 align:middle line:90%


01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.720 align:middle line:84%
That implies-- so
minus b is bigger than

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
or equal to every
element of minus A So

01:06:49.540 --> 01:07:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that implies b is an upper
bound for the set minus A.

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So minus A is a non-empty subset
of F, which is bounded above.

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, it has a supremum.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Thus, there exists
an x in F such

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:27.130 align:middle line:84%
that x equals sup
of the set minus A.

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is because we are
assuming the least upper

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
bound property, that every
non-empty set which is bounded

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:35.270 align:middle line:90%
above has a supremum.

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:38.750 align:middle line:90%


01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show this guy x is,
in fact, the infimum of the set

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
A, or minus x is
the infimum of A.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that x is
the supremum of minus A

01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
implies that for all a in
capital A, minus a is less than

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.060 align:middle line:84%
or equal to x
because x is supposed

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.700 align:middle line:90%
to be the least upper bound.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's, in fact,
an upper bound.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.180 align:middle line:90%


01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
for all a in A--

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
again, just flipping the
inequalities-- minus x is less

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:23.689 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to A,
which implies minus x

01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:33.220 align:middle line:90%
is a lower bound for capital A.

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:37.870 align:middle line:84%
We now have to show that minus
x is the greatest lower bound

01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:41.310 align:middle line:84%
of A. If I take any
other lower bound of A,

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:45.885 align:middle line:84%
then minus x is bigger than
or equal to that lower bound.

01:08:45.885 --> 01:08:53.270 align:middle line:90%


01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Now show that if--

01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:58.580 align:middle line:90%
let's call it something else--

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:11.510 align:middle line:84%
y is the lower bound for
A, then y is less than

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:13.955 align:middle line:90%
or equal to minus x.

01:09:13.955 --> 01:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And then that
concludes the proof

01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:18.690 align:middle line:84%
showing that minus x is,
in fact, the infimum of A.

01:09:18.690 --> 01:09:21.899 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, A has an infinum.

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
We've actually identified
what the infinum is.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the sup of minus A.

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:41.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let y be a
lower bound for A.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.649 align:middle line:84%
Then exactly how I showed
for this single lower bound

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:49.010 align:middle line:84%
that I had for A, you
can verify this again.

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:53.899 align:middle line:84%
Just go through the argument
and replace b with y.

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:57.545 align:middle line:90%
Then minus y is an upper bound--

01:09:57.545 --> 01:10:00.930 align:middle line:90%


01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
just look at the picture,
replace b with y--

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.590 align:middle line:90%


01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:13.665 align:middle line:84%
for minus A, which implies
since x is the supremum of A--

01:10:13.665 --> 01:10:23.340 align:middle line:90%


01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.890 align:middle line:84%
so since x is the
supremum of minus A,

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:27.330 align:middle line:90%
it's the least upper bound.

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:29.535 align:middle line:84%
So it has to be less
than or equal to minus y.

01:10:29.535 --> 01:10:32.460 align:middle line:90%


01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And flipping the
inequality again on that

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
means that y is
less than or equal

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to minus x which is
what we wanted to prove.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Thus, the inf of A exists.

01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've, in fact,
showed that it's

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:08.770 align:middle line:84%
equal to the sup of minus
A. So in an ordered field

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:10.270 align:middle line:84%
with the least upper
bound property,

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
not only does every set which is
bounded above have a supremum,

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
every set which is bounded
below has an infimum.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.740 align:middle line:90%


01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So now, we move on and not
talk about generalities,

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:33.490 align:middle line:84%
but we're just going to focus
on R, the set of real numbers.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to, again, state

01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:38.220 align:middle line:84%
this theorem about
the existence of R

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and its properties,
so just to bring this

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
all back to our goal of
describing exactly what R is

01:11:54.220 --> 01:12:01.190 align:middle line:84%
or what separates it
from Q is that-- so there

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:17.490 align:middle line:84%
exists a unique ordered
field with the least

01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
upper bound property
containing Q.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:46.030 align:middle line:90%
And this field we denote by R.

01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So Q does-- just
to bring this back,

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:56.980 align:middle line:84%
so we started off in ancient
times with the natural numbers.

01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.458 align:middle line:84%
We moved to the
integers so that we

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
could take additive
inverses, although they

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't call them that.

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.752 align:middle line:90%
And we wanted 0.

01:13:04.752 --> 01:13:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we moved to
the rational numbers

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't have
ways to solve the equation

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.440 align:middle line:90%
2x plus 1 equals 0.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.440 align:middle line:90%


01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we moved on
from Q to R essentially

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:25.720 align:middle line:84%
because we can't solve the
equation x squared minus 2

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.100 align:middle line:90%
equals 0.

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And this inability to
solve x squared minus 2

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:41.190 align:middle line:84%
equals 0, although an
algebraic fact, in fact

01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
means that Q is incomplete
as an ordered set.

01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:47.355 align:middle line:84%
It does not have this
least upper bound property.

01:13:47.355 --> 01:13:51.220 align:middle line:90%


01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And what characterizes
the real numbers

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:58.800 align:middle line:84%
is that it is an ordered
field containing Q.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's the unique one with
the least upper bound property.

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:06.510 align:middle line:90%


01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:14.280 align:middle line:84%
This unique should
be kind of in quotes

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.190 align:middle line:84%
because unique up to
what's called isomorphism.

01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Isomorphism is a fancy way of
saying what you call apples

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I call manzanas, essentially.

01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:34.517 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is what R is.

01:14:34.517 --> 01:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the unique ordered
field with the least

01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:42.780 align:middle line:84%
upper bound property
containing Q.

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to
prove this theorem.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
The way you usually
prove this theorem,

01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:53.170 align:middle line:84%
you construct R either as
what are called Dedekind cuts

01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%
or as equivalence classes
of Cauchy sequences.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:06.620 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about Cauchy
sequences soon-ish.

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'm more interested in
proving properties about R,

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and then going on to
functions on R, limits,

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
which is what analysis is,
is the study of limits,

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.650 align:middle line:84%
rather than get tied up in
really non-analytic facts,

01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:29.970 align:middle line:84%
algebraic facts
trying to construct

01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:32.740 align:middle line:90%
this R, the actual field.

01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going to
take this as a given.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going
to go from here

01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and start proving facts
about real numbers.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:44.720 align:middle line:90%


01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:50.645 align:middle line:90%
Where Q failed, R succeeds.

01:15:50.645 --> 01:15:54.250 align:middle line:90%


01:15:54.250 --> 01:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So the first fact is that
there exists a unique element

01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:10.440 align:middle line:84%
in R such that r is positive
and r squared equals 2.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So we saw before that
if I replace this

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.830 align:middle line:84%
with Q, ta rational
number, that's false.

01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:19.770 align:middle line:84%
There does not exist a rational
number whose square is 2.

01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But in the real
numbers, there does.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.150 align:middle line:90%


01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And right now, maybe you're
tempted to just say, yeah,

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
you set R equal to
square root of 2.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is square root of 2?

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you
come up with that guy?

01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So we have to come up with some
element of R whose square is 2.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, we basically
did that a minute

01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:44.000 align:middle line:90%
ago in the rational numbers.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And kind of the same
proof works here.

01:16:47.310 --> 01:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So let E be the set of all x's
in R such that x is positive

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:04.930 align:middle line:90%
and x squared is less than 2.

01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So earlier in the lecture and
at the end of the last lecture,

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.500 align:middle line:90%
we had q here, right?

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same proof, basically
And what we did earlier-- then

01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:30.800 align:middle line:90%
E is bounded above by 2.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.900 align:middle line:90%
So R, which I--

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.890 align:middle line:90%


01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:46.560 align:middle line:90%
so sup E tilde exists in R.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.330 align:middle line:90%
So I have this set.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.400 align:middle line:90%
It's bounded above by 2.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we did
the proof earlier.

01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So by the least upper
bound property of R,

01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:57.300 align:middle line:90%
the supremum exists.

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Call this element little r.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:12.170 align:middle line:90%


01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Then the same proof--

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to do it again
because we've already done it.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And all you need to do
is replace q's with r's--

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:30.040 align:middle line:90%


01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
shows r is bigger
than or equal to 1.

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:35.670 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's bigger than 1.

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:39.300 align:middle line:90%
And r squared equals 2.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So there does exist an
element of r which is positive

01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:47.610 align:middle line:90%
and whose square is 2.

01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, I will prove
that it's unique.

01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:53.470 align:middle line:90%


01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So now, I want to
prove that r is unique.

01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:06.340 align:middle line:90%


01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:08.710 align:middle line:84%
That means if I
take-- if there's

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:11.920 align:middle line:84%
some other element in capital
R that satisfies these two

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
inequalities, then it must
be equal to my original r.

01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So suppose r tilde is in R.
r tilde is bigger than 0.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.090 align:middle line:90%
And r tilde squared equals 2.

01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:35.370 align:middle line:90%


01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Then since their square
is the same number,

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:47.340 align:middle line:84%
namely 2, 0 is equal to
r tilde minus r squared,

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
which equals r tilde
plus r, r tilde minus r.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, both r and r
tilde are positive.

01:19:58.790 --> 01:20:01.160 align:middle line:90%
So r plus r tilde is positive.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.110 align:middle line:90%
In particular, it's non-zero.

01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So since it's a field, I can
therefore divide or multiply

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:10.760 align:middle line:84%
both sides by the additive
inverse of this thing

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and arrive at 0 is equal
to r tilde minus r or r

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:18.870 align:middle line:90%
equals r tilde.

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So there exist only one
element in the real numbers

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.295 align:middle line:84%
which is positive and
whose square is 2.

01:20:25.295 --> 01:20:30.750 align:middle line:90%


01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'll put it on the
assignment, namely that--

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:43.470 align:middle line:90%
so this shows what?

01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Square root of 2 exists.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But you can then show a
cube root of 2 exists in R.

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:05.050 align:middle line:90%
And we'll not prove this.

01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But you can show, in general,
that if x is in R, then x

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:18.190 align:middle line:90%
to the 1 over n--

01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that should say x-- is positive
for all natural numbers.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:33.620 align:middle line:90%


01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.320 align:middle line:90%
So where Q failed, R succeeds.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing
this-- or the fact

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
that it does succeed
is not coming

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:45.320 align:middle line:84%
from an algebraic
property of R. It's

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:48.980 align:middle line:84%
coming from this
property about its order.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:52.010 align:middle line:90%


01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:55.210 align:middle line:90%
All right, we'll stop there.

01:21:55.210 --> 01:22:04.000 align:middle line:90%

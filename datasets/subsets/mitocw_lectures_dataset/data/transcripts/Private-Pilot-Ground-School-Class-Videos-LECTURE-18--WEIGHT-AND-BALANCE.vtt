00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.952
[CLICKING]

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:14.810
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
All right, folks.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.880
Tina is going to tell you more.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.180
We had a little bit
of weight and balance

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.850
before that flight
planning example,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.970
but Tina is now going to
give you the real story.

00:00:24.807 --> 00:00:27.140
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So are guys
all ready to go out and get

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.960
your drone license?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.690
Good.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.480
I'm really glad.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.995
PHILIP GREENSPUN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.120
TINA SRIVASTAVA: All right.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.020
Weight and balance So
we talked a little bit.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.260
We've actually had quite a
few discussions throughout

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.310
about stability, about
where the center of G

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.800
is, how that affects
your controllability

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.070
of the aircraft.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.910
So weight and balance is
not only an important thing

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.770
to know, but it's
a required thing

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.080
that you have to do before
you go flying each time.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.260
And one thing
that's also relevant

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.090
is to understand the
center of gravity,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.090
and you want to make sure
that center of gravity

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.430
is within the limits
for your given aircraft.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.360
So we talked about--

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.660
yesterday, when we were talking
about aerodynamic flight,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.330
that certain aircraft
have to be reinforced

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.050
to do certain operations.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.860
So again, it really
has to do with that.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.360
And by the way,
from yesterday, mark

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.815
left behind some of his
aerodynamic procedure diagrams.

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:33.340
So if you want to take a look
at that, those are up front.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.840
Well, one thing
that really you have

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.900
to keep in mind in terms of
what the aircraft can handle

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.540
is just what is the
max gross weight.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.700
So what can this airframe
sustain, in terms of stresses

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.570
on its body.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.350
We also talked this
morning about performance

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.270
and discussed certain
things like the distance--

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.480
the length of the runway and the
distance you need to take off

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.960
are affected by how the
airplane is weighted.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.410
So we're going to talk about
those things specifically,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.780
and then one thing
I have on here

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.300
is if you go over
your gross weight,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.600
then you get into
test pilot territory,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.557
and right after this--

00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:18.140
we'll grab lunch and
come back-- we'll

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.750
hear from [INAUDIBLE],,
a test pilot who's

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.450
going to tell you some
really cool things as well.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.470
All right, so it's just some
basic terms to get started off.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.320
So when you're thinking
about an aircraft,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.920
one piece of information is
its standard empty weight.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.140
So that's the weight
of the airplane,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.110
and there's also
some fuel in the tank

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.670
that sometimes it's hard to
drain, and when you refill,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.090
that fuel sits at the bottom and
can't be used by the aircraft,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.370
so that's the unusable
fuel, and then

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.650
there's some different
fluids and fuel

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.940
oil inside the aircraft.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.490
So all those count
in the calculation

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.410
of the standard empty weight.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.390
There's also the
basic empty weight,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.330
where you have some
optional equipment inside,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.970
and we'll go to a aircraft's POH
to look into what it actually

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.365
reports about what it contains.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.790
There's also a
good rule of thumb

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.450
to know about what weight
you're going to associate

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.710
with the per gallon of fuel.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.240
So it's generally a good
number is six pounds.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.710
For the fuel that
you'll be using,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.965
it's slightly more for
different types of fuel.

00:03:28.965 --> 00:03:30.590
So right at the
beginning of the class,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.890
we talked about weight,
which is the force pulling

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.170
the aircraft down, which has to
oppose the lift pulling it up.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.650
So the weight actually
becomes less as you burn fuel.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.670
So when you take off, you have
all the fuel on the aircraft.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.560
As you've been flying
for a while, that

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.820
fuel is used in the
aircraft has less weight.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.960
So there's a fully
loaded aircraft.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.020
Has something called
the maximum ramp weight.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.530
So that has fuel that
will be expended even

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.440
when it's just taxiing
over to the runway,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.590
and so you make certain
assumptions about how

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.240
much fuel you'll
actually burn off

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.710
just taxiing up to the runway
and then before you take off.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.110
And so when you're calculating
the weight of the airplane

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.029
when it takes off,
it'll be slightly

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.940
different than how you fueled
it when it was sitting parking

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.580
on the ramp.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.500
OK, some of the
biggest things that you

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.870
would keep in mind that
you change every time you

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.160
get into the airplane.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.050
So there's the weight
of the passengers,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.760
the baggage you take
with you, and then

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.260
how much fuel you fill the
plane with before you take off.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.890
So the payload in this case is
the passengers and the cargo.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.190
So whatever baggage and
the weight of those bags

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.190
that you take with you.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.160
So one thing to keep in mind
in addition to just the weight,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.450
we have to figure out where
that vector, that force vector,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.260
acts on the aircraft.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.253
If all of the weight
is really at the front,

00:05:01.253 --> 00:05:02.670
you might have a
center of gravity

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.360
at the front, which will create
a moment on the airplane.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.040
So it'll cause it to bend
in a particular direction.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.650
And if all that
weight was acting

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.025
at the back of
the plane, you had

00:05:12.025 --> 00:05:14.820
a lot of really heavy bricks
at your tail, which is not

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.520
a good idea, it would
cause that force vector

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.740
to act over here
and create a moment.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.170
So that's all related to torque,
which we talked about before.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.710
So it's also important,
not just to calculate

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.570
what the weight
is of the airplane

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.910
once everybody and
everything is inside,

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.540
but also how that weight is
distributed in the airplane

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.880
and how it affects the
airplane's center of gravity.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.970
All right, so I think that
many of you have already--

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.270
It looks like most
folks in the rooms

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.360
were either MIT undergrad
or grad student, which

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.240
means you already understand
some of these basic physics

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.820
terms about torque
and moment, so we'll

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.220
discover them very briefly.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.790
The moment is the
weight times the arm.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.900
So basically where the wait
is times how far away it

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.900
is from a particular location
that you're calculating it

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.800
from.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.140
So we're going to do a
couple basic examples.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.090
So we have a seesaw here.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.980
So in this case, whenever
you're calculating your moment,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.630
you have to pick
a reference point

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.690
and make sure you're
consistent as you use it.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.210
So in this case, they have a--

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.620
their data point
is at that triangle

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.990
at that fulcrum in the
middle, and so they

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.260
have a moment on the right
and a moment on the left.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.840
So you see various
rectangles that

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.440
represent different objects
or different weight,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.670
and then they calculate it.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.290
So that blue box that's five
pounds is 10 inches away.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.170
So to figure out what the
moment is that it applies,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.330
you just calculate the
weight times how far away is.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.350
OK, so in order to figure out
what the center of gravity is,

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.290
you might want to
consider where you're

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.830
doing that reference point.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.890
So rather than doing
the reference point

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.583
from right in the middle of
the aircraft, in this case,

00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:06.750
they're starting at the end.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.500
So where that yellow
line is where it says

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.710
datum is where they're
starting, and then they're

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.660
using the length from
that same reference point.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.650
So now you have a purple
box of five pounds

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.280
that's 10 inches from that
datum, and then three pounds

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.650
then a green weight
that's father,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.830
and the red box that's
the farthest away.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.840
So here they've listed
all those different boxes

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.660
and the weight of each of those
boxes times how far it is.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.780
You multiply that to get
the moment that it applies.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.420
And use that to
calculate the location

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.890
of the center of gravity.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.160
And just in terms of if you've
been on a seesaw before,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.893
who has been on a seesaw before?

00:07:51.893 --> 00:07:52.560
All right, good.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.030
I'm glad.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.090
So as you know that
that fulcrum or where

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.520
that triangle is, if
you put that triangle

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.150
at the center of gravity.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.343
So all the kids sitting
on one side of the seesaw

00:08:04.343 --> 00:08:05.760
weigh the same as
the kids sitting

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.640
on the other side of the seesaw
at the appropriate lengths

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.830
away, so they're
applying the same moment.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.940
Then the fulcrum balances.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.750
So if we determined what
the center of gravity

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.618
of this airplane was and
I put my finger there,

00:08:18.618 --> 00:08:20.160
then it would balance
and it wouldn't

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.400
tilt one way or the other.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.380
So that's the whole idea.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.980
So for a given aircraft,
there is not only

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.210
the center of gravity, but
in the testing process,

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.480
they understand what is
that approved range of where

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.780
that center of gravity can be
such that the aircraft is still

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.100
stable.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.220
So if you're thinking about
putting a lot of weight

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.820
at the front of the
aircraft and less weight

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.250
at the back of the aircraft,
then the center of gravity

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.590
moves forward, and
there's a limit

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.350
to how far forward
that center of gravity

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.160
can be that allows the
plane still to be stable.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.740
So that's the forward
CG limit, and then you

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.120
see the same thing at the back.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.330
Aft just means back, so how
far back the center of gravity

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.010
can be.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.840
All right, so we've
already discussed some

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.320
of the performance things, but
just to just to remind you,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.280
what are some of the things that
can happen if your air plane is

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.540
overloaded?

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.670
You want to just a
shout out some things

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.230
that you would
experience if you have

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.314
a very, very heavy airplane.

00:09:27.314 --> 00:09:29.110
AUDIENCE: Longer take off.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.600
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yes, very good.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.760
Just to repeat it,
longer to take off.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.010
So we have takeoff and
landing distances increase.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.280
So if you have a
very heavy airplane,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.085
you may not be able to take
off from a short field runway.

00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:45.460
And then of course
it was talking

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.990
about if your aircraft gets
outside the approved envelope,

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.380
it will talk about what
we mean by envelope,

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.640
then it hasn't been tested
to be stable at those areas,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.340
and so now you've become a
test pilot, which you may not

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.490
want to do.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.630
Again, we're going to hear
from a test pilot very soon.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.560
OK, so what happens
if-- not just

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.480
that it's overloaded,
maybe it's still

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.910
within the envelope for
the total amount of weight,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.210
but what if the
center of gravity

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.080
has moved too far forward and
pass that forward CG limit.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.500
So your plane naturally
wants to be nose down.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.060
So what is the impact of that?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.450
Well, it'd be harder
to climb, right?

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.900
It's harder to climb
because your nose keeps

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.350
pulling it down, for example.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.650
What does it mean to have
a stall speed increased?

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.424
Is that a good thing?

00:10:41.424 --> 00:10:43.322
AUDIENCE: No.

00:10:43.322 --> 00:10:44.530
TINA SRIVASTAVA: And why not?

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.820
Why is it not a good thing?

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.450
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah, so
basically, if your stall speed

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.590
has increased, that means you're
likely to stall at a higher

00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.530
speed.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:04.020
So if traditionally
can fly at 60 knots

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.260
without stalling but that
stall speed has increased from

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.900
say 40 knots up
to 60 knots, that

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.460
means that when
you traditionally

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.320
have been able to fly
safely at 60 knots,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.000
you could actually
stall at 60 knots.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.250
So an increased
stall speed is bad.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.960
And what about an aft CG?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.170
Having the weight
too far to the back.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.915
What is the impact there?

00:11:27.915 --> 00:11:29.390
AUDIENCE: They pitch up.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.260
TINA SRIVASTAVA: They
tend to pitch up.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:30.760
Right.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.150
And so one thing that they are
talking about here is flare.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.810
So this is when you're coming
into land, you go down,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.400
but then you flare up, and
it could actually over flare,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.220
and that can cause some really
strange things when you're

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.870
trying to land,
such as bouncing,

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.720
and you definitely
don't want to do that.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.470
But all of these things
you might actually

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.260
just notice when you're
feeling the airplane.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.930
It acts differently
than you want it to act.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.840
So here's just basically
a cross section.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.900
If you took off the wings
and the top of the fuselage

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.340
and you were looking
at the plane,

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.140
it shows you the pilot
sitting in the left seat,

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.490
a passenger in the right seat,
two passengers in the back.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.210
This one actually has a third
row of passengers, and then

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.280
two baggage compartments.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.960
So this is just showing--

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.210
traditionally, when you're
loading up an airplane,

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.300
they payload again is your
passengers and your baggage,

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.225
where do they sit?

00:12:28.225 --> 00:12:30.350
So now I'm going to go over
to this document viewer

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.130
and talk about
specific airplane.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:39.220
The plane I like to
fly, a Cessna 172.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.310
OK, so this book is talking
about a particular aircraft,

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.520
a Skyhawk, so it's a Cessna 172.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.290
This is a plane that
many of you guys

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.110
might use as a flying aircraft.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.640
We've also talked
about for example

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.760
a Piper, which is a low wing
airplane that you might use.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.260
So this is what a
Cessna looks like,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.770
and it has a tricycle
gear at the bottom.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.550
Whatever plane you are
using for training,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.960
I would get very
familiar with this book,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.550
and in particular, remember
what the table of contents is.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.440
Because when you get your oral
exam on your FAA examination,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.390
it's OK if you don't
remember everything.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.180
What's really great is if you
know how to find information,

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.630
and you can say, hey, if
I didn't remember this,

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.480
I would go look at my
POH, and I would go look

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.850
at the weight and balance
section, section 6 of my book,

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.870
and I'd be able to flip and find
this information very quickly.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.113
So oftentimes, you'll get
questions in that oral exam

00:13:36.113 --> 00:13:37.530
where they would
ask how you would

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.630
go about finding information.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.850
We discussed that a lot
with regard to weather data.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.600
What are the sources
of weather data,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.450
so with regard to
weight and balance,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.580
the information
about your airplane

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.720
is found with a book made
about your particular airplane.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.220
And if you're at a
particular flight school,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.840
and we'll show you
that in an example,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.340
they might have a-- they most
likely have all of this weight

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.040
and balance information
listed in a spreadsheet,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.110
sometimes it's
accessible online so you

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.380
know for your exact airplane
what its gross weight is.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.320
So if we flip to
that section 6, it

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.660
has a fair amount of
information, including

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.340
the picture we just showed you.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.060
So it talks about--

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.730
in this case, there are
only two rows of seats.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.460
So that the pilot and
passenger, one row of seats,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.912
so it seats four people, and
then it has a baggage area.

00:14:32.912 --> 00:14:34.620
But what's really
important to understand

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.800
is that even though the
Cessna can fit four people,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:43.620
it will show you that if you put
four 200 pound people in there

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.848
with a bunch of bags, you'll
actually exceed the allotment.

00:14:46.848 --> 00:14:48.390
So just because
there are four seats,

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.660
doesn't mean you can take
four large people on a flight.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.930
Some of it is something
we'll keep in mind,

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.650
and maybe you can reduce bags
and reduce fuel such that you

00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.970
can make that weight workout.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.220
So we talked about envelopes.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.510
So the envelope is
basically a line

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.340
on this graph that shows where
the center of gravity can be,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.770
and the envelope is
where is it safe to be.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.260
So if you're inside
the envelope,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.460
so inside this line, if
your calculations result

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.620
in a center of gravity
inside, then you're

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.920
within the envelope.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.745
If you're outside of
it, then you're not.

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:36.660
You can see a little
pencil mark towards the top

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.850
where I took a flight
recently, and I

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.820
was trying to calculate
whether or not I was inside

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.140
and in fact I was.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.930
And it's OK that I'm right
at the edge of the envelope.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.670
As long as you're
inside, you're still

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.190
with inside the tested limits.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.230
Now, there are two
different categories

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.640
or two different lines here.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.520
There's a bigger line
that says normal category,

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.860
and then there's
a smaller line--

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.380
smaller envelope-- that's
talking about utility category.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.880
Does anyone know
what the difference

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.338
is between normal and utility?

00:16:06.338 --> 00:16:08.290
AUDIENCE: G limits.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.940
TINA SRIVASTAVA: G limits.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.110
Is that what you're
going to say?

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.200
So there's different
restrictions.

00:16:16.562 --> 00:16:18.520
One question you might
get asked is, how do you

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.900
find out where the answer is?

00:16:29.312 --> 00:16:30.270
And it's right in here.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.437
Right where you think it is.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.530
And I'm actually going to
show you real examples,

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:42.490
so we're going to go through
an example of loading up

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.087
an airplane.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.670
Don't want to embarrass
anyone, but we

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.795
might ask some of you
what your weight is.

00:16:47.795 --> 00:16:48.295
So beware.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.730
So every time you have
to calculate your weight

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.570
and balance, you
can do it by hand,

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.990
or you can use a
computer to do it,

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.560
and I would just caution
that you have to double check

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.490
all the information.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.819
So here's a great
link that tells you

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:11.869
for a particular Cessna 172, a
weight and balance calculator.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:15.790
So here, you can actually
type in the empty weight.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.152
Now, there's a big Warning
here, use your own AC data.

00:17:19.152 --> 00:17:19.985
What is that saying?

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.619
What is AC?

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:25.430
AUDIENCE: Aircraft.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.000
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Aircraft.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.380
Use your own aircraft's data.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.440
So look at your
actual information

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.890
from your school to
figure out for the plane

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.270
that you're renting what those
pieces of information are.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.020
So here is a link from
east coast aero club

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.030
just as an example,
and they have

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.880
provided for every
aircraft that they

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.740
have a bunch of information.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.310
So for each aircraft, they
have provided the empty weight

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:01.450
and the CG, the moment,
gross weight, useful load,

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.810
and then they also talk
about two different settings

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:05.750
for fuel.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:09.700
So you can have full
fuel or fuel to tabs.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.570
So that is something you'll
hear pretty frequently.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.200
Fill the fuel to tabs.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.780
So if you want to have
extra mass, extra weight

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.120
in your plane, you have some
heavier folks flying with you,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.480
you might only want
the fuel to tabs.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.550
But if it's just you or
you and your instructor

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.590
and you want to fly a
cross-country flight,

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.360
you might want to fuel full.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.760
So these are all
things you can change.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.960
This calculator has
some restrictions,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:43.610
which is that the weight is
identified here in terms of--

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.945
so they have the oil.

00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:48.290
So you might want to
check what is the oil

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.600
level inside your engine.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.638
For a Cessna 172, six quarts is
a really good number to have,

00:18:54.638 --> 00:18:56.930
but you check it every time
and during your pre-flight.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.365
It could be five quarts,
it could be seven quarts,

00:18:59.365 --> 00:19:00.740
so you want to
double check that.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.980
And of course, if you
see that it's low,

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.000
four quarts, you really
want to ask someone

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.700
to fill that up
before you go flying.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.980
But the other thing
here is you actually

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.970
list the weight of the
people that are sitting

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.680
in the front and the back.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.410
So I talked about
embarrassing folks.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.900
Well, let's not let's not
embarrass folks right now.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.990
So let's say the
pilot and let's say

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.330
you're doing some great
resource management.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.385
You have another pilot
sitting next to you,

00:19:28.385 --> 00:19:32.540
so your co-pilot is
there, and you also

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:37.220
have some big folks sitting
in the back, both the left

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.540
and the right side.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.050
And you want to take a
bunch of pictures and stuff,

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.340
but you want to get
as low as you want,

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.430
so you put in some bags.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.870
So this-- it's actually
hard to see because there's

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.040
too much weight.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.970
This red little
plus sign is showing

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.820
where your center
of gravity fell

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.560
and whether it's within that
utility or normal category.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.660
So in this case, we
have three people.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.350
Front two are 200
pounds each, one person

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:13.110
in the rear with 200, and bags
there weighing about 10 pounds.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.630
Is this safe to fly?

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.560
No, so you're a little red
dot went outside the limits.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.470
If you have a much
smaller person sitting

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.500
in the back seat, you
cross over that line,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.960
and now you're back into
the normal categories

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.490
so you can fly.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.070
Again, another
thing you can alter

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:38.870
is, of course, you
fill the fuel to tabs.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.010
So this is also talking about--

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:47.143
so most of the time in the
POH book, so the section 6

00:20:47.143 --> 00:20:48.310
is about weight and balance.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.820
So although the
one example I just

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.660
showed you was for a Cessna
172, the Piper Warrior

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.210
also has that
consistent, so really

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:01.790
recommend just memorizing the
table of contents for your POH.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.930
So the way that you go
about calculating it

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.540
is the same way we entered it
into their little calculator.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.870
So first you have to determine
the basic empty weight

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.110
of the aircraft and
then the moment.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.740
Section 6 almost always
also has a place for you

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.020
to do that calculation,
and so they

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.240
have a place right
there where you

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.750
can enter in your
airplane, the moment,

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.570
and it does the same steps
that we just saw on the slide.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.850
So you start with that
basic empty weight,

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.180
then you focus on the
fuel, and it gives you

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.330
the 6 pounds per
gallon is what you're

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.370
going to most likely be using.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.710
What is the max
number of gallons?

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.440
What is the amount for tabs?

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.200
You want to actually look
this up for your airplane.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.960
The weight of the pilot
in the front passenger,

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.320
rear passengers, and the
baggage area, and then you

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.630
get this ramp weight.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.580
And as I talked about,
you can actually

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.730
have your plane be a little
heavier than the envelope right

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.680
when it's fueled on the
ramp because there's

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.898
some allowance for the fuel that
you'll burn off during a taxi,

00:22:08.898 --> 00:22:09.940
and so that's right here.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.110
So fuel allowance for engine
start, taxi, and run up.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.380
So they took off about
eight pounds over there,

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.970
and then you can calculate it.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.070
And once you locate
the point, then you

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.470
go to that diagram right here.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.690
So you go to the
weight and the moment,

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.698
and you figure out whether
or not you're in the safe--

00:22:29.698 --> 00:22:31.240
whether or not you're
in the envelope

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.760
for that normal
category of aircraft.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.980
So what we just went through
is the same procedure

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.120
that's listed right here.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.900
And so here is it just
doing that same example

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.810
for a particular Piper Warrior.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.410
So they have the basic empty
weight of the aircraft.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.660
Just as a hint, if it's
something round like 1,500,

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.470
then you probably didn't get
the exact accurate amount.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.320
So again, if you look
at the real thing,

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:06.160
you're getting it down to some
very specific accurate numbers.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.060
So 1,196.63.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.530
That means you
got a real number.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.690
Here's our Piper Warrior.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.500
And so they have the basic
empty weight, the passengers

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.530
in the front and the rear.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.060
They don't have any
bags here right now,

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.230
and they basically multiplied
the weight times the arm.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.930
The arm is really
indicated in the book

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.510
and in these
calculators as to where

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.520
the location is of the chair.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.700
Now, of course, the seats
slide forward and back,

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.950
but they usually don't--
they don't get into that many

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.320
specifics, and then you can
calculate here the moment.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.660
So next, we do the
ramp condition.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.150
So ramp condition
is basically, what's

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.490
the weight and loading
of your airplane

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.770
once it's fueled up and
sitting on the ramp?

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.600
Then you, in this
case, they took off

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.690
seven pounds for
that taxi, and run up

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.900
and then you're takeoff
condition, in this case,

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:10.420
is 2,440 pounds, and it has
a moment here as calculated.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.970
So you basically do the
same thing we just showed.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.760
So you you look at the
weight on the left,

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.370
and the CG location
as the vertical line,

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.590
and you see where those
two lines intersect

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.681
and you see whether or not
it's inside the envelope.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.640
You can also check
the landing condition.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.450
In general, you will have
burned fuel during your flight,

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:36.290
and so your landing
condition will be lower,

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.380
but you might have
heard big jets,

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.100
and you've heard that sometimes
they have to do a fuel dump.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.840
Why did they have
to do a fuel dump?

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.660
Well, maybe they
calculated their landing

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.382
based on having flown
across the country,

00:24:49.382 --> 00:24:50.840
but their flight
across the country

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.820
was canceled because
of weather or whatever,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.787
and so they had to dump
their fuel in order to land,

00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:58.370
which you don't like to hear is
once they've dumped their fuel

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.500
then you have another delay in
the air, and you're like, hey,

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.083
what happened?

00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:03.560
I thought we dumped
all of our fuel.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.020
But of course, as a
small little airplane,

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.060
dumping fuel is not
really a procedure

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.030
you're going to be doing,
so it might be a good idea

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.750
to just calculate the landing
and the runway lengths

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:19.220
with the full fuel in case you
have to make it landing right

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.010
then and there before you've
flown all the distance you

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.300
thought you were
going to get to fly.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:30.710
So in general, as you can see
that where we were beforehand

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.620
was higher and the
weight goes down,

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.940
so your landing condition
is almost always

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.710
going to stay
within the envelope.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.450
There's some places,
where if you're CG

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.830
is too far aft or
too far forward,

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.930
where actually that
reduction in weight

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.171
could cause you to come
outside the envelope.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.530
All right, so there are also a
lot of spreadsheets available.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.410
You can make your own
spreadsheet pretty quickly

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.920
in Excel using the data
from the particular aircraft

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.420
that you're renting or buying.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.220
All right, and these
are just some snapshots

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.020
from the book that
we just looked at

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.540
and the show pictures
of where the seats are

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.350
in the airplane in order
for you to calculate that.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:19.910
You could also calculate
the moment left to right.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.800
It's pretty easy to
think about, though,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.750
that in that tiny
little airplane,

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.287
if you're sitting on the
front in the left and no one's

00:26:26.287 --> 00:26:28.370
sitting on your right and
you have someone sitting

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.610
in the back on the left, then
you're going to be tilted over.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.370
It's very easy to
fix that problem,

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.680
just make sure you have someone
sitting on the other side.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.540
I have noticed some of
these effects before.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.080
I'm a little bit of
a smaller person,

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.140
and there was a very, very large
instructor sitting next to me,

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.750
and I actually could tell
as I was flying that it

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.370
was a little bit tilted.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.100
And so with the future
flights, we put some more bags

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.250
on my side, and it was a
little bit more evened out.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.130
Usually, you won't run into
that too much as an issue.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:02.570
In some of the small puddle
jumper aircraft and so

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:06.650
a commercial aircraft, they
have sometimes a situation

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.322
where there's only one
row of seats on one side

00:27:10.322 --> 00:27:11.780
and then there's
the aisle and then

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.407
two seats on the other side.

00:27:13.407 --> 00:27:14.990
Have you guys seen
that configuration?

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.710
I'm getting a lot of head nods.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.270
So in that situation,
they might enforce

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.940
that you have to sit in the
seat that was assigned to you.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.420
And when people try to
move from the side that

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.787
only had one seat in
the row to the side that

00:27:28.787 --> 00:27:31.370
has two seats because they just
want more space to spread out,

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.537
they might say, hey, for
weight and balance reasons,

00:27:33.537 --> 00:27:37.040
you have to sit in the seat
that was assigned for takeoff

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.290
and so that's what
they're talking about.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.480
There any questions
about weight and balance?

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.280
Do you guys think you
could do weight and balance

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.580
calculations?

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.080
Yes?

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.540
OK, I'm getting a lot of head
nods, so everyone took physics.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.040
That's good.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.620
Good job.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.120
Yes?

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.129
AUDIENCE: So I assume that
[INAUDIBLE] the helicopter has

00:28:03.129 --> 00:28:05.524
lateral elements in the chart.

00:28:05.524 --> 00:28:08.400
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.230
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Helicopter question.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.320
I will actually defer to
Philip, who flies helicopters

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.410
quite frequently.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.300
So once he's back, we'll ask
him about helicopter CG limits.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.610
Good question.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.074
Anything else?

00:28:23.074 --> 00:28:24.026
Yes?

00:28:24.026 --> 00:28:32.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.030
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
So the question is,

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.710
when you're actually
flying, do you

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.603
do this calculation
every single time,

00:28:38.603 --> 00:28:40.520
or do you mostly only
do it when you're really

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.690
loading the aircraft?

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.790
So it's actually
required that you have

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.662
the weight and balance done.

00:28:45.662 --> 00:28:47.870
The reason you don't do it
every single time, though,

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.340
is you frequently fly in
the same configuration.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.550
So if you rent from
a flight school,

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.940
you might frequently rent
you know a couple aircraft,

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.960
and you might frequently
fly just yourself,

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.570
doing a solo flight, or
fly with your instructor.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.150
So you might just keep
it stored that you

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.240
have a couple of pieces of
paper in your flight bag

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.000
that are the weight and balance
calculations for what you

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.520
almost always fly
and is almost always

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.580
within the normal
category envelope.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.670
But you definitely want
to do those calculations

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.460
if you're getting
passengers in the back seat.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.890
Whenever we go on
these MIT fly outs,

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.080
we actually ask people
for their weights,

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.070
and it's actually a
big restriction too.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.443
So when we're trying to
get passengers to sit down,

00:29:33.443 --> 00:29:35.360
just because I fly
assessment with four seats,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.980
as we just saw from the example,
I don't have four pass--

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.810
I don't have three
passengers to offer.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.690
I often say, I have
220 pounds available,

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:49.160
and so they then have to sort
out, Sebastian and his team,

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.963
as to who to assign to my
plane versus another plane.

00:29:52.963 --> 00:29:54.380
And also, if people
aren't being--

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.743
if you notice people aren't
being overly forthcoming

00:29:56.743 --> 00:29:58.160
about their weight,
you might want

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.440
to increase the amount
that they gave you.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.870
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Yeah, let me add that--

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.180
obviously, have a
lot more experience

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:12.222
being over overweight than
Tina might have, but also--

00:30:12.222 --> 00:30:13.930
actually, these pants
are a good example.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.060
20 years ago, some
friends and I,

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.120
we made a web front end to
a Levi Strauss factory that

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.130
could make custom cut khakis.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.660
So we asked people
in the web form

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.820
when they ordered what's
your waist size, what's

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.520
your inseam, what's
your height and weight.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.000
And from that, we
had software to try

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.287
to infer their actual weight,
their actual waist size,

00:30:35.287 --> 00:30:37.370
and then we make them--
you can't really see this,

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.790
but these pants just
say pair number 7.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.490
They don't say anything about
what size it actually is.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.820
They would get their pants--

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.660
this was in 1997.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.720
They would get their
pants, if they didn't fit,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.303
they'd say, look, it needs to
be a little looser in the waist.

00:30:50.303 --> 00:30:52.370
It needs to be a little
shorter, and then

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.520
a revised pair would be
made and sent to them,

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.130
but we never relied
on their stated weight

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.872
or their stated
waist size, exactly.

00:31:00.872 --> 00:31:03.080
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Philip,
there was a question for you

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.950
that I wasn't able to
answer about helicopter CGs,

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.210
and really thinking
it was the lateral CG.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:10.710
What was your
question specifically?

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.250
PHILIP GREENSPUN: It's very
hard to get a-- the question is

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:19.240
it's very hard to get a
helicopter out of lateral CG,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.230
as with an aircraft.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.350
If you have to have you people
in the back and a light person

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:29.700
in the front, it's easy to
get out of front back CG,

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.160
longitudinal CG, but--

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.660
TINA SRIVASTAVA: He's talking
about, what we just discussed,

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.493
it's frequently the
case that you might have

00:31:36.493 --> 00:31:39.490
a forward CG or an aft
CG, but you don't usually

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.810
have an issue with the CG on
the left or the right, unless--

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.090
it's very visible in
a four seat aircraft

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:48.548
how to fix those
types of problems.

00:31:48.548 --> 00:31:50.423
PHILIP GREENSPUN: One
issue with the Robinson

00:31:50.423 --> 00:31:52.510
is they put the main
fuel tank on the left,

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.970
so they're budgeting for--

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.490
in a solo situation, a pilot
of at least a certain minimum

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.440
weight in the front right.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.320
So very lightweight,
sometimes when

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.630
teenagers are learning
to fly helicopters,

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.790
they have to add a
little bit of ballast,

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.240
let's say like a big
heavy gym weight.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.810
A 50 pound gym
weight in the front

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.790
left footwell or something.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.640
AUDIENCE: The other thing
that could go wrong is--

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.850
so when you do your pre-flight,
one of the things that you do

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.890
is that if you're sitting
in the pilot's seat, so

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.040
on the left side,
so to your right

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.810
in the middle at
the bottom, there's

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.300
a little knob where you
can say whether you want

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.990
the fuel to be coming from
the left tank, the right tank,

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.860
or both.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.830
And pretty much, all
the time, the checklist

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.663
says that after you've
parked the plane,

00:32:40.663 --> 00:32:42.580
you want to twist it to
the left or the right,

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.110
and the reason is
you don't want--

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.850
while it's sitting
there, fuel to be

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.960
sloshing across the plane,
and so you set it to left,

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.020
for example.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.590
Now, if you skipped that
step, even though it comes up

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.020
several times throughout
your pre-flight

00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.160
and then your run up check,
if you didn't put the fuel

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.430
to draw from both tanks and
it's only drawing from one tank,

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:07.598
then you might experience
that instability.

00:33:07.598 --> 00:33:09.390
PHILIP GREENSPUN: All
right, why don't we--

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.280
should we take a 15-minute
break so people can run out,

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.890
grab food, bring it back,
and then we'll hear from

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.150
[INAUDIBLE] about--

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.870
TINA SRIVASTAVA: The test pilot
and life potentially outside

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.570
of the limits.

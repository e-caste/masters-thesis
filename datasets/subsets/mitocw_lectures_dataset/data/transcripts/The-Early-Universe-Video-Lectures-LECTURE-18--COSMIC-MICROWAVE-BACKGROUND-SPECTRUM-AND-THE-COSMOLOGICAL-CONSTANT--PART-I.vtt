00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:26.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.130
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.300
Let's get started.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.060
Let me just begin by asking
if there are any questions,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.960
either about logistical issues
or about physics issues?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.860
OK.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.650
Today we'll be
finishing our discussion

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.090
of black-body
radiation by talking

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.480
about the actual spectrum of
the cosmic microwave background

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.480
that we find in our universe.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.520
And then move on to talk about
the rather exciting discovery

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.810
in 1998 of the fact that
our universe today appears

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.480
to have a nonzero
cosmological constant.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.490
So I want to begin by reviewing
what we did last time.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.269
And one of the reasons
why I do this is I

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:17.810
think it's a good
opportunity for you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.690
to ask questions that don't
occur to you the first time we

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.190
go through.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.690
And that, from my
point of view, has

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.950
been an extraordinary success.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.470
I think you've asked
great questions.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.010
So we'll see what
comes up today.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.440
We began the last
lecture by recalling,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.080
I think from the previous
lecture actually,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.810
the basic formulas for
black-body radiation, which

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.280
is just the
radiation of massless

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.020
particles at a
given temperature.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.800
And we have formulas for the
energy density, the pressure,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.370
the number density, and the
entropy density, all of which

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.530
are given in terms of
two constants, little g

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.580
and little g star, which
is the only place where

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.230
the actual nature of
the matter comes in.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.150
G and g-star are both
equal to 2 for photons,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.310
but these formulas
allow us to talk

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.590
about other kinds of
black-body radiation

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.660
as well, black-body radiation
of other kinds of particles.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.280
As neutrinos are
also effectively

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.690
massless, so they contribute.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.820
And in addition, e
plus e minus pairs,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.020
if the temperature
gets hot enough so

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.880
that the mass of the
electrons becomes negligible

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.770
compared to kt, also contribute
to the cosmic background

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.820
radiation.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.504
And if we want the
higher temperatures,

00:02:38.504 --> 00:02:40.170
other particle will
start to contribute.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.750
And at the highest
temperatures all particles

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.060
act like black-body radiation.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.430
The general formula
for g and g star

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.220
is that there is a factor
out front that depends on

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.210
whether the particle is
a boson or a fermion,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.860
a particle which does or does
not obey the Pauli exclusion

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.870
principle.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.980
Fermions do not, bosons-- excuse
me, I said that backwards.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.670
Fermions obey the Pauli
exclusion principle,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.100
bosons do not.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.710
G and g star are
both 1 for bosons.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.170
But for fermions there's
a factor of 7/8 for g

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.570
and 3/4 for g star.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.070
Yes?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.820
AUDIENCE: Would you
mind quickly restating

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.270
why the positron-electron
pairs act

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.657
like radiation above
that temperature?

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:30.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.690
The question is, why do
electron-positron pairs

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.784
act like radiation at
these high temperatures?

00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:37.450
And the answer is
that radiation is just

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.410
characterized by the fact that
the particles are effectively

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.840
massless.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.110
And the effective
energy scale is

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.450
kt, that's the average thermal
energy in a thermal mix.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.470
So as long as m e c squared
is small compared to kt,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.220
electrons and positrons
think that they're

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.140
massless and act like
they're massless.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.680
And as I said, if you go to
higher temperatures still,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.755
all particles will act
like they're massless.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.160
Coming back to the
story of g and g star,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.430
we have the factor out
front which depends on

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.350
whether they're
bosons or fermions.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.570
And then that just
multiplies the total number

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.980
of particle types,
whereby a particle type--

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.410
we made a complete specification
of what kind of a thing it is.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.300
And that includes specifying
what species of particle

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.370
it is, whether it's a
particle or an anti-particle

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.100
if that distinction
exists, and what the spin

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.900
state is if the
particle has spin.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.890
So we can try this out
now on some examples.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.310
First example, will
be neutrinos which

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.090
play a very important role
in the early universe,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.910
and even in the particle number
balance of today's universe.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.320
Neutrinos actually
have a small mass,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.090
as we talked about last time and
as I'll review again this time.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.630
But nonetheless, as far
as cosmology is concerned,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.490
they effectively act
like massless particles

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.490
although the story
about why they

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.775
act like massless particles
is a little complicated.

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:15.400
It's more than just
saying that they're

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.530
mass is small, for
reasons that we'll see.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.360
But anyway, I'm
nonetheless going

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.410
to start by describing neutrinos
as if they were massless,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.520
as was believed to be the
case really until 15 years

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.170
ago or so.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.390
The massless model
of the neutrino

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.330
was a particle which
was always left-handed.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.890
And by left-handed
what I mean is

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.680
that for neutrinos, if
you took the angular

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.740
momentum of the neutrino in
the direction of the momentum,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.680
p hat there means dotted
with the unit vector

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.360
in the direction of
the spatial momentum,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.650
you'd always get minus
1/2 in units of h bar.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.170
And conversely, all new
bars are right-handed which

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.370
just means the same equation
holds with the opposite sign.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.370
So neutrinos always
have spins that oppose

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.070
the direction of motion,
and anti-neutrinos always

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.710
have spins aligned with
the direction of motion.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.140
Now, it's not obvious
but, if neutrinos

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:22.350
were massless this would be a
Lorentz invariant statement.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.030
If neutrinos have a
mass, that statement

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.720
is obviously not learn
Lorentz invariant.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.340
As you can see by imagining
a neutrino coming by,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.170
and you can get
into a rocket ship,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.770
chase it, and pass it, and
then see it going the other way

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.700
out your window because
you're going faster than it.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.699
You would see the momentum
in the opposite direction

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.240
from the way it
looked to begin with.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.960
But the spin would look like
it was the same direction as it

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.740
did to begin with,
and therefore the spin

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.041
would now be aligned
with the momentum

00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:55.415
instead of opposite
the momentum.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.310
So this could not
possibly hold universally

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.840
if the neutrino has a mass.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.727
But for the time being our
neutrinos are massless.

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.560
So we're going to take
this as a given fact.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.930
And it certainly is a fact
for all neutrinos that

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.710
have ever been
actually measured.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.052
Given this model of the
neutrino, the g for neutrinos

00:07:20.052 --> 00:07:22.850
is 7/8 because they're fermions.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.830
Then there's a factor
of 3, because there

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.670
are three different species
of neutrinos- electron

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.610
neutrinos, muon
neutrinos, tau neutrinos.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.620
Neutrinos come in particles
or anti-particles which

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.340
are distinct from
each other, we think.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.360
So there's a factor of 2
associated with the particle

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.150
anti-particle duality.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.850
And there's only one spin state.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.530
The spin that's anti-aligned
with the momentum,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.520
or aligned for the
anti-neutrinos.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.510
But only one spin
state in either case.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.680
So just a factor of
1 from spin states,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.180
and multiplying that
through we get 21/4 for g,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.860
and 9/2 for g star.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.360
Yes?

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.044
AUDIENCE: If we found out
that they were Majorana,

00:08:08.044 --> 00:08:09.710
that they were their
own anti-particles,

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.970
would that change what we expect
the temperature [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.930
to be?

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.320
PROFESSOR: No, it would not.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:16.520
OK.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.740
The question was, if
we find that they're

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.044
Majorana particles--
which I'm going

00:08:19.044 --> 00:08:20.419
to be talking
about in a minute--

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:23.560
where the particles would be
their own anti-particles, which

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.220
would mean that the right-handed
anti-neutrino would really just

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.250
be the anti-particle of
the left-handed neutrino,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.490
it would not change these
final numbers at all.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.110
What it would do is, instead
of having the 2 for particle

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:42.090
anti-particle, we would
have a 2 for spin states.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.285
So there would still be
two kinds of neutrinos,

00:08:45.285 --> 00:08:47.910
but instead of calling them the
neutrino and the anti-neutrino,

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.490
the right words would
be right-handed neutrino

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.545
and left-handed neutrino.

00:08:55.156 --> 00:08:57.749
But the product would
still be the same.

00:08:57.749 --> 00:09:02.050
AUDIENCE: Wait, they have
mass and they are Majorana?

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.800
PROFESSOR: If they
have mass and Majorana,

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.541
what I just said applies.

00:09:05.541 --> 00:09:07.040
The fact that they
have a mass would

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.830
mean at the lowest possible
temperatures they would not

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.820
act like black-body radiation.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.944
Kt would have to be bigger than
their mass times c squared.

00:09:15.944 --> 00:09:18.235
But that's only on the order
of electron volts at most.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:28.470
So I'll talk later about why
the true model neutrinos which

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.260
have masses give the
same result as this.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.160
OK.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.280
Then we can also,
just as an exercise,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.365
calculate g and g star.

00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:39.490
It's more than an exercise.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.010
We like to know the results.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.510
We can calculate g and g star
for e plus e minus pairs, which

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.800
is relevant for when
kt is large compared

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.060
to the rest energy
of an electron.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.880
And again, they
are fermions so we

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.240
get a factor of 7/8 appearing
in the expression for g,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.527
and 3/4 appearing in the
expression for g star.

00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:01.360
And then we just have
to multiply that times

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.642
the total number of types
of electrons that exist.

00:10:06.642 --> 00:10:08.475
There's only one species
called an electron,

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:11.280
so we only get a factor
of one in the species

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.640
slot of the product.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.470
There are both electrons
and anti-electrons

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.870
where the anti-electrons are
usually called positrons.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.620
So we get a factor of 2
in particle anti-particle.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.050
Two spin states because an
electron can be spin up or spin

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.260
down, and that
gives us 7/2 and 3.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.200
Given that, we can go
ahead and calculate

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.980
what the energy density
and radiation should

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.200
be for the present
universe given

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.980
the temperature of the
photons, the temperature

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.360
of the cosmic
microwave background.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.900
And in doing that there's
an important catch which

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.220
is something which is the
subject of a homework problem

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.380
that you'll be doing
on problem set seven.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.460
When the electron-positron
pairs disappear

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.680
from the thermal
equilibrium mix,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.400
if everything were still
in thermal contact,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.580
its heat would be shared between
the photons and the neutrinos

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.770
in a way that would keep
a common temperature.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:25.220
But in fact, when the e plus
e minus pairs disappear,

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.350
things are not in
thermal contact anymore.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.600
And in particular, the
neutrinos have decoupled.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.350
They're effectively not
interacting with anything

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.640
anymore.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.320
So the neutrinos keep
their own entropy

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.940
and do not absorb any entropy
coming from the e plus

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.900
e minus pairs.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.890
So all the entropy of the
e plus e minus pairs gets

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.190
transferred only to the photons.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.240
And that heats the photons
relative to the neutrinos

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.260
in a calculable
amount, which you

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.780
will calculate on
the homework problem.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.090
And the answer is that the
temperature of the neutrinos

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:06.170
ends up being only
4/11 to the 1/3 power,

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.907
times the temperature
of the photons.

00:12:08.907 --> 00:12:10.490
And that's important
for understanding

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.870
what's been happening in the
universe since this time.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:17.699
That ratio is maintained
forever from that time onward.

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:20.115
So if we want to write down
the formula for energy density

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:24.460
and radiation today it
would have two terms.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.100
The 2 here is the g for the
photons, and this, times

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.920
that expression is the
energy density in photons.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.790
The second term is the
energy density in neutrinos.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.370
And it has the
factor of 21/4 which

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.210
was the g factor for neutrinos.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.470
But then there's also
a correction factor

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.260
for the temperature, because
on the right hand side here

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.200
I put t gamma to the fourth.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.420
So this factor corrects it
to make it into t neutrino

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.470
to the fourth, which
is what we need there

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:59.580
to give the right energy
density for the neutrinos today.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.850
And this is just that
ratio to the fourth power.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.810
And once you plug in
numbers there it's

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.700
7.01 times 10 to the minus 14th
joules per meter cubed, which

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.200
is, from the
beginning, what we said

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.210
was the energy density in
radiation of the universe

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:15.710
today.

00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:22.080
OK.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.120
Finally I'd like to come back
to this real story of neutrinos

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:33.520
and their masses and why, even
though they have small masses,

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.550
the answers that we gave for the
massless model of the neutrino

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.280
are completely
accurate for cosmology.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.640
We've never actually measured
the mass of a neutrino.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.440
But what we have seen is
that neutrinos of one species

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.650
can oscillate into neutrinos
of the other species.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.400
And it turns out,
theoretically, that that

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.610
requires them to have a mass.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.100
And by seeing how
fast they oscillate

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.320
you can actually
measure the difference

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.254
in the mass squareds
between the two species.

00:14:06.254 --> 00:14:08.170
So it's still possible
actually, in principle,

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.610
that one of the species
could have zero mass.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.380
But they can't
all have zero mass

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.670
because we know the differences
in the squares of their masses.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.800
So in particular, delta
m squared 2 1 times c

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.560
to the fourth, meaning the
mass expressed as an energy,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.420
is 7.5 times 10 to the
minus 5 eV squared.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.760
And larger values
obtained for 2 3,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.670
which is 2.3 times 10 to
the minus 3 eV squared.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.000
We're still talking
about fractions of an eV.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.670
The other of the three
possible combinations

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.340
here are just not known yet.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.030
Now, if neutrinos have a mass,
that does actually change

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:56.790
things rather dramatically
because of what we said about--

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.760
the statement that the neutrinos
always align their spins with

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.990
their motion just cannot be
true if neutrinos have a mass.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.840
And more generally,
for any particle

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.950
with a mass of arbitrary
spin j, the statement

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.780
is that, the component of j
along any particular axis--

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.460
and we'll call it
the z-axis-- always

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.590
takes on the possible
values in terms of h bar

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.587
going from minus j up
to j with no emissions.

00:15:24.587 --> 00:15:26.170
It's different for
massless particles.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.400
For massless particles
every one of these elements

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.550
on the right hand side is
independent and, by itself,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.990
a Lorentz invariant possibility.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.810
But, coming back to
neutrinos-- if the neutrinos

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.880
have a mass, in addition to
the left-handed neutrinos there

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.470
has to be a
right-handed partner.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:55.342
And the question then is,
what's the story behind that?

00:15:55.342 --> 00:15:57.050
And it turns out we
don't know the story.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.510
But we know two
possible stories.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.470
And one of the
possible stories is

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:07.740
that could be what's
called a Dirac mass.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.300
And for Dirac mass
what it means is that,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:16.130
the right-handed neutrino is
simply a new type of particle

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.470
which just happens to be a
particle that we've never

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.970
seen, but a particle
which would have

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.960
a perfectly real existence.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.920
It would however, to fit
into theory and observation,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.340
be an extremely weakly
interacting particle.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.170
The interactions of
the right-handed one

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.510
do not have to be the
same as the interactions

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.300
of the left-handed one.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.580
That is, the interactions
can depend explicitly

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.016
on p hat dot j.

00:16:43.016 --> 00:16:45.270
So depending its
value, you could

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.270
affect what the
interactions are, again,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.750
in a Lorentz invariant way.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:55.250
And in practice, the
right-handed neutrinos

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.400
would indirect so
weakly that we would not

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.410
expect to see them
in the laboratory.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.173
And we would not expect
even in the early universe

00:17:03.173 --> 00:17:04.589
that they would
have been produced

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.640
in any significant number.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.710
So even though it would
be a particle that,

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.829
in principle, exists, we
would not expect to see it.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:18.000
And we would not expected it
to affect the early universe.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.550
Alternatively-- and in some
ways a more subtle idea--

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.805
is that the mass of
the neutrino could

00:17:24.805 --> 00:17:27.530
be what's called
a Majorana mass.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.400
Where Majorana, like Dirac,
is the name of a person--

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.510
perhaps less well
known than Dirac,

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:39.210
but made important contributions
in this context nonetheless.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.830
In this case, it can only
occur if lepton number is not

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.650
conserved.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.780
And if lepton number
is not conserved then

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.710
there are really
no quantum numbers

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.210
that separate the
particle that we

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.740
call a neutrino
from the particle

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.000
that we call an anti-neutrino.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.190
And if that's the
case, the particle

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.750
that we call the anti-neutrino
could, in fact, just

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:06.740
be the right-handed
partner of the neutrino.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.190
So for the Majorana
mass case we don't

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.850
need to introduce any new things
that we haven't already seen.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.570
We just have to rename
the thing that we've

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:21.520
been calling the anti-neutrino
the neutrino with helicity

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:27.132
plus 1 instead of minus 1-- it's
with j hat dot p with j dot p

00:18:27.132 --> 00:18:32.840
hat, equal to plus 1/2
instead of minus 1/2.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.590
So these would just
be the two spin states

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.230
of the neutrino instead of the
neutrino and the anti-neutrino.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.271
And that's a possibility.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.670
And this would also change
nothing as far as the counting

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:44.600
that we did.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.430
It would just change where
the factors go instead

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.040
of having a factor
of 2 for particle

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.670
anti-particle and
this type counting.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.322
We'd have a factor of 2
in the spin state factor,

00:18:56.322 --> 00:18:58.280
and a factor of 1 in the
particle anti-particle

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:58.780
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.196
The particle and
the anti-particle

00:19:00.196 --> 00:19:01.250
would be the same thing.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.080
OK.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.140
Any questions about that?

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.700
OK.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.260
Finally-- and I think this is
my last slide of the summary.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.510
At the end of the lecture
we just pointed out

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.650
a number of tidbits
of information.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.300
We can calculate the temperature
of the early universe

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.550
at any time from the
formulas that we already

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.860
had on the slide.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.505
We know how to calculate the
energy density at any time.

00:19:31.505 --> 00:19:33.950
And by knowing about
black-body radiation

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.970
we can convert that
into a temperature.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.690
And for an important
interval of time,

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.000
which is when kt is small enough
so that you don't make muon

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.850
anti-muon pairs, but
large enough so that

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:52.470
electron-positron pairs
act like they are massless,

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:59.310
and this very large range
kt is equal to 0.860 m e v,

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.940
divided by the square root of
time where time is measured

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.980
in seconds.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:09.296
So in particular, at 1
second kt is 0.86 m e

00:20:09.296 --> 00:20:14.410
v. And it does
apply at 1 second.

00:20:17.296 --> 00:20:20.070
Because 0.86 m e v
is in this range.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.570
We also then talked
about the implications

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.340
of the conservation of entropy.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.670
If total entropy is
conserved, the entropy density

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:37.620
has to just fall off like 1
over the cube of the volume.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.380
Total entropy is conserved
for almost all processes

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.370
in the early universe.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.810
So the entropy falls
off like 1 over a cubed.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.560
And that means that,
as long as we're

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.920
talking about a period of time
during which little g does not

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.040
change-- and little g only
changes when particles freeze

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.140
out, like when the
electron-positron pairs

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.960
disappear-- but as long as
little g doesn't change,

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.980
s [INAUDIBLE] 1 over
a cubed means simply

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.670
that the temperature
falls like 1 over a.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.420
And when little g changes you
can even calculate corrections

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.140
to this as, effectively
you're doing

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.020
when you calculate
this relationship

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.600
between the neutrino temperature
and the photon temperature.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.240
And finally, we talked
about the behavior

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.220
of the atoms in the universe
as the universe cools.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.020
For temperatures above
about 4,000 degrees

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.730
the universe, which
is mainly hydrogen,

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.030
is mainly a hydrogen plasma.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.970
Isolated protons and electrons
zipping through space

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.890
independently.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.340
At about 4,000 Kelvin-- and
this is a stat [? mac ?]

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:54.830
calculation, which we're not
doing-- but using the answer.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.660
At about 4,000 Kelvin--
which is a number which

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.950
depends on the density of
hydrogen in the universe,

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.450
it's not a universal
property of hydrogen--

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.860
but for the density of
hydrogen in the universe,

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.800
at about 4,000 Kelvin
hydrogen recombines.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.105
It becomes neutral atoms.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:21.210
And slightly colder, at about
3,000, the degree of ionization

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.800
becomes small enough
so that the photons

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.800
become effectively free.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.630
The photons decouple.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.610
In between 4,000 and 3,000 the
hydrogen is mostly neutral,

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.860
but they're still enough ionized
so that the photons are still

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.420
interacting.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.170
So the most important
temperatures--

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.940
the 3,000 Kelvin,
when the photons

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.160
are released, when the
photons are no longer trapped

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.640
with the matter of the universe.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.530
And last time we estimated the
time at which that happens.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.320
That should be a small t, sorry.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.510
The time of decoupling
is about 380,000 years.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.260
And that number is
actually very accurate,

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.150
even though we didn't
calculate it very accurately.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.230
And that's the
end of my summary.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.420
Any questions about the summary?

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.760
OK.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.400
In that case, let's
go on to talk first

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.830
about the spectrum of the
cosmic background radiation.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.780
And then we'll move
on to talk about

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.863
the cosmological constant.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.680
CMB is cosmic
microwave background.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.370
And that's a very, very standard
abbreviation these days.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.850
So when the cosmic microwave
background was first

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:02.492
discovered by Penzias and
Wilson in 1965-- which,

00:24:02.492 --> 00:24:03.950
I might point out,
is going to have

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:09.100
its 50th anniversary
in the coming year--

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.840
they only measured
it at one frequency.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.800
It was a real tour de force to
measure it at the one frequency

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.860
and to convince themselves that
the buzz that they were hearing

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.500
in their detector was
not just some kind

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.730
of random electrical noise,
but really was some signal

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.090
coming from outer space.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.130
And the main clue that
it was some signal coming

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.340
from outer space
was that they were

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.702
able to compare it
with a cold load,

00:24:41.702 --> 00:24:47.720
a liquid helium-cooled
source, and find

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.460
that that comparison worked
the way they expected.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.340
And the main reason
for believing

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.599
it was cosmological
rather than local

00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:56.390
is that they got the
same reading no matter

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.140
what direction they
pointed their antenna.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:06.770
This just took a lot of
radio technique skill

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.520
to convince themselves
that it wasn't just

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.674
some radio tube that was
malfunctioning or something.

00:25:12.674 --> 00:25:14.090
They even worried
that it may have

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:18.510
been caused by pigeon
droppings in their antenna,

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.600
I actually read about
in Weinberg's book.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.850
But they finally convinced
themselves that it was real.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.470
They were still not
convinced really

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.510
that it was a sign
for the big bang

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.470
and-- you may recall,
again, from reading Weinberg

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.960
that there were two papers
published back-to-back.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.110
The experimental paper
by Penzias and Wilson,

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.360
which really just
described the experiment,

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.660
mentioning that a
possible explanation

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.380
was in this other paper
by Dickie, Peebles, Roll,

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.820
and Wilkinson which described
the theory that this

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.010
was radiation that
originated with the big bang.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.720
But it's all based on one
point at one frequency.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.810
Shortly afterwards, I
guess within the same year,

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.843
Roll and Wilkinson
were able to measure it

00:26:04.843 --> 00:26:07.160
at a slightly
different frequency.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.440
And when I wrote my
popular-level book

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:18.300
I tabulated all of the data
that was known in 1975.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.350
And this mess is the graph.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.940
This shows sort
of the full range

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.820
of interesting frequencies.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:30.180
The solid line here is the
expected theoretical curve

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.850
corresponding to a
modern measurement

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:37.412
of the temperature
2.726 degrees Kelvin.

00:26:37.412 --> 00:26:39.860
All of the interesting
historical points

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.560
are in this tiny little
corner on the left, which

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.610
is magnified above.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.230
The original Penzias
and Wilson point

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.620
is way down here at
very low frequencies

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:58.190
by the standards of radiation
at 2.726 degrees Kelvin.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.940
The Roll and Wilkinson
point is there.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.850
These blobs indicate error bars.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.240
The [? cyanogen ?] points
that you read about

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.490
in Weinberg are shown
there and there.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.840
The first measurement that
showed that, it didn't only

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.810
go up but started to go down
like black-body radiation

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:25.110
should, was a balloon flight--
this 1971 balloon flight

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:29.970
which produce that
blob and that bound.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.222
This was an experiment
by MIT's own Ray Weiss.

00:27:33.222 --> 00:27:35.670
And it was very
important in the history

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.060
because it was the first
evidence that we weren't just

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.070
seeing some straight
line, but we

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.230
were seeing something which
did indeed rise and fall

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.870
the way black-body
radiation should.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:52.070
A later balloon flight in
1974 produced error bars

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.950
that are shown by
this gray area.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.990
Incredibly broad.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.840
So the bottom line
that this graph

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.040
was intended by me to
illustrate is that, in 1975 you

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.460
could believe that this was
black-body radiation if you so

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.020
wished.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.140
But there was not
really a lot of evidence

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.355
that it was
black-body radiation.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.680
The situation did not
get better quickly.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.950
The next significant
measurement came

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:30.760
in 1987 which was a
rocket flight, which

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.750
was a collaboration
between a group at Berkeley

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.550
and a group at Nagoya, Japan.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.220
I believe it was the
Japanese group that

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.510
supplied the rocket and
the American group that

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.070
supplied the instrumentation.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:51.322
And they measured the
radiation at three points.

00:28:51.322 --> 00:28:52.780
I can give you the
number that goes

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.240
with those graphical points.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.800
I guess what I
have tabulated here

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.231
is the effect of temperature
that those points correspond

00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:13.730
to.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.260
As you can see from
the graph, those points

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.390
are all well above
the black-body curve.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.480
Significantly more
radiation than what

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.830
was expected by
people who thought

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:34.000
it should be black-body.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.790
And 0.2 up there
would correspond

00:29:42.790 --> 00:30:00.040
to a temperature of 2.955 plus
or minus 0.017 K. The size

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.480
of the vertical bars
there are the error

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.970
bars that the
experimenters found.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:31.560
And 0.3 was t equals 3.175
plus or minus 0.027 K.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.780
So these were higher
temperatures then

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.490
the 2.7 that fit the lower
part of the spectrum.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:40.640
And very, very small error bars.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.330
So this data came out in 1987.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:50.700
And, in truth, nobody knew
what to make out of it.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.730
The experimental group were
well aware that this was not

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:58.530
what people wanted them to find.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.560
And they certainly
examined their data

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.880
very carefully to figure at
what could have conceivably gone

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.930
wrong.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.390
And they were going
around the country

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.650
giving talks about this.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.250
And I heard one or
two of them in which

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.180
they described how surprised
they were by the results,

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.410
but emphasized that they
analyzed the experiment very,

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.420
very carefully and couldn't
find anything wrong with it.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.250
And this was the
situation for awhile.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.600
I should point out that I think
this point number three is

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.020
something like 16 standard
deviations off of the theory.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.220
And usually when somebody
makes a measurement that's

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.930
three or four standard
deviations off of your theory,

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.950
you really start to worry.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.910
16 standard deviations is
certainly a bit extreme.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:53.095
Nonetheless, nobody had any
good explanation for this.

00:31:53.095 --> 00:31:55.220
So, well, different people
had different attitudes.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.470
There were some people who
tried to construct theories

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.260
that would account for this.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:04.870
And there were others who
waited for it to go away.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.290
I'm pretty sure
I was among those

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:11.960
who waited for it to go
away, and we were right.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.240
So the next important
piece of data

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.770
came from the first
satellite dedicated

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.260
to measuring the cosmic
background radiation.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.654
The famous COBE Satellite--
Cosmic Background Explorer-- I

00:32:26.654 --> 00:32:28.320
guess I didn't write
down the name here.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.370
Oh, it's in the title.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.250
Preliminary measurement of the
cosmic microwave background

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.440
spectrum by the Cosmic
Background Explorer,

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.290
COBE Satellite.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.820
So COBE was the first
satellite dedicated

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.605
to measuring the cosmic
background radiation.

00:32:43.605 --> 00:32:48.770
It was launched in 1989,
I guess, and released

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.980
its first data in
January of 1990.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.700
Back in those days there
was no internet or archive.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.510
So you may or may not know that
the way physics results were

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.200
first announced
to the world were

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.510
in the form of what were
called pre-prints, which

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:12.130
were essentially xeroxed copies
of the paper that were sent out

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.220
to a mailing list.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.870
Typically, I think,
institutions had mailing lists

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.260
of maybe 100 other institutions.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.930
And every physics department
had a pre-print library

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:28.510
that people can go to and
find these pre-prints.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.940
So this is the COBE pre-print.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:35.560
90-01, the first
pre-print from 1990.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.770
And this is the data.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.600
So it is kind of
breathtaking, I think.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.130
It suddenly changed the entire
field, and in some sense

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.764
really change cosmology
for the field.

00:33:55.764 --> 00:33:57.680
Where we only had
approximate ideas of the way

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:05.530
things worked, to suddenly
having a really precise science

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.960
in which precise
measurements could be made,

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.849
and cleared up the
issue of the radiation.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:19.219
It wasn't just a mess like this,
or a terrible fit like that,

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:23.460
but a fantastically good fit.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:30.320
Really nailing the radiation
as having a thermal spectrum.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.360
So the history is that John
Mather presented this data

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:40.179
at the January 1990 American
Physical Society meeting,

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:43.870
and was given a
standing ovation.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:47.150
And he later won the
Nobel Prize for this work.

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.490
He was the head of the team
that brought this data.

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:53.000
He won the Nobel Prize in
2006 along with George Smoot,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.719
who was responsible for one
of the other experiments

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.761
on the COBE satellite.

00:34:57.761 --> 00:34:58.260
Yes?

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.801
AUDIENCE: So do we
know what happened

00:34:59.801 --> 00:35:01.120
with the other measurements?

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:01.856
PROFESSOR: To tell
you the truth,

00:35:01.856 --> 00:35:03.390
I don't think the
other measurements

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.330
ever-- the other people
ever really published

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.371
what they think happened.

00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:10.280
But the widespread rumor,
which I imagine is true,

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.850
is that they were seeing
their own rocket exhaust.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:19.000
And there were, I think,
some arguments going on

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.260
between the Americans
and the Japanese,

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.694
with the Americans more or less
accusing the Japanese of not

00:35:27.694 --> 00:35:29.610
really telling them how
the rocket was set up.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:33.580
Yes?

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.256
AUDIENCE: Are the error bars
plugged on those points,

00:35:36.256 --> 00:35:37.980
or is it just that good?

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.605
PROFESSOR: Those
are the error bars?

00:35:39.605 --> 00:35:40.146
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:51.860
PROFESSOR: And even
more spectacular,

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.210
a couple years later,
I guess it was-- this

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.710
was actually just based on nine
minutes of data or something

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.080
like that.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.840
But a couple years later they
published their full data set,

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:08.380
where the size of the error bars
were reduced by a factor of 10.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.649
And still a perfect fit.

00:36:11.649 --> 00:36:13.190
They didn't even
know how to plot it,

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.814
so I think they
plotted the same graph,

00:36:14.814 --> 00:36:16.910
and said the error
bars are a factor of 10

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.385
smalled than what's shown.

00:36:19.385 --> 00:36:20.295
It was gorgeous.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.520
So I think I forgot to tell you
what the spectrum is supposed

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.975
to look like exactly.

00:36:39.975 --> 00:36:41.840
And this is just
a formula that I

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.420
want you to understand
the meaning of, but not

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.830
the derivation of.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:53.378
We-- as with the other stat mech
results that we're relying on,

00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:56.810
we're going to relegate their
derivation to the stat mech

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.740
course that you either
have taken or will take.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.610
But the spectrum is
completely determined

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.830
because the principle
of thermal equilibrium

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.890
is sort of absolute in
statistical mechanics.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.510
And in order for a
black-body radiating

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:15.120
object to be in
thermal equilibrium

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.340
with an environment
at that temperature,

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.430
it has to have not only the
right emission rate but also

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:23.666
the right spectrum.

00:37:23.666 --> 00:37:25.040
If the spectrum
weren't right you

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.581
could imagine putting
in filters that

00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:30.130
would trap in some frequencies
and let out others.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.860
And then you would move away
from thermal equilibrium

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.750
if the spectrum were right
or wrong because you'd

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.880
be trapping in more
radiation-- you could arrange

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:44.030
for the filters to trap in more
radiation than they are letting

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.970
out.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:51.400
So the spectrum is calculable.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:58.995
And in terms of-- I guess
this is energy density.

00:37:58.995 --> 00:38:01.210
I have to admit, I usually
call energy density u

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.070
and in these notes
here it's called rho.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.440
We'll figure out the units after
I write it down and make sure

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.750
that it is energy density.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:21.890
Rho sub nu of nu d nu,
means-- with this product

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:27.340
it means the total energy
density, energy per volume,

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.891
per frequency interval, d
nu-- well, it's times d nu,

00:38:30.891 --> 00:38:32.390
so if you multiply
by times nu, this

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:36.050
is the total energy for
frequencies between nu and nu

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.220
plus d nu.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:51.770
And the formula is 16 pi
squared h bar nu cubed, divided

00:38:51.770 --> 00:39:07.980
by c cubed times 1 over e to
the 2 pi h bar nu over kt,

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.290
minus 1 d nu.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:26.980
OK.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.896
And actually, the unit's
not that transparent.

00:39:28.896 --> 00:39:32.800
I believe this is energy
density and not mass density.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.350
But maybe I'll make sure of
that and let you know next time.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.610
And this is what
produces that curve

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.310
that you saw on the slides.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.660
I've included the
subscript nu here

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.550
to indicate that it's the number
which, when you multiply it

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.640
by d nu, gives you the energy
density between nu and nu

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.230
plus d nu.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.110
If instead you wanted
to know the energy

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:04.690
density between lambda
and lambda plus d lambda,

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.620
there'd be a kinematic
factor that you'd

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.660
have to put in here-- the factor
that relates d lambda to d nu.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:15.460
And you could imagine
working that out.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.090
I might add that,
in Weinberg's book,

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:22.772
he actually plots
both sub lambda of nu.

00:40:22.772 --> 00:40:24.980
So his curve looks somewhat
different than the curves

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.492
that I showed you.

00:40:26.492 --> 00:40:27.950
This is not exactly
the same thing.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:39.050
Now, what this extremely
accurately black-body curve

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:42.480
proves is that the
early universe really

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.970
was very accurately in
thermal equilibrium.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.754
And that can only happen if the
early universe was very dense.

00:40:50.754 --> 00:40:52.420
And of course, our
model of the universe

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.090
goes back to infinite density.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.860
So the model predicts
that it should

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.880
be in thermal equilibrium.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.530
But in particular, the
numbers that we have here,

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.610
if you ask how much could
you change the model

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:08.040
and still expect these
curves the answer

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:13.110
is roughly that, all of the
important energy-releasing

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.080
processes have to have
happened before about one

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.520
year after the Big Bang.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.540
Anything that happened
after one year

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.670
would still show
up as some glitch

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:26.110
in the black-body spectrum.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:30.030
So the big bag model really
is confirmed back to about one

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:33.350
year on the basis of
this precise measurement

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.974
of the spectrum of the
cosmic background radiation.

00:41:35.974 --> 00:41:37.890
And the COBE measurement
is still, by the way,

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:39.860
the best measurement
of the spectrum.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.860
We've had other very
important experiments,

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.500
that we'll talk
about later, which

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.230
measure the non-uniformity
of the black-body radiation.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.600
Which is very small,
but nonetheless very,

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.690
very important [? effect. ?]

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:56.460
So we've had WMAP
and now Planck which

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.790
have been dedicated to
measuring the anisotropies

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:00.870
of the radiation.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:02.490
COBE also made
initial measurements

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.210
of the anisotropies.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.420
And we'll be talking
about anisotropies later

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.380
in the course.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.170
Yes?

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:12.337
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:12.337 --> 00:42:13.045
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:42:13.045 --> 00:42:14.930
AUDIENCE: The units
of the right-hand side

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:16.050
are energy density.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:16.370
PROFESSOR: Energy density.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.870
OK.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:17.380
Thanks.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:17.880
OK.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.380
Good.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.100
So my words were right.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.169
I should have called
it u, I think,

00:42:22.169 --> 00:42:23.835
to be consistent with
my usual notation.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:31.840
Thanks.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.550
OK.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:37.966
Any other questions
about the CMB?

00:42:37.966 --> 00:42:41.230
Because if not, we're going
to change gears completely

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:46.800
and start talking about one of
the other crucially important

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.940
observational discoveries in
cosmology in the last 20 years.

00:43:01.571 --> 00:43:02.070
OK.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:03.590
So what I want to
talk about next

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:10.040
is the very important
discovery originally made

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:19.584
in 1998-- also resulting
in a Nobel Prize--

00:43:19.584 --> 00:43:21.000
that the universe
is accelerating.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:36.940
And this was a
discovery that involved

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.030
two experimental groups,
and a total of something

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:43.960
like 52 astronomers
between the two groups.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.980
Which actually meant that--
I'm exaggerating slightly,

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:47.560
I suppose.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.544
But it really
involved the majority

00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:51.710
of the astronomers of the
world, and therefore there

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.918
weren't a lot of astronomers
to argue with them about

00:43:53.918 --> 00:43:57.220
whether or not the
result was right.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.110
But there still
was some argument.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:03.350
The announcement was initially
made at a AAS meeting

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:10.250
in January of 1998 by--
which group was first?

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:18.570
I think that was the High-Z
Supernova-- where are they?

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:19.070
Yeah.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.220
That was the High-Z
Supernova Search Team.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.080
And then there was also a group
largely based at Berkeley.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.670
The High-Z Supernova Search Team
was actually fairly diffused,

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:33.190
although based to some
extent at Harvard.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.710
And the Supernova
Cosmology Project

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.600
was based rather
squarely in Berkeley,

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.260
headed by Saul Perlmutter.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.700
And they both agreed.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:47.390
And what they found
was, by looking

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:54.510
at distant supernovae of a
particular type-- type 1a--

00:44:54.510 --> 00:45:00.530
they were able to use these
supernovae as standard candles.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:02.530
And because supernovae
are brighter

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:06.320
than other standard candles
that had been studied earlier

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.660
in history, they were able to go
out to much greater distances.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:14.610
And that means to look
much further back in time

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:17.520
than previous studies.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.420
And what they discovered
was that the expansion rate

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.680
of the universe
today was actually

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.600
faster, and not slower,
than the expansion rate

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.080
about five billion years ago.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.030
And that was a big shock because
until then everybody expected

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:38.850
that gravity would
be slowing down

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:41.430
the expansion of the universe.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:45.710
And when these guys started
to make these measurements

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:48.730
they were just simply
trying to figure out

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:52.330
how fast the universe
was slowing down.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:55.730
And they were shocked to
discover that it was not

00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:00.400
slowing down, but
instead speeding up.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.420
Initially there was some
controversy about it.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.055
People did try to invent other
explanations for this data.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:14.240
But the data has, in fact, held
up for the period from 1998

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.320
to the present.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.000
And in fact, it has been
strongly supported by evidence

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.040
from these anisotropies in the
cosmic microwave background

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.070
radiation, which we'll
be talking about later.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.330
But it turns out, you can
get a lot of information

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:33.270
from these anisotropies in the
cosmic background radiation.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:36.820
So the picture now is
really quite secure,

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:41.670
that the acceleration-- the
expansion of the universe

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:47.790
is actually accelerating,
and not decelerating.

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.950
And the simplest
explanation for that,

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.290
which is the one that--
well, certainly because it's

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.330
the most plausible, and the one
that most of us take seriously,

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.913
and it's the only one that fits
the data extraordinarily well.

00:46:59.913 --> 00:47:03.410
So we've not seen any reason
not to use this explanation.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:07.690
The simplest explanation is
that there's a nonzero energy

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:11.360
density to the
vacuum, which is also

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.400
what Einstein called the
cosmological constant.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.970
So we should begin
by writing down

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:23.245
the equations that
describe this issue.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.910
So we've learned how to write
down the second order Friedmann

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:55.972
equation, which
describes how the scale

00:47:55.972 --> 00:47:57.430
factor of the
universe accelerates.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:09.730
And on the right-hand side,
once we included materials

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.480
with nonzero
pressures, we discover

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.860
that we need on the
right-hand side, rho plus 3 p,

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.810
over c squared--
excuse me-- times a.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.790
Now when the cosmological
constant was born,

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:29.720
was when Einstein
first turned his theory

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.730
of general relativity
to cosmology.

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:36.700
Einstein invented the theory
of general relativity in 1916.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.210
And just one year
later, in 1917,

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.370
he was applying it to
the universe as a whole

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:45.800
to see if he could get
a cosmological model

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.370
consistent with
general relativity.

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:55.860
Einstein at that point was
under the misconception

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:59.790
that the universe was static,
as Newton had also thought,

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:02.260
and as far as we
know, as everybody

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.830
between Newton and
Einstein thought.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:11.350
If you look up at the stars, the
universe looks pretty static.

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:13.845
And people took
this very seriously.

00:49:13.845 --> 00:49:16.220
In hindsight, it's a little
hard to know why they took it

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.490
so seriously, but they did.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:25.820
So when Einstein
discovered this equation

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.990
he was assuming that
the universe consisted

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:30.210
of basically
non-relativistic stuff.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:33.300
Stars are essentially
non-relativistic hunks

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.220
of matter.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.300
So he thought that
rho would be positive,

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.390
the effective pressure
would be zero.

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:45.400
And he immediately
noticed that this equation

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.240
would imply that the
scale factor would

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.800
have a negative acceleration.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.300
So that if you tried to
set up a static universe

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.170
it would instantly collapse.

00:49:57.170 --> 00:50:00.370
And as we talked
about earlier, Newton

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:03.910
had talked himself out
of that conclusion.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.090
And I think the real
difference, as I think we also

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:08.850
talked about earlier, was
that Newton was thinking

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.310
of the law of gravity as
an action at a distance,

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:14.390
where you determine the
total force on something

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:18.850
by integrating the forces
caused by all other masses.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:21.520
And then things get complicated
and divergent, actually,

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.220
for an infinite,
static universe.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.500
And Newton managed
to convince himself

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.540
that you could have a static
universe of that type,

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.540
a statement that we now
consider to be incorrect

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.800
even in the context of
Newtonian mechanics.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.279
But this fact that
it's incorrect even

00:50:38.279 --> 00:50:39.820
in the context of
Newtonian mechanics

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.230
was really not discovered
until Einstein wrote down

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:43.520
this equation.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:50.090
And then Einstein himself
also gave a Newtonian argument

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:53.860
showing that, at least with
a modern interpretation

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.050
of Newtonian mechanics.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:56.970
It doesn't work in
Newtonian gravity

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:59.940
either to have a
static universe.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:05.440
But Einstein was still convinced
that the universe was static.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:12.049
And he realized that he could
modify his field equations--

00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:13.840
the equations that we
have not written down

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.190
in this course, the equations
that describe how matter create

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:22.280
gravitational fields--
by adding a new term

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:31.195
with a new coefficient in front
of it which he called lambda.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:05.060
And this extra
term, lambda, could

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.320
produce a kind of a universal
gravitational repulsion.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.330
And he realised he had to adjust
the constant to be just right

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:15.050
to balance the amount of
matter in the universe.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.840
But he didn't let
that bother him.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.690
And if he adjusted
it to be just right,

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:21.820
and the universe was
perfectly homogeneous,

00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:23.770
he could arrange
for it to balance

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:27.375
the standard force of gravity.

00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:29.500
We can understand what
lambda does to the equations

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.625
because it does, in fact,
have a simple description

00:52:31.625 --> 00:52:34.240
in terms of things that we have
discussed and do understand.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.020
That is, you could
think of lambda

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:41.540
as simply corresponding to
a vacuum energy density.

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.470
Einstein did not
make that connection.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.790
And not being an
historian of science,

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.800
I can speculate
as much as I want.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.420
So my speculation is that,
the reason this did not

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.250
occur to Einstein
is that Einstein

00:52:57.250 --> 00:53:00.840
was a fully classical
physicist who was not

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.390
at this time or
maybe never accepting

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:04.669
the notions of quantum theory.

00:53:04.669 --> 00:53:06.210
And in any case,
quantum field theory

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:08.940
was still far in the future.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:13.130
So in classical physics the
vacuum is just plain empty.

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:15.540
And if the vacuum
is just plain empty

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.760
it shouldn't have
any energy density.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.060
The quantum field theory
picture of the vacuum,

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.860
however, is vastly more complex.

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:28.250
So to a modern quantum
field theory-oriented

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:32.090
theoretical physicist
the vacuum has

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:35.260
particle, anti-particle pairs
appearing and disappearing

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.890
all the time.

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:38.970
We are now convinced
that there's also

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:43.330
this Higgs field that has
even a nonzero mean value

00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:44.850
in the vacuum.

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.180
So the vacuum is a
very complicated state

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.910
which, if anything
characterizes it,

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:52.790
it's simply the state of
lowest possible energy density.

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:56.120
But because of, basically,
the uncertainty principles

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.830
of quantum mechanics, the
lowest possible energy density

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:00.810
does not mean that all
the fields are just zero

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:02.210
and stay zero.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.226
They're constantly
fluctuating as they must

00:54:05.226 --> 00:54:07.100
according to the
uncertainty principle, which

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:08.955
applies to fields
as well particles.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:15.220
So we have no reason
anymore to expect the energy

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:18.010
density of the
vacuum to be zero.

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:20.490
So from a modern perspective
it's very natural

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:24.110
to simply equate the idea
of the cosmological constant

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:27.430
to the idea of a nonzero
vacuum energy density.

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:31.050
And there are some
unit differences-- just

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:34.110
constants related to
the historical way

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:37.930
that Einstein added
this term his equations.

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:43.480
So the energy density of
the vacuum-- which is also

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.460
the mass density of
the vacuum times c

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:53.790
squared-- is equal to Einstein's
lambda times c to the fourth,

00:54:53.790 --> 00:55:01.050
over 8 pi G.

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:03.680
And this is really just
an historical accident

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.840
that it's defined this way.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.673
But this is the way
Einstein defined lambda.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:15.910
Now, if the vacuum
has an energy density,

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:19.370
as the universe
expands the space

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:20.640
is still filled with vacuum.

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.400
At least, if it was
filled with vacuum.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.174
If it was matter
it would thin out.

00:55:24.174 --> 00:55:26.590
But we can imagine a region
of space that was just vacuum,

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.360
and as it expands it would
have to just stay vacuum.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.850
What else could it become?

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:35.110
And that means that we
know that, for a vacuum,

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:39.250
rho dot should equal zero.

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:43.170
Now we've also learned earlier,
by applying conservation

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:46.270
of energy to the
expanding universe,

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:54.680
that rho dot in an expanding
universe, is equal to minus 3

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.280
a dot over a.

00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.650
Or we could write
this as h times

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:04.065
rho plus p over c squared.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.710
This is basically
a rewriting of d u

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:16.380
equals minus p d v, applying
it to the expanding universe.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.380
So I won't re-derive it.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:19.629
We already derived it.

00:56:19.629 --> 00:56:21.670
Actually, I think you
derived it on the homework,

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:23.070
was the way it actually worked.

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:26.090
But in any case,
this immediately

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:33.680
tells us that if
rho dot is going

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:47.530
to be 0 for vacuum
energy, this has to be 0.

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:55.860
And therefore p vacuum has
to be equal to minus rho

00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.620
vacuum times c squared.

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.260
And if we know the energy
density in the pressure

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.174
of this stuff called
vacuum, that's

00:57:20.174 --> 00:57:22.590
all we need to know to put it
into the Friedmann equations

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:25.370
and find out how things behave.

00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:27.660
Otherwise this vacuum energy
behaves no differently

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:28.640
from anything else.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.090
It just has a
particular relationship

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:34.700
between the pressure
and the energy density,

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.455
with a very peculiar feature-
that the pressure is negative.

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.300
And that's an important
feature because we

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.660
had commented earlier that
a negative pressure can

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.280
drive acceleration.

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.490
And now we're in a good position
to see exactly how that works.

00:58:11.566 --> 00:58:13.690
To sort of keep
things straight I'm

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:20.060
going to divide the mass
density of the universe

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:26.105
into a vacuum piece
and a normal piece,

00:58:26.105 --> 00:58:30.100
where normal represents matter,
or radiation, or anything else,

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.662
if we ever discover
something else.

00:58:32.662 --> 00:58:34.620
But in fact it will just
be matter or radiation

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.190
for anything that we'll
be doing in this course,

00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:38.356
or anything that's really
done in current cosmology.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.100
And similarly, I'm going to
write pressure as p vac plus p

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:48.830
normal.

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:49.690
"N" is for normal.

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.800
But p vac I don't
really need to use,

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:01.589
because p vac I can rewrite
in terms of rho vac.

00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:03.380
So in the end I can
express everything just

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:06.290
in terms of rho vac.

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:09.650
And I can write down the second
order Friedmann equation.

00:59:14.537 --> 00:59:16.620
And it's just a matter of
substituting in that rho

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.640
and that p into the
Friedmann equation

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.430
that we've already written.

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:34.960
And we get minus 4 pi
over 3 G, times rho

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:42.730
normal plus 3 p
normal, over c squared.

00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:45.890
And the vacuum pieces-- have two
pieces because there's a vacuum

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:49.730
piece there and a
vacuum piece there. it

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:53.290
can all be expressed in terms
of rho vac and collected.

00:59:53.290 --> 01:00:02.650
And what you get is
minus 2 rho vac times a.

01:00:06.834 --> 01:00:08.500
Showing just what we
were talking about.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.700
That because of that minus
sign, multiplies that

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:17.790
minus sign, vacuum energy drives
acceleration, not deceleration.

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:20.640
And that's why vacuum
energy can explain

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.810
these famous results of 1998.

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:26.110
And we'll see later that,
for the same reason vacuum

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:28.690
energy or things
like vacuum energy

01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:30.700
can actually drive the
expansion of the universe

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.320
in the first place in
what we call inflation.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.130
Yes?

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:39.950
AUDIENCE: So for the equation
without the cosmological

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:46.110
constant it's, let's say, rho
and p are about the constant,

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:48.054
then wouldn't that
be the equation

01:00:48.054 --> 01:00:50.000
for a simple harmonic
function [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.546
or the oscillation
of a [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:54.546 --> 01:00:56.981
is some negative
constant times a?

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:04.880
PROFESSOR: That's right, except
that you would probably not

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.949
believe the equations
with the bounds.

01:01:06.949 --> 01:01:07.490
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:09.781
PROFESSOR: And when a went
negative you wouldn't really

01:01:09.781 --> 01:01:11.880
have a cosmological
interpretation anymore,

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.970
I don't think.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:17.340
But it is, in fact, true that
if rho and p were constants--

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.360
I'm not sure of any model that
actually does that-- this would

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:24.640
give you sinusoidal behavior
during the expanding

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.670
and contracting phase.

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:28.613
Yes?

01:01:28.613 --> 01:01:32.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the vacuum
energy is constant over time,

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.867
is it also makes
sense [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:38.700
AUDIENCE: Are you asking,
does it make sense

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.970
for maybe the vacuum
energy to change with time?

01:01:48.055 --> 01:01:49.430
I think, if it
changed with time,

01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:51.900
you wouldn't call
it vacuum energy.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.070
Because the vacuum
is more or less

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:55.870
defined as the lowest
possible energy

01:01:55.870 --> 01:02:00.130
state allowed by
the laws of physics.

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.210
And the laws of physics,
as far as we know,

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:03.481
do not change with time.

01:02:03.481 --> 01:02:05.980
It's certainly true that, in a
completely different context,

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.630
you might imagine the laws of
physics might change with time.

01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:10.700
And then thing would
get more complicated.

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.580
But that would really take you
somewhat outside the sphere

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.910
of physics as we know it.

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:18.660
You could always explore
things like that,

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.170
and it may turn out to be right.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:24.940
But at least within
the context of physics

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.500
as we currently envision
it, vacuum energies

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.280
are constant, pretty
much by definition.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.940
Now I should maybe qualify
that within the context of what

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:45.650
we understand, there may,
in fact, be multiple vacua.

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:48.740
For example, if you
have a field theory

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.350
one can have a potential
energy function

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.830
for one or more fields.

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:55.280
And that potential
energy function

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.680
could have more than
one local minimum.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.080
And then any one of those local
minima is effectively a vacuum.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.130
And that could very
likely be the situation

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.970
that describes the real world.

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:10.820
And then you could
tunnel from one vacuum

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.990
to another, changing
the vacuum energy.

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.890
But that would not be
a smooth evolution.

01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:17.350
That would be a
sudden tunneling.

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:33.990
OK.

01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:37.120
So this is what happens to
the second order Friedmann

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.576
equation.

01:03:39.576 --> 01:03:42.890
It is also very useful to look
at the first order Friedmann

01:03:42.890 --> 01:04:03.380
equation, which is a dot over
a squared, 8 pi over 3 G.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:08.970
And in its native
way of being written

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:11.990
we would just have
8 pi over 3 G rho,

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:16.100
minus k over-- kc
squared over a squared.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:20.450
And all I want to do now
is replace rho by rho

01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:21.690
vac plus rho n.

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.670
And this is a first
order Friedmann equation.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:54.530
And we can expand rho n
if we want more details,

01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:59.070
as rho matter plus
rho radiation.

01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:07.940
And rho matter, we know,
varies with time proportional

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.135
to 1 over a cubed.

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:18.250
Rho radiation behaves with
time as 1 over a to the fourth.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.900
So all of the terms
here, except for rho vac,

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.460
fall off as a grows.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:33.760
And that implies that
if you're not somehow

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.889
turned around firsts,
which you can be--

01:05:35.889 --> 01:05:37.430
you could have a
closed universe that

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:41.840
collapses before vacuum
energy can take over.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.430
But as the universe gets larger,
if it doesn't turn around,

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:49.974
eventually rho vac will win.

01:05:49.974 --> 01:05:51.640
It will become larger
than anything else

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.660
because everything else is just
getting smaller and smaller.

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:55.576
And once that starts to
happen everything else

01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:57.930
will get smaller and
smaller, faster and faster,

01:05:57.930 --> 01:06:03.350
because a will start
to grow exponentially.

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:17.140
If rho vac dominates--
which it will, as I said,

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.890
unless the universe
re-collapses first--

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:21.620
so for a large class
of solutions rho vac

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:27.740
will dominate-- then you
can solve that equation.

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:39.460
And you have h, which is
a dot over a, approaches,

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:49.255
as a goes to infinity, the
square root of 8 pi over 3 G

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:49.755
rho vac.

01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:09.250
So h will approach a fixed
value for a universe which

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:13.540
is ultimately dominated
by rho vacuum.

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.260
And if a dot over
a is a constant,

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.845
that means that a
grows exponentially.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.840
So we could maybe give
this a name-- h vac.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.680
The value h has
when it's completely

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.890
dominated by the vacuum energy.

01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:30.485
And then we can
write that a of t

01:08:30.485 --> 01:08:35.090
is ultimately going to be
proportional to e to the h vac

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:36.557
times t.

01:08:36.557 --> 01:08:38.640
Which is what you get when
you solve the equation,

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.760
a dot over a equals
this constant.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.479
OK.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:09:00.485
Now one thing which you
can see very quickly--

01:09:00.485 --> 01:09:02.359
let's see how far I
should plan to get today.

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:20.720
OK.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.511
I'll probably make one
qualitative argument

01:09:22.511 --> 01:09:25.399
and then start a calculation
that won't get very far.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.680
I will continue next time.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.750
One qualitative
point which you can

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:33.710
see from just glancing
at these equations

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:37.950
is that the cosmological
constant, when

01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:40.330
added to the other
ingredients that we've already

01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:42.779
put into our model
universe, will

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:45.550
have the effect of
increasing the age

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:48.950
of the universe for
a given value of h.

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:52.410
And that's something that we
said earlier in the course,

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:53.910
we're looking forward to.

01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:56.460
Because the model of
the universe that we're

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.420
been constructing
so far have always

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:04.359
turned out to be too young
for the measured value of h.

01:10:04.359 --> 01:10:06.150
That is, the oldest
stars look like they're

01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:07.310
older than the universe.

01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:08.370
And that's not good.

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:11.030
So we'd like to make
universe look older.

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:17.460
And one of the beauties of
having this vacuum energy,

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.120
as far as making
things fit together,

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.410
is that it does make
the universe older.

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:26.050
And the easiest way to
see that-- at least a way

01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:32.530
to see that-- is to imagine
drawing a graph of h versus t.

01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:36.320
Hubble expansion rate versus t.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.510
And if we look at
the formula for h

01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:44.770
here we see that the
rho vac piece just

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:49.800
puts in a floor as
h evolves with time,

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.420
instead of going to 0 as it
wood in most models-- at least,

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:56.250
as it would in
open-universe model.

01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:57.855
It stops at some floor.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:11.050
And certainly for the models
that we've been dealing with,

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:15.370
h just decreases to
some-- this is supposed

01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:18.650
to represent the present time.

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:24.115
So this is previous models.

01:11:27.852 --> 01:11:30.310
Now as you might say, that what
I'm trying to describe here

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:35.220
is not quite a theorem if you
considered closed universes

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:43.471
where this k piece
could be causing

01:11:43.471 --> 01:11:47.010
a positive-- a negative
contribution to h, which

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:48.640
is then decreasing with time.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.674
Things can get complicated.

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:52.840
But for the models that
we've been considering which

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:57.130
are nearly flat, that
k piece is absent.

01:11:57.130 --> 01:12:00.660
And then we just have pieces
that go like, 1 over a cubed,

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.060
1 over a to the
fourth, and constant.

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.650
All of which are positive.

01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:11.920
Then in the absence of vacuum
energy we would have h falling.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:16.270
And with the presence
of vacuum energy

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:17.820
it would not fall
as fast because we

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:21.890
have this constant piece
that would not be decreasing.

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:24.110
So this is previous models.

01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:29.780
This is with rho vac.

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.340
And I'm always talking
about positive rho vac

01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:34.800
because that is what
our universe has.

01:12:38.307 --> 01:12:40.140
So this would be the
two different behaviors

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:46.110
of h for the model
without vacuum energy

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:48.140
and the model with
vacuum energy.

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:51.170
And if we're trying to calculate
the age of the universe

01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:53.900
we would basically be
extrapolating this curve back

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:57.410
to the point where h was
infinite, at the big bang.

01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:59.900
And we could see that,
since this curve is always

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.750
below this curve,
it will take longer

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:05.140
before it turns up
and becomes infinite.

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:10.886
So the age will always increase
by adding vacuum energy.

01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:34.500
With rho vac h equals infinity
is further to the left.

01:13:38.902 --> 01:13:41.110
And notice that I'm comparing
two different theories,

01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:42.651
both of which are
the same age today.

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.920
Because that's what
we're interested in.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.170
We've measured the value of h.

01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:48.475
We're trying to infer
the age of the universe.

01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.950
OK.

01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:05.283
Maybe I'll just say a couple
words about the calculation

01:14:05.283 --> 01:14:07.242
that we'll be starting
with next time.

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:08.950
We want to be able to
precisely calculate

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:10.490
things like the age
of the universe,

01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:13.340
including the effect
of this vacuum energy.

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:16.840
And we'll be able to do that
in a very straightforward way

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.165
by using this first
order Friedmann equation.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.100
We know how each term in
this Friedmann equation

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:28.240
varies with a.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.227
And we can measure
the amount of matter,

01:14:30.227 --> 01:14:32.560
and the amount of radiation,
and in principal the amount

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.030
of curvature-- it's
negligibly small--

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:37.480
in our current universe.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.600
And once you have
those parameters

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.070
you can use that
equation to extrapolate,

01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:47.020
to know what h was at
any time in the past.

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:51.990
And that tells you
how the derivative--

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:55.820
it tells you the value of a
dot at any time in the past.

01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:58.670
And if you know the value of
a dot at any time in the past,

01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:01.080
it's a principle just
a matter of integration

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.330
to figure out when a was 0.

01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:07.710
And that's the calculation that
we'll begin by doing next time.

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:11.020
And we'll be able to get
an integral expression

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:14.980
for the age of the universe
for an arbitrary value.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.180
We'll, at the end,
express the matter density

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.710
and the radiation
density as fractions

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:24.470
of omega, fractions of
the critical density.

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:27.480
And for any value
of omega matter,

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.810
omega radiation, and we'll
even express the curvature

01:15:30.810 --> 01:15:31.920
as an omega curvature.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.040
The effective fraction
of the critical density

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.120
that this term represents.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.075
And in terms of those
different omegas,

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:39.700
we'll be able to
write down an integral

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.080
for the total age
of the universe.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.100
And that really is going
to be state of the art.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:48.160
That is what the
Planck team uses

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.854
when they're analyzing their
data to try to understand what

01:15:50.854 --> 01:15:53.020
the age of universe is
according to the measurements

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.180
that they're making.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.180
So we will finally come
up to the present as far

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:05.210
as the actual understanding
of cosmology by the experts.

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:07.530
So that's all for today.

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:10.000
see you all next Tuesday.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.913
PROFESSOR: OK,
so, local picture.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.610
It's all about getting
insight into how

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.330
the way function looks.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.360
That's what we'll need to get.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.500
These comments now
will be pretty useful.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.150
For this equation you
have one over psi,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.680
d second psi, d x
squared is minus 2 m

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.980
over h squared, E minus v of x.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.660
Look how I wrote it, I
put the psi back here,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.440
and that's useful.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.560
Now, there's a whole
lot of discussion--

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.090
many textbooks-- about
how the way function

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.560
looks, and they say concave
or convex, but it depends.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.760
Let's try to make it very clear
how the wave function looks.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.060
For this we need two regions.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:20.990
So, the first case, A, is
when the energy minus v of x

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.960
is less than 0.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.350
The energy is less than v of
x, that's a forbidden region--

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.310
as you can see there--

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.710
so it's a classically forbidden.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.710
Not quantum
mechanically forbidden,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.134
but classically forbidden.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.820
What is the main thing about
this classically forbidden

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.140
region is that the right
hand side of this equation

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.378
is positive.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.760
Now, this gives you
two possibilities.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:16.030
It may be that psi at some
point is positive, in which case

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.040
the second psi must
also be positive,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.580
because psi and the
second psi appear here.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.580
If both are positive,
this is positive.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.090
Or, it may be case two,
that psi is negative,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.380
and the second psi--

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.914
the x squared--
it's also negative.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.900
Well, how do we plot this?

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.630
Well, you're at some
point x, and here it

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.460
is, a positive
wave function seems

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.030
to be one type of convexity,
another type of convexity

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.090
for a negative, that's why
people get a little confused

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.110
about this.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.890
There's a way to see in a way
that there's is no confusion.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.640
Look at this, it's positive,
second derivative positive.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.520
When you think of a second
derivative positive,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.030
I think personally of
a parabola going up.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.720
So, that's how it could look.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.510
The wave function is
positive, up, it's all real.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.680
We're using the thing we
proved at the beginning

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.870
of this lecture: you can work
with real things, all real.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.280
So, the wave from here
is x, and here negative.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.230
And the negative
opening parabola,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.190
that's something they got.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.620
So nice.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.420
So, the wave
function at any point

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.670
could look like this
if it's positive,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.220
or, it could look like
this if it's negative.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.820
So, it doesn't look like
both, it's not double value.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.290
So, either one or the other.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.630
But, this is easy
to say in words,

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.770
it is a shape that is
convex towards the axis.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.340
From the axis it's convex
here and convex there.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.732
So, convex towards the axis.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.070
Now, there's another
possibility I want to just

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.050
make sure you visualize this.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.280
Sometimes this looks funny--
doesn't mean actually the way

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.080
function can look like that--

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.390
but, it's funny because
of the following reason.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.700
It's funny because if you
imagine it going forever,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.310
it doesn't make
sense because you're

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.200
in a classically the
forbidden region.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.320
And the way function's
becoming bigger and bigger

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.700
is going to blow up.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.670
So, eventually
something has to happen.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.070
But, it can look like this.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.530
So, actually what happens
is that when you're

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.290
going to minus infinity--

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.080
here is x and we
use minus infinity--

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.100
it can look like this.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.440
This is an example of this
piece that is asymptotic,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.820
and it's positive, and the
second derivative is positive.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.310
Or, negative and the second
derivative is negative.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.180
So that's a left asymptote.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.530
Or, you could have
a right asymptote,

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.870
and it looks like this.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.350
Again, second derivative
positive, positive wave

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.890
function.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.710
Second derivative negative,
negative wave function.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.500
So, you may find this at
the middle of the potential,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.250
but then eventually
something has to take over.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.720
Or, you may find this behavior,
or this behavior, at plus minus

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.040
infinity.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.380
But, in any case you are
in a classically forbidden,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.559
you're convex towards the axis.

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:04.100
That's the thing
you should remember.

00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:17.550
On the other hand, we can be on
the classically allowed region.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.357
So, let's think of that.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.380
Any questions about the
classically forbidden?

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:49.590
Classically allowed, B. E
minus v of x greater than 0,

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.725
classically allowed.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.180
On the right hand side of
the equation is negative.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:12.480
So, you can have, one,
a psi that is positive,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.760
and a second derivative
that is negative.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:27.400
Or, two, a psi that is negative,
and a second derivative

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.330
that this positive.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.760
So, how does that look?

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.260
Well, positive and second
derivative negative,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.070
I think of some wave function
as positive, and negative

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.620
is parabolic like that.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.400
And then, negative and
second derivative positive,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.990
it's possible to have this.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.790
The wave function
there it's negative,

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.020
but the second
derivative is positive.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.690
These things are not very good--

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.440
they're not very
usable asymptotically,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.740
because eventually
if you are like this,

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.330
you will cross these points.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.300
And then, if you're still
in the allowed region

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.050
you have to shift.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.340
But, this is done nicely in a
sense if you put it together

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.425
you can have this.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.180
Suppose all of this is
classically allowed.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.390
Then you can have the wave
function being positive,

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.370
the second derivative
being negative,

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.120
matching nicely
with the other half.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.299
The second derivative positive,
the wave function negative,

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.380
and that's what the
psi function is.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.030
It just goes one after another.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.880
So, that's what
typically things look

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.820
in the classically
allowed region.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:03.770
So, in this case, we say that
it's concave towards the axis.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.480
That's probably
worth remembering.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.270
So, one more case.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:37.210
The case C, when E is equal to E
minus v of x not is equal to 0.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.680
So, we have the negative,
the positive, 0.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.550
How about when you have
the situation where

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.060
the potential at some point
is equal to the energy?

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.150
Well, that's the
turning points there--

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.890
those were our turning points.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:10:01.530
So, this is how x 0
is a turning point.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.440
And, something else happens,
see, the right hand side is 0.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.500
We have that one over
psi, the second psi,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.550
the x squared is equal to 0.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:34.150
And, if psi is different
from 0, then you

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:41.400
have the second derivative
must be 0 at x not.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.450
And, the second derivative
being 0 is an inflection point.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:11.820
So, if you have a wave function
that has an inflection point,

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.950
you have a sign that you've
reached a turning point.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.360
An inflection point
in a wave function

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.190
could be anything like that.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.090
Second derivative
is positive here--

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.430
I'm sorry-- is negative here,
second derivative is positive,

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.036
this is an inflection point.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.870
It's a point where the
second derivative vanishes.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.600
So, that's an inflection point.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.240
And, it should be remarked
that from that differential

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.940
equation, you also get that
the second psi, the x squared,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:00.670
is equal to E minus v times
psi, which is constant.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.240
And, therefore,
when psi vanishes,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.700
you also get inflection
points automatically

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.790
because the second
derivative vanishes.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:19.360
So, inflection points
also at the nodes.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.580
Turning point is
an inflection point

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.910
where you have this situation.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:37.060
Look here, you have negative
second derivative, positive

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.490
second derivative, the
point where the wave

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:44.550
function vanishes and joins them
is an inflection point as well.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.690
Is not the turning point--

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.740
turning point are
more interesting--

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.420
but inflection points
are more generic.

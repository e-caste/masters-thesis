00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.616
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:24.240
So I'm going to hand
it over to Andrew.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.906
And this is basically--
we're continuing

00:00:25.906 --> 00:00:30.000
our track on narrative
and writing for games.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.740
On Wednesday we're switching
back over to production

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.720
and we'll be talking
with-- we'll have folks

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.280
from Blizzard to talk with us.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.410
But for today, more narrative.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.410
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.326
We're going to talk about
writing for computer

00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:42.850
games, or games in general.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.660
I'm here with Heather
Albano and Laura

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.954
Baldwin, who have very different
experiences with writing.

00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:51.120
And so I'm just going to
go ahead and dive right in,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.830
and we'll just sort of see what
happens in this conversation.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.663
And in a bit we're going
to start opening up

00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:58.510
to questions from
you folks, then

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.032
we'll sort of play
it by ear, and go on.

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:03.490
So I want to start with-- I
want you to go ahead and answer

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.190
first, Heather.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.440
What was your path towards
getting into writing

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.070
for computer-- for games?

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.740
Not for computer, just games?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.120
HEATHER ALBANO: I usually tell
people I got into it sideways.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.800
So my freshman year in college--
my first week of my freshman

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.570
year in college I looked
out the dorm window

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.060
and there were people with
boffer swords out in the quad.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.740
And my new best friend
and I looked at each other

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.850
and said, I'll go check it
out, if you come with me.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.430
And so I got involved
playing with a LARP,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.530
and-- Live Action
Role Playing a game.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.900
And then I got involved
writing for it.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.840
And I did that as a hobby
for a number of years,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.760
through college and
into the real world.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.434
And in 2009 I lost
my job in marketing.

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:51.350
It was the year that
everybody lost their job.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.260
And Adam Morse, whom
I knew from the LARP,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.320
called me and said he was
founding a games company.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.869
This is Choice of Games, which
possibly you've heard of.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.910
They've been pretty well
in the four years since.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.370
At the time it was a lark.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.300
And he said, do you
want to write for us?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.740
They never turn into anything.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.669
And I said, yeah.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:09.270
Why not?

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.775
So it started me on a
really amazing adventure

00:02:12.775 --> 00:02:15.720
of-- started writing for
them, and now I do freelance

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.900
for other people as well.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.634
And here I am.

00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:19.634
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:20.630
Cool.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.800
LAURA BALDWIN: Mine, actually,
is not so dissimilar.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.750
I went to college and got
involved in the MIT Assassins

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.830
Guild, which hopefully
some of you have heard of,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.570
which is another LARP, and
started writing for them.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.040
I did sit-down games.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.590
Then I went to grad school,
got a degree in immunology,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.890
and decided I didn't
want to be a biologist.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.950
Which is much like
you, losing your job.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.570
HEATHER ALBANO:
Yep, [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.259
LAURA BALDWIN: And I got a
half-time job working with MIT,

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.550
because they only had half
of a head count in the thing

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.680
that I was doing, and
my other half-time

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.120
job was a friend of mine who
I had written some Assassin

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.320
games with and had done
some sit-downing with.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.060
Had, at a point in the past,
founded a computer game

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.140
company, or been part of
creating a computer game

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.960
company-- Looking Glass, I
think it was Studios firsts--

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.730
And said, well, I
know that you know

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.900
how to write things, and
know things about games

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.480
and can work with
well with others.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.200
So do you want to
come and work for us?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.730
And since I wanted to keep
my job with the health care

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.160
I worked half-time for
them and half-time for MIT,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.220
and did that for
a number of years

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.500
until Looking Glass
ended up going bankrupt,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.800
and now I just work for MIT.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.400
And still do
sit-downs and stuff.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.606
But yeah, it does
seem to be about-- you

00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:42.980
get into games
first and then you

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.396
have connections
with other people

00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:47.085
and they get you
into game companies.

00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:48.460
HEATHER ALBANO:
Networking works,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.840
is the moral of the story.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.048
ANDREW GRANT: It really does.

00:03:51.048 --> 00:03:52.930
LAURA BALDWIN: Meet each other.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.210
ANDREW GRANT: You
never know later.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.100
Everyone you meet
today might be helpful.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.600
Yeah.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.240
So you've both done a fair
bit of writing for games.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.449
Have you been writing
outside of games at all?

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.740
HEATHER ALBANO: Do you want
to take it first this time?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.781
LAURA BALDWIN: So I work
in customer support now,

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:11.450
and that involves a lot of
writing email back to people.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.460
That has trained me to be
concise and clear and friendly

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.980
in writing.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.449
It's a little bit related,
but that's about it.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.240
HEATHER ALBANO: OK.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.270
In contrast, I do a lot of
non-game fiction writing.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.690
My dream job for years was
to be able to write novels,

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.500
and it's actually less
so as I've had success

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.780
in writing for games, which
is fulfilling in its own way

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.750
and pays a lot better.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.030
But I've sold some short fiction
and some poetry to magazines.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.450
I've self-published two novels.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.885
And that's sort of on the hobby
side of my life these days.

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:48.760
ANDREW GRANT: Got it.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.570
We'll come back to that
in a little bit, I think.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.710
So I want to talk about
what kinds of games

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.700
you've worked on, and
so what kind of writing

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.574
that you've done has
appeared in those games?

00:04:57.574 --> 00:05:02.540
And feel free to name names and
whatnot of what you worked on.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.474
Why don't head, Heather?

00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:09.250
HEATHER ALBANO: So my
professional game writing

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.990
divides into three
categories pretty neatly.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.040
I've done most of it
for Choice of Games,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.310
which does multiple choice
text-based games of the Choose

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.540
Your Path variety.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.260
So, kind of like the old Choose
Your Own Adventure books,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.300
if you're familiar with those,
although better-written,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.510
if I say it myself.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.670
So that's all text, right?

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.700
All text all the time.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.860
I was lead writer on
Codename Cygnus two years

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.330
ago now, which is an
interactive radio drama, which

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.950
is sort of the same idea in
that it is all word-based,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.330
but obviously the interface
is very different.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:54.070
And I have done some work
for paper-and-pencil RPGs.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.809
TimeWatch by Kevin Kulp
is coming out next year

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:58.100
and I've got some work in that.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.200
ANDREW GRANT: There's
a small world again.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.250
OK.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.054
I know Kevin Kulp.

00:06:00.054 --> 00:06:01.470
HEATHER ALBANO: I
figured you did.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.344
Looking Glass, right?

00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:03.840
Wasn't he-- no?

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.620
OK.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.669
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:08.460
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.440
His wife worked for Looking
Glass, and et cetera.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.180
So talk about
interactive radio show.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.760
How does that work?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.270
HEATHER ALBANO: So you
play it off your iPod,

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.880
and I think now your Android.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.140
It talks to you and at the--
it narrates what's going on.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.670
You play a spy in a
James Bond kind of world.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.920
And so it tells you the
circumstance you're in

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.940
and then asks you if you want
to do this or that in response,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.000
and you say the word.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.670
The voice recognition
is pretty good,

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.310
but it's not
super-sophisticated.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.440
It wasn't designed to be.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.600
So you don't get to talk
back to it in a natural way,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.680
you have to save the-- it's
a little bit better than,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.750
pick a or pick b, but
you have to say the words

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.555
that it gives you.

00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:56.430
ANDREW GRANT: Got it.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.260
So you can say, shoot gun,
not for a villain or whatever.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.260
HEATHER ALBANO: Exactly.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.820
Not, I draw the gun and
duck behind the-- no.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.420
I shoot the gun.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.060
But yeah.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.060
So other than that, it's
mostly multiple choice.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.059
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:10.530
So the behind-the-scene
mechanics

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.250
are very similar to the
multiple choice text adventure,

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.711
but it's text that's going
to be heard instead of read.

00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:18.710
HEATHER ALBANO: Exactly.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.520
ANDREW GRANT: Oh, all right.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.180
Neat.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.544
And you, Laura?

00:07:22.544 --> 00:07:24.460
LAURA BALDWIN: What was
the original question?

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.270
ANDREW GRANT: The original
was what sorts of stuff

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.700
has-- what kinds of
games have you worked on

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.400
and how did your
stuff appear in there.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.880
LAURA BALDWIN: So I was kind
of a-- since I was part-time

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.570
they didn't want to put me in
charge of any specific levels

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.420
or anything, so I was sort
of-- I did a lot of odd jobs.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.330
I ended up writing the manual
for System Shock 2, which

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.140
was really exciting because
a lot of the time you have

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.700
to write the manual before the
game mechanics are sorted out.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.780
So you would say
things like, this psi

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.530
power provides defense.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.300
You really have no idea, sorry.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.170
And then in Thief
and Thief II I did

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.680
a lot of sort of
like random books

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.910
that are scattered around,
or dialogue that characters

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.910
would say to each other.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.118
There wasn't much that
characters said to each other.

00:08:16.118 --> 00:08:18.710
And then the guards and so on
you're trying to sneak around,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.790
and the guards are
basically walking

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.247
around being emitters
of what they think

00:08:23.247 --> 00:08:24.830
is going on right
now which, you know,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.650
if you're really
sneaky they're like,

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.410
I have no idea
anything is going on.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.090
I am bored.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.280
I see nothing.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.320
I hear nothing.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.607
But you know, if you let
them-- if they see you briefly

00:08:34.607 --> 00:08:36.190
or hear you briefly,
then they sort of

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.940
have to admit their
state which is,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.012
I am mildly suspicious
because I heard something

00:08:40.012 --> 00:08:41.220
but I don't know what it was.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.330
Or, I'm really
suspicious because I just

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.540
saw Thief going that way.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.030
But you know, they're
not very bright AIs,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.290
so they don't have a
lot of different states

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.180
that they can say.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.300
They have a level of
suspicion and then a level

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.190
of what caused the suspicion.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.990
And there's a big
matrix of that.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.680
And then you don't
want your guards

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.820
to say the same thing
every single time,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.210
so you have to have, like,
20 different things for each

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.550
of those categories.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.630
And it gets kind of
tedious and difficult

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.560
to come up with 20
different ways to say,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.070
I am mildly suspicious
because of a noise,

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.370
without sounding like you've
been coached to say that.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.860
You know, how many natural
ways can you say that?

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.065
And then yeah-- I think
that's most of it.

00:09:30.065 --> 00:09:31.065
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:09:31.065 --> 00:09:32.520
Yeah, that's good.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.944
And so let's jump
right into a little bit

00:09:34.944 --> 00:09:37.360
here, the difference between
writing for stuff that people

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.540
are going to read versus stuff
that people are going to hear.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.520
It sounds like you've
got a lot of experience

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.050
with that, with
long-form read words,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.990
and you're talking
about guards that

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.220
are saying things out loud,
or also written books.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.900
And those are very
different things,

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.830
I assume, in terms
of how the player's

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.517
going to appreciate them.

00:09:56.517 --> 00:09:57.350
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.520
So the thing that I
learned pretty quickly

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.860
about stuff that is said out
loud is that the players want

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.230
it to be really,
really short, which

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.200
makes it in particular
extra-hard because, you know,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.770
"huh," or "what was that?"

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.870
You know, they want to have
about that much of interaction

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.820
with the guard that
they're hiding from,

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.230
and you have to convey all this
little settings because you

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.960
want to have people
know the difference

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.555
between a "huh" that's like,
"hm," or a "huh" that's like,

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:28.300
"huh!

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.800
I'm going to get you."

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.340
So there's also a lot of little
stage notes, you know? "Huh.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.970
Angry."

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:42.210
But I ended up writing a lot
of little, short dialogues

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.930
for guards to be
talking to each other,

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.690
or other-- it was mostly
guards-- that you could

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.450
sneak by and hear,
and sometimes it

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.920
was to convey information
about where something was.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.610
And sadly kind of the
first thing that we got

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.590
told after the playtesting was
that those are just too long.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.137
Nobody wants to sit there for
three minutes and, you know,

00:11:01.137 --> 00:11:02.970
hide in the shadows
listening to guards talk

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.220
to each other about something.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.110
Especially not more than once.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.830
And so really only one
of the conversations

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.400
that was more than
four lines survived

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.050
into the shipping game, which
is at the very beginning

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.860
of the first level.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.870
And you can skip it.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.710
It's the guards talking to
each other in the courtyard

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.565
about going to bear
bits, and you can go

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:23.690
and you can listen to them.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.830
And it tells you a little
bit about the world.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.955
Or you can just, you know,
sneak around and go back

00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:29.000
to the secret entrance.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.420
And so if you're playing
the game for the second time

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.882
you do not have to
listen to all of it.

00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:35.840
ANDREW GRANT: So is there
a lot of conversation

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.870
left on the cutting room
floor, as it were then?

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.830
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.330
Yeah.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.180
ANDREW GRANT: Because it
wasn't until playtest that you

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.310
realized that it was too long.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.760
LAURA BALDWIN: I think-- I
guess it must have been recorded

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.480
because most of our guards were
being voiced by programmers,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.930
at least early on.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.536
I think we definitely kept
Dan Thron as the stupid guard.

00:11:59.536 --> 00:12:02.190
He became very popular.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.780
ANDREW GRANT: He's got
a very expressive voice.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.600
So I imagine your form
of fiction, Heather,

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.260
is a little bit different
because it's a longer form

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.990
to begin with, so you expect
a little bit more patience

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.960
on the part of your players.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.610
HEATHER ALBANO: Yep.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.320
And also all they've
got is the words.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.290
The words are-- the
dialogue in the radio drama,

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.810
for instance-- the dialogue
isn't a distraction

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:20.590
from the mechanic.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.360
The dialogue is the mechanic.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.610
It's all they got to react to.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:23.860
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.530
You don't want to have--
they're not going to be saying,

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.430
oh, I want to fast
forward through all this,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.450
because why would
they be playing?

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:28.780
HEATHER ALBANO: Right.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.280
Exactly.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.390
All they're doing is listening
to other voice actors,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.240
you know, putting
together a drama

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.676
and then they're responding
to it, interacting with it.

00:12:38.676 --> 00:12:41.660
The difference between--
there is a difference

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.050
between writing dialogue
that will be read

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.320
and writing dialogue
that will be spoken.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:55.080
In the Choice of Games we
have a lot more freedom.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.030
We have a lot
more-- we have a lot

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.540
of things that
aren't the dialogue.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.520
You can put in a tag that
says, "hey, he said angrily."

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.030
Right?

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.400
Or you can say that he said
it while folding his arms

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.230
or whatever, that gives the
reader a clue as to what

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.410
they're dealing with.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.040
When you're writing a
radio drama all you've got

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.730
is the dialogue and the
stage queues for the actors.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.430
I got a lot better at
writing dialogue very,

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.219
very, very fast
out of necessity,

00:13:24.219 --> 00:13:25.260
working for that project.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.400
People who write
traditional fiction

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.500
will tell you that there
shouldn't be a difference.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.980
You should always be writing
dialogue that doesn't

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.990
need the prose around it.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:45.220
You should always be able to
get the character's personality

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.320
and how they're reacting
to the particular situation

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.160
just from their word choice,
which is a great gold standard.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.312
There are some writers
who do that very well.

00:13:56.312 --> 00:13:58.270
Dorothy Sayers, who wrote
a series of mysteries

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.852
back in the earlier
part of the century--

00:14:00.852 --> 00:14:05.280
in the early part of the 1900s--
does this very, very, very

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:05.780
well.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.680
You can read-- she's got--
there's pages and pages where

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.060
it's just open
quotes, close quotes

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.439
dialogue between two
characters and you never

00:14:14.439 --> 00:14:16.980
lose track of who's saying what
because the personalities are

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:17.744
so very different.

00:14:17.744 --> 00:14:18.910
ANDREW GRANT: So very clear.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.100
HEATHER ALBANO:
Very, very clear.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.780
Most of the rest of
us aren't that good.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.090
That's really the gold standard.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.040
But when you've only got
dialogue to work with,

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.970
you have to get that good.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.210
It forces you to think
very hard about what

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.629
the different
characters are like.

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:38.670
ANDREW GRANT: Sure, sure.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.130
I imagine the stage
direction helps a little bit.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.970
So you want to get
across he said angrily,

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.400
but we can tell the
actor to do that.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:45.873
HEATHER ALBANO: Exactly.

00:14:45.873 --> 00:14:46.820
Yeah.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.320
ANDREW GRANT: And then,
of course, you probably

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.990
want to pick actors with
different sounding voices

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.010
to help it along a little
bit, and that sort of thing.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.370
HEATHER ALBANO: Yep.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.110
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.760
HEATHER ALBANO: That's more on
the production end, but yeah.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.500
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:55.999
Sure.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.820
So one of things that a friend
of mine was talking about

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.860
was, he was adapting
a Shakespearean play

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.002
for a comic book form,
which is very cool.

00:15:08.002 --> 00:15:09.960
But when he did that he
said he had to take out

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.860
about half the text of the
play because in the play

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.840
most of the information appeared
twice, because the listener was

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.470
hearing the play and you don't,
in real time, understand it.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.870
For a radio play do you give
people redundant information

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.600
or do you just rely on them
paying really intense attention

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.892
to it?

00:15:27.892 --> 00:15:31.460
HEATHER ALBANO: That's
an interesting question.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.390
I think I would probably have
to go back over the script

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.625
to answer that for real.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.380
My recollection is that we
did a little bit of repetition

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.330
to make sure that
any time the player

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.670
was making a choice they
knew the context they

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.360
were making the choice in.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.990
So if there had been some
dialogue they couldn't respond

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:58.930
to they might get like a summary
from character number three.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.820
"It looks like John
wants to do this,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.350
but Mary wants to do this.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.610
What do you think, agent?

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:04.977
What should we do?"

00:16:04.977 --> 00:16:06.768
LAURA BALDWIN: Do you
have a Go Back button

00:16:06.768 --> 00:16:08.460
so you can hear stuff again?

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.543
HEATHER ALBANO: Not in the
current implementation,

00:16:10.543 --> 00:16:12.579
as far as I know.

00:16:12.579 --> 00:16:14.620
ANDREW GRANT: But it sounds
like you could almost

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.057
play this game without
touching anything, is the idea.

00:16:17.057 --> 00:16:18.640
HEATHER ALBANO:
That's the idea, yeah.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.700
You can-- it does
come with a button

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.940
that you can choose
visually if you like,

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.690
but the idea was that you should
be able to play it in your car.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.950
ANDREW GRANT: Got it.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.370
HEATHER ALBANO: So yeah.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.270
But of course we weren't dealing
with Shakespeare, either.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.115
So it wasn't that
level of complexity.

00:16:32.115 --> 00:16:34.410
ANDREW GRANT: Well, and the
poetry must complement it.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.160
LAURA BALDWIN: Like,
in role playing games

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.260
where they have a
lot of voice-overs

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.032
and they have subtitles, I
usually turn the subtitles

00:16:41.032 --> 00:16:41.740
on, just in case.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.860
Like, sometimes I
miss a word or two

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.680
and I'm like, I can't go back.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.007
It's a conversation
tree, you know?

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:48.840
ANDREW GRANT: Right.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.756
HEATHER ALBANO: Right.

00:16:49.756 --> 00:16:50.940
Yes.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.900
ANDREW GRANT: That's
kind of interesting too,

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.040
because a lot of the
sit-down role playing games

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.690
that I've been in, a lot of
times the gamemaster's very

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.290
patient with saying, wait,
what did that person say?

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.620
And if you missed it, will
help you figure it out.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.971
But in this meeting you're
talking about, no, there's

00:17:03.971 --> 00:17:04.720
not a lot of help.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.369
If you missed it, you missed it.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.068
And part of the
game is, in fact,

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:09.609
comprehension the
first time through.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.736
That's kind of neat.

00:17:12.736 --> 00:17:13.319
So, all right.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:17.130
So you've talked a little
bit about this already,

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.937
but all these
things are placing,

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:21.020
pretty much, a lot of
constraints on your writing.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.520
You know, you're
talking about-- you

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.569
have to get across ideas
for dialogue alone.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.259
And I think it's
kind of-- there's

00:17:28.259 --> 00:17:30.675
a difference between-- there's
conversation that gives you

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:31.740
an idea of who the
characters are,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.406
or just sort of some
filler, and there's

00:17:33.406 --> 00:17:35.990
conversation which has got
vital information in it.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.240
You might know before you
write that conversation what

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.680
that information is.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.560
Does that change
how you approach

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.215
that writing,
knowing that you have

00:17:44.215 --> 00:17:46.090
to stick some important
information in there?

00:17:48.965 --> 00:17:50.840
Or do you now think
about it that way at all,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.920
and I'm just off in the field?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.961
HEATHER ALBANO: No, I've
got to think about that.

00:17:53.961 --> 00:18:03.240
So I think every scene
has a particular point

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.200
you're driving towards.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.080
If there are multiple
choices in a scene--

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.010
I'm thinking now
Choice Of as well as

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:15.026
Cygnus-- then every choice has a
particular piece of information

00:18:15.026 --> 00:18:17.150
that you're needing to get
across so the player can

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.910
make the choice.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.160
It's not quite a constraint
in bad way, though.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.950
It's more of-- I don't know.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.360
It's a more positive
word than that.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.860
I feel like I've actually
had the good fortune

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.666
to be remarkably unconstrained
in the writing I've

00:18:31.666 --> 00:18:33.520
done for games,
because so much of it

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.380
has been text-based
and dialogue-driven.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.630
I think if you want to talk
about constraints, writing

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.557
for actual video games is the--

00:18:41.557 --> 00:18:42.890
LAURA BALDWIN: So, I mean, Yeah.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.930
The little grid of
"I'm suspicious"

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.120
is very constraining.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.070
But I mean, to some
extent the constraints are

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.750
what tell you what you
have to write about.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.940
I mean, I pretty much never
wake up in the morning and say,

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.959
"I am going to write a thing."

00:18:58.959 --> 00:19:01.500
It's always, you know, what are
the things you have to write?

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.230
I think I read
somewhere that poets

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:11.290
said that the very
strict poem forms--

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.640
it's the pushing against
the boundaries that

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.060
are what make them interesting,
as opposed to prose

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.050
where you sort of
write whatever.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:24.700
But it's more that sometimes the
constraints are kind of funny.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:30.130
Like, for the cutscenes
the rule was you did them

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.960
in screenplay format.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.250
And, you know, it's particular
margins, particular fonts

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.660
and capitalization
and everything.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.760
And the rule of thumb
was one page per minute,

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.780
or one page per
30 seconds, or-- I

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.840
don't remember what
it was, but it was--

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.860
and so it was, OK, well,
we've got two minutes and 30

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.450
seconds budgeted
for the cutscene

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.810
so it can't be more
than five pages.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.100
And you can't do the trick
of making the font smaller.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.980
So there was a lot of
very strange text editing

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.950
where, you know,
someone would say things

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:07.420
and it was, like, a line plus a
word, and you can't have that.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.709
That's taking up 10 seconds
or something with the one word

00:20:11.709 --> 00:20:13.250
at the end-- which
it isn't, really--

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.010
but by the measurement,
you know, no.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.320
It has to be-- so,
you know, I would--

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.910
sometimes you put in a
semicolon instead of a dash

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.090
because it's shorter.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.022
And then, you
know, you would put

00:20:30.022 --> 00:20:31.980
in the descriptions of
the scenes or the action

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.380
or whatever, which is like,
you know, "view of a study,

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.820
zoom in on the desk which has
an ink well," or whatever.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.170
And you had to make those also
very short but descriptive

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.180
because you can't just
say, "study" and leave it

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.160
to the artist to
imagine what you mean.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.440
And the reason that
the rules are like that

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.560
is because the more
description you

00:20:53.560 --> 00:21:00.720
have in the set scene,
in the scene description,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.290
the more time it's going to
take to show all of the things.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.240
You know, if you have 15
different things on the desk

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.906
and you want to be
able to see them all,

00:21:06.906 --> 00:21:08.560
you'll want to focus
on it for longer.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.599
So it's kind of true that the
more lines you have describing

00:21:12.599 --> 00:21:13.890
the scene, the longer it takes.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.280
But it was a very
strange constraint

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.810
to write to, just because
it seemed so surreal.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.351
ANDREW GRANT: So you're kind of
gaming-- you had a constraint

00:21:22.351 --> 00:21:25.900
and you're kind of gamed the
constraint to fit on one line.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.460
And that's actually
not at all surprising.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.150
I mean, that happens with all
rule sets everywhere, right?

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.140
People game the system.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.790
LAURA BALDWIN: And I'm sure
screenwriters have to do that,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.120
too.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.685
And they're probably--
like, if there

00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:37.768
are screeners out there
they're probably like, oh,

00:21:37.768 --> 00:21:39.092
yeah, use the short words.

00:21:39.092 --> 00:21:40.550
HEATHER ALBANO:
And, interestingly,

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.630
there is an almost identical
constraint in Choice of Games,

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.490
where we only want so many
words on any given screen.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.310
People are playing these on
a phone a lot of time, right?

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:52.590
So there's a rule of thumb
that I can no longer remember,

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.860
about how many
words you can have

00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:01.270
before you should have a choice,
and how many words per screen.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.460
Perhaps you might have two
screens before a choice,

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.293
but probably you shouldn't
do a lot of that.

00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:06.700
You get the idea.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:11.660
But so that leads to some
gaming, like with finding

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.220
a shorter word to say
a thing, but it also

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.970
forces you to think
about what you actually

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.730
need to say right now as
opposed to later, or never,

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:21.345
or, you know.

00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:24.700
And what you said about,
if you need more words

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.090
to paint the scene it's
going to take longer,

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.230
that's definitely true
when it's prose, right?

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.800
If the player needs to know
about-- he's sitting at a desk

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.700
where there's an ink well and a
book of poetry and a something

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.520
else that's going to
be relevant later,

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:43.660
you have to describe them all
without knocking the player

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.370
over the head, necessarily.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:45.630
LAURA BALDWIN: By the
way, there's three things.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:46.750
HEATHER ALBANO: By the
way, there's an ink well.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:47.360
Yeah.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.250
Yeah, exactly.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.040
You just slip it in.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.540
ANDREW GRANT: So you talk about
these constraints coming in.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.123
Are these constraints
that were handed

00:22:54.123 --> 00:22:55.440
to you by the rest of team?

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.300
And if so, is
there cases where--

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.030
how much creative controlled do
you have to sort of fight back

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.030
against that sometimes?

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.290
Or is it pretty much
written in stone?

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.169
Or how do you interact
with the team that way?

00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:08.960
HEATHER ALBANO: Well,
when I was at Looking

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.190
Glass I was kind of the
odd jobs person, as I said.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.950
So I would had really
no creative control,

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.190
but I wasn't looking for it.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.410
I was happily doing
tasks that I was given.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:24.240
Sometimes, I guess, I would
say-- you know, sometimes

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.010
you would get
feedback saying, so

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.310
you need to make these
things more this way,

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.340
and I would be
like, well, it isn't

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.110
possible to make them
more-suspicious-sounding

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:38.050
and still have them in the
not-suspicious category,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:38.789
or, you know.

00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:40.080
But it would be a conversation.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.410
It was like, OK, the thing
that you're telling me to do

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.110
doesn't make sense, please
clarify, as opposed to,

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.476
I think the thing you're
telling me to do is wrong

00:23:47.476 --> 00:23:48.475
and I want it different.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.026
And--

00:23:53.026 --> 00:23:54.990
ANDREW GRANT: So there
would be back and forth,

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.667
communication being
the key thing there.

00:23:56.667 --> 00:23:57.500
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.380
And, you know, often there
would be a level designer

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.790
who would say things
like, OK, I need

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.870
books for this, this, and this.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:12.246
Or can you translate the books
that I've-- I have these pieces

00:24:12.246 --> 00:24:12.870
of information.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.830
Can you translate them
into Hammerspeak for me?

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.409
And so it was--

00:24:17.409 --> 00:24:18.784
ANDREW GRANT:
What's Hammerspeak?

00:24:18.784 --> 00:24:19.830
LAURA BALDWIN: Ah.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:25.460
So the factions in Thief--
there were the Hammerites

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.240
who kind of spoke like
King James bibles,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.400
and there were the trickster
minions, the Woodsies,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.478
who spoke weirdly.

00:24:37.478 --> 00:24:42.650
And that's kind of
the-- you know, they-- I

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:48.460
think Terri Brosius came up
with their dialect originally,

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.960
and it was, you know, "the
Woodsies sing in the treesies."

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.537
And, you know, it was
just a little weird.

00:24:55.537 --> 00:24:57.120
ANDREW GRANT: A
little crazy, kind of.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:57.953
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:24:57.953 --> 00:25:01.740
And it tended to be
not very grammatical

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.070
and there were a lot
of diminutives on it.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.660
But it made them
all sound like they

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.930
were from the same
subculture, and I

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.690
think that that was useful.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:15.947
Where did I start with this?

00:25:15.947 --> 00:25:17.530
ANDREW GRANT: You
started with working

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.779
with a team, creative control.

00:25:18.779 --> 00:25:21.610
If there's any-- how
do you manage that,

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:26.470
or was it frustrating
or any of that?

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.550
LAURA BALDWIN: I can't
do artists stuff,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.950
and I wasn't very good
at the level des--

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.520
So I don't want the
creative control.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.086
I want to do the
stuff I'm good at

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:37.710
and let the other people who are
going at stuff do their stuff.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.434
That's--

00:25:39.434 --> 00:25:41.100
HEATHER ALBANO: I
think that's certainly

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.580
the attitude I
would take if I were

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.710
working on a video game,
which I haven't done yet.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.300
Maybe someday.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.500
Because I have great
respect for people

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.560
who can do visual storytelling.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.270
I have no artistic
ability myself.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:57.730
So I would definitely
be pushing that off.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:05.507
The Choice of Games-- I'm doing
a solo project the first time,

00:26:05.507 --> 00:26:07.340
galloping towards the
end of a solo project.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.310
The other ones I have done
have been co-authored,

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:14.970
and so there was-- the
first one certainly I

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.090
was kind of a junior
partner, learning.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:20.470
And so the Choice of Broadsides
was the first game I worked on,

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.180
and when I joined the team
it was all storyboarded.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.640
And so it was a
matter of, right,

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.306
well, I'm going to
learn how to do this,

00:26:26.306 --> 00:26:31.590
so I'll take that scene
to start with, you know?

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.130
The second game, Choice of
Romance, Adam Strong-Morse

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.890
and I were definitely
colleagues.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.320
And so there's a give
and take in a-- well,

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.589
any kind of partnership.

00:26:42.589 --> 00:26:44.380
Any kind of creative
partnership, for sure,

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.890
where you have two people
with different opinions

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.220
on how to do x and y and z.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.960
And, you know, we have a pretty
solid working relationship.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:27:01.090
The one I'm doing solo has been
both freeing and terrifying

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:05.825
in that I have
creative control-- yay.

00:27:05.825 --> 00:27:06.450
It's wonderful.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.510
It's totally my story,
and that's phenomenal,

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.350
and it does mean,
however, that when

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.130
I don't know how to do something
there are times when I do kind

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:17.764
of wish I had a
co-author to say,

00:27:17.764 --> 00:27:19.680
I actually don't have
any good ideas for this.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.670
Can you--?

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.770
What I do have is a
very, very good editor.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.950
And so we work in
pretty close partnership

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.530
where I can-- for
instance, last week--

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.560
write her an email after a
playtesting session saying,

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.630
I think we might
have to eliminate

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.170
this section completely.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.390
If we do it we'll cause
these other problems,

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.430
but if we don't, I don't know
how to solve these problems.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.770
Which do you think?

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.650
Leading to a two
hour conference call

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:49.090
where we came up with a third
option, which I would never

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:50.545
have come up with
by myself, which

00:27:50.545 --> 00:27:52.086
meant we didn't have
to cut the scene

00:27:52.086 --> 00:27:54.180
and we solved the
problems a different way.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.180
ANDREW GRANT:
That's really cool.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.090
HEATHER ALBANO: So
hooray for editors.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.548
ANDREW GRANT: I really like
the fact that you mention that,

00:27:58.548 --> 00:28:00.660
as you're playtesting your
work and it's not done.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.124
You're playtesting your writing,
which I think is awesome.

00:28:04.124 --> 00:28:06.540
And so that's a great example
of what we're talking about,

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.425
where playtesting
totally just told you

00:28:08.425 --> 00:28:10.120
that something wasn't working.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.775
Does that happen a lot?

00:28:11.775 --> 00:28:13.025
HEATHER ALBANO: Unfortunately.

00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:14.470
Well, I mean,
fortunately, right?

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.230
Because you'd much
rather have it

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.800
when it's still under
your control than when

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.530
it's out in the wild, right?

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:30.950
So the Codename Cygnus
thing I was the lead writer,

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.180
so I have a lot of influence,
a lot of control of the script,

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:34.680
right?

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.810
It was me and the Creative
Director, John Myers,

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.360
working together on it.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.310
But John was in
charge of production,

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.430
so I actually wasn't involved
in the playtesting for that.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.700
I would get notes that
were along the lines of,

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.300
this dialogue sequence
is running way long,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.780
we need to cut it.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.260
You get the idea.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:57.620
The Choice of Game stuff I have
been much more in the trenches,

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:02.760
like with this game I'm working
on now, my solo project.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.760
I'm buying dinner for friends
and sitting behind them

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.440
and watching them play it
because it's the only way I

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.217
can tell when they're confused.

00:29:13.217 --> 00:29:14.800
You can ask people
to write you notes,

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.350
and they will, and
they mean well,

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.930
but they never
remember everything.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.180
And so when you're sitting
there and somebody's taking

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.170
10 minutes to make a
choice you can ask,

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.605
so what are you
thinking right now?

00:29:26.605 --> 00:29:28.230
And you can get an
idea of whether they

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:32.410
have no idea what's going
on, which was actually

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:37.136
where the problem in this most
recent-- that the player was

00:29:37.136 --> 00:29:39.260
utterly confused and that
wasn't the first time I'd

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.435
gotten that feedback.

00:29:40.435 --> 00:29:41.810
Although it was
the first time it

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.240
was utter confusion,
rather than mild confusion.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.351
Or whether the player
is so engrossed

00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:49.850
that they want to make sure
they do exactly the right thing,

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.220
which is a fine response.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.082
And they can take 10 minutes
if that's what I need to do.

00:29:55.082 --> 00:29:56.730
So yes, I've sort
of wandered away

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.572
from-- what was the
original question?

00:29:58.572 --> 00:29:59.530
ANDREW GRANT: Playtest.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.080
You found it.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.010
You do it all the time.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:02.551
In fact, you're
going out of your way

00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:07.032
to do it on the solo project
which is mostly writing,

00:30:07.032 --> 00:30:08.740
and you're still
playtesting a lot, which

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.580
I think is really fascinating.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.516
You mentioned an
editor, you have

00:30:10.516 --> 00:30:12.430
to imagine-- so you've
written books as well.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:13.263
HEATHER ALBANO: Yes.

00:30:13.263 --> 00:30:15.759
ANDREW GRANT: Do
you playtest books?

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:16.800
HEATHER ALBANO: Um, yeah.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.674
I do, actually.

00:30:17.674 --> 00:30:19.590
You don't call it that
in traditional fiction,

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.220
but absolutely.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.927
You have drafts, and I belong to
the Cambridge fiction workshop.

00:30:22.927 --> 00:30:24.760
LAURA BALDWIN: My husband
gets really grumpy

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.502
when I call him a
playtester instead of QA.

00:30:27.502 --> 00:30:28.460
ANDREW GRANT: Who this?

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.640
Say that again?

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.990
LAURA BALDWIN: So
Jerry works in QA

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.080
and I often refer to
him as a playtester

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.412
and he's like, it's not
actually playtesting.

00:30:36.412 --> 00:30:38.120
HEATHER ALBANO: Is he
QA-- not for games?

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.060
LAURA BALDWIN: Not
for games, yeah.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.851
HEATHER ALBANO: OK.

00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:40.500
All right.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.460
That's hilarious then.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.670
ANDREW GRANT: So Laura,
have you had experiences

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.090
with playtesting being
essential or showing

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.690
you stuff you didn't expect?

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.900
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.600
I mean, in general
for computer games

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.940
you have to have playtesting.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.800
And I feel like there's actually
a new, modern version where

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.800
you don't playtest and
you ship broken games

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.024
and you just patch as you go,
but I don't approve of that.

00:31:08.024 --> 00:31:09.940
ANDREW GRANT: That is
the new, modern version.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.660
Yeah.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.990
LAURA BALDWIN: Looking Glass
had in-house playtesting,

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.690
so you not only had sort
of the naive people saying,

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.960
oh, this is confusing, you
had people who were like,

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.585
OK, I know how is
this, this, and this,

00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:20.880
and they would try to
do all of the things

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.581
and tell you which
ones were broken.

00:31:22.581 --> 00:31:24.580
And that's a little bit
more for the programming

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.880
side and the level design side.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.320
But I guess there was one thing
that came up pretty early,

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.350
was the head designer thought
that it would be really cool

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.110
if there was sort
of a thieves can't.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:42.060
And so all of the internal stuff
that the Garret character would

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.370
be saying to himself-- and
sometimes the guards might

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:48.370
be saying-- they
would use dialects.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:51.540
They would say things like,
"eagled" instead of "saw"

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:57.980
or-- I forget what we
came up with for "heard."

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.970
And he had this idea of it
being very Clockwork Orange

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:04.300
where it has its own, you know,
internal language that you

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.710
can mostly figure out if
you're paying attention.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:11.945
And so my first set of dialogue
stuff was full of this stuff,

00:32:11.945 --> 00:32:13.320
and the playtesters
were like, we

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.760
have no idea what
they're saying.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.680
This makes no sense.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.270
They're saying random words
and it tells us nothing.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.310
And so that all got cut
out, and pretty much

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.820
the only thing that got kept
was the word "taffer," which was

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.585
sort of the generic swear word.

00:32:26.585 --> 00:32:28.440
You know, you would
say, "you taffer,

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.500
I saw you back there,"
because, you know,

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.080
we were trying for
a no-swearing game.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.720
But sometimes you want
to have character sounds

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.020
like they're swearing so we
had that word and it stayed.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.420
HEATHER ALBANO: That's awesome.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.510
I find there's a difference
between testing and playtesting

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.610
though, too.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.110
ANDREW GRANT: What's
the difference?

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.540
HEATHER ALBANO: Well,
so one is technical.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.930
Does the game work?

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.000
Are their crashing bugs?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.560
And we have certainly at Choice
Of, it's two different things.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.020
There's the, can you
play to the end of it

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.060
without it crashing on you?

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.825
Good.

00:33:06.825 --> 00:33:07.590
All right.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.200
First level.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.130
That's great.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.780
Can you play through it with
it doing the variable hands off

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.250
between the scenes
correctly, or do you suddenly

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:17.656
find that you're married to this
person instead of that person?

00:33:17.656 --> 00:33:19.780
I mean, problems like
this happen all the time.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:25.420
So although my undergrad
degree is in English,

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.010
I did work in consumer
electronics, such

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:29.510
that I was working
with programmers.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.990
I was in QA, in
fact, a long time ago

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.780
before I was in marketing.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.380
And so thinking about it
in terms of the black box

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.540
testing of, are the
variables being passed,

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:47.460
are the flags being set,
are the typos in the English

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.940
on the screen,
everything capitalize?

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.116
And then there's the
playtesting which is,

00:33:52.116 --> 00:33:53.490
are you delivering
the experience

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:54.600
you're trying to deliver?

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.445
Which you can only tell by
watching a human being play it.

00:33:58.445 --> 00:33:59.870
ANDREW GRANT: Got it.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.487
I like that you
split those two apart

00:34:01.487 --> 00:34:03.070
because when we talk
about it in class

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.200
we often don't make
that distinction,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.658
but I think it's an important
distinction that there's the,

00:34:06.658 --> 00:34:09.330
does it do what we think
it does technically,

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:12.880
and does it do what we want it
to do emotionally or enjoyably

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.389
or whatever?

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.090
That's has a good distinction.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.790
HEATHER ALBANO: In
consumer electronics

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.860
I worked for Bose Corporation.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:24.360
They separated it into
verification and validation,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.199
were the sub-parts of
the test department.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.880
It was, did we build
the thing right,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.570
and did we build
the right thing?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.106
We thought that
was pretty clever.

00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:34.542
ANDREW GRANT: Awesome.

00:34:34.542 --> 00:34:34.980
I like that.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.938
LAURA BALDWIN: I feel
like, from my experience,

00:34:36.938 --> 00:34:39.219
it would be kind of more
programmer bugs versus design

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:41.283
bugs, do the variables
do the right thing?

00:34:41.283 --> 00:34:41.949
Programmer bugs.

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:42.659
Does it crash?

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:43.670
Programmer bugs.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.510
Is it fun?

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.010
Design bugs.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:45.885
HEATHER ALBANO: Yeah.

00:34:45.885 --> 00:34:47.552
That's a great way
to think of it, yeah.

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:48.343
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:34:48.343 --> 00:34:50.199
So I've just got one
more question for you

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.429
and then we'll turn it over if
anyone out there has questions.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:54.095
But before I do that
I want to point out

00:34:54.095 --> 00:34:55.570
that, while I did
sort of warn you

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:57.153
that I'd be asking
a little bit about,

00:34:57.153 --> 00:34:59.000
have playtests been
useful for you,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.070
I did not ask them to go on as
long and as enthusiastically

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.505
as they did about how
awesome playtesting has been.

00:35:05.505 --> 00:35:06.880
HEATHER ALBANO:
Is this something

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.135
that you're trying to-- OK.

00:35:08.135 --> 00:35:08.480
OK.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:08.870
ANDREW GRANT: We say this a lot.

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.570
Playtest, playtest,
playtest, playtest.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:12.153
No matter how much
you're playtesting,

00:35:12.153 --> 00:35:14.119
you probably aren't
doing it enough.

00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:15.910
Anyway, so the last
question I have kind of

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.826
comes back to something
you were talking about

00:35:17.826 --> 00:35:21.580
how, when you did your first
project you had the storyboards

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.280
and you're like, oh, I'll take
on this part and another writer

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.690
might take on a different part.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.404
Did you have any problems
getting the voices to match?

00:35:28.404 --> 00:35:30.820
Presumably you've got different
authors, different writers

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.319
for different
sections, but you want

00:35:32.319 --> 00:35:35.600
it to feel like it's
a coherent piece.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.710
You obviously want to
write in a similar style

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.990
to the other writers.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.573
HEATHER ALBANO: Did
we have a problem?

00:35:40.573 --> 00:35:45.280
The answer is yes, but not like
in a funny-horrible way, in a,

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.650
this is one of the
challenges with-- Broadsides

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:49.470
was three people.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.170
It was me, and Dan Fabulich,
and Adam Strong-Morse.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.930
And so it was sort of
part of the cost of doing

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.220
business, of dividing the
work among three people,

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:04.410
was the, hey, this
guy has a different--

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.170
has speech patterns that imply
a different educational level

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:11.570
when one person a is writing
than when person B is writing.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.970
Either is fine for a sailor
in the Napoleonic era,

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.310
but we should pick one.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.920
Like, these were bugs
in the spreadsheet when

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.220
we were-- We were like, we
gotta fix that because so-and-so

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.460
sounds like he has
a split personality.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:33.680
And there were sometimes issues
between-- like, that's a design

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.930
thing, as you were saying.

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.570
That's a flavor thing, right?

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.990
There were sometimes
issues with handoffs

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:46.547
on the technical sense,
but that's also--

00:36:46.547 --> 00:36:48.880
somebody wasn't setting a
flag that someone else needed,

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.463
type of thing.

00:36:49.463 --> 00:36:50.880
And that was in the spreadsheet.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.932
I think that's just a
collaborative thing, you know?

00:36:53.932 --> 00:36:54.836
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:36:54.836 --> 00:36:57.040
HEATHER ALBANO: What it
means, interestingly,

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.200
is that having three writers
doesn't save you as much time

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.080
as you might think.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.180
It is probably quicker
than having one,

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.710
but not three times
quicker because you

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:11.049
have the integration phase
that you don't otherwise have.

00:37:11.049 --> 00:37:11.840
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.506
I like how you put
that, because you all

00:37:13.506 --> 00:37:16.917
have encountered the same
thing through code right now.

00:37:16.917 --> 00:37:17.750
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:21.530
I found that having, for any
given sort of tone thing,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.780
having one person who is
the expert, or at least

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.630
that was their thing,
like Terri would tend

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.840
to do the pass on all the
Woodsies and, you know,

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.637
make sure they
seemed Woodsy enough.

00:37:32.637 --> 00:37:34.220
And I would do the
pass on the Hammers

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.200
and make sure that people
hadn't confused thee and thou

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.626
and translate things, you
know, into King James.

00:37:40.626 --> 00:37:42.250
I mean, it wasn't
even real King James.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.625
It was sort of,
like, what people

00:37:43.625 --> 00:37:45.692
think King James sounds like.

00:37:45.692 --> 00:37:47.440
ANDREW GRANT: Right.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.770
HEATHER ALBANO: For Broadsides
we actually had-- Adam

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.140
was serving as Lead Writer.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.780
It was-- so this is a secondary
world Horacio Hornblower, so

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:01.720
not the real Napoleonic war, but
the Napoleonic war, you know?

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:07.370
But so it was his idea and he
was the Hornblower fan, right?

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.660
So if there was a disagreement
about the right way

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.840
to name something or present
something or whatever,

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.270
Adam had final say because--
I read three of the books

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.786
really fast as I was getting
up to speed for the project,

00:38:18.786 --> 00:38:20.660
and so did Dan, but
that's not the same thing

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.097
as being immersed in it, right?

00:38:22.097 --> 00:38:22.930
ANDREW GRANT: Right.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:26.930
HEATHER ALBANO: It was actually
harder when Adam and I were

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.250
working as complete
partners and we

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:33.840
were building our own
secondary world medieval

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.790
fantasy from the ground
up, because there

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:41.010
was no-- sometimes it's nice to
have a final arbiter as opposed

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:45.835
to having to come
to a resolution--

00:38:45.835 --> 00:38:48.200
not necessarily fight
it out, but come

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.320
to an agreement with
everything under discussion.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.020
ANDREW GRANT: It's
just faster when

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.495
you start to get to an impasse
if someone can say, nope.

00:38:56.495 --> 00:38:58.095
We're going to go with A.

00:38:58.095 --> 00:38:59.610
HEATHER ALBANO: OK.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:00.990
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:06.330
Any questions from out there,
while we're here at the moment?

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:07.718
Please.

00:39:07.718 --> 00:39:09.394
STUDENT: So,
something I think is

00:39:09.394 --> 00:39:12.830
true about the
Choice of Games is

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:16.628
that, if you make choices at
the beginning of the story that,

00:39:16.628 --> 00:39:21.263
like, carry over and possibly
have grand repercussions

00:39:21.263 --> 00:39:24.101
on the three-hour
mark, or something

00:39:24.101 --> 00:39:27.420
like that, how would you
actually playtest them?

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.896
So it seems like
playtests having

00:39:29.896 --> 00:39:32.476
to deal with something
that happened

00:39:32.476 --> 00:39:36.958
three hours ago without
having the playtest go on

00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.210
for three hours--

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.210
HEATHER ALBANO: Ah, so--

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.834
ANDREW GRANT: Let me paraphrase
that, just for the microphones.

00:39:41.834 --> 00:39:44.070
You're asking about,
you run a playtest that

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.110
would take a long, long
time to see the results,

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.250
but your playtester
isn't that patient.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.495
So how do you work with that?

00:39:51.495 --> 00:39:52.370
HEATHER ALBANO: Yeah.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:54.460
Well, I actually
don't know how you

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:59.190
work with it in that
constraint, because the--

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.790
if you are the
author and you know

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:03.580
the game you can
self-playtest it such

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.370
that you skip ahead to
see how scene five feels

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:14.200
when you're married to, Grace
instead of to Diana, right?

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.686
But if you're playtesting--
playtesting for real-- Choice

00:40:18.686 --> 00:40:20.060
by Gaslight, the
game that I hope

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:24.120
will ship early in the
winter, has about four hours

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.010
of gameplay.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:27.770
And the only way I
have found to test

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:30.360
what it feels like for the
players to make the choices

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.010
and be in it is to sit behind
them for four hours, which

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:36.070
is why I buy them dinner,
because it's the very least I

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:36.570
can do.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:37.450
And these are all informal.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:38.730
These are all friends of mine.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:39.840
ANDREW GRANT: Of course.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.340
HEATHER ALBANO: So
I think there are

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.127
things that you can't shortcut.

00:40:43.127 --> 00:40:44.960
You've just got to do
it if you want to know

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.740
what it's like for the player.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.000
On the other hand, there
may be a better solution

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.730
to that that I just haven't
found yet, I don't know.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.740
LAURA BALDWIN: I mean,
so for a larger company,

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.720
the answer is you pay them a
wage to do it for three hours.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.700
I mean, it's their job.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:04.322
And they do become faster at it,
like, if they were playtesting

00:41:04.322 --> 00:41:05.780
Choice of Games
they would probably

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.360
be able to read pretty
quickly the things

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.401
that they've read before.

00:41:08.401 --> 00:41:09.590
But--

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.970
HEATHER ALBANO: Absolutely.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:12.386
When I say four
hours of gameplay,

00:41:12.386 --> 00:41:13.600
that's the first time.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:19.882
The first three or four
scenes are not substantively

00:41:19.882 --> 00:41:21.340
different, no matter
what you pick.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.120
I mean, there are
flavor text differences

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.280
but they're not meaningfully so.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.070
So once you realize that,
then the second play through

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:31.079
is just, yeah, right, right,
right, right, right, OK.

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:32.870
Here's where it starts
getting interesting.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:35.670
Now I'm going to slow
down and read again.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.796
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:41:37.796 --> 00:41:39.750
And I think that's,
in large part,

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:43.230
actually why we encourage
shorter games in the class,

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:45.524
actually.

00:41:45.524 --> 00:41:47.690
Partially because of scope
for your own development,

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.430
but also partially because
of that playtest problem.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:52.940
HEATHER ALBANO: Speaking
as the author of some

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:57.100
of the longer and more
convoluted Choice of Games,

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.450
speaking also because the
company encourages people

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.850
to download the code
and make their own,

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.725
they have a Host
of Games program.

00:42:03.725 --> 00:42:05.850
You shouldn't start with
long, convoluted anything.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.940
You should start with--
seriously, seriously,

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.000
seriously, seriously start
with something short and simple

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.330
and prove that you've got
the language and you've got,

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.900
you know-- and then
branch out into things

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.340
that will take you forever
and lots of dinners

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.640
to properly test.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.140
ANDREW GRANT: So what might be
a good sort of first project?

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.670
Like a conversation or
a one-page short story

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:30.880
that ends up being branching,
a lot more writing than that?

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:37.280
HEATHER ALBANO: So a
typical Choice of Game

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.470
is divided into
10-ish chapters which,

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:45.070
at least within the senior
staff we refer to as vignettes.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.170
I don't know if that terminology
got to the website or not,

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.370
but we call them vignettes.

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.022
So writing a vignette,
which has-- I

00:42:52.022 --> 00:42:53.980
forgot how many words
they're supposed to have.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.690
And, you know, let's
say four or five choices

00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:04.170
is a good way to get a handle on
how it all works on the rhythm,

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.160
on the technicalities.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.900
And would go back to
what I said earlier,

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.830
which is when I joined
the company I picked

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:15.200
a vignette from the 10 that the
partners had already laid out.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.120
They asked me
which one I wanted,

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.510
and I picked the courtship
scene in no small part

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.140
because there was a similar one
in the game that had shipped,

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.320
and I had something
I could work from.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.920
So what are working towards?

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.350
It should be about this long.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:29.600
ANDREW GRANT: Got it.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.150
HEATHER ALBANO: It should
have about this many choices.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.200
It should have
about this pacing.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.240
OK.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:35.740
All right.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.760
So I can copy that.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.600
Got it, got It.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.100
All right.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.910
Now I'll do something
totally different.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.022
Now I can do a whole game.

00:43:41.022 --> 00:43:41.980
You know, you get the--

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:42.835
ANDREW GRANT: So
you started kind

00:43:42.835 --> 00:43:43.755
of-- that's actually
really interesting

00:43:43.755 --> 00:43:46.046
because a lot of people doing
computer game development

00:43:46.046 --> 00:43:48.200
start as mod-ers, you
know modify an existing

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.300
game or an existing
level, and you almost

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.091
start with, you know, you
mod the existing writing,

00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:54.590
but of course replace
all the words.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.214
HEATHER ALBANO: Hey, you know,
a lot of traditional fiction

00:44:00.214 --> 00:44:01.880
writers start writing
fan-fic, you know?

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.570
I mean, it's a thing, right?

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:07.652
It means that you have a-- I'm
sorry, we're off in the weeds

00:44:07.652 --> 00:44:09.150
now-- but fan-fic
in particularly

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.610
means that the
world-building is done,

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.550
the character voices are set.

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.300
What you need to--

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.010
LAURA BALDWIN: You
aim for a voice,

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:15.930
as opposed to make one up.

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:16.930
HEATHER ALBANO: Exactly.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:19.550
And similarly, the
constraint of the world

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.100
are known, rather than things
you have to impose, right?

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.480
So what you have
to figure out is

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.771
a plot that works with this
world and these characters,

00:44:25.771 --> 00:44:28.940
and I'd say it's just a plot.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.735
And then once you've
got that down you

00:44:30.735 --> 00:44:33.325
can grow into sort
of the other things.

00:44:33.325 --> 00:44:35.700
ANDREW GRANT: That's a good
little way to do it, I think.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.830
STUDENT: So, something that
Laura mentioned earlier

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:40.718
was the whole standing
around and listening to MPCs

00:44:40.718 --> 00:44:42.690
talk for, you know, minutes.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:46.480
And it seems to me that in
the Shock Games in particular,

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.495
the answer to that
would be audio logs.

00:44:48.495 --> 00:44:49.740
LAURA BALDWIN: Yes.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.710
STUDENT: A lot more pervasive
than just a shock series.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.990
And I'm wondering
has that started

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:59.550
to become too much of a
crutch to sort of get around

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.480
this whole, we want to
do all this exposition

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.110
but we don't want to tie
people down to a location,

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:10.995
or do you find that there
is a very specific use

00:45:10.995 --> 00:45:14.320
for that kind of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.570
LAURA BALDWIN: So I think that
Shock, in particular, it's

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:22.190
trying to be sort of
a role playing game

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:24.579
which at its hallmark has
dialogue trees and stuff,

00:45:24.579 --> 00:45:25.870
except there's no people there.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.020
And so it's replacing
dialogue trees

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.650
with little monologue trees.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.860
And so it's both exposition
and also atmosphere setting.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:42.300
So I think that actually-- I
thought that worked very well.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:46.740
Shock 2 had a lot of
sort of cutscene--

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:50.471
in engine cutscenes where you
would be going down a corner

00:45:50.471 --> 00:45:51.970
and there would be
a window and then

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:52.990
there would be
something that happens

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:54.323
on the other side of the window.

00:45:54.323 --> 00:45:58.110
And that felt a little bit
more like the Thief listening

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.890
to people talk, because it
would be this scripted thing

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:04.010
to happen that you would
have to watch, or not watch,

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:07.590
and it would take
place whether or not

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.320
you were paying attention to it.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.070
And then it always had to be
built so that you couldn't

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.012
interact with it
because you didn't want

00:46:15.012 --> 00:46:16.970
it to be the case that
you saved the person who

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:19.360
was being killed, or whatever.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.220
But yeah, the audio logs
felt like, I thought,

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:27.320
were a nicely atmospheric
way to do text stumps.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.570
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah, the question
was, is it overused now?

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:33.970
And I don't know-- I
imagine, just like any trick

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:36.300
you use in a game,
if everyone does it,

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.240
yeah, it'll be overused.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.530
But in some games
it's the right tool.

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:44.812
In some games it's not.

00:46:44.812 --> 00:46:46.270
STUDENT: Just
following up on that,

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:51.640
it seems to be a very similar
function to, say, written

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.280
books that you find around in a
game like Skyrim or something.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.860
It's such a global thing
[INAUDIBLE] building it.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:04.050
But because you hear it
as opposed to read it,

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:07.314
it's something that you can
do while doing other things,

00:47:07.314 --> 00:47:08.736
you know?

00:47:08.736 --> 00:47:12.054
You can go ahead and move
the garbage cans while you're

00:47:12.054 --> 00:47:13.476
receiving all this information.

00:47:13.476 --> 00:47:20.215
And I'm wondering, if
that diminishes its value,

00:47:20.215 --> 00:47:22.640
because you don't really
have to pay attention to it

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.888
and you can just kind
of like be the pack rat

00:47:24.888 --> 00:47:26.762
and collect all the
audio logs without really

00:47:26.762 --> 00:47:27.975
caring about any of that.

00:47:27.975 --> 00:47:32.320
Or is it more prevalent
because there's

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.570
no reason to avoid them?

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:36.847
It doesn't stop you
from getting around.

00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:37.680
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:42.200
I mean, I think that I would
listen to all the audio logs,

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:48.360
but-- what is the--
there are some games that

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.240
have had too many books.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:54.220
I could not possibly read all
the books, and so I didn't.

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.840
So I think it's
almost more setting

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.820
the right number for any
particular player's enjoyment.

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.610
And I have no idea how to
pick what the right number is.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:09.360
I mean, probably somebody read
all the books in Morrowind.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.010
I did not.

00:48:12.159 --> 00:48:14.200
ANDREW GRANT: It's
player-specifc too, I imagine.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.180
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.294
ANDREW GRANT: Some players
will read none of them,

00:48:16.294 --> 00:48:16.970
some players will
read all of them.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:17.803
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:48:17.803 --> 00:48:20.590
But the question
of-- I don't know

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.220
if you even need,
want to try to say,

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.030
well, we don't want
to let the player not

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:26.302
care about the things.

00:48:26.302 --> 00:48:28.010
I mean, if the players
don't want to care

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.700
that's their choice, I guess.

00:48:34.366 --> 00:48:36.490
I mean, that's a totally
different thing, you know?

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.281
What if people are
playing your game wrong?

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:42.390
You know?

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:43.912
HEATHER ALBANO: Nothing
you can do about that once

00:48:43.912 --> 00:48:44.430
it's out there, right?

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:45.070
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:46.611
You know, so there's
the question of,

00:48:46.611 --> 00:48:49.220
should you be able to use
the mods to let you just

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.280
kill anything?

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.640
Is that playing it wrong?

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.220
Or does everyone get to pick
how they want to play it?

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.384
Is using cheat codes evil
or, you know, letting--

00:48:59.384 --> 00:49:01.050
ANDREW GRANT: Helping
you enjoy it more?

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.930
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.650
STUDENT: Is there an analog
of concept art in writing?

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:10.430
Like, for example
you have a paragraph

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.458
that explains what a character
is that's not in the game?

00:49:13.458 --> 00:49:14.291
HEATHER ALBANO: Yes.

00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:15.704
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:49:15.704 --> 00:49:19.010
STUDENT: How often are you
responsible for that as well?

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.490
LAURA BALDWIN: So I guess
that's why we design documents.

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.090
And those are traditionally
not as well kept

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.137
up as they should be.

00:49:25.137 --> 00:49:26.970
So they often describe
the state of the game

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:28.094
as it was three months ago.

00:49:30.947 --> 00:49:32.030
ANDREW GRANT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:35.987 --> 00:49:37.820
LAURA BALDWIN: Those
tend to be written more

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.070
by the higher-level
people than I ever was.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.450
So there would be the
overall design document.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:46.450
Here is what we want
the game to be like.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:49.840
Here's what we want
this level to be like.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:56.220
But that is a good way of
being sort of a tone reference

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.070
or a gameplay-- here are the
things we were aiming for,

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.840
and you can always go
back and look at that.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.220
HEATHER ALBANO:
Specifically character.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.912
You said concept art, so
were you thinking characters

00:50:06.912 --> 00:50:08.120
or were you thinking overall?

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.995
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
talked about concept art

00:50:09.995 --> 00:50:13.530
being partly to explain to
the artists what they're

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.764
going to do, partly just
to inspire the team,

00:50:15.764 --> 00:50:17.430
which I thought was
an interesting idea.

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:18.346
HEATHER ALBANO: Right.

00:50:18.346 --> 00:50:19.030
OK.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:20.740
I see that.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:24.090
So the games I've worked on--
all the games I've worked on

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:26.140
actually-- except
for the RPG where

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.640
I was in the
world-building part of it--

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.220
have had character bibles
separate from other design

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:32.740
documents.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.470
So there's the design documents
that say Choice of Broadsides

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:39.820
will have 10 vignettes and this
is the one where you capture

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.826
a prize ship, and here
are the five main choices,

00:50:42.826 --> 00:50:44.200
and here's the
one where you have

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.010
the evil lieutenant over you and
here are the five main choices.

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:52.070
And so there was that, and
those do fall out of date

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.140
very quickly because
once you're in the code,

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.510
you realize you want
to do different things.

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:59.555
LAURA BALDWIN: And nobody
likes documentation.

00:50:59.555 --> 00:51:00.680
HEATHER ALBANO: Absolutely.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.300
Absolutely.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.550
LAURA BALDWIN: I'm in IT now.

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:05.390
It's still true.

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.890
HEATHER ALBANO: The
character bibles

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:11.410
though I have found to
be more inspiring, right?

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.640
And so you sit down and you
say that the-- you can do it

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.680
in a few lines, right?

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.640
That the backstory
of this character

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.720
is this and the things
they care about are this.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:25.140
And I recently
learned a technique--

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:30.050
Richard Dansky from UberSoft
is a friend of a friend,

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.820
and boy, is he a very, very,
very skilled game writer.

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:39.780
And a technique he referred
to was-- oh dear, what was it?

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.390
It was interview
questions, right?

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:45.740
But the point is,
you answer them

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.470
in the voice of
the character, not

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:50.415
just what the character would
answer-- their favorite--

00:51:50.415 --> 00:51:53.220
their best friend is Susan.

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:59.468
But there's a difference between
a character who says, "oh, you

00:51:59.468 --> 00:52:02.140
know, Bob, he's
always got my back,"

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:05.510
and, "I first met Susan
when we were in kindergarten

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.990
and we were friends all
through elementary school,

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:10.450
except for that time when we
had a fight in sixth grade

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:12.360
over the"-- and, like,
you know something

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:17.240
about both of the speakers
just from the way they answer.

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.371
LAURA BALDWIN: Most
design documents

00:52:19.371 --> 00:52:20.620
are not necessarily inspiring.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:23.950
But something that
is possibly more so

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:25.840
is the One Minute of Gameplay.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.610
And it's sort of like
the little narration

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:30.660
of what you're doing as some
random moment in the game,

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:32.660
and why is it fun?

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.910
Because why is it fun
is kind of the thing

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.820
that you need to keep
focusing everyone on.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.890
You know, the point
of the game is not

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:42.180
to show you the cool art,
or to make you listen

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.550
to my really cool dialogue.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:46.090
It's to be fun.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:50.390
And I think that if you can
write a One Minute of Gameplay

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:53.950
which is somewhat inspiring for
your designers and programmers,

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.720
then that's really good.

00:52:58.059 --> 00:52:59.059
ANDREW GRANT: Questions?

00:53:01.921 --> 00:53:04.320
Then I think I will follow
up with one last thing

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.220
and we may have already
used up an answer here,

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.760
but we'll all try it.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.760
What can you think
of that you didn't

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.740
know when you started
trying to write for games

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:17.510
that kind of surprised you,
and now you would think

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.510
to yourself, yeah, I
didn't know that, I did not

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:20.841
expect that to be that way?

00:53:24.849 --> 00:53:26.390
LAURA BALDWIN: I
think the screenplay

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:27.990
thing was the weirdest.

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:34.090
Just-- a screenplay has these
fonts and these margins and you

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:34.927
can't go over the--

00:53:34.927 --> 00:53:36.010
ANDREW GRANT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:37.240
LAURA BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:41.117
I gather that you can
submit academic abstracts

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.950
and it has the same
sort of thing, you know,

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:45.240
no more than 800
characters or whatever.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.380
But I think that
was the strangest.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:51.220
Like, I just had-- that
was a very big surprise.

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:54.429
Most writing, I think,
feels more natural.

00:53:54.429 --> 00:53:55.220
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.570
HEATHER ALBANO: Screenplays
are pretty specific, yeah.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.010
Personally speaking,
my biggest surprises

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:07.680
have all been the positive ones.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.930
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:10.380
HEATHER ALBANO: I thought
I wanted to write novels--

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.550
and I still think I probably
want to write novels--

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:17.590
but I didn't expect this to
be as artistically satisfying

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:19.360
as it has turned out to be.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:22.620
Now, granted, I'm in a
pretty narrow writing field.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.430
What I do is not typical.

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:26.930
What Laura's done is
more typical of writing

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:30.110
for the games industry.

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.320
Something that I
think surprises a lot

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:37.160
of people who have a background
in traditional fiction and then

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:43.050
transition into writing games--
because I've seen this a lot--

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.176
back in the LARP days we
used to call it the oops

00:54:45.176 --> 00:54:49.050
I forgot to add the interactive
part where you have people

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:53.680
who are very, very, very skilled
at plots and at character arcs

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:58.950
and at story arcs and are
not accustomed to having

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:02.620
to leave room for the player
to interact with the world.

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.070
And this is, I think, a
problem you get specifically

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.780
when you have
somebody transitioning

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:10.070
from non-interactive fiction
to interactive fiction.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:14.490
I think I was fortunate that
I made those mistakes very

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:18.660
early, when I was running
LARPs when I was in college,

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.930
and learned those lessons fast.

00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:23.510
ANDREW GRANT: Right.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:27.280
HEATHER ALBANO: It's sort
of-- at least at that time

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.840
doing Quest at
Wesleyan and it was

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.700
one of the typical
first-time Jam mistakes,

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.860
was putting too much
on their staff members,

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.390
their non-player
characters and not

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:40.510
giving enough room for
the players to, you know,

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:45.224
play the game and affect the
world and impact what happens.

00:55:45.224 --> 00:55:46.890
You can't impact what
happens because we

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:48.140
have this scene for the end.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:49.570
No.

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:51.556
It's not a play.

00:55:51.556 --> 00:55:52.680
ANDREW GRANT: Right, right.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.760
LAURA BALDWIN: I
have another answer.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.926
ANDREW GRANT: OK, excellent.

00:55:54.926 --> 00:55:57.430
It is awesome how cool
your writing sounds

00:55:57.430 --> 00:56:00.930
when it is spoken by an actual
professional voice actor,

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:02.934
and I did not expect that.

00:56:02.934 --> 00:56:04.970
ANDREW GRANT: As
opposed to programmers?

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:08.530
LAURA BALDWIN: Or by me, like
when I say it in my head.

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:11.030
And then, you know,
there was a little ritual

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:14.720
at the end of Thief where the
Dark God is doing this ritual

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.660
and I was like, well,
he's doing this thing,

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.860
he has to say something.

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.010
You always have to have
a poem for rituals.

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.820
So I wrote him a
poem to be saying.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.800
And then the actor
for Constantine

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:31.050
came in and spoke it in his Dark
God voice, and it was awesome.

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:35.300
And then even better was when
it was translated into French

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:39.030
and spoken by the French
Dark God, and it still rhymed

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:42.990
and I was like, they translated
my doggerel into the doggerel

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.610
in French!

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:46.660
Oh my god!

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.200
That was neat.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.200
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.079
Well, thank you both very
much for coming to share

00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:53.120
your experiences with us.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.035
HEATHER ALBANO:
You're very welcome.

00:56:54.035 --> 00:56:55.446
Thank you for having me.

00:56:55.446 --> 00:56:56.404
LAURA BALDWIN: Welcome.

00:56:56.404 --> 00:56:58.967
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:58.967 --> 00:57:01.050
ANDREW GRANT: I'll stand
here for your microphone.

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.133
PROFESSOR: Yep, thank you.

00:57:02.133 --> 00:57:03.300
So, it's 2:08.

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.989
We're going to give you a few
more minutes to take a break.

PROFESSOR: So, if you'd like
them to playtest your game,

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.700

bring them to your game.

questions personally,

00:57:18.575 --> 00:57:19.890

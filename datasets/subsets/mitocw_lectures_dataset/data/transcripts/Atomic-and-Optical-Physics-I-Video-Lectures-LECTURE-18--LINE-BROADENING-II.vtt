00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.260
PROFESSOR: So we want to
discuss line shifts and line

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.820
broadening.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.950
And I assume you'll
remember that last class we

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.740
did some brainstorming and came
up with quite a number of line

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.690
broadening and line shifts
mechanism, temporal lifetime

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.040
broadening, motional
broadening, external field

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.420
broadening,
collisional broadening.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.760
And as I indicated at
the end of last class,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.720
those different
broadening mechanism

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.770
have much more in common
than you may think.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.810
And you will see that they
have much more in common

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.730
when we look at it from
the fundamental perspective

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.020
of coherence.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.720
Any line broadening
mechanism comes

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.470
because the atom experience, the
environment and the drive field

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.000
as a coherent source only
for limited coherence time.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.630
So the concept of
the coherence time

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.000
will actually provide
a common denominator

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.410
for all those line
broadening mechanisms.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.580
However, before I
present to you this kind

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.470
of correlation function approach
to what's line broadening,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.860
I think it's really
important that we

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.290
go through some simple cases.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.570
I always want you to learn
phenomena in the simplest

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.800
possible manifestation,
in a situation where

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.850
without any math you
see what's going on.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.080
And what I particularly
love is if there

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.040
is an analytic solution
where everything

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.030
is sort of transparent here.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.030
So therefore, before we discuss
in a comprehensive way line

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.800
shifts and line
broadening, I want

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.550
to go through simple cases.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.350
Now, I decided for this class
that most of today's lecture

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.050
uses pre-written slides
because those cases are

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.600
so simple that I would be
almost afraid I would bore you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.030
if I would write it out.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.210
Because if you look at
this equation in one second

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.580
you get it, and it takes me
10 or 20 seconds to write it.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.050
On the other hand,
I would sort of

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.940
give the responsibility to you.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.620
If I'm flooding you with
too much information,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.950
ask me questions,
slow me down, or say,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.570
can you please go over that?

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.730
So I don't want
to obscure things

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.480
by going through them faster.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.980
I also looked a
little bit forward

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.220
to the end of the course.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.820
We are about OK with the
pace of the course, or maybe

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.410
one hour behind.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.150
And so in order to make room for
discussions of superradiance,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.740
which I would like to have
with you in a couple of weeks,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.520
I thought I can save
half an hour here

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.790
by going over that material
a little bit faster.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.620
But these are really
just illustrations

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.760
of line broadening.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.120
And you should actually
know most of them already.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.870
So the first cases are
actually leading you up

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.790
to the Ramsey
resonance, to the method

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.350
of separated oscillatory fields,
which is really absolutely

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.560
important for high
resolution spectroscopy.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.760
But before we can fully
understand the Ramsey

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.600
resonance, we have to
understand the Rabi resonance.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.500
So what I've written
down here is for you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.600
just the well-known formula
for Rabi oscillations.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.390
And if you now simply assume
we let the atoms interact

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.940
with the field by a fixed
amount time tau in such a way

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.960
that we have a pi pulse,
then this probability

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960
as a function of detuning
becomes a line shape.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.920
And this line shape
is plotted here.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.329
It has a full width
of half maximum,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.180
which is approximately 1/tau.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.280
And this is-- you can
regard it as the Fourier

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.230
limit of finite interaction
time broadening.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.590
We are observing the
atoms for time tau

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.920
and the line which is
on the order of 1/tau.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.950
But we also know
from the Rabi formula

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.940
that we have these side lobes,
so we see some oscillatory line

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.302
shape.

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:46.370
OK, now, with the
advent of trapped atoms,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.764
you can often have
the situation that you

00:04:48.764 --> 00:04:50.180
have an ensemble
of trapped atoms.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.950
You flash on your drive field
for fixed amount time tau.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.020
At least for most of last
century, this was not possible.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.200
You had atomic beams.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.380
And in an atomic
beam, what is fixed

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.730
is not the interaction time tau
but the interaction length l.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.800
And then due to the
velocity distribution,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.730
different velocity
groups of atoms

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.140
interact a different
amount of time with that.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.080
So for conceptional reasons but
also for the historic context,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.270
you should sort of have an idea
what the Rabi apparatus is.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.860
I may have mentioned
it, but I regard Rabi

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.650
as sort of one of my
ancestors in my family tree

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.620
because Rabi was the PhD
advisor of Norman Ramsey, who

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.540
was the PhD advisor
of Dan Kleppner, who

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.950
was the PhD advisor
of Dave Pritchard.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.210
And Dave Pritchard was
my postdoctoral mentor.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.690
So I'm really talking here
about my scientific great-great

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.770
grandfather.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.050
Anyway, so the famous Rabi
apparatus is the following.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.400
You use one Stern-Gerlach magnet
to prepare a certain hyperfine

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.210
state.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.330
Then you have the
interaction region,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.570
and this is what
we are focusing on.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.590
And then later, if a spin
flip has taken place,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.840
you can figure that
out by running it

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.110
through a
Stern-Gerlach analyzer.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.610
So it's this ABC
region, and we are

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.500
talking about this middle region
where we have an interaction

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.030
time which is now given by the
length divided by the velocity.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.070
So what we have to
do is-- well, that's

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.480
why I'm saying
it's simple cases,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.260
and I hope I can
go fast-- you just

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.440
take the previous result
with a Rabi probability

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.660
and convolute it with a
velocity distribution.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.490
So when we do that,
we find two effects.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.600
One is, well, due to the
velocity distribution,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.250
the line width becomes
a factor of 2 broader,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.100
but it's still
proportional to something

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.230
on the order of unity divided
by the interaction time.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.770
And because the
different velocity groups

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.710
have a different
kind of oscillations

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.160
as a function of detuning,
the oscillatory behavior

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.462
now disappears because
it becomes averaged out

00:07:10.462 --> 00:07:11.670
[? of ?] the velocity groups.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.080
OK so this is the Rabi
method or the Rabi resonance,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.460
where we have one interaction
pulse or one interaction

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.190
time for an atom.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.970
The next method is now
what was introduced

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.070
by Norman Ramsey as the method
of separate oscillatory fields.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.020
And for that and
other contributions

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.010
he was awarded the
Nobel Prize in 1990.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.490
And the difference
is the following.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.410
In the Rabi method, we
let the atoms interact

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.010
with the drive field for fixed
lengths l or fixed time tau.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.760
But in the Ramsey
method, we interrogate,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:02.650
we drive the atoms
with two short pulses,

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.880
which are separated.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.060
So in the simplest
case, we do 2 pi

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.510
over 2 pulses
separated by a time t.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.470
And now, if you have two
pulses, everything is coherent.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.380
The two pulses can
interfere constructively

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.160
or destructively.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:40.960
So what you would
expect is that-- I

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.210
want to give you two pictures.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.590
One is the Bloch sphere
picture, but let's just sort

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.270
of play with the
concept of interference.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:59.860
If this is zero
detuning, the two pulses

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.490
are separated by a time t.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.830
And therefore, you
would now observe,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.880
as a function of detuning,
Ramsey fringes and oscillatory

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.710
behavior, which
has a spacing which

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:22.631
is 2 pi over the
time between pulses.

00:09:22.631 --> 00:09:26.060
The envelope of
the whole fringes

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.410
is related to the short
time of the duration.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.940
It's like a double
slit experiment.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.160
You know, each slit is
broad, and the width here

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.830
is given by 1 over the short
time delta t of the pulse.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.980
But then the two
slits interfere.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.330
And the interference
pattern is the distance

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.190
between the slits, which
now in the temporal domain

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.110
is the time capital
T between them.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.630
So these are sort of
typical Ramsey fringes.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.380
And now, if you would
average over a broad velocity

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.360
distribution, then
you would kind of

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.300
average-- you would maybe
see one or two side lobes,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.820
but the other fringes
are averaged out.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:25.460
So the central peak,
the resolution is again

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.640
on the order of 1/T.
It's the total time

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.390
of the experiment,
which is setting

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:37.690
the ultimate resolution,
similar to the Rabi resonance.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.170
So this uses the
picture of interference

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.040
between two pulses.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.950
But I also want to
sort of give you

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.600
the Bloch sphere picture,
because it's beautiful.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.340
For that I need a
little bit of room.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.650
So an atom enters the
first Ramsey region,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.410
and it has to spin down.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.390
You do a pi/2 pulse,
which is at 90 degrees.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.100
And now what happens is
there is a field-free region

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.060
between the two pulses,
so the atom is now

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.855
precessing at its
resonance frequency.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.670
OK, but the synthesizer which
is attached to your coils

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.980
is also sort of precessing
at this frequency.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.290
And when you add zero detuning,
the synthesizer and the atoms

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.860
are aligned again.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.880
And the second pi/2 pulse
is now flipping the atoms,

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.760
and you've 100% excitation.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.000
And this is what you see here.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.780
But now let's assume you
are slightly detuned.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.280
Then the atom is precessing,
and your synthesizer

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.100
is precessing at a slightly
different frequency.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.250
And now in the second
region, the frequency

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.960
of the synthesizer
may be different

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.700
with-- the phase
of the synthesizer

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.340
is 180 degree different
from the phase of the atom.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.560
And then instead of flipping
the atoms up and getting 100%

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.570
in the up state, the
atom is now flipped down.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.660
And this explains
the first minimum.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.230
So you should really see
that in this long region,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.430
nothing happens.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.640
But you accrue a relative
phase between the synthesizer

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.900
and the atom, which oscillates
at its resonance frequency.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.350
So based on this model,
you could work out

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.980
mathematically every aspect of
those fringes I've shown you.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.300
But I decided to take the
equations out of the lecture

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.390
and just present you with
this physical picture.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.970
Questions?

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.220
AUDIENCE: If you have a
velocity distribution,

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.480
would the points of
those minimums change

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.879
or is it still this--

00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:46.170
PROFESSOR: Well, good question.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.960
The spacing is the time T.
But if you have a velocity

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.800
distribution, let's say a
velocity distribution which

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.620
has a width delta v over v
of 30%, what we have kept

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.480
fixed in the beam
experiment are the lengths,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.210
the interaction lengths.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.700
So time is length over velocity.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.910
So therefore, when
the velocity changes

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.660
by plus/minus 30% in
your atomic beam--

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.665
unless you take a
supersonic beam with a very

00:13:12.665 --> 00:13:14.920
narrow velocity
distribution-- then that

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.340
means one velocity class
has this set of fringes.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.890
The other velocity class has
this similar set of fringes,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.130
but like in a
harmonica, everything

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.390
is now spread out by 30%.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.440
And if you have now 30%
velocity resolution,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.985
that means you may be able
to see two or three fringes.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:43.220
But the central fringe is sort
of like a white light fringe.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.180
There is no relative
phase shift.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.240
And therefore all the
different velocity classes

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.520
will have a maximum
at zero detuning.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.460
So in the extreme limit
of a very broad velocity

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.370
distribution, the only
feature which survives

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.230
is the central fringe.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.480
But this is where you obtain
your spectroscopic information

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.340
from.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.036
Will?

00:14:03.036 --> 00:14:05.952
AUDIENCE: You have explained
this Bloch sphere picture

00:14:05.952 --> 00:14:09.354
assuming unbroken coherence
between your synthesizer

00:14:09.354 --> 00:14:11.920
and the field-free
evolution of your atom?

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.545
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:15.265
AUDIENCE: Is it equivalent
to if you wrote down the time

00:14:15.265 --> 00:14:17.720
evolution operator, you
would say that there's 0 Rabi

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.165
frequency, but no
detuning in your field?

00:14:21.165 --> 00:14:21.790
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.726
AUDIENCE: So what if
I-- is this necessary,

00:14:25.726 --> 00:14:28.702
to have this unbroken coherence
if I unplug my synthesizer

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:30.160
and plug in a new
one [INAUDIBLE]--

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.250
PROFESSOR: Yes, you
can do spectroscopy

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:37.230
with a resolution
delta mu, which is 1/T,

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.080
only if you have a synthesizer
which has a frequency

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.660
stability which is
better than 1/T.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.580
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.110
PROFESSOR: Otherwise, we've
done this a little bit

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.240
when we talk narrowband
and broadband.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.860
When we talked about
narrowband and broadband cases,

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.040
you are always limited
in your resolution

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.340
by whatever is broader.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.710
Here I'm discussing about the
width of the atomic system,

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.110
assuming a perfect synthesizer.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.750
But then in essence, you
should convolute this result

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.320
with the spectral distribution
of your synthesizer.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.390
And then if the synthesizer
has a resolution which

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.890
is worse than that, you would
actually blur out the fringes

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.710
through the convolution
with the frequency

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.480
spectrum of the synthesizer.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:25.980
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.230
AUDIENCE: So that also means
if you add a [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:36.482
to the second coil, [INAUDIBLE]
just like if you had

00:15:36.482 --> 00:15:38.240
[INAUDIBLE] to one of the--

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.960
PROFESSOR: Yes, actually,
if you would add a pi phase

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.750
shift to the second
coil, then the minimum--

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.231
the central feature would
not be maximum or minimal.

00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:51.730
Yes.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:04.690
And that's why when you have
atomic clocks with a beam,

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.670
the question of
distributed phase

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.840
shifts within the microwave
cavity play a big role.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.820
And this is related
to are the two Ramsey

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.870
zones really at the
same phase or not?

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.421
So that's an important
issue for ultimately making

00:16:19.421 --> 00:16:20.420
resolution spectroscopy.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.950
OK.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:37.140
Since-- OK.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.360
So we've discussed
two methods now,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.300
the Ramsey method
versus the Rabi method.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.470
And let me discuss advantages
or disadvantages of the method.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.840
So if you're an atomic
physicist and you

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.680
have to give advice
to your friends

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.740
whether they should use the
Ramsey or the Rabi method,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.950
these are your talking points.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:02.750
So one point is that I said the
central feature of the Ramsey

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:08.339
fringes is 1/T. The
Rabi feature is 1/T,

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.557
so we are both limited
by time resolution,

00:17:10.557 --> 00:17:11.890
because this is a Fourier limit.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.050
But if you work out
the details, you

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:28.610
find that the Ramsey fringe
is about 2 times narrower

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.530
than the Rabi resonance.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.700
Just how things work
out mathematically--

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.340
I can't give you any
real deeper insight why.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:41.200
It just works out to be a factor
of 2 narrower than the Rabi

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:41.700
resonance.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.810
There's one important aspect,
and this is the following.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.600
When you accrue the
spectroscopic information,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.850
you compare-- I hope you
remember my demonstration-- you

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:01.530
compare the atomic oscillator
to the synthesizer,

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.170
but you're not interacting
with each other.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.270
So therefore you don't
have any power broadening.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.950
You're comparing the free
evolution of the atom

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.750
with the propagating
phase in your synthesizer.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:19.370
And therefore, your Rabi signal
has no power broadening at all.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:25.930
And that means that,
however, the Rabi signal,

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.850
at least for small detunings
which are smaller than the Rabi

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:38.790
frequency, will always depend
quadratically on delta.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.050
Remember, generalized
Rabi frequency,

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.530
you add or make a Rabi
squared and detuning

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.350
squared in quadrature.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.260
So therefore you will
always get effects

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.850
for small detunings
which are quadratic,

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:59.980
whereas the way how you set
up the Ramsey experiment, you

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.820
can explore a linear dependence.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.450
So you have more
sensitivity here.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.400
Finally-- well, not finally.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.100
There are more.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.330
Next is the Ramsey spectroscopy.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:25.220
It's done in a
field-free region,

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.000
so you're not
driving the system.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.680
You observe the free evolution.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:38.400
Therefore you have no AC Stark
effects due to the drive field.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.060
Of course, you drive the
system in the two Ramsey zones.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:58.570
And some form of AC Stark
effect may come in in the way

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.810
that you may not
have exactly a pi

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.880
pulse due to AC Stark effects.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.710
But this is sort of a
higher order effect.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.640
The basic spectroscopy
is done by comparing

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.446
the atomic oscillator with
the frequency synthesizer.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.820
Since it's a field-free
region, this region can now

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:29.150
be used for-- well,
let me say generally

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.600
for experimental additions.

00:20:35.357 --> 00:20:37.690
And of course, what should
immediately come to your mind

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.725
is the Nobel-Prize-winning
experiments

00:20:39.725 --> 00:20:42.830
of Serge Haroche where
he had two Ramsey

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.790
regions with microwaves.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.450
And in between in the
field-free region,

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.990
the atom passed
through another cavity.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:57.280
And in between the
Ramsey zones, the atom

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.590
experienced a phase
shift due to the presence

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.990
of a single photon.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.950
So the field-free
region could now

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:09.250
be used to put in a cavity
which was filled with one or two

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.030
photons.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:14.470
And the atom was in a
non-destructive way reading out

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.277
how many photons were there.

00:21:16.277 --> 00:21:18.610
So this is another advantage
of the Ramsey spectroscopy,

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.626
that you can now use
the field-free region

00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:21.500
to measure something.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.100
You can introduce a phase
shift, which can then

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.210
be read out through the
Ramsey interference.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:37.010
Similarly, if you just think of
how the resonance comes along,

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:43.850
if you had a slightly
fluctuating magnetic field

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.280
between the two
Ramsey regions, this

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.090
would not necessarily
broaden your signal.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.170
Because what you measure is
the integrated phase evolution

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.720
of the atomic oscillator.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.310
So in other words, what you
get is shift of the resonance,

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:03.600
which is the average over the
inhomogeneous magnetic field.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.430
Whereas when you do
a Rabi resonance,

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.670
whenever you have a
field inhomogeneity,

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.115
you broaden and shift the
resonance to this field value.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:24.390
So in other words,
the Ramsey resonance

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:34.500
depends only on the average
along the mean energy

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:42.040
separation between
the two levels.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.950
And therefore
inhomogeneous fluctuations,

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:57.880
spatial fluctuations, can
completely average out.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.780
Whereas in the Rabi method,
any kind of fluctuations

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.100
leads to line broadening.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:18.630
And finally, I will explain
that in more detail later on.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:27.770
But what happens in
the Ramsey method

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:34.650
if the separation
between the two regions

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.527
is much longer than the
spontaneous lifetime of one

00:23:37.527 --> 00:23:38.110
of the levels?

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.170
Do you now get a
resolution which

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:50.680
is 1/T, the temporal separation
between the two interrogations?

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.210
Or do you get a
resolution which is 1/tau,

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.506
the lifetime of
the excited level?

00:23:58.506 --> 00:23:59.690
What do you think?

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.670
AUDIENCE: 1/tau.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.860
PROFESSOR: It would be
a good clicker question.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.350
So who thinks it's 1/tau?

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.240
Who thinks it's 1/T?

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.260
So who thinks it's
limited by lifetime?

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.190
Who thinks it's limited
by the interrogation time?

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.290
OK.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.230
So that's a minority
for the Ramsey method.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.900
The minority is correct.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.960
And the picture
you should have is

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.010
that you remember the sort of
picture of those oscillators.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.310
But if some atoms decay away,
it diminishes your signal.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:35.620
But the interference comes
only from the survivors.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.580
And the survivors have survived
in the exponential tail

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.640
of the natural decay, but
they are longer lived.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.850
And therefore, you can
actually do spectroscopy

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.560
which is narrower than
the natural line width,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.930
using Ramsey spectroscopy.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.180
But if you do Rabi
spectroscopy, you're

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.860
limited by the
spontaneous lifetime.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.530
And this is probably what was
in mind of the other people who

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:05.740
raised their hand
for option A. But why

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.730
there is a difference
between the Rabi

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.670
and the Ramsey method,
that's something

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.670
I want to discuss later.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.390
OK, so Ramsey has
the possibility,

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:28.340
sub-natural line
width is possible

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.650
when the interaction
time is larger

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.590
than the inverse
natural line width.

00:25:37.476 --> 00:25:37.975
OK.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.980
Questions about Ramsey method?

00:25:49.656 --> 00:25:50.155
Good.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.780
Physics Today has a wonderful
article written by Ramsey

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.150
which was reprinted
recently, I think

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.370
on the occasion of his death.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.320
I will post this
article to our website.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.080
Then you can really
read about it

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.800
in the language
of Norman Ramsey.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.200
OK, let's move on.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.160
I said we are discussing
simple examples.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.480
So we have discussed the example
of Rabi resonance and Ramsey

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.750
resonance.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:29.250
Now I want to talk about line
shape with exponential decay.

00:26:32.562 --> 00:26:34.020
One reason why I
wanted to give you

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.740
a simple model for
exponential decay

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.930
because in the end,
everything is exponentially

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.750
decaying because of the
finite lifetime of levels.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.380
And with this very,
very simple model,

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.600
I want to convey to you that
not all exponential decays are

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.320
equal.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.120
You have to be a
little bit careful.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.430
And this is just sort
of the simplest example.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.190
And you learn something
by figuring out

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.680
what is different from
spontaneous decay here

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.399
and what are the
consequences of that.

00:27:03.399 --> 00:27:04.440
So remember where we are.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.070
We have the Rabi resonance.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.940
I gave you the simple example
that the Rabi resonance

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.820
is applied for fixed time tau.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.930
And then we did one extension
we averaged over the velocity

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.200
distribution.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:22.680
But now we can just say, OK, we
have our Rabi resonance here.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.910
But we assume that
while we drive the atom,

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.995
they decay away.

00:27:27.995 --> 00:27:30.700
If you want, you can think
these are radioactive atoms

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.050
and they decay
[? radioactively. ?]

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.580
For that situation,
this model is exact.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:41.780
So therefore, instead of having
a fixed interaction time tau,

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:46.530
you have a distribution, which
is an exponential distribution.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.500
So all we have to do is we
have to take our result, which

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.270
I discussed 10 or 20 minutes
ago, with the fixed interaction

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:57.860
time and convolute it with
the distribution of times

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.000
the atom experiences
the drive field.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.740
And what I've introduced here
is the exponential is gamma.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.740
And the mean interaction time
over which an atom interacts

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.240
with the drive field
is just 1 over gamma,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.100
and I called that tau.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.590
So now we had the
Rabi probability here,

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.720
but now we convolute it
with the distribution

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.020
of interaction times.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.240
And this is now the probability
that after the Rabi pulse

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.630
the spin was moved from
spin down to spin up.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.660
Or if you have an
electronic transition,

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.090
from ground to excited state.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:42.240
So this integral can
be analytically solved.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.990
That's why it's
worth presenting.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.330
And what you get is a
Lorentzian line shape.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.620
And this Lorentzian
line shape shows

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.190
power broadening, which
actually you should find nice,

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.020
because we will
sometimes [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.820
in power broadening you can't
get out of perturbation theory.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.290
And a lot what we have
done and what I actually

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.450
want to do for the remainder of
this chapter on line broadening

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.040
is a perturbative approach.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.820
So that's another reason I
want to present it to you here.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.750
These are some
non-perturbative results,

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.390
and they show the physics of
power broadening, saturation

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.530
broadening.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.010
But there are two things
which are noteworthy.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:23.140
One is the full
width at half maximum

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.190
is not gamma but 2 gamma.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:33.620
So if we had natural
decay at a rate gamma,

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:38.200
the Lorentzian which we
get is only half as wide.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.650
But you can
immediately say, well,

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:43.190
that can be understood because
here I assumed the atoms just

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.370
decay away no matter whether
they are in the ground

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.860
or in the excited state.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.450
And I gave you a model that
you assume there is maybe

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.810
radioactive decay independent
of the internal state.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:58.590
And now you can wave
your hands and say, OK,

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.900
if you have only decay
in the excited state

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.390
and not in the
ground state, this

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.470
should give you a factor
of 2 in the width.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:09.440
And this may explain why we have
a full width of half maximum

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.220
here of 2 gamma and in
spontaneous decay it is gamma.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:18.040
But there's another thing
which is interesting, maybe

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.090
more interesting.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:23.700
And this is the
power broadening.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.500
If you take the power-broadened
Lorentzian line width

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.830
and we look at it in
the limit of high power,

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.840
it is 2 times the
Rabi frequency.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.710
Well, if we have a system
which has spontaneous decay

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.520
and we would go to
the high power limit--

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.430
we've discussed it before.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:48.960
What you get is square root
2 of the Rabi frequency.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.330
So the message I
can give you here

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:56.570
is that saturation
broadening, power broadening

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:03.120
depends sensitively on the
exact nature of the decay

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.790
and of the lifetime
broadening involved.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.050
And if you really
want to do it right,

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.411
you have to use the
optical Bloch equations.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.480
So let me just write that down.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.610
So what we learned from that is,
yes, we get power broadening.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.240
We have a simple model
for power broadening here.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:36.320
But power broadening
depends sensitively

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:42.890
on the nature of
the decay process.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:52.120
And so if you want to get this
result without any assumptions

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.040
or approximations, you
should use the optical Bloch

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.540
equations.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.750
And yes, your
homework assignment

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.960
looked at the optical
Bloch equations.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:13.310
And I think you also found
out that some results

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.400
for the optical Bloch
equations really

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.310
depend on the ratio of gamma
1 gamma 2 or T1 and T2.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.580
So that is with a more
mathematical formalism

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.450
shows you that the way
how you introduce decay

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.300
into the atomic system, it's not
just there is one time constant

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.042
and the result just depends
on the time constant.

00:32:34.042 --> 00:32:35.125
There are some subtleties.

00:32:42.515 --> 00:32:43.390
Questions about that?

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.210
OK.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:53.220
Now-- and many people
have asked me about it--

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.670
I think for the first
time in this course

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.420
we bring in motion of the atoms.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:04.740
So the atoms are now not
pinned down at the origin.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.980
Maybe you can imagine
you have an atom which

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.790
is held in a solid state
lattice with a nanometer,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.970
and we just look at
the internal structure.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.980
We have maybe some ions
implanted into a material.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.970
And these ions are fluorescent,
and we are probing them.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.640
Or we're doing spin
flip on nuclei,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:28.512
which are nuclei of atoms which
are part of a condensed metal

00:33:28.512 --> 00:33:29.520
lattice.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.570
Or if you want to think
more [? with ?] the methods

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.140
of atomic physics, you have the
most tightly confining ion trap

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.850
in the world.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:40.520
You are deeply in
the Lamb-Dicke limit,

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.400
and your ion just cannot move.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.620
It's always in the ground
state of the ion trap,

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:50.317
and all you are dealing with is
the internal degree of freedom.

00:33:50.317 --> 00:33:51.650
Actually, let me make a comment.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.070
I often see when people
approach me and ask

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.240
me question that they
are not necessarily

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.570
making the separation.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.440
When they think
about what happens

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.790
to the internal
structure of atoms, what

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:05.940
is in their head is, but there
is motion, there is recoil.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:09.790
You can, in my experience,
always separate the two.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.440
You can create a
situation where you only

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.520
probe the internal
degree of freedom

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.699
by tightly confining
the atom, and then you

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:21.480
can relax the condition that
the atoms is tightly confined.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.094
Now the atoms can
move, and then all

00:34:25.094 --> 00:34:27.260
of the things we want to
discuss now come into play.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.610
Sometimes people assume, yes,
but if you confine an atom,

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.190
doesn't the atom always have
a de Broglie wavelengths?

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.270
And isn't that
another length scale?

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.739
The answer is no,
because you need

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:46.000
a coupling between the internal
degree and the external degree,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.340
or you need some way of exciting
the external degree of motion.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.469
And if you have a tightly
confining ion trap,

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:58.110
h bar omega, the next vibration
or level in the ion trap

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:02.300
is so high, you may not excite
it with the recoil of a photon.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.930
But there is another limit
which I often find very useful,

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.590
and this is the following.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:12.880
When we talk about
spectroscopy, spin flips,

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.210
electronic transitions,
we have not really

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.550
talked about the
mass of the atom.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:22.800
The mass of the nucleus only
appeared in the reduced mass.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.970
Remember when we did last
class the hydrogen atom?

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.260
We had the reduced mass,
which was slightly different

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.030
from the electron mass.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:33.400
So if you want to completely
exclude the motion of the atom,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.380
just work in the limit that
the nucleus has infinite mass.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.330
If the nucleus
has infinite mass,

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.860
its de Broglie wavelength is 0.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.830
It's confined in a
harmonic oscillator

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.590
to sort of a delta function.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:51.330
So by just assuming that
you deal with infinite mass,

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:55.870
you automatically neglect
all possible motions.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.710
And as you will actually
see from the next formula,

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.900
working in the infinite mass
limit means that your Doppler

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.650
shift is 0, your recoil
shift is 0, everything is 0.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.940
So either way,
I've given you now

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.600
two ways how I recommend
that you think about all

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.330
the physics we have
discussed which

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.510
deals with the internal
degree of freedom

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:20.620
by either saying the atom
is tightly organized.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.260
But then some people
say, ah, but then

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.737
it has Heisenberg Uncertainty.

00:36:23.737 --> 00:36:24.820
There's a lot of momentum.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.569
It doesn't matter.

00:36:25.569 --> 00:36:27.370
If it's localized,
it's localized.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.120
But you can also assume just
the infinite mass limit.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:35.250
And in both cases, the
result is you can completely

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.410
talk about so many aspects
of internal excitations

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:43.419
without even considering
what happens externally.

00:36:43.419 --> 00:36:44.460
Any questions about that?

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:51.560
So now we take the mass from
infinity to finite value,

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.930
and now we want
to allow the atom

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:56.270
to move and have kinetic energy.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.170
So let's start out very simple.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:02.220
We have an atom which is
addressed in the excited state,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.900
and it emits a photon.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:09.940
Before the emission
of the photon,

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.560
the total energy is
the excitation energy.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.990
But after the emission
of the photon,

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.900
the atom is in the ground state.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.700
The photon has been emitted.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.490
But now the atom, due to
the photon recoil h bar k,

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.850
has kinetic energy.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:33.340
So therefore the frequency
of emission of the photon

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.110
does not happen at the
resonance frequency of the atom

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:40.160
because some part of
the electronic energy

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.490
goes into the kinetic energy
of the recoiling atom.

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.470
And this is called
the recoil shift.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.080
We start at 0 velocity.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.650
At 0 velocity, you don't
have any Doppler shift.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.085
But you do have recoil shift.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.660
Well, we can play the same game.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.990
We have an atom addressed.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.390
It absorbs the photon.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.450
And after the atom has
absorbed the photon,

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.610
it's in the excited state.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.330
But now you have
to excite the atom

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.500
if you want to transfer
the atom to the excited

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.780
state with a frequency
which is slightly

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.780
higher than the
resonance frequency.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.860
Because the laser has
to provide not only

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.110
the energy for the
electronic excitation

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:25.360
but also the energy for
the kinetic energy at which

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.400
the atom recoils.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:36.340
So therefore we find that, due
to the recoil of the photon,

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.220
the absorption line
and the emission

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.040
line for an atom
addressed are shifted.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:53.600
The shift is the
recoil energy, h bar--

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.880
the momentum of the photon
squared, divided by 2 times

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.360
the mass of the atom.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.390
And the shifts are opposite
for absorption and emission.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:07.180
So therefore, if you look at
the two processes for absorption

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:13.990
and emission, there is a recoil
splitting between the two.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.660
This recoil splitting between
emission and absorption

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.720
is just a few kilohertz.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.300
And it was really one of the
wonderful accomplishments

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.040
when high resolution
spectroscopy came along

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.860
and John Hall at
Boulder managed to have

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.230
lasers stabilized
to sub kilohertz.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:36.550
For the first time, this recoil
splitting could be resolved.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:39.420
So he had set up some
intracavity absorption,

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:44.190
and he saw sort of two peaks
in some kind of spectrum.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.870
I don't remember the
details, but two peaks

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.320
split by a few
kilohertz were really

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:56.110
the hallmark of the photon
recoil shifting the lines away

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:59.070
from resonance.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:03.600
OK, so now we know what the
kinetic energy of the atom

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.110
does.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.090
If it emits a photon,
there is recoil.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.110
But now, in addition, we
can drop the assumption

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.550
that the atom is initially at
rest when it absorbs or emits.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.230
Now the atom is moving.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.840
But for that, we don't
need any new concept.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.190
Because the moving atom-- we
can just do a transformation

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.990
into the frame of the atom
where the atom is at rest.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:28.600
And then just using the
relativistic transformation,

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:35.500
we are now transferring
the laser frequency

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.720
from the atomic frame
into the lab frame.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.410
So what I've
written down here is

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:45.990
the general special
relativity formula

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:48.320
for the frequency shift.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.600
And I've assumed that
the photon is emitted

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.129
at an angle phi with respect
to the motion of the atom.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:13.870
So now we obtain-- OK, let me
do a second-order expansion.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.290
Usually, our atoms
are non-relativistic,

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.700
so it's the first- and
second-order term which

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.130
are most important.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.910
And if we are now
looking in the lab frame,

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:27.680
what is the frequency where
we emit and absorb photons.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:34.510
It's a resonance frequency
minus/plus the recoil shift,

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.900
which we have already
discussed in isolation

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.380
by assuming we have
atoms at 0 velocity.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.290
But now the velocity
of the atom leads

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:46.420
to a first-order and
second-order Doppler shift.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.880
If v/c is small, what
is most important

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.000
is the first-order
Doppler shift.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.370
And in almost all cases
[? where we ?] do spectroscopy,

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.770
dominant line
broadening effect comes

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.050
from the first-order shift.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:16.280
However, let me point out
that the first-order shift can

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:16.865
be suppressed.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.800
One simple way to suppress
it-- interrogate the atoms

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.270
at an angle of 90 degrees.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:28.570
Have an atomic beam.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:33.510
And if you interrogate them
with a laser beam at 90 degrees,

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.100
the cosine phi is 0.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.240
k dot v is 0.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.900
And this is the oldest method
to do Doppler-free spectroscopy.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.620
In your new homework
assignment, you

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:53.930
will discuss saturation
spectroscopy.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:56.440
If you have a broad
velocity distribution,

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.470
but you find a way of labeling
atoms with a certain velocity

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:04.640
class, then you have created
your own narrow velocity class

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.650
where the Doppler
broadening is absent

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.660
because you've only
one velocity class.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.570
And these methods of nonlinear
spectroscopy, the concept

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:17.290
will be developed in
the homework assignment.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:20.220
Finally-- and this will
be the next chapter

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.890
which we talk in class here
in about two weeks-- this

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.780
is by having two-photon
spectroscopy.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.280
To give you the
appetizer, if you

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.560
have two photons from opposite
direction, the Doppler shifts.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.640
One has a positive, one has
a negative Doppler shift.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.720
And if you stack
up the two photons,

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.130
the sum of the two
Doppler shifts is 0.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:46.370
So two-photon spectroscopy
provides you an opportunity

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.255
to completely eliminate
the Doppler shift.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:59.530
However, no matter what you
pick here for the angle,

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:02.870
there is a part of the
second-order Doppler

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:05.680
shift you can never get rid of.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.400
And this is something
important to keep in mind.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.050
The second-order Doppler
shift, at least one part of it,

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:16.570
comes from the relativistic
transformation of time.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.900
So if you have atoms moving
at different velocities,

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:25.210
time in the frame of the atom
ticks slightly differently

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:27.700
depending what the velocity is.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.900
And therefore, if
you do spectroscopy,

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.530
you measure time
in the lab frame,

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.320
but the atoms measure time
in the resonance frequency

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.860
in their own frame.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.690
Then there is
inevitably broadening.

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.470
So for instance, when people
did Ted Hansch's experiment,

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.430
the famous two-photon
spectroscopy

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:48.580
on hydrogen, high resolution,
determination of the Lamb

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.260
shift, the Rydberg constant--
one of the flagship experiments

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.410
of high resolution
laser spectroscopy.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:59.660
A limit is the
second-order Doppler effect

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.660
because of its
relativistic nature.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.090
And the only way to suppress
the relativistic Doppler effect

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:08.390
is by cooling the atoms,
reducing their velocity.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.930
So let me just write that down.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:25.070
So when we suppress
the first-order effect,

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:30.290
then the limit is given
by the second-order term.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:38.140
And just repeat, the
second-order term cannot be

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.460
eliminated by playing
geometric tricks,

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.190
90-degree angles and such,
because it's fundamentally

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.900
rooted in the relativistic
definition of time.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.000
OK.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:06.325
Any questions about recoil
shifts, Doppler shifts?

00:46:06.325 --> 00:46:06.825
Yes.

00:46:06.825 --> 00:46:08.571
AUDIENCE: What are
the correct way

00:46:08.571 --> 00:46:11.910
to determine whether
we're in tightly confined

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:12.864
[? regime ?] or not?

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:19.330
PROFESSOR: OK, the
question is what

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.640
is the criteria on whether we
are tightly confined or not.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.690
I will give a full answer
to that in about a week when

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:29.040
I discuss with you
in great detail

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.760
the spectrum of a
confined particle.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.690
And what we will
introduce is it's

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:37.590
the frequency of
harmonic confinement.

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.490
And we have to
compare the frequency

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:43.270
of harmonic confinement
to two other relative,

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:45.890
to two other
important frequencies.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:47:00.970
One frequency is the
recoil frequency.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:05.280
And another one may be
the natural line width.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.360
So in other words, when
we discuss the spectrum

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.190
of confined particles,
we can discuss it

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.710
as a function of three
parameters-- confinement

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:17.210
frequency, recoil frequency,
and natural line widths.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:22.020
And based on the hierarchy
of those three frequencies,

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.140
we find limiting cases.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.840
And we will find, then--
and this is probably

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.070
what you are aiming for-- at
some limit when you reduce

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.020
the confinement in your
harmonic oscillator,

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.880
you will actually retrieve
the free gas limit.

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:42.350
Or to be very brief,
confinement, you

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:45.020
have the benefit of confinement.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.600
Confinement means the
motion of the atom

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.967
is quantized in
units of h bar omega.

00:47:49.967 --> 00:47:51.550
So you shouldn't
think about velocity.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:53.900
You should think
about discrete levels.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.060
And I will show you that the
spectrum which is broadened

00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:01.100
becomes a spectrum with
discrete levels and side bands.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.620
As long as you can resolve the
side bands, you can see them,

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.980
you can actually
address the line

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.440
in the middle which has
no motion blurring at all.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.990
But you have to resolve it.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:15.200
So one condition here now is
that the harmonic oscillator

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.390
frequency is larger than
the natural broadening

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:19.870
of each line.

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:23.146
If the lines blur, you're
pretty much back to free space

00:48:23.146 --> 00:48:25.020
and you've lost the
advantage of confinement.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.160
But maybe we can discuss
some of those aspects

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.660
after I've introduced the line
shape of confined particles.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:40.700
OK.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:46.880
OK.

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.980
Let me now discuss
briefly, or use

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.190
what we have just discussed
about Doppler shift

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:04.570
to discuss the line
shape in a gas.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:07.140
Well, of course, line
shapes in a gas--

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:10.150
that's what all people observed
when they did spectroscopy

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.910
before the advent of
trapping and cooling.

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:15.940
But even now, we
often have a situation

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.780
that we have a thermal clouded
microkelvin temperature.

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.940
And what we see is
still broadening

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:23.120
due to the thermal motion.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.420
So therefore, let
me just tell you

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.990
a few aspects of that which
you might find interesting.

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:38.120
So one is when we have
an non-degenerate gas,

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.575
this is described by a
Boltzmann distribution, sort

00:49:41.575 --> 00:49:44.340
of a Gaussian
distribution of velocity.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:49.850
And therefore, if the
first-order Doppler shift

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:53.310
is relevant, the
first-order Doppler shift

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:59.380
is proportionate to v,
so therefore the spectrum

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:05.420
we observe is nothing else
than the spectrum in velocity

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.410
multiplied with a k vector.

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:10.270
The Doppler shift is k dot
v, and therefore the velocity

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:12.560
distribution by
multiplying it with k

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.790
is turned into a
frequency distribution.

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:17.420
And so the classic
frequency distribution

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.770
you would expect
in a gas is simply

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.890
the Gaussian distribution.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:25.210
And the Doppler width,
the spectroscopic width,

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:29.640
is nothing else than whatever
the characteristic speed

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.690
in your Boltzmann
distribution is, typically

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:36.480
the most probable speed, 2 times
the temperature over the mass

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:40.130
multiplied with the k vector.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:48.880
And in many cases, it is this
Doppler width which dominates.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.950
I've just given you
typical examples here.

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:55.640
If you've stabilized your laser
to a room temperature vapor

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.700
cell, you will encounter
typical Doppler widths

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.970
on the order of 1 gigahertz.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:05.000
This is 100 times larger than
the natural line width, which

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.970
is 100 times larger
than the recoil shift.

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:13.087
So that is the usual
hierarchy of shifts

00:51:13.087 --> 00:51:14.170
and broadening mechanisms.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:28.740
So therefore, you would
think that if the Gaussian

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.920
line widths due to the
velocity distribution is

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.080
100 times larger than the
natural line widths which

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.010
is described by Lorentzian,
you can completely

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:41.970
neglect the Lorentzian.

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:46.140
But that's not the
case, and that's

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.000
what I want to discuss now.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.540
What happens is you
have a Gaussian which

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.850
is much, much broader.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:55.470
But the Gaussian
decays exponentially,

00:51:55.470 --> 00:52:02.090
whereas your narrow Lorentzian
decays with a power law.

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.220
So just to give you
the example, if you

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:08.100
go two full
half-line widths away

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.400
from the center of a
Gaussian, the Gaussian

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.540
has dropped to 0.2%.

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.110
The Lorentzian has still 6%.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.390
So therefore, what
happens is if you

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:25.180
have your gigahertz
broadened line in a gas,

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.370
but you go further
and further away,

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:31.740
at some point what
you encounter are not

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:36.560
the Gaussian wings but
the Lorentzian wings.

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.980
And that's maybe also sort of
intellectually interesting.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.740
I've talked to you about
homogeneous, inhomogeneous line

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:43.440
widths.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.390
The bulk part of the
Gaussian is inhomogeneous

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.490
because you can talk
to different atoms

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:49.790
at different velocities.

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:52.940
Each atom resonates
with its own Lorentzian,

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.070
and it is inhomogeneously
broadened.

00:52:56.070 --> 00:53:01.010
But in the line widths which
is due to the Lorentzian,

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:04.980
the homogeneous
broadening dominates.

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.460
And since the Lorentzian
has information

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.100
about either the
natural line widths

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.900
or in a gas about
collisional broadening,

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:19.040
you can actually, far away in
the wings of your line shape,

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:22.530
retrieve information about
collisional physics, which,

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:24.736
in the center of the
line, is completely

00:53:24.736 --> 00:53:26.402
masked by the first-order
Doppler shift.

00:53:36.734 --> 00:53:37.240
OK.

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:44.060
So I've already written it down.

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.230
So far wing spectroscopy
in the gas phase

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.320
can give you
interesting information

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.920
about atomic collisions
and atomic interactions.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.390
So having started
out by telling you

00:53:56.390 --> 00:54:01.180
that it's a first-order Doppler
shift which usually dominates,

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.150
but then telling you that if
you go far away from the line

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:10.780
center, the Lorentzian actually
dominates, that means now there

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:14.980
are situations where
we want actually both.

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:19.015
And the general
solution, of course,

00:54:19.015 --> 00:54:22.150
is you do a convolution.

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:25.980
Each atom with a given
velocity has a Lorentzian.

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.370
And then you have to do the
convolution with the velocity

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:29.960
distribution.

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:35.550
So therefore, the general
situation for gas phase

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:43.420
spectroscopy is the
convolution of the Lorentzian

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:50.650
for each atom and the Gaussian
velocity distribution.

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:55.010
And since this was the standard
case which people encountered

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:58.170
when they did spectroscopy
in the gas phase,

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:02.520
this convoluted line
shape has its own name.

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.860
It's called the Voigt profile.

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.247
Colin.

00:55:16.247 --> 00:55:18.742
AUDIENCE: It's not
obvious to me what exactly

00:55:18.742 --> 00:55:21.736
about the atomic
collisions and interaction,

00:55:21.736 --> 00:55:23.732
the wings of the
Lorentzian [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:23.732 --> 00:55:28.223
Don't you just learn
about the bare line?

00:55:28.223 --> 00:55:30.219
Like the un-Doppler
shifted line itself?

00:55:33.001 --> 00:55:35.500
PROFESSOR: OK, that's a good
question, as it is not obvious.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.670
And yes, the literature
is full of it.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:42.970
Because if you don't have
Doppler-free spectroscopy,

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:46.530
if you are always limited
by the Doppler broadening,

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:48.660
put yourself back
into the last century.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.510
But you really want
to learn something

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:52.890
about how atoms
interact and collide,

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:55.470
this was the way to do it.

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:56.970
I don't want to go
into many details

00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:58.870
because it's a little
bit old fashioned.

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:00.690
We have other ways to do it now.

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:03.060
But I find it
intellectually interesting

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.910
when we talk about line shapes
to realize there are maybe

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:09.020
some subtleties we wouldn't have
thought about it by ourselves.

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:12.000
But just to give you one
example, for whatever reason,

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.760
you're very, very interested.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.790
What is the rate of
collision of atoms?

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:21.950
Let's just assume the
simplest model for collisions

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:25.980
that when two atoms collide,
the excited state is de-excited.

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:27.850
Then the lifetime
of the excited state

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:31.040
is no longer 1 over
gamma, the lifetime

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.830
is the collision time defined
as a de-excitation time.

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:38.050
And you're really interested
for whatever reason,

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:41.250
because you have the world's
best theory on this object,

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:46.980
that you have a theory what is
the collision time for excited

00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:50.930
sodium with argon,
with helium, kind

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.264
of with all different elements.

00:56:53.264 --> 00:56:54.680
And you have an
interesting theory

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:59.170
which actually reflects how
sodium in the excited state

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.830
would interact with noble gases.

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:03.610
And you really want
to test your theory.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:07.070
Well, now what happens is
the situation is simple.

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:11.300
You have a Lorentzian,
but the Lorentzian

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.290
has a broadening which
is the collision rate.

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:19.770
And by carefully analyzing the
wings of your Doppler profile,

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:25.700
you find the collision rate--
as a functional of buffer

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:30.230
gas density, as a function of
noble gas, whatever you pick.

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.930
That's one example.

00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:34.330
Another example would
be, there may be also

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:37.610
somewhere nontrivial shifts
when the atoms collide.

00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:39.760
We'll talk about it
also a little bit later.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:43.880
The experience-- de-excitation
is one possibility.

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.460
But more subtle
things can happen.

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:48.200
For instance, just a
phase perturbation,

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.510
or when atoms come
close to each other,

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:52.720
they feel the electric field.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.030
And the electric field
causes an AC Stark shift.

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:59.410
But by understanding the
AC Stark shift or AC Stark

00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.480
broadening which
comes along with that,

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.990
you can maybe map out
the interaction potential

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:05.560
between two atoms.

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.570
So people were really
ingenious in trying

00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:11.220
to learn something about
atomic interactions

00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:13.870
from spectroscopic
information, and that

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.310
was one of the few
tools they had.

00:58:18.749 --> 00:58:19.415
Other questions?

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:24.460
OK.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:29.010
We have covered the
simple examples.

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:38.240
And now I want to give you a
more comprehensive framework

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:42.070
called perturbation theory
of spectral broadening.

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:47.950
And in the last class, I
mentioned to you already

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:50.410
that, by using
this framework, we

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:56.950
can more deeply understand
line broadening mechanisms.

00:58:56.950 --> 00:59:02.130
And one highlight actually
will be that next week,

00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:06.370
using these concepts, we
will actually understand that

00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:10.550
collisions cannot only cause
collisional broadening,

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:13.940
they can also cause
collisional narrowing.

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:16.920
So some things which
are counterintuitive

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.690
have a very clear description
using this method.

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:25.310
So I think what I'm able to do
in the remaining 20 minutes is

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:28.910
to step you through
the derivation.

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:32.530
And then we apply it to a
number of interesting physical

00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:35.750
situations next week.

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:39.220
Now, in a way, I
have to apologize

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:42.880
that what I present to you is
time dependent perturbation

00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.410
theory again.

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:50.350
And again with a slightly
different notation, so

00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:55.280
I think I go rather quickly for
the part which is just review.

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.980
But repeating something
is also a good thing.

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:02.530
But then I will
tell you when we go

01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:05.635
beyond what we have
discussed and beyond what you

01:00:05.635 --> 01:00:06.760
may have seen in textbooks.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:18.790
So in other words, we do time
dependent perturbation theory.

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:22.860
We have a wave function which
is in two states, A and B.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:27.810
And there's a time dependent
perturbation v. Schrodinger's

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:32.500
equation tells us that it's
probably the interaction

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.140
picture, that the rate of
change of the amplitude B

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.880
comes because we
start in the state A

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.430
and the perturbation
couples from state A to B.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.186
And so we can solve it.

01:00:44.186 --> 01:00:47.470
At this point, it's not even
perturbative, it's general.

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:50.270
And we are interested
in spectroscopy

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:53.930
in the rate of a transition,
because we do spectroscopy

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.930
and we measure what is the
population in the excited

01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:57.590
state.

01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:59.780
Because there was
a rate at which

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.860
atoms were transferred from
the calm to the excited state.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.370
So the rate is the
probability to be

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.770
in the excited
state per unit time.

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:12.679
So what we are interested now
is, what is the amplitude B?

01:01:12.679 --> 01:01:14.220
And what is the
probability B squared

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.440
to be in the excited state?

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.560
And now comes
perturbation theory.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.900
If we take
Schrodinger's equation

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:26.670
and we integrate it with respect
to time-- so we go from B dot

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:30.030
to B-- we are integrating
here with respect to time.

01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:32.450
And in first-order
perturbation theory,

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:36.690
we assume the initial
state is undepleted.

01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:41.110
And we replace the amplitude
A of t by its value at time t

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:42.995
equals 0, which is
assumed to be unity.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.510
OK.

01:01:46.510 --> 01:02:02.592
So with that-- oh yeah,
and this may be something.

01:02:02.592 --> 01:02:04.800
I'm not doing anything which
goes beyond perturbation

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.430
theory, but I'm using a
slightly different formulation.

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:10.890
Because you will see that
I need it in a moment.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:14.630
The rate is dB squared dt.

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:17.250
And if I take the
derivative of B squared,

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:21.630
I get B or B star times B dot.

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.010
So now I'm using
the perturbative--

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:28.990
I'm inserting this function
B into this expression

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:31.090
for the rate.

01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:32.250
And this is what I obtain.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.060
So I can take the
time derivative of it,

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:44.550
but the time derivative is only
affecting the upper integral.

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:48.920
So therefore what I get
is B is the integral.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.570
B dot is the integrand.

01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:53.740
And now I get this
expression, which

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.915
has the product of the
two matrix elements.

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:01.210
Simple mathematics,
plug and play.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:03.320
No new concept.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:07.180
But what it leads us now is,
and this is what is usually

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.090
not so much emphasized
in perturbation

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.910
theory, that everything
which happens to the atom,

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:17.190
and this is the rate at
which we excite the atom,

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:20.920
is now involving a
correlation function.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:28.680
It involves sort of an
integral over the drive field v

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.240
at time t and time t prime.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.690
And this is the
important concept

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.810
when you want to
explain and understand

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:37.510
line broadening and such.

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:42.440
You are driving the system
with an external field.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.960
And often in
perturbation theory,

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.870
you assume the external field
is just e to the i omega t,

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:51.720
and this correlation function
is just e to the i omega t.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.870
And it's so trivial that you
don't even recognize that e

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:59.060
to the i omega t is not the
time dependence of your field.

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:04.170
e to the i omega t is sort of
the product of the field at t

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:10.240
equals 0 and the field at time
t and the field at time t prime.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.430
But if you have a more
general field with lots

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:16.120
of Fourier components, the
difference between whether it's

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.342
a correlation function or the
field itself becomes important.

01:04:20.342 --> 01:04:21.800
In other words,
I'm now telling you

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.700
whenever you did perturbation
theory, this is what you did.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.550
Maybe you didn't notice it,
but what you had was actually

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:32.040
the correlation function
between the drive field

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.224
at two different
times, t and t prime.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:51.300
OK, so our rate is now given
by the correlation function

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.300
of the field.

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.440
And then we so-to-speak
Fourier transform it

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.960
with e to the i omega 0.

01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:12.980
OK.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:16.670
Let's just streamline
the expressions,

01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:18.950
make them look nicer.

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:21.930
We integrate between
time 0 and t.

01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:30.490
But let's now assume--
which is actually

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:33.250
the situation for many
fields of interest--

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:37.790
that the field is invariant
against translation in time t.

01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:40.030
So therefore this
correlation function

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:41.970
does not depend on two times.

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:46.370
It only depends on the
time difference tau.

01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:52.850
Finally, because of the complex
character of the Schrodinger

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:55.730
equation, I had an
expression but I

01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:59.590
had to add the
complex conjugate.

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:03.290
Remember, the rate was the
derivative of B square.

01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:07.660
And the derivative of B
square is B star B dot

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.330
times B star dot times B.

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:10.720
You get two terms.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.260
And this is carried forward
with the complex conjugate.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:18.050
But if the correlation
function has the proper t,

01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:23.000
that complex conjugation means
you can go to negative time.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.430
e to the i omega t
complex conjugate

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:27.720
is e to the minus i omega t.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.660
That means now that we can
absorb the complex conjugate

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.430
by integrating not
from 0 to t, but having

01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:37.960
the integral from
minus t to plus t.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.700
And this will be the next
step for most situations

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.570
of interest.

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:03.300
This correlation, if you
drive it with the field,

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.850
the field has a
finite coherence time.

01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:08.880
So therefore this
integral will not

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.170
have any contribution
when the times are

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:13.270
longer than the coherence time.

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:17.150
And then we can set minus
t and plus t to infinity.

01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:20.450
So that will be our
final expression

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:23.310
which we will use to discuss
line broadening and line

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:25.760
shifts.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.320
But we are not yet there.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:36.700
We need-- so far, I've just done
ordinary perturbation theory.

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:39.360
The one extra thing
is I'm stressing

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.070
that when we have
a product of-- when

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:44.740
we had a matrix element
squared in perturbation theory,

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:48.130
this is really a correlation
function between the

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:51.690
[? external, ?] the drive
field at two different times.

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:55.000
We come back to that when
I discuss the result.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.030
But the second thing I
want to introduce now

01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:02.270
is that this framework,
which I have formulated,

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:06.930
allows me now to
include the fact

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:09.610
that different
atoms in my ensemble

01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:14.790
may experience a
different drive field.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:18.691
For instance, I gave you
the example in last class,

01:08:18.691 --> 01:08:20.149
if you have Doppler
broadening, you

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:22.550
have atoms which start
out at the same point.

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:27.140
But the faster ones move faster
and experience the laser field

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.810
now with a different phase.

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:30.634
So different atoms
now experience

01:08:30.634 --> 01:08:34.500
the perturbation v
in a different way.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.939
So what I've done here so far
is I've pretty much written down

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:40.330
Schrodinger's equation
for a single particle.

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:42.339
But now we have to do
an ensemble average.

01:08:46.149 --> 01:09:02.880
So therefore I introduce
now an ensemble average

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.100
by just taking that
expression and averaging

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.000
over all atoms in the ensemble.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.640
So then I get the
ensemble averaged rate.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.970
All the correlation
functions we discussed,

01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:19.859
our ensemble averaged
correlation functions

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:23.564
and our final result will
also have an ensemble average.

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:34.410
OK.

01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:47.090
So this correlation function
between v of 0 and v of t

01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:49.939
will go to 0 for
very long times.

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:54.600
Even the most expensive laser
in the world, the electric field

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.380
which is emitted
now is not related

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.660
to the electric field which
is emitted in an hour.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.610
Because the phase
relationship has been lost,

01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:06.590
and therefore the correlation
function has decayed to 0.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:12.900
OK.

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:17.270
So this is the ensemble average.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.200
So therefore, what I'm
naturally drawn to now

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.670
is that if I take this
correlation function,

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:31.040
and I know any
correlation function has

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.100
a characteristic time called the
coherence time where it decays.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.930
And therefore I can now
discuss two limiting cases.

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:43.660
One is where the time
evolution of the system

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:46.915
is started for times much
shorter than the coherence time

01:10:46.915 --> 01:10:50.650
or much longer than
the coherence time.

01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:53.270
And if what I'm
telling you right now

01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:57.180
reminds you of my discussion of
Rabi oscillation versus Fermi's

01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:00.800
golden rule-- yes,
this is actually

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.030
a very analogous discussion.

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:06.950
OK, so there are the
two limiting cases.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:17.400
If the time is much shorter
than the coherence time-- let

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:23.170
me give you the example of an
oscillating single mode field.

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:27.370
The perturbation v of
t is just oscillating

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:30.540
with one frequency, omega.

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.390
And that means if I look
at the correlation function

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:38.970
at time t and time
t plus tau, it

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:41.090
is simply the
amplitude of the field

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:45.260
squared times e
to the i omega t.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:50.260
And now I can take this
correlation function;

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.380
put it into my
integral, which has just

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:55.800
disappeared from the screen;
do the integration with e

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.540
to the i omega 0 t.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.188
And this is the result I obtain.

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:08.430
And of course, this
is nothing else

01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:09.950
than what you have
always obtained

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:13.820
in time dependent perturbation
theory with a sinusoidal field.

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.860
It is this characteristic
sine detuning

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:20.720
t over detuning,
which in the limit

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.430
and in the limit of when
you square it and go

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:26.600
to the limit of long times, it
turns into a delta function.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.080
This gives us
Fermi's golden rule.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.850
And of course, it has the
same behavior at short times.

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:47.910
At short times, the
probability for the atom

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:50.670
to be in the excited
state is quadratic.

01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:54.230
Quadratic is like an
incipient Rabi oscillation.

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:56.900
And in perturbation theory,
we never get higher up.

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:59.800
We just look at the
beginning Rabi oscillation.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.010
So therefore, the
probability is quadratic.

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:05.760
But I'm talking about
the rate, and the rate

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.080
is probability divided by time.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:11.540
So that means the rate is
linearly increasing in time.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.580
So I'm just saying this is
nothing else than rewriting

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:18.560
the physics of
Rabi oscillations.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.490
OK.

01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:24.070
If the time is longer
than the coherence time,

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:30.970
then we integrate the integral,
not from minus t to plus t.

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:33.690
We can take the
limits to infinity.

01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:36.290
And that means we
obtain a result

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:39.160
which is now
independent of time.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.960
And that means since
Wba is the rate,

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.920
we retrieve a constant
rate, and this

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.148
is what we have done
in Fermi's golden rule.

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:57.260
So therefore, when we
look at the time evolution

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:03.410
of a system driven by an
external field, the moment

01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:06.671
we look for the time evolution
longer than the coherence

01:14:06.671 --> 01:14:08.420
time-- and this is
where the main interest

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.570
is in spectroscopy-- we
have a Fermi's golden rule

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:18.690
result that the system is
excited at a constant rate.

01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:25.020
And I want to now
reinterpret this rate.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:29.400
This rate is nothing else
than the Fourier transform

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.660
of a correlation function.

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:33.810
It makes a lot of sense.

01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:40.020
You apply time-dependent
magnetic fields, perturbations,

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:43.660
fluctuating magnetic fields,
whatever, vibration and noise

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:44.410
in your lab.

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.620
You just apply that to
the atom, and the atom

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:50.580
is nothing else than a
little Fourier analyzer.

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:53.590
It says, my resonance
frequency is omega 0.

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:56.540
And all of what matters for
me to make a real transition

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:59.020
is what you offer me at omega 0.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:01.380
And I now Fourier
analyze whatever

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.570
acts on me, the correlation
function of the perturbation

01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:07.160
which acts on me, and
I fully analyze it.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.220
And what matters for my rate
to go to the excited state

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:13.670
is the Fourier component
at the resonance frequency.

01:15:13.670 --> 01:15:15.252
It's just a
generalization of what

01:15:15.252 --> 01:15:16.710
we have done in
perturbation theory

01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:20.227
when we assumed that we
have a drive field only

01:15:20.227 --> 01:15:20.935
at one frequency.

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:29.860
So I've written it
down here for you.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.190
The rate of excitation
is nothing else

01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:37.760
than the Fourier transform
of this correlation function.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.880
But let me now take
it one step further,

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.270
which also makes a lot of sense.

01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:47.400
The Fourier transform
of the correlation

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.970
function-- the
correlation function

01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:54.170
is the convolution of
the time-dependent fields

01:15:54.170 --> 01:15:59.720
with themselves, v of
t with v of t plus tau.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.160
The Fourier transform
of the convolution

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.460
is the product of the Fourier
transform of the field itself.

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:13.510
So therefore, I
can take whatever

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:18.580
perturbation the atom
experiences in its own frame--

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:21.240
external fields, moving around.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.860
Whatever the atom
is exposed to, I

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.090
have to calculate
the power spectrum

01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:30.000
of what the atom feels.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.210
And this power spectrum
provides me the excitation rate.

01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:37.340
It's nothing else than
Fermi's golden rule

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.800
but generalized to the
concept of an arbitrary

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.569
spectrum of the driving field.

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:57.830
Questions so far?

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:12.510
You can also say
that's a wonderful way

01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:16.152
to look at energy conservation.

01:17:16.152 --> 01:17:21.140
If an atom is exposed to
any kind of environment,

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:24.550
it goes from the ground
to the excited state only

01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:32.330
to the extent that whatever
acts on the atom has a Fourier

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:35.070
component at the
resonance frequency.

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:38.820
And it is only the power
of the fluctuating drive

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:42.950
field at the resonance
frequency which

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:46.370
is responsible for
driving the atom.

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:49.570
And this is energy conservation.

01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:52.870
The frequency component
has to be omega 0

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:55.360
to take the atom from the
calm to the excited state.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.010
All the other
frequency components

01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:01.490
take the atom to the virtual
state and take it down again.

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:04.150
They create maybe line shifts
or something like this.

01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:05.760
But a real transition,
a transition

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.610
where the atom stays
in the excited state,

01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:13.290
requires photons at the
resonance frequency.

01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:15.960
And so to speak, this
measures how many

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:20.320
photons are acting on the atoms.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:26.460
Let me now give you one
or two general features

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:31.380
of such correlation
functions which I just

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:35.080
find very, very useful.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.650
And then I think
your time is over.

01:18:45.102 --> 01:18:49.760
If we have G of w
is now the spectrum

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.460
of the fluctuating fields.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.780
And let's assume,
yes, eventually we

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.920
have a fluctuating
field which is somewhere

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.940
centered at the
resonance frequency.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.390
After all, we use a
laser, but the atom

01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:02.290
may now move around
in the laser beam.

01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:03.920
The mirrors may be vibrating.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.760
So the spectrum seen
by the atom is sort of

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.730
broadened around the
resonance frequency.

01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:13.530
And the broadening is
nothing else than 1

01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:18.570
over the coherence time
of the environment.

01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:22.100
So let me just normalize
the correlation function

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.520
that the integral is unity.

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:29.620
And then this is
trivial but important.

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:32.280
The value at the
resonance frequency

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:37.650
is 1 over the broadening and is
therefore the coherence time.

01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:40.220
It's sort of subtle
but important.

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.140
If you have a
normalized spectrum,

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:44.160
the more coherent
your source is,

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.060
the larger is the value
of the correlation

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.770
function in the center.

01:19:52.850 --> 01:20:00.330
Let me do the Fourier transform.

01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:02.300
If you Fourier transform
something like this,

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.950
it gives an oscillating function
at the resonance frequency.

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:08.350
But let me just multiply by
e to the i omega t and sort

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:10.980
of shift everything
to 0 frequency,

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:14.390
then we would find that
the temporal correlation

01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:15.830
function decays.

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:19.930
And it decays over
characteristic time tau

01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:23.310
coherence, which is nothing
else than the inverse line

01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:25.173
bits of the Fourier transform.

01:20:28.549 --> 01:20:30.340
This has nothing to do
with atomic physics.

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:36.340
It's just properties of the
function is Fourier transform.

01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:39.980
But now we have the situation.

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:46.210
Our rate was the temporal
correlation function times e

01:20:46.210 --> 01:20:47.835
to the i omega 0 t.

01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:56.960
The integrand here is exactly
what I'm plotting here.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.400
And so if I perform
the integration,

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.690
at least without getting
the last numerical factor,

01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:08.640
I can approach the result by the
correlation function at time t

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:12.650
equals 0 times-- if I
do the integration--

01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:15.420
times the temporal
rates of this curve,

01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:19.190
so this is the
correlation time tau c.

01:21:19.190 --> 01:21:23.090
So therefore, if I have,
for instance, my operator

01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:24.930
is the electric
field and I drive

01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:28.020
the atom with a
dipole operator, what

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.880
I find is the
correlation function at t

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.490
equals 0 is nothing else than
the electric field squared,

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:38.400
which is what we have called the
Rabi frequency squared so far.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.714
But now I multiply it
with a coherence time.

01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:51.500
So this result should
come very naturally to you

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.370
because when we have
Fermi's golden rule,

01:21:53.370 --> 01:21:57.200
we have a matrix element squared
times the delta function.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.900
But I've emphasized it again
and again-- the delta function

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:05.700
is representative for spectral
widths for density of states.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.870
And if we have an
environment which

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:13.860
causes spectral broadening,
1 over the coherence time

01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:21.970
is nothing else than the
spectral widths here.

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.820
And so I've done here exactly
what the delta function

01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:26.680
Fermi's golden rule
asked me to do.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.630
So if I had wanted, I
could have just said,

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:30.330
look, here is
Fermi's golden rule.

01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:33.550
And by interpreting Fermi's
golden rule the way I just did,

01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:37.500
I could have written down this
result for you right away.

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:41.660
OK, I think time is over.

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:45.670
And maybe the
summary which I could

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:47.450
give you now is a
good starting point

01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:51.010
for our lecture on Monday.

01:22:51.010 --> 01:22:55.120
Reminder, Friday we have the
midterm in this other lecture

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.120
hall in the other building.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.140
We start at the
normal class time.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.590
Please be there on time.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good morning. Good morning.
Today I'm going to talk about,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
this is lecture 14, and I'm going
to talk about protein localization.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, some of you may remember
that earlier in the semester I was

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
walking around with this sling.
And so to help me from writing on

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the board, even though it is
this arm, I have made a PowerPoint

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
presentation of most of the
things that I would have written

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
on the board. And for
your ease and comfort,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
this PowerPoint presentation will
be posted online so you won't have to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
write down everything in my slides.
So just sort of sit back. And I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
will write a few things on the
board, so you can write those down.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
OK. So now you guys have heard
about central dogma from Professor

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Eric Lander and you've heard
about gene regulation last Friday.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Here is something that
you're familiar with,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
this image here
depicting central dogma.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
DNA replicates to DNA. This
is replication. Replication.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
DNA is translated, excuse
me, transcribed to RNA.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Transcription. And RNA
is translated to protein.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Central dogma. Where does this
occur? Where does replication

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
occur in a cell?
Nucleus. Good.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Where does transcription
occur in a cell? Nucleus.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I heard nucleus. That is
correct. And where does

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
translation occur?
Cytoplasm. Ah, and yet we know

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that these processes
require proteins to do them.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
OK. You've just described
where these processes occur in a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
eukaryotic cell. Let's
say you're a bacterium.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In bacteria, where does replication,
transcription and translation occur?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Where? Cytoplasm. OK. So now
we've made bacteria look very

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
simple. But they're not that simple.
And so let's take a look here.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Here's a bacterial cell.
I've drawn what could be E.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
coli. I has an outer membrane, an
inner membrane, and the space in

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
between is the perisplasm.
Now, here is its circular

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
chromosome. I've transcribed some
gene to an RNA and a ribosomal pop

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
on and make a protein
which his in the cytoplasm.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Yet some proteins are
localized to the inner membrane,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
others are localized to the
periplasm, and some are localized to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the outer membrane, and
others are actually exported

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
completely outside the cell.
Even more complicated is a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
eukaryotic protein, because
not only does it have a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
plasma membrane where proteins
are localized. It has a bunch

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
of organelles. There's
the nucleus and there's

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
mitochondria and there's endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi apparatus.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And it, too, translates RNA
by ribosomes in the cytoplasm.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So how do these proteins get
back to the nucleus or go into the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
mitochondria or get into the
organelles? So what we're going to

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
do in the next few slides is
we're going to follow the process,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
because they're so similar in
bacteria and eukaryotic cells,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
of how proteins get to the membrane
and how they get outside the cell.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And then I'll go back and talk about
how proteins get into some of the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
organelles. So let me show you
what some of the proteins are.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So an example of a cytoplasmic
protein in bacteria is beta

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
galactosidase.
You've heard about it.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It breaks down lactose. It's
in the cytoplasm. And example

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of a membrane protein
is a lactose receptor.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The lacY permease that's on the
surface of the cell brings lactose

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
in. An example of a fully
secreted protein is a toxin.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
For instance, bacillus
anthracis makes anthrax toxin.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It's completely exported from the
cell. In a eukaryotic cell there's

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
a bunch of cytoplasmic proteins.
There are all of the glycolytic

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
enzymes. And, for
instance, biosynthetic amino

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
acid enzymes like histidine
synthesis enzymes, those

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
are cytoplasmic. For a
membrane protein there are

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
receptors, like the receptor
for insulin, a hormone,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
a peptide hormone, or growth factor
receptors, every receptor that's

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
membrane-bound. And a
fully secreted protein.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Some cells like pancreatic
cells secrete insulin.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Some cells like some of your
immune cells secrete antibodies.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
OK. So it was not clear how these
cytoplasmically made proteins,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
proteins that were made in the
cytoplasm got to this location.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And the person who worked
on this was George Palade.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And this was in the fifties.
And he studied pancreatic cells

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
because they're master secretors.
And he was able to perfect his

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
microscopic technique. And
you can see here this is a

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
pancreatic cell. This
is endoplasmic reticulum

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
studded with ribosomes.
These are mitochondria.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
This is the nucleus. Here is
another picture that he took.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And here is the rough endoplasmic
reticulum studded with ribosomes.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Here's Golgi apparatus. And then
there are like little vesicles.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So he did this experiment where
he decided he would pulse label

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
proteins as they were being
synthesized in a pancreas,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
directly in a pancreas. So
what he did was he injected

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:51.000
radioactive amino acids directly
into the pancreas of hamsters.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I guess I could
draw a little

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
hamster here. And he directly
injected radioactive isotopes.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And what he's doing is these
radioactive amino acids will be

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
incorporated into proteins
as they're being translated,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and he can follow the population of
freshly translated proteins through

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the cell. So he injects hamsters
with the radioactive amino acids.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And then at various time points he
adds, he also injects glutaraldehyde.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So first the label, then
glutaraldehyde. And what this

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
does is it fixes the cells in its
tracks. Whatever the cell is doing

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
it just stops. And he
removes the pancreas and he

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
looks at the cells.
This is fixes the cells.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So, Tom, I don't know what's
going on here. Can we not use this,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Tom? All right. It's just doing it
on its own. It has some time thing?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Oh. All right. So what he found
was at the early time points,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
now, what I did, I did this, OK?
He didn't see yellow. What I did

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
was I added yellow to his original
slide to show you at the earliest

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
time point he found the label
associated with the endoplasmic

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
reticulum. At the next
time point he found the

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
label associated with the Golgi
apparatus. And then at even later

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
time points he found the
label in secretory vesicles.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So this is my representation
of what he found.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So here's a cell,
nucleus, mitochondria.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The early time points the label
was in the ER followed by the Golgi.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I didn't do that.
Yeah, take it out.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Followed by vesicles.
It's not working. OK.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Sorry for that. I'm sorry. So
he won a Nobel Prize for this

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
work because it is the pathway
that still holds true today.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Now, he won the Nobel Prize in '74.
And at about that time, maybe '71,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
another scientist names Cesar
Milstein was working on immunology.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And what he did was he fused
a cancer cell with a cell that

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
constantly secreted antibodies,
so he ended up having an

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
immortalized antibody producing cell.
And he was doing some research and

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
he did in vitro analysis. And
he found that antibodies that

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
were produced in vitro were longer
than the ones that were actually

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
coming out of the cell. So
he proposed that there was an

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
N-terminal end. He
looked and saw that the

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
N-terminus was different,
and he proposed that it would

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
possibly be cleaved upon export.
OK? And so this is, he won a Nobel

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Prize, not for this work but
for his work in immunology.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And this was also correct. And
so this is from his lecture,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Nobel lecture. It says in vitro
synthesis of immunoglobulin light

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
chains, that's what he was doing,
to our delight we ran into the

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
unexpected observation of the
existence of a biosynthetic

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
precursor of light chain.
Further experiments led us to

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
propose the extra N-terminal
sequence was a signal for vectorial

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
transport across the membrane
during protein synthesis.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
This was the first evidence that
indicated the signal for secretion

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
was an N-terminal segment rapidly
cleaved upon protein synthesis.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
OK. So now there was a student
of Palade. He was a post-doctoral

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
student. His name
was Guther Blobel.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And he saw this experiment in 1971.
And he thought how do we know it's

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
not an artifact of in vitro science?
Well, how do you know that the

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
ribosomes are not just hoping
on earlier in the message?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Maybe that's why it's a longer
protein. And he didn't buy it.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So he wanted to further pursue
this. And he did it in the

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Palade manner. So what
he did was he took a test

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
tube and he added message
for exported protein,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
ribosomes and charged tRNAs. And
when I say charged tRNAs I mean

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
tRNAs that have amino acids attached
to them. And so if you add those

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
three things to a test tube you
find a protein is made. So then

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
he added microsomes.
What are microsomes?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.000
OK. We're going
to pause this.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Now, I told you what Palade found
out. He found out that proteins

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
were first seen in the rough ER in
the lumen. This is the lumen right

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
here. This is where he
first observed radioactivity.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Now, if you take endoplasmic
reticulum and you share it,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
it forms little tiny vesicles,
little vesicles with ribosomes on

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the outside. And they're
called microsomes for

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
small things. Microsomes.
And they're essentially little

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
rough endoplasmic reticulum vesicles.
So when Blobel added to the same

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
test tube that had the RNA,
the ribosomes, the tRNA.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
When he added microsomes he found
that the protein was still in the

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
supernatant. There was no protein
found in the lumen of the microsomes.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So he figured, OK,
it needs something.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Let me go extract something
from the cytoplasm.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And he extracted lots of fractions.
And he added these cytoplasmic

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
fractions. And he found that one
faction actually was able to cause

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
the peptide to enter the microsome.
And if he added this fraction late

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
in the reaction, the protein
would never get into the

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
lumen of the microsome. But
if he added the fraction late,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I mean, excuse me, early, if he
added the faction early they would

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
get in. So let me just summarize.
So message ribosomes, tRNA, you

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
find protein in the supernatant.
Message ribosomes, tRNAs, plus

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
microsomes, protein in the
supernatant, not in the microsomes.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
You add a fraction that works
sometimes, but if it's added late

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
the protein is in the supernatant.
But if you add that fraction early

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
the protein is in the lumen of the
microsomes. So he interpreted this

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
result as that there was an amino
acid sequence at the beginning of an

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
exported protein. And that's
recognized by a complex

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
that was in the fraction. This
complex is required to get the

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
protein to the lumen of the ER.
And to get to the lumen of the ER

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
the protein has to be just
beginning to be translated.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Now, since not all proteins
have the same N-terminus,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Blobel predicated, like Milstein,
whatever the sequence was it would

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
later be cleaved. And he
won a Nobel Prize for this

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
in 1999. And it wasn't just for
this, because he went on and he

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
actually figured out
the entire pathway.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
In the next few slides I'm going
to show you what he discerned.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
One thing I want to just point out,
though, the experiment he did was

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
heterologous. So the
extract came from wheat germ,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
the microsomes came from dog, and
yet it still worked. And it was

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
right because this pathway is
universal. And let me show you how

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
universal. It's used in bacteria
and it's used in eukaryotic cells.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So here's a bacterium,
it's translating a message.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Here's the signal starting to be
translated, it's an exported protein.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
The same thing, in the
cytoplasm a signal sequence

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
is being newly made. And
here's a close look of the

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
signal sequence. It's
about 20 amino acids long.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
It has a couple of positive
charges at its extreme N-terminus.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
In the middle there's about seven
to twelve hydrophobic amino acids

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
variable. And this called
a signal sequence. OK,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
so let's take a look at what happens.
OK. Now we're in the cytoplasm of

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
a eukaryotic cell. Here is
a signal sequence emerging

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
from a ribosome here.
What recognizes it is SRP.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
That's what he named his complex
for signal recognition particle.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
So SRP binds to the signal sequence.
And, if you recall, it takes it to

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
the ER to be translated.
Here's a picture of the ER.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And there's a docking protein or
SRP receptor. So the SRP binds to

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
the docking protein, it
brings with it the signal

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
sequence which is attached to the
ribosome, which is attached to the

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
message. Adjacent to the docking
protein is a translocon which is a

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
channel composed of proteins.
The ribosome pops onto the

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
translocon. The SRP floats away.
And notice that the signal sequence

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
is in the membrane, excuse
me, starts to enter through

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
the membrane and
translation resumes.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
The signal sequence is cleaved by
a signal peptidase within the ER,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
it cleaves off the signal
and translation continues.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And if it's a fully secreted
protein it's fully internalized

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
within the lumen of the ER
and the ribosome pops up.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
If it's a membrane protein
the signal is cleaved again,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
translation resumes, and then
it gets imbedded in the membrane.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And so I'm going to shut this off,
otherwise it's going to keep going

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
on its own here. So if
it's a membrane protein what

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
does it have? It has a
transmembrane stretch.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
You've seen this maybe before
in problem sets. So it's a

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000
transmembrane stretch.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Or transmembrane domain. It's
about 20, 22 amino acids long.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
It can be 30 maybe. So we'll
say 20 to 25 amino acids of

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:58.000
hydrophobic residues.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000
It is a stop transfer sequence.
Stop transfer for going across an

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:14.000
ER membrane. It anchors
it in the membrane.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:28.000
It forms
alpha helix.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:44.000
If this part is
the lumen of the ER

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000
right in here then
this is the cytoplasm.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:01.000
OK. So that's
how membranes and

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
proteins look of this kind.
Now, as you can see here,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
it's in the membrane. It's
imbedded in the membrane.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And I've drawn a different membrane
protein over here because this

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
protein is going to work its way
to the far side of the endoplasmic

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
reticulum. OK? As the
fully secreted protein will

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
also work its way. In the
endoplasmic reticulum sugars

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
get put on these proteins. So
when they get to the far side

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
they bleb off into
little transport vesicles.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
OK? So here's the cytoplasmic
protein completely within the lumen

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
of the vesicle. Here's
the membrane protein

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
imbedded in the membrane of the
vesicle. And if you remember Palade

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
sequence, the next stop is the
Golgi. So the head over to the Golgi,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
they bind, they fuse, and what was
imbedded in the membrane is still

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
imbedded in the membrane. And
the fully secreted protein is

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
within the lumen of the Golgi.
Here the sugars are modified. I

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
put little bows on them. And
they work there way over to the

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
far side of the Golgi where
they bleb off again into

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
secretory vesicles.

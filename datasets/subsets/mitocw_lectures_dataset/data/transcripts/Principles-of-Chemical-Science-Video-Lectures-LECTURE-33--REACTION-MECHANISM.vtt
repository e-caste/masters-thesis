00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:28.020
PROFESSOR: Please note that this
is a clicker competition,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.660
perhaps the last of the year,
before you put in your vote

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.070
for this particular
clicker question.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.840
And the defending champs are
recitation three, and I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.420
believe that no recitation
has won more than once.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.080
Is that true?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.570
Is there a recitation that
has two victories?

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.180
So, this might be your last
chance if your recitation has

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.040
not won, or if you want to be
decisive victors in the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.426
clicker competition to have a
repeat victory, this is your

00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:04.770
chance -- no pressure.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:24.210
But go ahead and put in
your clicker response.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:44.550
OK, let's just take 10 more
seconds to click in.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:53.410
OK, the answer here is b, and
the trick was to recognize

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.730
which is the equation for first
order half life, and

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.210
which is the equation for
second order half life.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.620
Most people got this right.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.420
And we picked this clicker
question to demonstrate a

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.620
point that will, for the final
exam, which is that you will

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.620
have an equation sheet
of all the equations.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.520
There'll be a few you have to
memorize, we'll let you know

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.230
what they are, but that's
a lot of equations.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.510
So, so far on each hour exam,
you've had an equation sheet

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.420
that's been related to that
particular material.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.370
On the final, you of an equation
sheet that has the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.620
equations from exam 1, exam 2,
exam 3, and also the fourth

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.650
exam material.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.280
And so, it doesn't say on them,
oh, first order half

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.510
life equation, colon, and then
the equation, it just has all

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.780
of the equations.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.320
So one thing that you have to do
is recognize which equation

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.120
can be applied where.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.060
And this is something that
people, occasionally that's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.840
part of knowing the
material is to

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.510
know/recognize the equations.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.610
You don't have to memorize them,
but you do have to be

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.950
able to recognize them and
know when to apply them.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.550
So that's something you should
be thinking about as you're

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.070
reviewing the material
for the exam.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.870
And we're just going to at jump
right in and talk about

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.070
reaction mechanisms. So this is
the last type of question

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.520
that's on problem-set 10.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.010
So, when you're investigating
reaction mechanisms, you often

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.940
will have an experimentally
determined rate law, and then

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.240
you want to try to come up
with a mechanism that's

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.430
consistent with that rate law.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:48.670
So, for this particular
reaction, we have 2 n o plus o

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.260
2 going to 2 n o 2 gas.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.920
And experimental rate laws
determined there was a rate

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.310
constant called k obs, for k
observed, the observed rate

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.250
constant that was calculated.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.000
And we know that it's the order
of the reactions here.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.880
Overall, what is the overall
order at this

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.360
particular rate law?

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.160
Three.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.020
So we have second order in n
o and first order in o 2.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.110
So if it's overall order of
three, is it likely to occur

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.400
in one step?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.220
No.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.080
What would it be called if it
did occur in one step -- if

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.530
three things came together
at the same

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.670
time to form a product?

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.970
Yeah, thermonuclear.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.730
And we learned last time
that thermonuclear

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.930
reactions are rare.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.020
So it's unlikely that those
three things, the two n o's

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.180
and the one o 2 are going to
come together at the same time

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.560
to form product, so
it probably has

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.750
more than one step.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.250
So, on the board here and on
your notes, we have a two-step

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.700
proposed mechanism, and let's
talk about these two steps and

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.060
come up with a rate law that's
consistent with this

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.740
mechanism, and then see if
that agrees with the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.970
experimental rate law
that was determined.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.160
So, in the first step of this
reaction, we have 2 n o's

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.770
coming together.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.910
There's a little rate constant,
k 1, above the first

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.130
arrow, and for the reverse
direction, we have k minus 1,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.060
so this is written as a
reversible reaction, and it's

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.830
forming an intermediate
n 2 o 2.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.110
In the second step, we have the
o 2 coming in, reacting

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.530
with that intermediate with a
rate constant, k 2, and it's

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.700
forming two molecules
of n o 2.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.690
So now we can write the
rates for each of

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.800
these individual steps.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.400
We can write the rate for the
foward reaction here, and so

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.200
that's going to be
equal to k 1.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.540
And we have n o, two n
o's, so n o squared.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.380
And again, this is a step or an
elementary reaction so we

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.130
can write the reaction
exactly as it occurs.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.000
We can write a rate law for
that step using the

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.010
stiochiometry of the reaction.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.550
For an overall reaction, you
can't do that, it has to be

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.120
experimentally determined.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.000
But for an elementary reaction
or a step in a mechanism, you

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.080
can do that.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.960
So we write it exactly
as it occurs.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.290
So, what would be the order of
this particular reaction as

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.450
written here?

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.450
Two.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.870
And what about molecularity?

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:06.250
It would be bimolecular.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:13.990
So we're just getting you used
to some of these terms.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.840
All right, so then for the
reverse direction, the rate of

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.250
the reverse direction would be
equal to what rate constant?

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.500
k minus 1.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.450
Times what?

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:34.370
Yeah, n 2 o 2.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.180
So what's the order here?

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.300
One.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.470
And what's this called?

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:53.800
Yeah, so that's called
unimolecular.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.550
All right, what about step 2?

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.930
What would be the rate
here, and that

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:47.340
is a clicker question.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:09:01.250
OK, just 10 more seconds.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:09.450
Yup, so we write it exactly as
written, so we have a k 2

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.550
times the concentration
of o 2 times the

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.490
concentration of n 2 o 2.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:24.150
All right, so what is the
overall order here?

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.220
Two.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:38.480
And again, that would
be the bimolecular.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.270
All right, so we have our two
steps, and we've written rates

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.310
for all of those particular
steps.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.360
Now we're interested in writing
the rate of the

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.500
overall reaction that
forms n o 2.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:10:09.440
So, let's think about what the
rate of n o 2 formation is.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.920
So, in the last step, we're
forming n o 2, and we can just

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.000
use that last step to
write this out.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.320
We're forming two molecules
of n o 2.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.440
So we're going to put a 2 in
there, because the rate at

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.780
which the concentration of this
will increase twice as

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.180
much as will decrease
this amount.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.820
And the book is somewhat
inconsistent in its use of 2's

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.910
in these equations.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.890
If you're forming two molecules
in your last step,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.560
there should be a 2, but 2 is
not always in the answer key.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.690
So what I've done in the past
is if you put a 2 and there

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.660
should be a 2, great, but if you
don't put it, that's OK,

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.010
too, so I have not taken off for
this because the book is

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.800
not been completely consistent
in its use of that.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.300
But, if you see a two, and 2
things are being formed, you

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.960
know where that comes from.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.340
So, 2 times k 2, that's the
rate constant of that last

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:16.930
step, and that we're talking
about the concentration of o 2

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.450
and the concentration
of n 2 o 2.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.150
So we're writing out just that
last out there with the 2,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.430
because two molecules of
n o 2 are being formed.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.050
But we're not done with this, we
can't use this, because it

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.460
has an intermediate
term in there.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.610
And if we're going to write the
rate of a reaction, the

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.500
rate of product formation, we
can't have any intermediates

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.910
in our equation.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.790
We need to solve it in terms
of products and reactants.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:55.850
So, we need to solve
for n 2 o 2.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:03.110
So we need to solve for the
concentration of n 2 o 2, and

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.040
substitute that into
our equation.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.460
So we need to solve
for it in terms of

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.690
products and reactants.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.410
So, we need to think about how
this intermediate is formed,

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.470
and we need to think about
how the intermediate is

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.810
decomposed, and we need to
think about how this

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.990
intermediate is consumed.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:38.150
So, the net formation of n 2 o
2 is going to be equal to the

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:43.280
rate at which it's formed.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.830
So the rate at which
it's formed.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.640
What step is it formed in, the
intermediate formed in?

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.230
It's in step one in the forward
direction, so the rate

00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:04.020
at which its formed is k
1 times n o squared.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.000
So that's the forward rate
of the first step.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.410
Then we need to think about
the rate at which its

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.660
decomposed.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.830
What step does the intermediate
decompose in?

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.780
Right, the reverse of
the first step.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:32.140
So we're going to put a minus
sign here, and k minus 1 times

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.860
the concentration of
the intermediate.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.490
And then we also want to
think about the rate

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:45.200
at which it's consumed.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.310
And it's consumed in the second
step, so that's k 2

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:56.130
times the concentration of the
intermediate times the

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:01.010
concentration of o 2.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.890
So that's the net formation.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.000
And now we can use something
called the steady state

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.370
approximation, and the steady
state approximation is used in

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.350
all sorts of kinetics, including
enzyme kinetics, and

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.140
it can be phrased two different
ways, which are

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.130
equivalent.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.840
You can say that the steady
state approximation is that

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.030
the net formation of the
intermediate equals zero --

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.190
i.e. this is the net formation
of the intermediate, so this

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.850
entire equation equals zero.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.770
Another way to say it is that
the rate of formation of the

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.590
intermediate equals
the rate of decay.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.600
So that's saying the same thing,
that this term is going

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.930
to be equal to those
two terms. That's

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.480
saying the same thing.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.550
So, if we can set this whole
equation equal to zero, then

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.610
we can solve for the
concentrations of the

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.240
intermediates in terms of the
rate constants and the

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.740
concentrations of the reactants
and the products,

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.520
which is what we need to do.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.280
So, let's do that.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.200
So we can rearrange this
expression now that we have

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:26.800
set equal to zero, and so we can
bring n 2 o 2 over to one

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.010
side, so we have our
intermediate on one side.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:40.620
And then we are going to have k
minus 1, and our little k 2

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.080
times the concentration
of o 2.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.730
And so, that is the rate in
which the intermediate is

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.770
decomposed and consumed, and
that's going to be equal to

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.470
the rate at which it's formed,
which is another way of

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.310
expressing the steady
state approximation.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.070
So we've just moved the
decomposed and consumed to one

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.280
side, and we have the rate at
which it's formed on the other

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.970
side, and now we can easily
solve for the concentration of

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:19.920
the n 2 o 2, so we're going
to do that over here.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:26.360
So that's now going to be equal
to our k 1 times n o

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:42.790
squared over k minus 1
plus k 2 times the

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.020
concentration of o 2.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.760
So now we've just solved for n
2 o 2, our intermediate, in

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.250
terms of our rate constants and
in terms of our reactants.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.560
So that's good.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.890
Now we need to take this and
substitute it back into here.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:08.780
And if we substitute it back
into here, let's do that over

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:14.900
here, so now we'll have
k, 2 times k 2, we'll

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.760
also have a k 1 term.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.830
We're going to have, we
have n o squared.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:29.190
We also have an o 2 term from
over here, and this is all

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:43.200
going to be over k minus
1 plus k 2 times our

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.970
concentration of o 2.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.500
So we've just substituted that
term in here, and now we have

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:56.490
a new expression for the rate of
our product formation, and

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.830
that's lovely.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.860
Except that it doesn't agree
with the experiment.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.240
So we have a problem.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.150
In the experiment, there's n o
squared and o 2, but there is

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.170
no o 2 in the bottom, so
something is going on.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.640
So that means that our reaction
as written, which

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.980
didn't have any fast steps or
any slow steps is inconsistent

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.700
if you write a mechanism for
this, if you write a rate law

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.560
for this, it's inconsistent
with the experiment.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.460
So we need to do more to
our proposed mechanism.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.370
We need to add fast steps and
slow steps until we can write

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.280
a mechanism that agrees
with the experiment.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.200
And so, if we want to do this,
we're going to assume, now we

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.980
can try that the first
step is fast and the

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.270
second step is slow.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.890
So let's talk about this slow
step and what happens if you

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.780
have a slow step.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.670
So I'm going to introduce this
term of rate determining step.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.720
So the slowest step in an
elementary reaction is going

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.500
to determine the overall rate.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.420
If it's slow compared
to the other steps.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.490
And so, the overall rate, it
can't be any faster than that

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.100
slow step, and that slow step
is going to govern how fast

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.520
the overall reaction is.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.550
All right, so let me give
you an example of this.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.570
I know they're you're all
very anxious to complete

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.330
problem-set 10, the last
problem-set that will be

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.740
graded in this course.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.960
And you know, because I told you
at the beginning of class,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.100
that after today's lecture, you
will know all the material

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.200
that will allow you to complete
that problem-set.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.900
So some of you are going to get
really antsy at the end of

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.830
class thinking OK, I can go
and do that problem-set.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.080
So, you're going to be ready,
you may have already started

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.490
packing up your backpack as the
class is winding down, you

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.580
see we're getting close to the
end of the handouts saying,

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.530
all right, I've got to get out
of here, I've got to get to

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.750
the library and finish the
rest of problem-set 10.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.220
All right, so let's say it takes
you five seconds to pack

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.680
up and be out the door.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.220
Or maybe there's some people
coming in, OK, maybe ten

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.550
seconds to get out the door.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.610
Then you're running down toward
the library and you're

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.850
moving pretty fast, you're
jumping over people that are

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.510
stopping and talking to their
friends, you're moving very

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.850
quickly, you might slide down
the banisters to get to the

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.400
first floor, and you get
to the library, but

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.420
you were too slow.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.280
Even though you did it really
fast, all the tables are busy,

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.620
everyone else is completing
problem-set 10.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.040
So you go up and down, you're
looking for a table, there's

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.090
no tables, they're all busy,
everyone has their chemistry

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.850
textbooks out and
they're going.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.960
All right.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.130
So, then you have to leave the
library, you go to building 2,

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.340
that's close by, they're
classrooms, they're not in

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.040
use, the first couple
you check there's

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.210
recitations going on.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.910
Finally you find the
one that's empty.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.870
When you find it that's empty,
your backpack is off, your

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.280
books are out, your
calculator's

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.600
out and you're going.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.700
Right, maybe another
ten seconds.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.360
But it took you about
20 minutes to

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.370
find that free table.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:05.380
So, maybe ten seconds to get
out of this classroom, ten

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.590
seconds to get your books out of
your backpack, but then 20

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.150
minutes overall to find
that free table.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.030
So that's the rate determining
step, that 20 minutes to find

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.020
that table is going
to control the

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.080
overall rate of the reaction.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.100
And so, many of you have
probably experienced rate

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.020
determining steps in your life,
some of you may have

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:31.130
friends that are always your
rate determining step, and so

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.270
you know about this.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.850
You know about this.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:39.740
And so rate determining steps
allow us to come up with

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.040
different kinds of mechanisms
and simplify different

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.010
expressions.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.840
All right, so let's look at what
this does for us here.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.970
If we make assumptions now about
a step being fast and a

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.900
step being slow.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.130
All right, so we're going to be
able to -- this expression

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.210
here, we're going to be
able to simplify.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:08.550
All right, so we're going to ask
the question then, here,

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.330
we're assuming that we're going
to say, all right, let's

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.410
just say the first step
is fast and the

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.610
second step is slow.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.730
We're going to see whether that
gives us an answer that's

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.270
consistent with the
experimentally

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.760
determined rate law.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.860
So here, if we say this is
fast and this is slow,

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.850
basically we're asking the
question, is the decomposition

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.370
of the intermediate or it's
consumption faster?

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:40.560
So as we wrote this, then, we're
saying decomposition is

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.820
fast. The first step is fast
and reversible, so the

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.820
decomposition is fast. The
second step is slow, the

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.810
consumption of that intermediate
is slow.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:56.470
So that allows us to
change our rate.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.580
So, what we're then saying in
terms of the here's the words,

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.860
here's sort of the equations,
we're saying that this term

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.100
here, this k minus 1 times the
intermediate term, is a lot

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.460
bigger, because this is
faster than this.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.990
This is slow, the rate of
consumption is slow.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.320
So k minus 1 is going to
be a bigger number

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.600
than k 2 times o 2.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.920
So, if we say that, if we say
this is fast, that's a big

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.070
number, this is a fast step,
k 2 is a small number, it's

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:33.370
slow, if this is a lot smaller
than k minus 1, and these are

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.870
both appearing in the bottom
of the equation here, that

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.360
allows you to get rid
of this term.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.460
So if you have something really
big and something

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.930
pretty small, on the bottom of
this equation, the really

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.250
small thing is kind
of insignificant.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.510
And so we can get rid
of that here.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:55.980
So we can get rid
of this term.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.240
So that allows us to simplify
this expression.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:06.650
Now we have k 1 times n o
squared over k minus 1.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.570
We can also rearrange that and
bring our concentration terms

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.930
on one side, so we have our
intermediate over our n o

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.100
squared and have that now is
going to be equal to k 1

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.660
over k minus 1.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.670
What is little rate constant
k 1 over rate

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:30.430
constant k minus 1?

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.710
Big k, right.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.260
So that's another way of
saying the equilibrium

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.800
expression.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.600
So it's the equilibrium constant
for the first step is

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.890
equal to k 1 over k minus 1.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.780
So basically what we're saying
then, if we have the first

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.870
step being fast and reversible,
and the second

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.400
step being slow, we're saying
that the first step is really

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.330
an equilibrium.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:59.430
So what allows us to say that?

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.100
Well, if you have a fast
reversible step followed by a

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.220
slow step, that means that not
much of your intermediate is

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.990
being siphoned off by the second
step, allowing you to

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.630
reach equilibrium.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.920
So you can think about that in
terms of this plot here.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.970
If you have reactants going to
intermediate, and this is fast

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.650
and reversible, so they're going
back and forth, fast,

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:27.020
reversible, and very little of
that intermediate is getting

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.410
siphoned off, this
is very slow.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.390
So very, very little
of this is being

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.260
siphoned off to products.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.250
So that allows that first step
to really reach equilibrium

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:41.070
conditions, because this doesn't
really factor in, and

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.300
so you reach an equilibrium
here.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:50.020
And that allows you to simplify
your expressions.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:54.060
So now, we can go back with our
simplified expression, and

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.360
we can express it as rate
constant k 1 over rate

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.710
constant k minus 1 times n o
squared, or we can write it as

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:05.890
the equilibrium constant 1 times
n o squared, and we can

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:10.210
plug that in solving for
our intermediate.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:16.090
And so, if we put that now back
into this expression, we

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:22.890
have the 2 k 1, k 2, we have our
oxygen concentration and

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:28.140
our n o squared over k minus 1,
or we can have equilibrium

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.620
constant 1 with our
k 2 in our 2.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.810
And now, we're consistent.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:39.330
If we realize that the k
observed that was given in the

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.890
experimental rate law is a
combination of all of our k

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.420
terms. So it's a combination,
you can't, at least in this

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.450
experiment, you weren't able to
come up with the individual

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.930
rate constants, they just came
up with overall observed rate,

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.650
and so that's all of
our terms in there.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.260
And so if we put that in here,
we realize that this is

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.880
consistent with the
experiment.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.280
And in doing these problems,
it's OK to leave your little

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.340
rate constants, it's OK to use
equilibrium constants in

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:15.190
there, you should show all of
your work, so that if you have

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.960
a k obs in your final answer, we
can look back and see what

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.410
that was equal to.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.630
So it's hard not to show all
your work as you're writing

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.690
through all of these on a test,
but you can end your

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.680
answer, it would be correct
end your answer

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.200
here or here or here.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.150
So I don't care which k is
in your final answer, but

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.380
definitely show all your work.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.350
So that agrees with
the experiment.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.340
All right, so let's look
at another example now.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.780
And now we have, again, a 2-step
reaction, and the first

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.540
step is fast and reversible, and
the second step is slow.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:58.890
So, with those predictions of
the mechanism, let's just go

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.920
right through and try to solve
for the rate here without

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.820
going through all of the steps
we did the first time and see

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.360
if we can do this more
efficiently.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.380
And again, this is a reaction
with ozone, and depletion of

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.520
ozone is a major problem that
will be facing us, that has

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.190
faced us, and will continue
to face us in the future.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.180
All right.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.030
So lets first think about the
rates of the individual steps.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.700
So the rate of the forward
reaction here

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.190
is going to be what?

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.570
Just yell it out.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:43.610
Yup, k 1 times the concentration
of o 3.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:49.690
What about for the
reverse step?

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:53.040
Yup, it's like clear and then
it gets mumbly. k minus 1

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.800
times the concentration of o 2
times this concentration of o,

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.810
which is an intermediate.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.610
All right, so let's look at
the second step here.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:06.770
So the rate here is going to be
k 2 times this intermediate

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.620
-- concentration of this
intermediate, o times the

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.620
concentration of o 3.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.430
All right, so now we know that
this second step is going to

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.390
be controlling the rate, it's
a slow step, at least that's

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:25.070
our prediction that we're
going to write a rate

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.870
expression based on.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.950
And so, that's going to be
our slow step, our rate

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.010
determining step.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:36.990
And again, we're forming two
molecules of o 2 in this step.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.810
So we can have a two in there.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:44.350
And that the rate of formation
of o 2 in this last step, 2

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:49.450
times k 2 times our intermediate
o times o 3.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.000
Are we done?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.080
Was it that easy?

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.260
Are we done?

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.390
No.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:01.630
Why isn't this finished?

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.440
There's an intermediate.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.690
Intermediates will not be your
friend in doing these

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:06.280
problems.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.060
Yes, we have an intermediate
so we're not complete.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.640
We need to solve for o in terms
of products, reactants,

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.040
and rate constants.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.550
So we're not done.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.210
So we need to get rid
of the intermediate.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:25.240
But now, we can do that more
simply because we've set this

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.660
up that we have a fast
reversible step

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.430
followed by a slow step.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.590
So we can solve for the
concentration of that

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.780
intermediate in terms of
equilibrium expressions.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:41.000
So, if you haven't learned how
to write an equilibrium

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.830
expression yet, remember you
need it for the unit on

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:48.550
chemical equilibrium, the unit
of acid base, the unit of

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.890
oxidation reduction, and here
you need it again in kinetics,

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:57.980
so definitely want to be able to
write those for the final.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.540
So we can go ahead
and write those.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.930
So, for the first step, again,
it's products over reactants.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:09.030
You can also express that in
terms of rate constant k 1

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:13.300
over rate constant k minus 1,
and that's all equal to our

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.000
big k, our equilibrium
constant, k 1.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.210
And so now we can solve in terms
of o, our intermediate,

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:26.400
and so here, we pull that out,
here we've solved for it in

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.930
terms of k 1 times o 3 over k
minus 1 times o 2, so we just

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:34.570
brought those to
the other side.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.960
You could have also used the
equilibrium constant here

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.360
instead of the rate constants,
either one is OK.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.970
So, now we've solved for it
here, and we can put it down

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.630
into this expression here.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:49.860
So we are going back
to our overall

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.860
expression that we wrote.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:56.150
So the expression that we wrote
based on this was 2, k 2

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.790
times the concentration of our
intermediate, times the

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.730
concentration of o 3.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.800
Now we substitute in for the
intermediate, so we have 2

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:11.280
times k 2, k 1, we have o 3 and
an o 3, so that squared,

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:17.590
over k minus 1 times o 2.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.690
And this can also be expressed
in terms of k observed,

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:27.800
putting those terms together,
o 3 squared over o 2.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.850
And that would be the answer to
what the rate is for that

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:35.090
particular proposed mechanism.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:39.320
So, let's think about if that's
true, what we should

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.740
expect if we do some
experiments, what we should

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.950
expect about the order of the
reactions, and what would

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.960
happen if you double
concentrations of things and

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.560
look for the effect.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.170
So if you're going to
test this proposal,

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.860
what would we get?

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.960
So, what is the overall order
of this rate law here.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.720
Oh, sorry, the order first
let's do of o 3.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.370
2.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:11.030
So if we double the
concentration of o 3, what

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:16.990
would you expect to see
in terms of the rate?

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:18.960
It will what?

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.440
Yup, quadruple.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:29.895
What is the overall order of o
2, or order of o 2, and that

00:33:29.895 --> 00:33:33.260
is a clicker question,
actually.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:39.750
So you know what some
people think.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.495
And not only tell me the order,
but tell me the effect

00:33:42.495 --> 00:34:29.610
of doubling.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:45.280
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:57.290
Very good.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.540
All right, so the overall minus
1, that's what it means

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.100
if it's on the bottom of
that equation there.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:08.210
And so if we double it
then it should half.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:13.960
So overall then, what is the
order of the reaction?

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.930
It's 1.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:20.280
And so, remember you can sum up
the order of the individual

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.700
ones to get the overall order,
so the overall order is 1.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.850
And what about if you double
both things, what's going to

00:35:29.850 --> 00:36:02.320
happen to the rate?

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:19.140
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.130
OK, people are doing
quite well on this.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:29.600
All right, so you double
both and you double.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.340
So, everyone's in very good
shape on these types of

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.350
problems, which is excellent
because this is worth

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.340
a lot on the final.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:42.720
All right, so let's do a final
example, and in this case

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.200
we're given an experimental rate
law, which is up here, k

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.090
observed times the concentration
of n o and the

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:56.210
concentration of b r 2, and we
want to figure out from this,

00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:00.100
we'll look at if we have one
step is being fast and the

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:04.800
other step is being fast, and
see which would be consistent

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.860
with this experimentally
determined rate law.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.890
So these are some of the types
of problems you have, your

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.790
given experimental rate law and
say tell me which step has

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:17.030
to be fast and which has to be
slow to have a rate that's

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.270
consistent with the
observed rate.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.120
So, in this reaction we
have 2 n o plus b r 2

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.550
going 2 n o b r.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.550
So if we write this in the first
step, we have n o plus b

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:35.210
r 2 going to an intermediate,
n o b r 2 with forward rate

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:39.020
constant, k 1, and reverse
rate constant, k minus 1.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:42.180
And in the second step we have
the intermediate interacting

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.790
with another molecule of n o
forming two molecules of n o b

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.620
r, our product.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.540
So let's consider what the rate
of the forward reaction

00:37:52.540 --> 00:38:00.520
is here, and so that would be
-- you can yell it out. k 1

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.120
times -- yes, excellent.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.020
And for the reverse reaction
then we're going to have our k

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:14.980
minus 1 times our intermediate
concentration.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.250
Now we can look at step 2 where
our intermediate is

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:26.120
being consumed, and the rate
would equal then k 2 times the

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.250
concentration of the
intermediate, n o b r 2 times

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:33.300
the concentration of n o.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.580
All right, so we know nothing
now about fast or slow steps,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:41.540
so we can write the formation
of our product just in terms

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.280
of this second step.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.250
And again, there are two
molecules being formed, so we

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:53.230
have a 2, and 2 times this rate
for this second step, k 2

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.020
times intermediate times n o.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.980
So again, now we have an
intermediate that we have to

00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.640
get rid of.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.610
We can't have an intermediate
in our final expression.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:05.430
But we can't use the equilibrium
constant right now

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.380
because we don't know anything
about what are the fast or the

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.420
slow steps.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.840
So we're going to write it the
long way with no assumption

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:16.300
about fast or slow steps.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:20.660
So to do this, so we have our
intermediate, and so we're

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:24.610
going to solve for it in terms
of products and reactants.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.140
So we're going to write about
the change in the

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.740
concentration of that
intermediate.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.610
So, the intermediate's being
formed in the first step.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.810
So we first write the rate at
which it's being formed.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:43.860
So it's being formed here, so
that's k 1 times n o times the

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:49.150
concentration of b r 2, so this
is how it's being formed.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.690
And then we're going to consider
how it's being

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.150
decomposed, and you told me
before it gets decomposed in

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.800
the reverse of the first step.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.400
So we have a minus sign, because
this is a negative

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:06.180
change in concentration, it's
being decomposed, and it's

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:10.750
being decomposed with a rate
constant of k minus 1 times

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.570
the concentration of
that intermediate.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:17.120
And the intermediate's also
being consumed, so that's

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.630
decreasing the concentration of
the intermediate, and it's

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.480
being consumed in this
second step.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:28.000
So it's being consumed here with
the rate constant of k 2

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.320
times the intermediate
times n o.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.570
So that second step.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.550
So this is how we write it if
we don't know anything about

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.940
the rate at which -- what's slow
and what's fast. So this

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.550
will always, always work to
write things this way.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.900
So that's the overall change
in the concentration of the

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.130
intermediate, how it's
being formed,

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.440
decomposed, and consumed.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.100
Now we can use the steady state
approximation, and you

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.570
can always use the steady state
approximation in these

00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:00.570
problems, and that says that
this net change is going to be

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.750
equal to zero.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.560
So the steady state
approximation, then, let's you

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.030
set this entire term
equal to zero.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.670
And sometimes, a question you
might get is to say what the

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:15.450
steady state approximation is.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.110
So you should be able to
articulate that in words as

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.990
well as use it on a problem.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.650
So now we can set this all
equal to zero, and we can

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:27.260
solve for our concentration
of our intermediate.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.830
So, rearranging this then,
bringing our intermediate

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.420
terms on one side of the
expression, and again, here's

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.300
the rate at which it's
decomposed and consumed being

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.940
equal to the rate at which
it's being formed.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.530
And we can pull out our
intermediate, so then that's

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:48.090
times k minus 1, k 2 times n
o, and that's equal to the

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.040
rate at which it's
being formed.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.370
And so now we can take that,
divide by that term, and we

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.340
get an expression for the
concentration of the

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.720
intermediate in terms
of our reactants

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.650
and our rate constants.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:06.380
So now we need to plug that
back in to the original

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.260
equation that we had.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.540
So this is what we solved for,
and now we can put it into

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.690
here, and if you rearrange that,
we have the 2, we have

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:21.470
the k 1, we have the k 2, we
have an n o here, we have an n

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:26.130
o there, so it's squared, b r 2
here, and then on the bottom

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:31.700
we have k minus 1 plus
k 2 times n o.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.770
OK, so that's great, but that's
not consistent with the

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:39.410
experimentally determined rate
law, so something has to be

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.770
fast and something
has to be slow.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.590
So let's first consider if the
first step is slow and the

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:51.540
second step is fast, which would
mean that the second

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.970
step is bigger, it's faster,
that's k 2 times n o would be

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.710
bigger than k minus 1.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:02.430
So the second step then is
fast, faster than this.

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:05.200
So now why don't you go ahead
and tell me how this

00:43:05.200 --> 00:44:01.530
simplifies if that is true.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:17.160
All right, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.060
Yup.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:23.350
All right, let's look at why.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:26.790
All right, so that's the answer
and let's consider why.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:30.310
So that means if this is much
bigger than this term, that

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.380
cancels out.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:37.170
If that cancels out, what else
cancels? k 2 also cancels, and

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:41.380
what else cancels? one n o
cancels giving you this

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.390
expression.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.690
And that is consistent with
the answer up there.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.200
So you could also see that
as the k observed.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.570
So that's consistent.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.320
And let's just quick
-- oh, first tell

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.130
me the overall order.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.970
2.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:58.950
And now let's just look at what
would have been true if

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.060
we had done it the
other way around.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.560
So if we did it the other way
around, we'd say that the

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.630
first step is fast so that's
a lot bigger than this.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:09.610
If this is a lot bigger than
that, we'd cancel out this

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.050
second term here.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:13.200
Can anything else cancel?

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.110
No.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:18.640
So, we're left with this
expression, and that is not

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.810
consistent with this up
here, because we have

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.360
this squared term.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.250
So even if you write it as
k observed, that's not

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.500
consistent.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:33.770
And so, the overall order for
this would have been 3, which

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.570
is not consistent with
the experiment.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.970
All right, so now you know
everything you need to know to

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:43.970
finish problem-set 10.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:47.170
Don't let anything be your
rate determining step.

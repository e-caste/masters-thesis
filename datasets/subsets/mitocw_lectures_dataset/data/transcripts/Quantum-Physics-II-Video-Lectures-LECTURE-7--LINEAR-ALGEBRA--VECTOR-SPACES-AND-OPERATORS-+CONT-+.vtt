00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.357
PROFESSOR: OK, so
let's get started.

00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:28.940
I just wanted to
make one announcement

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.340
before we start the lecture.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.130
So Prof.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.320
Zwiebach is a way again today,
which is why I'm lecturing.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.290
And his office hours he's
obviously not going to have,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.350
but Prof.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.030
Harrow has kindly agreed
to take them over.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.235
So today I'll have office hours
four to five, and then Prof.

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:52.850
Harrow will have office
hours afterwards five to six.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.960
So feel free to
come and talk to us.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.410
So today we're going to
try and cover a few things.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.770
So we're going to spend a
little bit of time talking about

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:10.760
eigenvalues and vectors,
which we've-- finishing this

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.230
discussion from last time.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.110
Then we'll talk about inner
products and inner product

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.150
spaces.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.360
And then we'll
talk about-- we'll

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:35.340
introduce Dirac's
notation, some of which

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.360
we've already been using.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.480
And then, depending
on time, we'll

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.795
also talk a little bit more
about linear operators.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.200
OK?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.470
So let's start with
where we were last time.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.120
So we were talking about
T-invariant subspaces.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:18.230
So we had U is a
T-invariant subspace

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.190
if the following is satisfied.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:30.180
If T of U is equal to--
if this thing, which

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.860
is all vectors that are
generated by T from vectors

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.020
that live in U. So if
T is inside U itself.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.139
OK?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:59.170
And we can define this in
general for any U. However,

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.770
one class of these invariant
subspaces are very useful.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.815
So if we take U to
be one dimensional.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:27.770
OK/ and so that really means
that U I can write as some

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.000
whatever field I'm defining
my vector space over.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.180
Every element of this subspace
U is just some scalar multiple

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.890
of a single vector U. So this
is a one dimensional thing.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:51.730
Now if we have a T-invariant
subspace of this one--

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.310
if this is going to be
a T-invariant objective,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.716
then we get a very
simple equation

00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:01.720
that you've seen before.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.910
So we're taking all vectors
in U acting on them with T,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.500
and if it stays
within U, then it

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500
has to be able to be
written like this.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.550
So we have some operator
acting on our vector space

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.000
producing something in
the same vector space,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.310
just rescaling it.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.520
OK?

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.670
For sum lambda, which
we haven't specified.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.020
And you've seen
this equation before

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.860
in terms of matrices
and vectors, right?

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.920
This is an eigenvalue equation.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:48.085
So these are eigenvalues
and these are eigenvectors.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.060
But now they're just
an abstract version

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.300
of what you've discussed before.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.420
And we'll come back
to this in a moment.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.370
One thing that we just
defined at the end

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.470
is the spectrum of an operator.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.482
The spectrum of T is
equal to all eigenvalues

00:05:18.482 --> 00:05:19.190
of that operator.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.350
And so later on
these will become--

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.690
this object will
become important.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.250
Let's just concentrate on this
and ask what does it mean.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:54.722
So if we have lambda
being an eigenvalues,

00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:55.680
what does that tell us?

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.160
What does this equation tell us?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:07.250
Well, it tells us that
on U. So all I'm doing

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.050
is taking this term over to
the other side of the equation

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.370
and inserting the
identity operator I.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.540
So this is in itself
an operator now, right?

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:40.650
And so this tells us also that
this operator, because it maps

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.170
something that's non-zero
to the null vector, this

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:55.810
is not injective, OK?

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:04.110
And you can even write the
null space of T-- of T minus I

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:14.600
lambda is equal to
all eigenvectors

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.400
with eigenvalue lambda.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.710
OK?

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.440
So every eigenvector
with eigenvalue lambda,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.250
T acting on it is just going
to give me lambda times

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.820
the eigenvector again,
and so this will vanish.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.430
So for all eigenvectors
with that eigenvalue.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:48.790
And we've previously seen that,
if something is not injective,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:55.980
it's also not invertible, right?

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:13.125
So this lets us write
something quite nice down.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.000
So there's a theorem.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.050
Let me write it out.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:27.160
So if we let T is in the space
of linear operators acting

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:33.309
on this vector
space v, and we have

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:41.409
a set of eigenvalues, lambda
1, lambda 2, lambda n,

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:54.970
distinct eigenvalues,
eigenvalues of T,

00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:06.580
and the corresponding
eigenvectors, which

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:14.080
we will call U. OK, so the
sum set U1, U2, up to Un

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.600
with the correspondence
by their label.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:30.740
So then we know that
this list is actually

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.770
a linearly independent set.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.500
So we can prove this
one very quickly.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.330
So let's do that.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.660
So let's assume it's false.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.300
So the proof is y contradiction,
so assume it's false.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.130
And what does that mean?

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.900
Well, that means that there
is a non-trivial relation.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:27.180
I could write down some relation
C1U1 plus C2U2 plus CkUk

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.162
equals 0 without
all the C's being 0.

00:10:32.162 --> 00:10:33.620
And what we'll do
is we'll actually

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.920
say OK, let's do let--
so we'll let there

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:46.280
be a k, a value of k that's
less than or equal to n, such

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:53.630
that this holds for
Ci not equal to 0.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.590
So we're postulating that
there is some linear dependence

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.856
on some of these things.

00:11:00.856 --> 00:11:07.570
So what we can do is
then act on this vector

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:16.140
here with T minus lambda k times
the identity acting on this.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.992
So this is C1U1 plus
dot dot dot plus CkUk.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.030
OK?

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.050
And what do we get here?

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.700
So we're going to get, if
act on this piece of it,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.660
this is an eigenvector,
so T acting on this one

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.080
would just give us
lambda 1, right?

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.860
And so we're going to get
products of lambda 1 minus

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.850
lambda k for this
piece, et cetera.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:55.695
So this will give us C1 lambda
1 minus lambda k U1 plus dot dot

00:11:55.695 --> 00:12:05.310
dot up to the Ck minus
1 lambda k minus 1

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:10.500
minus lambda k Uk minus 1.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.400
And then when we act
on this one here,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.300
so this one has an eigenvalue--
the eigenvalue corresponding

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.690
to the eigenvector is lambda k,
so that last term gets killed.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.355
So we get plus 0 lots of Uk.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.120
And we know this is still 0.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.950
And now we've
established, in fact,

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.030
these things here
are just numbers.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.270
All of these things.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.570
So we've actually
written down a relation

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:49.444
that involves less than k.

00:12:49.444 --> 00:12:50.860
Actually, I should
have said this.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.030
Let there be a least k
less than or equal to,

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.910
and such that we have
linear dependence.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.640
But what we've just shown
is that, in fact, there's

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.240
a smaller space that's also
linear independent, right?

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:15.780
So we've contradicted what
we assumed to start with.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.470
And you can just repeat
this procedure, OK?

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.765
And so this is a contradiction.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:32.300
And so, in fact, there must
be no non-trivial relation

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.280
even for k equals n
between these vectors, OK?

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.960
Another brief
theorem that we won't

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:56.480
prove, although we'll sort of
see why it works in a moment,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:08.120
is, again, for T in linear
operators on v with v

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:15.140
being a finite dimensional
complex vector space.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.360
OK?

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.850
There is at least
one eigenvalue.

00:14:33.515 --> 00:14:43.670
So I guess for this-- so T
has at least one eigenvalue.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.600
Now remember, in
the last lecture,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.390
we looked at a matrix,
two by two matrix, that

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.780
was rotations in the
xy-plane and found

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.910
there were, in fact,
no eigenvalues.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.780
But that's because we were
looking at a real vector space.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:11.570
So we were looking at
rotations of the real plane.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.650
So this is something
that you can prove.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.560
We will see why it's true,
but we won't prove it.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.580
And so one way of saying
this is to go to a basis.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.235
And so everything we've said
so far about eigenvalues

00:15:27.235 --> 00:15:30.590
and eigenvectors has
not been referring

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.720
to any particular basis.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.495
And in fact, eigenvalues
are basis independent.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.660
But we can use a basis.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.220
And then we have matrix
representations of operators

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.030
that we've talked about.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.900
And sort of this
operator equation,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:56.250
or the operator statement
that T minus lambda

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:10.030
I-- so as operator statement
T minus lambda I U equals 0

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:17.757
is equivalent to saying that--
well, we've said it here.

00:16:17.757 --> 00:16:19.340
We said that it's
equivalent to saying

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.740
that it's not invertible.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.110
This operator is not invertible.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.330
But that's also
equivalent to saying

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.285
that the matrix representation
of it in any basis

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:35.035
is not invertible.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.170
And by here we just mean
inverses as in the inverses

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.380
that you've taken the many
matrices in your lives.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:15.550
And so what that means then,
if-- I'm sure you remember.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.329
If a matrix is not
invertible, that

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.619
means it has a
vanishing determinant.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:24.069
So it has debt of this.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.849
Now you can think
of this as a matrix.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.460
This determinant has to be 0.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.120
And remembering we can
write this thing out.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.250
And so it has lambdas
on the diagonal,

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.510
and then whatever entries
T has wherever it wants.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.150
This just gives us a
polynomial in lambda, right?

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:48.090
So this gives us some f of
lambda, which is a polynomial.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.800
And if you remember,
this is called

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.370
the characteristic polynomial.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.995
Characteristic.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.350
Right?

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:11.410
And so we can write it, if we
want, as just some f of lambda

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:15.050
is equal to just,
in this case, it's

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.565
going to be just lambda
minus some lambda 1.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.030
I have to be able to
write it like this.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:33.650
I can just break it
up into these terms

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:40.830
here, where the lambda I's,
the 0's of this polynomial

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.115
are, in general, complex
and can be repeated.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.362
Now what can happen is that
you have, in the worst case --

00:18:57.362 --> 00:18:59.570
I don't know if it's the
worst case, but in one case,

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.330
you could have all of
the singularities--

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.200
all of the the 0's
being at the same place.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.230
And you could have a eigenvalue
that is in full degenerate

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.841
here.

00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:13.340
Right?

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.780
So if we, say, have
lambda 1 occurring twice

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.690
in this sequence, then we set
out to a degenerate eigenvalue.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.420
And in principle, you could
have just a single eigenvalue

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.170
that's in full degenerate.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.040
But you can always write this.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.040
There has to be one
lambda there at least,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.820
one lambda I there at least.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.220
And so you can see why
this is true, right?

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.395
Now if you're in a
real vector space,

00:19:43.395 --> 00:19:47.230
you don't get to say that,
because this polynomial may

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.630
only have complex
roots, and they're not

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.440
part of the space
you're talking about.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:53.940
OK?

00:19:57.232 --> 00:19:59.440
So it can be repeated, and
this is called degeneracy.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.717
OK, so are there any questions?

00:20:09.717 --> 00:20:10.800
AUDIENCE: Can you turn it?

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.871
It should be lambda
I minus T, just so

00:20:13.871 --> 00:20:15.650
that it matches the next line.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.932
PROFESSOR: Thank you, OK.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.870
Thank you.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.762
I could have flipped the sign
on the next line as well.

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:30.720
So any other questions?

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:34.940
No?

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:40.710
OK, so let's move on and we
can talk about inner products.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.750
And so first, what
is an inner product?

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:57.170
So an inner product is a map,
but it's a very specific map.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:16.210
So an inner product
on a vector space V

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:33.110
is a map from V cross
V to the field, F.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.590
And that's really
what it's going to be.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.740
Now who has seen an
inner product somewhere?

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.647
OK, what do we call it?

00:21:43.647 --> 00:21:44.701
AUDIENCE: Dot product.

00:21:44.701 --> 00:21:45.950
PROFESSOR: Dot product, right.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.110
So we can learn a
lot from thinking

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:53.820
about this simple case, so
the motivation for thinking

00:21:53.820 --> 00:22:00.170
about this is really
the dot product.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:05.880
So we have a vector space Rn.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.510
OK?

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:15.050
And on that vector space, we
might have two vectors, a,

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.260
which I'm going to write as a1.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.010
a2 dot dot dot.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.900
a2 dot dot dot. an, and b.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.990
So we have two vectors, and
these are in vector space V.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:36.999
Then we can define
the dot product, which

00:22:36.999 --> 00:22:38.790
is an example of one
of these in a product.

00:22:41.766 --> 00:22:45.200
So a dot b.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.120
We can even put little
vectors over these.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.030
And so our definitions that
we've used for many years

00:22:53.030 --> 00:23:04.020
is that this is a1 b1 plus
a2 b2 plus dot dot dot an bn.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.230
And you see that this
does what we want it.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.560
So it takes two vectors which
live in our vector space.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.650
And from that, you
get a number, right?

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:17.370
So this lives in R.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.300
So this is a nice
example in a product.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.700
And we can look at what
properties it gives us.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.110
So what do we know
about this dot product?

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:45.890
Well, we know some properties
that it has is that a dot b.

00:23:50.425 --> 00:23:52.800
So it doesn't care which order
you give the arguments in,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.299
all right?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.350
Also, if I take
the same vector, I

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:07.650
know that this is got to be
greater than or equal to 0,

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:08.250
right?

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.560
Because this is going
to be our length.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.910
And the only case where it's
0 is when the vector is 0.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:38.910
Well we can write this.
a dotted in to, say,

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:45.440
b to 1 b1 plus b to 1 b2.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.540
So this b2's are real numbers,
and these b's are vectors,

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.400
right?

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.370
So this thing we can just
write is equal to b to one

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:03.000
a dot b1 plus b to 2 a do b2.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.220
And make them
vectors everywhere.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.614
OK, so we've got
three nice properties.

00:25:12.614 --> 00:25:14.280
And you can write
down more if you want,

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.817
but this will be enough for us.

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:20.900
And the other thing that
we can do with this is we

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.300
can define the length
of a vector, right?

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.540
So we can say this is for
this defines a length.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:45.370
And more generally, we only call
this the norm of the vector.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:26:00.520
And that, of course, you
know is that mod a squared is

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.710
just equal to a
dot a, all right?

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.475
So this is our
definition of the norm.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:18.750
OK so this definition over
here is really by no means

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.330
unique in satisfying
these properties.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:31.960
So if I wrote down something
where, instead of just say

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:37.600
a1 b1 plus a1 b2 et cetera, I
wrote down some positive number

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.620
times a1 b1 times some
other positive number a2 b2,

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.650
et cetera, that would also
satisfy all of these properties

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.774
up here.

00:26:47.774 --> 00:26:48.565
So it's not unique.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:57.280
And so you could
consider another

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.880
the dot product,
which we would write

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:17.420
as just c1 a1 b1 plus c2 a2
b2 plus some cn an bn, where

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:23.080
the c's are just
positive real numbers.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.510
That would satisfy
all of the things

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.580
that we know about our
standard dot product.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.870
But for obvious reasons,
we don't choose to do this,

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:36.540
because it's not a
very natural definition

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.050
to put these random
positive numbers along here.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.460
But we could.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.070
And I guess one
other thing that we

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.155
have is the Schwarz inequality.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:03.700
And so this is the a dot b.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:11.420
So the absolute value of
the dot product of a dot b

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:17.090
is less than or
equal to the product

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.150
of the norms of
the vectors, right?

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.540
And so one of the
problems in the piece

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.960
is to consider this in
the more abstract sense,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.050
but this is very easy to
show for real vectors, right?

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.640
So this is all very nice.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.560
So we've talked about Rn.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.890
What we really are
going to worry about

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.460
is complex vector spaces.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.290
And so there we have
a little problem.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.580
And the problem
comes in defining

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.220
what we mean by a normal, right?

00:28:55.220 --> 00:29:01.570
Because if I say now that this
vector has complex components

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.530
and write this
thing here, I'm not

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.710
guaranteed that this is
a real number, right?

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.250
And so I need to be
a little bit careful.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:19.375
So let's just talk
about complex spaces.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.360
And we really want to have a
useful definition of a length.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:36.680
So let's let z be in this thing,
in interdimensional complex

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.180
space.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:44.990
So really my z is equal
to z1 z2 zn, where

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:49.850
the zI line as
being in c, right?

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.905
So how can define a
link for this object?

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.015
Well, we have to do it
sort of in two steps.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.080
So already know how
to define the length

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.450
for a complex number, right?

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.100
It's just the absolute
value, the distance

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.750
from the origin in
the complex plane.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.690
But now we need to
do this in terms

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.670
of a more complicated
vector space.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.720
And so we can really
think of this as

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:28.350
equal to the sum of the squares
of z1, of the absolute values

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.420
of these complex numbers.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:37.170
OK?

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:47.195
Which if we write it out,
looks like z1 star z1 plus.

00:30:54.456 --> 00:30:55.430
OK?

00:30:55.430 --> 00:31:02.340
And so we should now, thinking
about the inner product,

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.130
we should be thinking
that the appearance

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:09.510
of complex conjugation is
not entirely unnatural.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:13.370
So if we ask about the
length of a vector here,

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.900
then that's going to arise
from an inner product.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.510
OK?

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:21.090
This object we want to arise
from our inner product.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:29.561
So we can now define our general
in a product with the following

00:31:29.561 --> 00:31:30.060
axioms.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.475
So firstly, we want to basically
maintain the properties

00:31:38.475 --> 00:31:40.600
that we've written down
here, because we don't want

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.831
to make our dot product not
being in an inner product

00:31:43.831 --> 00:31:44.330
anymore.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:45.880
That'd be kind of silly.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.640
So let's define our inner
product in the following way.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.750
I'm going to write it
in a particular way.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:03.060
So the inner product is
going to be, again, a map.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.290
And it's going to take our
vector space, two elements

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:11.520
of the vector
space to the field.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.200
And I'm in a complex
vector space.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.030
So it's a map that I'm
going to right like

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:29.835
this that takes v cross v to c.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.730
OK?

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:39.300
And what I mean here is you put
the two elements of your vector

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.680
space in these positions
in this thing, OK?

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:49.530
And so really a b is
what I mean by this.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:54.940
Where a and b-- so let
me write it this way.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:33:03.800
So this thing is in c for a
and b are in the v, right?

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.420
So these things
dots are where I'm

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.720
going to plug-in my vectors.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.005
And so this inner product
should satisfy some axioms.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.040
And they look very much like
what we've written here.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.060
So the first one is a
slight modification.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:31.600
We want that a b is
equal not to b a,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.690
but to its complex
conjugate, OK?

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.245
And this is related to
what I was discussing here.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:48.510
But from this, we can see that
the product of a with itself

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:52.440
is always real, because it
and its complex conjugate

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.350
are the same.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.450
So we know that a a is real.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:00.180
And we're also going
to demand a definition

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.920
of this inner a
product that this

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.980
is greater than or equal to 0.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:13.170
And it's only 0 if a equals 0.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:14.820
Right?

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.230
So that's pretty much unchanged.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:22.060
And then we want the same
sort of distributivity.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:34.260
We do want to have that a
inner producted with B to 1 b

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:49.082
plus B to 2 b2 should be equal
to B to 1 a b1 plus B to 2

00:34:49.082 --> 00:34:58.213
a b2 where the [INAUDIBLE] are
just complex numbers, right?

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.270
And that's what we
need to ask of this.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:12.270
And then we can make a
sensible definitions of it

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:18.360
that will give us a
useful norm as well.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.900
Now I'll just make one remark.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:26.410
This notation here,
this is due to Dirac.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.210
And so it's very
prevalent in physics.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:40.480
You will see in most purely
mathematical literature

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:48.210
you will see this
written just like this.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.210
So let me write it as a b and
put these things in explicitly.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:04.710
And sometimes you'll even see
a combination of these written

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:09.520
like this, OK/ But they
all mean the same thing.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.730
Compared to what
we've written up here,

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.610
this seems a little asymmetric
between the two items, right?

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.510
Well firstly, these
are isometric.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.660
And then down here
we've shown something

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.840
about that we demand something
about the second argument,

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.090
but we don't demand the same
thing about the first argument.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.260
So why not?

00:36:44.062 --> 00:36:47.570
Can anyone see?

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:52.561
I guess what we would demand
is exactly the same thing

00:36:52.561 --> 00:36:53.436
the other way around.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:06.520
So we would demand
another thing that

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:18.140
would be sort of alpha
1 a plus alpha 2 a2 b

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:22.340
is equal to-- well,
something like this.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:30.595
Well, we would
actually demand this.

00:37:30.595 --> 00:37:32.675
a1 b.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.120
But I don't actually
need to demand that,

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.020
because that follows
from number one, right?

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.720
I take axiom one,
apply it to this,

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.262
and I automatically
get this thing here.

00:37:55.262 --> 00:37:56.610
OK?

00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:02.350
And notice what's
arisen is-- actually

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.540
let's just go through
that, because you really

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:08.286
do want to see these complex
conjugates appearing here,

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:09.515
because they are important.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.160
So this follows.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.630
So 1 plus 3, imply this.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.770
Let's just do this.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:25.570
So let's start with
this expression

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.050
and start with this piece.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.940
And we know that
this will then be

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:40.310
given by axiom one by b alpha
1 a 1 plus alpha 2 a2 complex

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:44.570
conjugate, all right?

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:48.200
And then by this linearity
of the second argument

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.640
we can now distribute
this piece, right?

00:38:51.640 --> 00:39:06.260
We can write this is alpha
1 b a1 plus alpha 2 b a2,

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.350
all complex conjugated.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:13.080
Which let's put
all the steps in.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.190
Is alpha 1 star
and this one star.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.640
And then, again, by the first
argument, by the first axiom,

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.810
we can flip these and get rid
of the complex conjugation.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:39.330
And that gives us this
one up here, right?

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.370
So we only need to define
this linearity, distributive

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.130
property on one
side of this thing.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:46.463
We could have chosen to define
it here and wouldn't have

00:39:46.463 --> 00:39:49.200
needed that one, but we didn't.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.685
OK, so let's look at
a couple of examples.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.520
And the first one is a
finite dimensional example.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.660
And we're going to
take v is equal to cn.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.440
And our definition
is going to be

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.960
a pretty natural
generalization of what

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.335
we've written down before.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.980
So a and b are elements of cn.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:25.200
And this is just
going to be a1 star

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:34.975
b1 plus a2 star b2
plus an star bn.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.590
Another piece of chalk.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:46.650
So the only difference from dot
product in real vector space

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.540
is that we've put this
complex conjugates here.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.785
And that you can check
satisfies all of these axioms.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.590
Another example is
actually an example

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:02.890
of an infinite
dimensional vector space.

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:15.960
Let's take v is the set
of all complex functions,

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:27.180
all f of x that are in c with x
living in some finite interval.

00:41:30.275 --> 00:41:30.775
OK?

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.760
And so a natural norm to
define on this space-- and this

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.260
is something that we
can certainly talk about

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:49.260
in recitations-- is that if
I have f and g in this vector

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:56.990
space v, then f g
I'm going to define--

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.126
this is my definition of
what the dot product is--

00:42:00.126 --> 00:42:06.961
is the integral from 0 to
l f star of x g of x dx.

00:42:09.916 --> 00:42:10.416
OK?

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.100
If you think of this as
arising from evaluating

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.330
f at a set of discrete
points where you've

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.210
got a finite dimensional
vector space,

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.390
and then letting the space
between those points go to 0,

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:30.090
this is kind of the
natural thing to arise.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.730
It's really an integral
as a limit of a sum.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.610
And over here, of course,
I could write this one

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:40.850
as just the sum over
i of ai star bi.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:44.500
i equals 1 to n.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.560
And so this is the integral
is infinite dimensional

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.320
generalization of the
sum, and so we have this.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.720
And that might be something
to talk about in recitations.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.220
OK?

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.370
So we've gone from
having just a vector

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:08.820
space to having a
vector space where we've

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:14.270
added this new operation on it,
this inner product operation.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:18.770
And that lets us do things
that we couldn't do before.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:29.825
So firstly, it lets us
talk about orthogonality.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.720
Previously we couldn't
ask any question

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.967
about two objects
within our vector space.

00:43:43.967 --> 00:43:45.925
This let's us ask a
question about two objects.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:44:07.240
So if we have the inner product
a b in some vector space V,

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:15.570
then if this is 0, we
say they're orthogonal.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:21.690
We say that the vectors
a and b are orthogonal.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.800
And I'm sure you know
what orthogonal means

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.340
in terms of Rn, but this
is just the statement

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:42.700
of what it means in a
abstract vector space.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.413
This is the definition
of orthogonality.

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:56.170
So this is one thing if
we have a set of vectors.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:16.950
e1 e2 en, such that ei ej is
equal to delta ij, chronic

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:21.280
to delta ij, this
set is orthonormal.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.810
Again, a word you've
seen many times.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:55.940
OK, so we can also define
the components of vectors

00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:00.195
now in basis dependent way.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:15.450
We're going to choose ei to be
a set of vectors in our vector

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:24.030
space V. We previously
had things that

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:35.460
form a basis, a basis
of V. And if we also

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:49.670
demand that they're
orthonormal, then we can-- well,

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:51.670
we can always decompose
any vector in V

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:53.530
in terms of its basis, right?

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.770
But if it's also
orthonormal, then we

00:46:55.770 --> 00:47:01.970
can write a, which is
a is some vector in V.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:12.460
a is equal to the sum over i
equals 1 to n of some ai ei.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.740
So we can do that for any basis.

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:20.940
But then we can take this vector
and form its inner product

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.090
with the basis vectors.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:31.350
So we can look at
what ek a is, right?

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:34.880
So we have our basis vectors
ek, and we take one of them

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.470
and we dot product it
into this vector here.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:39.700
And this is
straightforward to c.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.160
This is going to be equal to
the sum over i equals 1 to n ai.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.091
And then it's going to be the
inner product of ek with ei,

00:47:48.091 --> 00:47:48.590
right?

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:53.919
Because of this
distributive property here.

00:47:53.919 --> 00:47:56.190
OK?

00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:01.540
But we also know that, because
this is an orthonormal basis,

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:07.600
this thing here is a delta
function, delta ik, right?

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.540
And so I can, in fact,
do this sum, and I get

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.580
and this is equal to ak.

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.420
And so we've
defined what we mean

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:25.042
by a component of this
vector in this basis ei.

00:48:25.042 --> 00:48:26.625
They're defined by
this inner product.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:41.130
So we can also talk
about the norm, which

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:49.910
I think, unsurprisingly, we
are going to take the norm

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:53.160
to be, again, equal to
this, just as we did in Rn,

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:58.860
but now it's the more general
definition of my inner product

00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.950
that defines our norm.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.330
And because of our
axiom-- so because

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:11.260
of number two in particular,
this is a sensible norm.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.000
It's always going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:18.960
OK?

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:25.000
And conveniently we can also
change this Schwarz inequality.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.550
So instead of the one
that's specific to Rn,

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:37.095
that becomes a b.

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:45.990
All right, so let's
cross that one out.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.750
This is what it becomes.

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:50.020
And in the current
p set, you've got

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.130
to prove this is true, right?

00:49:54.130 --> 00:50:03.190
We can also write down
a triangle inequality,

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:07.810
which is really something
that norms should satisfy.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:13.510
So the norm of a plus
b should be less than

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:18.060
or equal to the norm of
a plus the norm of b.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:24.610
And the R3 version of
this is the longest side

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:27.830
of a triangle is shorter than
the two shorter sides, right?

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:32.800
So this is fine.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:40.320
OK, so you might
ask why we're doing

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.900
all of this seemingly
abstract mathematics.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:47.290
Well, so now we're in a
place where we can actually

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:54.120
talk about the space where
all of our quantum states

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.590
are going to live.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:58.900
And so these inner
product space--

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.767
these vector spaces that
we've given an inner product.

00:51:02.767 --> 00:51:04.350
We can call them
inner product spaces.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:22.590
So we have a vector space
with an inner product

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:27.065
is actually we call
a Hilbert space.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:35.010
And so this needs
a little qualifier.

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.220
So if this is a finite
dimensional vector space,

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.100
then this is straight.

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.940
It is just a Hilbert space.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.560
Let me write it here.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:55.320
So let's write it as a
finite dimensional vector

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:59.660
space with an inner
product is a Hilbert space.

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.092
But if we have an infinite
dimensional vector space,

00:52:02.092 --> 00:52:03.550
we need to be a
little bit careful.

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:16.510
For an infinite
dimensional vector space,

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:17.945
we again need an inner product.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:30.400
We need to make sure that
this space is complete.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.510
OK?

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:34.560
And this is a kind
of technical point

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.680
that I don't want to
spend too much time on,

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:42.960
but if you think about-- well,
let me just write it down.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.780
Vector space.

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.250
Let me write it here.

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:55.945
And I haven't defined what this
complete vector space means.

00:52:55.945 --> 00:52:57.820
But if we have an infinite
dimensional vector

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.420
space that is complete
or we make it complete,

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.670
then we have an inner product.

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:02.836
We also get a Hilbert space.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:11.147
And all of quantum mechanical
states live in a Hilbert space.

00:53:11.147 --> 00:53:12.063
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:22.700
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's true.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.940
So how's that?

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:32.170
So we need to define what we
mean by complete though, right?

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:35.285
So I don't want to
spend much time on this.

00:53:35.285 --> 00:53:36.535
But we can just do an example.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:54.350
If we take the space of-- let V
equal the space of polynomials

00:53:54.350 --> 00:54:01.270
on an interval 0 to L, say.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:10.510
So this means I've got all pn's.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:21.300
P0 plus p1x plus pn xn.

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:31.430
There are things that will
live in the completed vector

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:34.750
space that are not
of this form here.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:38.822
So for example, if I
take n larger and larger,

00:54:38.822 --> 00:54:40.280
I could write down
this polynomial.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:52.945
I could write pn of x is the sum
over i equals 1 up to n of i--

00:54:52.945 --> 00:54:58.470
x to the i over i
factorial, right?

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:03.860
And all of pn's live in
this space of polynomials.

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:06.350
But their limit,
as n becomes large,

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:12.210
there's a sequence of these
call it a cushy sequence

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:17.840
that, as n goes to infinity,
I generate something

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.790
that's actually
not a polynomial.

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:25.570
So I generate e
of x, which lives

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:31.490
in the completion of this,
but itself not a polynomial.

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:38.120
Don't worry about this
too much, but in order

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.570
to really define
a Hilbert space,

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:40.986
we have to be a
little bit careful

00:55:40.986 --> 00:55:42.445
for infinite dimensional cases.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:53.580
OK, so a few more things
that we can do to talk about.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:56:02.300
Well how do we make
a orthonormal basis?

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:08.440
So I presume you've all
heard of Gram-Schmidt?

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.126
The Gram-Schmidt procedure?

00:56:10.126 --> 00:56:11.020
Yep.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:16.340
OK, so that's how we
make a orthonormal basis.

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:20.130
And just the way
you do it in R3,

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.527
you do it the same way in
your arbitrary vector space.

00:56:22.527 --> 00:56:24.110
So we have the
Gram-Schmidt procedure.

00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:47.950
So you can define this-- so we
have a list v1, v2, vn are just

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:52.365
vectors in our vector space
that are linearly independent.

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:05.425
So we can construct
another list.

00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:27.270
There's also orthonormal, so
it's a very useful thing for us

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:28.880
to have.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.530
And so you could define
this recursively.

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:39.500
You can just write
that ej is equal to vj

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:47.360
minus the sum over
i less than j of ei.

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:07.250
So this thing divided
by its length.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:14.750
And so by the sum,
you're orthogonalizing

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:17.410
ej versus all of the previous
ei's that you've already

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.550
defined.

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:22.650
And then you normalize it by
dividing by its length, right?

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:28.200
So that's something
that's very useful.

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:32.240
And the last thing I want to
say about these inner product

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:37.600
spaces is that we can use them--
these inner products at least,

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.910
is that we can use them to
find the orthogonal complement

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:45.390
of something, of
anything really.

00:58:50.490 --> 00:59:01.760
So let's let u-- so we
have a vector space V,

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.700
and I can just choose some
things in that and make a set.

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:16.358
So u is the set of
v that are in V.

00:59:16.358 --> 00:59:18.030
So it doesn't need
to be a subspace.

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:18.900
It's just a set.

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:27.030
For example, if v
Rn, I could just

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:31.510
choose vectors pointing
along two directions,

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:32.760
and that would give me my set.

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:37.490
But that's not a subspace,
because it doesn't contain

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:39.490
some multiple of this
vector times some multiple

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:42.110
of this vector, which would
be pointing over here.

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:44.180
So this is just a set so far.

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:56.050
We can define u
perpendicular, which

00:59:56.050 --> 01:00:09.240
we'll call the orthogonal
complement of u.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.310
And this is defined
as u perpendicular

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:20.200
is equal to the set
of v's in V such

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:34.270
that v u is equal to 0 for
all u in U. All of the things

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:37.690
that live in this space are
orthogonal to everything

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:40.560
that lives in U. OK

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.705
And in fact, this one is
a subspace automatically.

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.380
So it is a vector space.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.440
So if I took my example of
choosing the x direction and y

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.910
direction for my set here,
then everything perpendicular

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.480
to the x direction
and y direction

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.100
is actually everything
perpendicular to the xy-plane,

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:14.190
and so that is actually
a subspace of R3.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:23.070
And so there's a nice theorem
that you can think about,

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:26.630
but it's actually
kind of obvious.

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:35.050
So if u is a subspace,
then I can actually

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:39.360
write that V is equal
to the direct sum of U

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.766
plus its orthogonal
complement, OK?

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:52.940
So that one's kind of fairly
straightforward to prove,

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.810
but we won't do it now.

01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:58.110
OK, so in the last
little bit, I want

01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:04.354
to talk more about this
notation that I've introduced,

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:05.270
that Dirac introduced.

01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:09.650
What can we say?

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:14.206
If I can find a
[INAUDIBLE] here.

01:02:14.206 --> 01:02:16.170
Are there any
questions about this?

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:17.505
Yep.

01:02:17.505 --> 01:02:22.024
AUDIENCE: So when we find space
and the idea of basis balance,

01:02:22.024 --> 01:02:24.730
why is that [INAUDIBLE]
decompose things

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:27.436
into plane waves when we're
not actually [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.860
PROFESSOR: So it's because
it's-- basically it works.

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.980
Mathematically,
we're doing things

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.970
that are not quite legitimate.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:54.360
And so we can generalize the
Hilbert space a little bit,

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.990
such that these non
normalizable things can

01:02:56.990 --> 01:03:00.060
live in this generalized space.

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.880
But really the answer
is that it works,

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.630
but no physical system is going
to correspond to something

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:06.190
like that.

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:07.890
So if I take plane
waves, that's not

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:11.980
a physically realizable thing.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.440
It gives us an easy
way to, instead

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.580
of talking about
some wave packet

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:20.140
that some superposition
of plane waves,

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.250
we can talk about the
plane waves by themselves

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.715
and then form the wave packet
afterwards, for example.

01:03:29.165 --> 01:03:32.040
Does that answer the question
a little bit at least?

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:37.160
Yep.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.489
AUDIENCE: If p could be written
as a sum of U [INAUDIBLE],

01:03:41.489 --> 01:03:45.430
why is U not [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:47.480
PROFESSOR: Well, just
think about the case

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.615
that I was talking about.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.720
So if we're looking
at R3 and we take

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:04.700
U to be the set the unit
vector in the x direction,

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.550
the unit vector in
the y direction,

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:08.210
that's not a
subspace, as I said,

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:10.964
because I can take the unit
vector in the x direction

01:04:10.964 --> 01:04:12.630
plus the unit vector
in the y direction.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.520
It goes in the 45
degree direction.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.620
And it's not in the things
I've written down originally.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:22.780
So then if I talk
about the subspace,

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:30.200
the things spanned by x hat and
y hat, then I have a subspace.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.580
It's the whole xy-plane.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:38.050
And the things are
orthogonal to it

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:43.505
in R3 are just the things
proportion to z hat.

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:55.080
And so then I've got the
things in this x hat and y hat,

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.260
and the thing that's
in here is z hat.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:03.730
And so that really is the basis
for my R3 that I started with.

01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:07.060
That contains everything.

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:13.680
And more generally, the reason
I need to make this a subspace

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:23.200
is just because-- so I define
U by some set of vectors

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.260
that I'm putting into it.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.020
The things that are
orthogonal to that

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:31.382
are automatically
already everything

01:05:31.382 --> 01:05:32.840
that's orthogonal
to it, so there's

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.720
no combination of the things
in the orthogonal complement

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.690
that's not already
in that complement.

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:44.480
Because I'm saying that
this is everything in V

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:50.610
that's orthogonal to these
things in this subspace.

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:53.720
So I could write down
some arbitrary vector v,

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:59.590
and I could aways write
it as a projection

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.590
onto things that live
in here and things

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:04.850
that don't live in
this one, right?

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:09.940
And what I'm doing by
defining this complement is

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:15.200
I'm getting rid of the bits
that are proportional to things

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:21.150
in this, OK?

01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:22.219
All right any-- yep?

01:06:22.219 --> 01:06:23.760
AUDIENCE: So an
orthogonal complement

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.206
is automatically a subspace?

01:06:25.206 --> 01:06:25.830
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:27.862
AUDIENCE: But that
doesn't necessarily

01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:32.437
mean that any random collection
of vectors is a subspace.

01:06:32.437 --> 01:06:33.020
PROFESSOR: No.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.400
All right, so let's
move on and talk

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.600
about the Dirac's notation.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.610
And let's do it here.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:01.670
So three or four
lectures ago, we

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:05.310
started talking
about these objects,

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:09.210
and we were calling
them kets, right?

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:12.570
And they were things that
live in our vector space V.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:17.000
So these are just a way of
writing down our vectors, OK?

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.640
So when I write down
the inner product,

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:29.210
which we have on the wall
above, one of the bits of it

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:31.810
looks lot like this.

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:40.450
So we can really think of
a b, the b being a ket.

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:42.600
We know that b is a
vector, and here we're

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.240
writing in a particular
way of writing things

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.670
in terms of a ket.

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:50.720
And what we can do
is actually think

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.810
about breaking this
object, this inner product

01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:58.970
up into two pieces.

01:07:58.970 --> 01:08:02.910
So remember the dot product is
taking two vectors, a and b.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:06.240
One of them, we already have
written it like a vector,

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.500
because a ket is a vector.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.450
What Dirac did in breaking
this up is he said,

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:19.330
OK, well this
thing is a bracket,

01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:25.740
and so he's going to call this
one a ket, and this is a bra.

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:29.874
So this object
with something it.

01:08:29.874 --> 01:08:31.290
The things inside
these you should

01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:33.960
think of as just
labeling these things.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.760
OK?

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.700
Now we already know
this thing here.

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:39.859
So these kets are
things that live

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:46.119
in-- I should say this
is direct notation.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.450
OK, so we already
know these kets

01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:56.819
are things that live
in the vector space.

01:08:56.819 --> 01:09:01.000
But what are the bras?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.250
Well, they're not vectors
in V. So b is a vector,

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:10.779
so maybe I should've
called this one

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:13.050
b to be a little less confusing.

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:15.510
So b is a ket, and
this is something

01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:19.170
that lives in our
vector space V.

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:23.950
This inner product we're writing
in terms of bra and a ket.

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:30.060
The bra, what does
it actually do?

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:35.200
So I'm going to use it to
make this inner product.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:40.060
And so what it's doing
is it's taking a vector

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:42.454
and returning a complex number.

01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:51.080
The inner product takes
v cross v goes to c.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:56.000
But if I think of it as the
action of this bra on this ket,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.740
then the action is that
this bra eats a vector

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:02.400
and spits back a
complex number, OK?

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.610
So a is actually a map.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:14.010
OK?

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:17.950
So these bras live in
a very different place

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:20.898
than the kets do.

01:10:20.898 --> 01:10:23.740
Although they are going to
be very closely related.

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:30.980
So firstly, it's not in V. You
should be careful if you ever

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.790
say that, because
it's not right.

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:45.720
We actually say that it
belongs to a dual space, which

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:52.590
we label as V star, because it
is very dependent on V, right?

01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:54.510
It's mapped from V to c.

01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:00.110
And I shouldn't even say
this is a linear map.

01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:13.410
Now what is V star?

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:16.230
Well, at the moment
it's just the space

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:19.040
of all linear maps from V to c.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.630
Me But it itself
is a vector space.

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:31.405
So we can define
addition of these maps.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.990
We can define addition on V star
and also a scalar modification

01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.745
of these maps.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:51.430
And so what that means is
that I can define some bra

01:11:51.430 --> 01:12:01.210
w That's equal to alpha lots
of another one plus B to b.

01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:03.950
And all of these live
in this V star space.

01:12:09.064 --> 01:12:10.950
Let me write that explicitly.

01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:22.120
So a b and w live in V star, OK?

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.950
And the way we define
this is actually

01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:27.750
through the inner product.

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:48.850
We define it such
that-- so I take

01:12:48.850 --> 01:12:53.270
all vectors v in the
vector space big V,

01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:57.510
and the definition of
w is that this holds.

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:04.060
And then basically
from the properties

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:08.180
of the inner product, you
inherit the vector structure,

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.120
the vector space structure.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.345
So this tells us V
star is a vector space.

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.290
Let's go over here.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.030
And there's actually
a correspondence

01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:42.000
between the objects in the
original vector space V

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.450
and those that live in V star.

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:54.070
So we can say for
any v in V, there's

01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:57.740
a unique-- I should
write it like this.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:02.190
Any ket v in the
vector space, there

01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:09.230
is a unique bra, which I'm
also going to label by v,

01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:11.265
and this lives in V star.

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:20.080
And so we can show uniqueness
by assuming it doesn't work.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:37.870
So let's assume that
there exists a v and a v

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:57.050
prime in here such
that v-- so we'll

01:14:57.050 --> 01:15:01.200
assume that this
one is not unique,

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.250
but there are two
things, v and v prime.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:10.200
And then we can
construct-- from this,

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.830
I can take this over
to this side here,

01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:18.090
and I just get that
v w minus v prime w

01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:30.260
is equal to 0, which I
can then use the skew

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.530
symmetry of these
objects to write

01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:45.920
as w v minus w v prime star.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.020
So I've just changed the
order of both of them.

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:53.590
And then I can use
the property of kets.

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:56.130
I can combine them linearly.

01:15:56.130 --> 01:16:06.700
So I know this is equal
to w v minus v prime star.

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:10.730
And essentially,
that's it, because I

01:16:10.730 --> 01:16:15.280
know this has to be true for
every w in the vector space V.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.800
So this thing is equal to 0.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:25.510
And so the only thing that can
annihilate every other vector

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:29.290
is going to be 0 for
my definition, in fact,

01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:31.950
of the inner product.

01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:36.390
So this implies
that v minus v prime

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:42.980
equals 0, the null vector, which
implies that v equals v prime.

01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:49.370
So our assumption was wrong,
and so this is unique.

01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:52.080
OK, let's see.

01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:58.540
And so we actually
have really a one

01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:01.840
to one correspondence between
things in the vector space

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:07.440
and things in the
joule space, OK?

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.370
And so we can actually
label the bras

01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:16.050
by the same thing that's
labeling the kets.

01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:24.510
So I can really do what I've
done in the top line up there

01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:27.040
and have something--
everything is labeled

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:31.540
by the same little v. Both
the thing in the big vector

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.510
space, big V, and
the thing in V star

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:36.750
are label by the same thing.

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:48.050
And more generally,
I could say that v--

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:52.480
so there's a correspondence
between this thing

01:17:52.480 --> 01:18:04.790
and this thing.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.240
And notice the stars
appearing here.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.680
They came out of how we
define the inner product.

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:27.410
OK, so really, in fact, any
linear map you write down,

01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:33.100
any linear map like this
defines one of these bras,

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:35.040
because every linear
map that takes

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.860
to V to c lives in V star.

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:39.872
So there has to be an element
that corresponds to it.

01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:45.960
And just if you want
to think about kind

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.930
of a concrete way of
talking about these,

01:18:48.930 --> 01:19:04.420
I can think of-- if I think
of this as a column vector,

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:10.411
v1 to vn, the way I should
think about the bras

01:19:10.411 --> 01:19:19.390
is that they are really what you
want to write as row vectors.

01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:26.010
And they may have to have
the conjugates of the thing.

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.260
The components are conjugated.

01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:37.030
OK, and now you can ask what
the dot product looks like.

01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:48.370
Alpha v is then just this
matrix multiplication.

01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:53.790
But it's matrix multiplication
of an n by 1 thing

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:54.910
by 1 by n thing.

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:14.130
Alpha 1 star alpha 2 star alpha
n star times this one here.

01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:18.384
So v1 vn.

01:20:18.384 --> 01:20:20.175
And this is now just
matrix multiplication.

01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:34.915
I guess I can
write it like this.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:48.980
So they're really,
really quite concrete.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:51.710
They're as concrete
as the kets are.

01:20:51.710 --> 01:20:54.370
So you can construct
them as vectors

01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:58.450
like strings of
numbers in this way.

01:20:58.450 --> 01:21:01.602
So I guess we should finish.

01:21:01.602 --> 01:21:03.560
So I didn't get to talk
about linear operators,

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:06.070
but we will resume
there next week.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:09.750
Are there any questions about
this last stuff or anything?

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:14.710
No?

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:15.210
OK.

01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:17.380
So you next week, or see
you tomorrow, some of you.

01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:17.880
Thanks.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:19.230
[APPLAUSE]

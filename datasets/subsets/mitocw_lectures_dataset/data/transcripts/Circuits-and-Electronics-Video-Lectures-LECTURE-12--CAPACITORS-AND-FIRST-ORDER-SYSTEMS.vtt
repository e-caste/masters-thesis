WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning.
Today we move in the direction

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that takes a big turn from the
direction we have been going in

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so far.
All the devices we have had up

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
until now, resistors and voltage
sources, and even your digital

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
devices like the AND gate or the
inverter and so on had a very

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
specific property.
We didn't dwell on that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
property, but that property was
that these were not what are

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
called memory devices.
In other words,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the outputs at any given time
are a function of the inputs

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
alone.
In other words,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
if you took your inverter or
your NAND gate for that matter

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and you build a circuit
comprising 50 NAND gates

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
connected in structures that we
have talked about,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you apply an input and boom you
get an output.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And your output is a function
of the inputs alone,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
right?
The same thing with your

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
resistors and voltage sources.
At any given point in time your

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
output VO of T was some function
of the input VI of T.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What we are going to do today
is discuss a new element which

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
will introduce a whole new class
of fun stuff for all of us to

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
deal with.
And that is called storage.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In other words,
the output of a circuit is now

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
going to depend not just on the
inputs but it is going to depend

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
on the background or it is going
to depend on where the circuit

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
has been in the past.
So past is going to matter.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It is a very fundamental
difference.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And what I would like to do is
start by giving you folks a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
little bit of a surprise.
I am going to do a little demo

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
taking two of your inverter
circuits.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I am going to start by taking a
couple of inverters.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Remember, I am using this
structure here as an inverter.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And I am going to couple this
to another inverter and take an

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
output C, some VS,
some load resistance RL,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
my B terminal and my A
terminal.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So I'm going to apply some
input between ground and my A

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
terminal.
And for fun I want to apply a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
square wave at the input.
A square wave between zero and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
5 volts.
And this is how my time goes.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Let's assume that VS is 5
volts.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So what I am going to do is
plot for you the behavior of

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
this inverter.
I am going to plot for you A,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which would look like this.
I am going to plot for you B,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which would be the inverted
wave form.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And then plot C,
which would be a wave form that

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
looks like this again.
Let me do a plot here.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So this is A.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
-- and so on.
Time goes this way.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And let's say this is between
zero and 5 volts.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And B should be an inverted
wave form that should look like

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
this.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
If all that we believe of the
world so far is true then this

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
is how things should behave,
so C should look like this.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
This is what the world should
look like and if everything that

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
you learned about is true and
correct and all of the good

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
stuff.
Let me show you a little demo

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and see if I can try to pull the
rug out from under all that you

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
have learned so far and show you
some surprising stuff.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Here are the three wave forms
that I showed you up here.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This is my A.
This is my A wave form.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
This is the B wave form.
Notice that B,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
as you expect,
is an inverted form of A.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And this is C.
We all expect this,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
correct?
But what I am going to do is

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
let me expand the time scale on
this so that I can look at these

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
transitions a little bit more
carefully.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I am just going to expand the
time scale.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
There you go.
All I have done is expanded the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
time scale and spread that out a
little bit.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And what you see there is quite
different from what you expect.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
A is a square wave as expected,
but B is stunningly different.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It is a zero as expected
because this is a one.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But here I get some really
strange behavior,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
behavior that is like nothing
on earth.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Like nothing you have seen
before.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And then, of course,
it becomes a one eventually,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
but there's some really,
really shady stuff going on

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
here.
And so far you are not prepared

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
to deal with this.
We have not given you the

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
facility to deal with his issue.
What is the problem with this?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We could say who cares?
What is the problem with this?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Let's look at the result.
I am looking at this,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I am focusing on this piece
here.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And notice that instead of
being a sharp rise it looks like

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
this.
It is going up a little bit

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
more slowly.
What kind of problem would that

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
create?
The problem that it creates is

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
the following.
Let me play around with this

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
graph a little bit more.
What I am going to do is just

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
take this output here,
the C output and line it up

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
against the A output.
And so I am going to line up

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the C wave form on top of the A
wave form.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So you can see for yourself if
something really,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
really strange and nasty is
happening, I am just going to

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
move up the C wave form and line
it up.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
What is happening out there?
If you look carefully,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
what you observe is that the C
wave form transitions just ever

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
so slightly later than the A
wave form.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Look here.
And I claim that it is because

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
of this.
Because of this,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
the C wave form falls just a
little bit later,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and that little thing we see
out there is a delay.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So nothing you have learned so
far prepares you for this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Suddenly, instead of the output
exactly following the input,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
my output is following the
input but a little bit later.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And it is this fact of life
that things happen a little bit

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
later, is really the reason why
each of you and all of us needs

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to buy new computers every
couple of years.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
This simple basic fact.
If this fact of life didn't

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
exist, you would buy one
computer and be done with it for

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
life.
Intel would make gobs of money

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
one year, and so would Dell and
Gateway and so on,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and then no more.
That's it.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This is it.
But because of this a little

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
itty-bitty difference here the
entire semiconductor technology

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
is charging along trying to do
something about that.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
You buy newer and newer
computers each year.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
It turns out this little
itty-bitty thing here,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that is called the delay,
the inverter delay.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And it happens because of a
specific element that has been

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
introduced here that we have not
shown you so far.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And a large part of the
semiconductor industry and

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
follow-on courses and design and
so on focuses on how could I

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
make my delay smaller,
how can I get to be faster and

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
faster and faster?
This relates to how fast we can

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
clock your Pentium IV.
Remember it came all the way to

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
1.3 gigahertz?
What's the fasted Pentium money

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
can buy today?
What is the fastest P4?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Oh, 3.2 have come out?
I don't know.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Ken claims 3.2.
But, yeah, there you go,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
3.2 gigahertz.
It all has to do with this

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
little itty-bitty thing.
You saw it for the first time

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
here.
When some of you become CTOs at

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Intel and so on,
just remember that it all began

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
on October 16th with this little
rinky-dink thing here.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
What you are going to learn now
is some really cool stuff that

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
has huge implications for life.
So why does that happen?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Why did this transition happen
just a little bit later?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The reason is that remember
when this wave form reaches VT,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
the threshold voltage of this
MOSFET, this guy is going to

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
switch, right?
So because of the slower rise

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
of the voltage,
the VT is going to be reached a

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
small amount of time later.
So I am going to hit VT

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
slightly later.
And because of that this guy is

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
going to transition just a bit
later because this intermediate

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
wave form B is slower.
It hits VT just a little bit

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
later than if it would have made
an instantaneous transition.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And therefore my output falls
just a little bit later and this

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
gives rise to my delay in the
inverter.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We can call that d if you would
like, some delay.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
In your course notes,
this material is covered in

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Chapters 9 and 10.
That was to kind of motivate

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:30.000
why we are going to be doing all
that you we will be doing.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Don't anybody come within a
foot of this even by mistake.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I mean it.
It is pretty deadly stuff.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Today we will talk about the
capacitor.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And in the next couple of
lectures I am going to tie it

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
all together and show you how
this relates to that.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I will show you exactly how the
delay happens.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You can compute it based on
some simple principles that you

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
will learn about in the next
couple of lectures.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
What I am going to do is first
of all show you,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I claim that that delay happens
because of the presence of a

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
capacitor somewhere in there.
What I will do now is take you

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
into a closer look,
take a closer look at the

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
MOSFET and show you were the
capacitor is.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
This is the MOSFET that you
have seen so far,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000
drain, gate and source.
This is called an n-channel

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
MOSFET.
And what I am going to do is

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000
dissect this and show you what
is actually happening,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
what this looks like on
silicon.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So here is my slab of silicon.
It is very thin.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And let's say this is,
I won't go into details here.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
You will learn a lot more about
this in future device classes

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
like 301 and so on,
but suffice it to say I will

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
just introduce it here to give
you a sense of where the

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
capacitor is.
This is p-type silicon.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And the way you build a MOSFET
is you create a couple of tubs

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
in which you dope to be n-type.
The basic silicon is dope

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
p-type.
And this guy here is n-type.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And what you do is a thin oxide
layer is placed on top of that

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and then on top of that a thin
metal layer.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
This is a metal layer.
This is a thin piece of oxide,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
silicon dioxide.
And this is my P substrate.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Now this is a little metal
layer that is really a wire on

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
top of the silicone.
This metal layer could be some

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
sort of a wire that meanders
around on the surface of

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
silicone.
And this is a wire that

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
connects to the gate.
This is the gate of my MOSFET.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And this guy here is the drain.
And this guy here is the

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
source.
And this is my gate.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So there is a little piece of
metal here.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
This is this piece of metal
here.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And there is a piece of oxide
and then my silicone substrate.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Notice that this is my oxide.
When I apply a positive voltage

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
to the gate here with respect to
the substrate,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
what happens is that I draw up
negative charges.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I draw up electrons here into
this channel region and I have

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
corresponding plus type out here
so that I get a view here that

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
looks like a couple of plates.
And I end up with an oxide in

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
the middle.
There is no connection.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Two plates separated by a small
distance with plus q and minus q

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
on the plates.
And, because of that,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
what ends up happening here is
that this piece behaves like a

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
capacitor.
So a capacitor has two plates

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
with a thin insulating material
in the middle with some

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
permittivity epsilon.
And so I get a little piece of

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
a capacitor here.
That is the capacitor that is

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
forming.
I did not set out to build that

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
capacitor, but there is a
capacitor nonetheless.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
So when I apply a positive
voltage at the gate,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
negative electrons are pulled
up here which forms a channel,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and then a current can then
flow.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And that is how the MOSFET
turns on.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
So n-type electrons back to
n-type, and I get electron flow

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
here and that gives me my
channel.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
This is just kind of devices in
four minutes or less.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
You will do an entire course on
this, if you like,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
if you take 301.
What we do is to be able to

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
capture the behavior that we
just saw, the funny delayed

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
behavior, we have to augment our
model.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
We have to introduce a new
element.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So what we do is here is a
MOSFET, gate,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
drain and source.
And notice here we model this

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
by putting a little capacitor,
CGS between our gate and the

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
source.
So this becomes a simple model

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
for our MOSFET device which is
the good old gate drain source

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
device from the past with a
little capacitor CGS having some

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
value for CGS in maybe ten to
the minus 14 or thereabouts

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
farads.
So that is a little capacitor

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
that has come about in this
device that we fabricated here.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
It is that capacitor that is at
between node B and ground

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
because it is between the gate
and the source of the second

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
inverter.
And it is that capacitor that

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
is playing the games that we saw
out there.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
So let's look at some of the
behavior of an ideal linear

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
capacitor.
A capacitor,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
as I said, has a couple of
plates.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
There are a couple of plates.
Between the plates is some

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000
dieletric, permittivity epsilon.
Let's say the area of the

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
plates is A, and let's say the
plates are separated by a

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
distance D.
I get some charge here,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
let's say q.
So q and minus q on the

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
capacitor.
And the capacitance C is given

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
by epsilon A divided by D.
Epsilon, as I said,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
is the productivity of the
dielectric.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
So if it is free space then it
would be epsilon zero which is

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
the permittivity of free space.
That is the capacitance in

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
farads.
And the symbol looks like this.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Capacitor C.
Voltage v.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Current i.
So this, much like the

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
resistor, voltage source and so
on, this now becomes a primitive

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
element in your tool chest of
elements like the voltage source

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
and so onn.
Capacitance with the voltage v

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
across it and a current i.
And I have assigned the

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
associated variables here
according to the associated

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
variable discipline.
A question to ask ourselves is

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
remember we said we are all now
in a playground from all of

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
nature, in this playground where
the lumped matter discipline

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
holds?
And also remember that we said

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
that for the lumped matter
discipline to hold we have to

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
make a couple of assumptions.
One of those assumptions was

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
that dq/dt, for all their
elements should be zero for all

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
time.
So right now what about the

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
capacitor?
It has got some charge q.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
So charge must have built up
somehow.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Does that mean that I lied all
along, that we are no longer in

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
this playground,
that we have been ejected from

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
the playground because of the
capacitor, or are we still in

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
the circuits playground in which
the lumped matter discipline

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
holds and all good things happen
and so on?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
It seems like a contradiction,
doesn't it?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
I took you from Maxwell's
playgrounds to the EECS

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
playground where I said the
lumped matter discipline holds.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And one of the foundations of
the LMD was that dq/dt should be

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
zero for all time inside the
elements that we are going to

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
deal with.
And right now boom,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
it's not four weeks into the
course and Agarwal introduces an

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
element and it has q in it.
It turns out that the capacitor

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
also adheres to the lumped
matter discipline.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Remember the discipline says
that dq/dt is zero for all time

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
within elements.
So I am going to be clever.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
What I am going to do is I want
to choose element boundaries in

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
a very cleaver way.
Notice that if I have q here on

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
this plate then I get minus q on
the other plate.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
So if I take the whole element,
the element as a whole,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
if I am careful in terms of how
I package my boundaries,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
if I put both my plates inside
my element boundary then I still

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
do get the net charge being
zero.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
So dq/dt is indeed zero for all
time provided I make sure that

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
my element has both the plates.
Therefore, if you come across

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
somebody else that gives you an
element that says I have an

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
idea.
Let's create a new branch of

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
electrical engineering in which
we model the capacitor not as

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
one element for two plates,
but let's build a capacitor by

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
combining two new elements,
two garbage elements called G1

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
and G2.
G1 is like the top plate.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
G2 is the bottom plate.
I put them together and I get a

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
capacitor.
But notice if I just pick one

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
plate then the element G1 will
not adhere to the LMD.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
It adheres to the LMD because I
choose my element boundaries in

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
a way that both plates come
within it.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
So it is very fundamental and
key.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And you can read a lot more
about it in the course notes.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I purposely dwelt on that
simple point because I think it

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
is foundational and important.
And you really need to

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
understand that the capacitor
does satisfy LMD.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
We are still in the good old
playground.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
A few simple facts here.
These are in the notes.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And you have also seen this
before, I am sure.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
I can relate the charge to the
capacitance and the voltage as q

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
is equal to Cv.
And q is in coulombs,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
this is in farads and this is
in volts.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
So there is some charge q
stored on the capacitor and it

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
is in coulombs and q is equal to
Cv.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.000
So I can differentiate this
with respect to time to get the

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
current, and that becomes
i=dq/dt.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000
So the current at any given
time is dq/dt.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
And so I substitute for q in
terms of Cv here.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
That is what I get.
So the current i=d(Cv)/dt.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
A 6.002 assumption,
capacitance in general can be

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
time-varying.
I can get time-varying

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
capacitors.
In fact, there are some sensors

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
which are capacitive.
And, as I talk,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
my sound waves can change the
pressure on the top plate of the

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
capacitor.
And move the top plate of the

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
capacitor, thereby changing the
capacitance by moving the plate.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Remember d here,
as the plate moves closer I get

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
a higher capacitance.
So we won't be dealing,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
unless explicitly said so,
with time-varying capacitances.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
So what we can do is 6.002
allows us to write Cdv/dt.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
So my current source capacitor
is Cdv/dt.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
I can also write down the
energy, capacitors store energy.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
E=1/2Cv^2.
I am sure you have seen all

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
this before in physics and so
on.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000
That is the amount of energy
stored in the capacitor if it is

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
holding a charge q.
Let me do a little

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
demonstration for you.
They don't make glasses like

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
they used to.
Our friend Lorenzo has charged

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
up this capacitor.
It is a huge capacitor.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
It is a 250 volt capacitor so
it is nasty.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
He has charged it up and has
kept it there.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
And to show you that it does
contain stored charges it has

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
been sitting there holding
charge.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Maybe the first row should go
backwards, just step back for a

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
second.
I think you guys would be safe

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
but I just don't want to take
any chances.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
This is holding a bunch of
charge.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
It is kind of sitting there.
If I short the terminals it

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
should try to say oh,
I've got a path,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
let me get my charge out.
All right.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Let's do it.
This is always a scary moment

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
for me.
And I say a little prayer

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
before I do this.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Good?
OK.
Gee, you guys would love to see
me getting fried,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
huh?
All right.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Let's see.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
So it did contain charge.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
So there is a reason why
Lorenzo puts one hand inside his

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
pocket when he shorts it,
because there is a natural

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
tendency to hold the wire with
both hands, and la,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
la, la, la, la and put it
across the capacitor.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
By doing this you are
guaranteed that you will just be

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
touching it with one hand.
Hopefully you folks will

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
remember for life that a
capacitor can sit around and

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
hold its charge for a while.
All right.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
That is enough of fun and
games.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Let's get on with our business
of building circuits.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
What I am going to do is,
as I promised you,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
I am going to close the loop on
that example by halfway through

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
the next lecture.
I'm going take you on a bit of

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
a journey involving capacitors
and resistors and involving some

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
analysis, and then we will close
it all up for you at about the

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
middle of next lecture.
What I would like to do next is

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
here is a new element.
And let's do some fun stuff

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
with elements.
Well, you know about voltage

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
sources, you know about
resistors, let's put them

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
together and see how they
behave.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Let's have a capacitor here,
C, vc(t) and some current i.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
What I am going to do,
in general, whenever I have

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
something new or something
strange, let's say like a

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
capacitor or some other device.
It is interesting to model the

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
rest of the circuit behind it if
it contains only resistors and

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
voltages and linear elements as
a Thevenin equivalent.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
So let me do that.
This is R and this is vi.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
This stuff in the back is my
standard pattern,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
voltage source in series with a
resistor, and I connect that

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
across my capacitor.
But remember,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
although you saw those funny
wave forms and so on,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
the capacitor is a linear
device.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Because you can see from here
that the current relates to

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
dv/dt.
That is a linear operation.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
You don't see V squareds and
Vis and things like that in

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
there.
It's is a linear device.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Let's go back to our trusty old
method, the node method.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
If you just blindly apply the
node method and simply grunge

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
through a bunch of math,
you should be able to get to

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
the answer, that is for some
voltage v or some form of

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
voltage vi, I should be able to
figure out what vc looks like.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
So let's do that.
This is the node that is of

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
interest here with the unknown
node voltage vc.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
So let me apply the node
method.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
(vc-vi)/R is the current going
this way.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
That plus the current through
the capacitor should equal zero.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
And what is the current through
the capacitor?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
The node method tells me that,
get the current in terms of the

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
element values.
We know that the current is

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
given by CdvC/dt.=O.
Just shuffling things around a

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
little bit, I can write RC
dvc/dt+vc=vi.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
We are writing the node
equation and then getting the

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
equation that characterizes this
little circuit.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Notice here that this has units
of volts.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
And since I have time here,
this also must have units of

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
time.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Let's go about solving this
little circuit and understanding

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
how it behaves.
The specific example that we

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
will look at looks like this.
Let's say the capacitor voltage

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
at time T=0 is V0.
This is given.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
So at time T=0,
I am telling you that the

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
capacitor contains a charge.
And because of that there is a

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
voltage V0 across it.
That capacitor had a voltage of

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
250 volts across it and most of
the devices we deal with in

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
laptops and so on today,
like the Pentium IV,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
voltages are on the order of
1.5 volts, very small voltages.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
So that is the value in the
capacitor, the voltage.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
That is called a state.
This is called the state,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
capacitor state.
It is the state of the

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
capacitor.
And I also give you that

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
vi(t)=VI.
So my voltage is VI.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
And somehow,
I am not telling you how,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
but some how it arranged to
have the capacitor voltage be V0

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
at time T=0.
Now I want to look to the

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
solution to this for t greater
than or equal to zero.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And in that time my voltage vi
is at some capital VI,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
some DC voltage VI.
So I am going to solve the

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
differential equation RC
dvc/dt+vc=vi given these two

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
values.
Input is DC voltage VI and VC0

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000
is V0, the initial charge in the
capacitor.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
So from now until almost to the
end of the lecture,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
it is just going to be math by
solving this very simple first

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
order differential equation.
And the key here will be that

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
throughout 6.002 we will be
following one method to solve

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
these.
There are many methods to

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
solving differential equations,
and we will follow one method.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
That method is called the
method of homogenous and

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
particular solutions.
In 1802, I believe,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
you would have learned maybe
this, and certainly other

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
methods.
You can use any method to solve

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
it.
We will just stick to one

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
method.
And this is also used in the

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
course notes.
In this method what we do is

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
take the solution VC by finding
two other components.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
One is called the homogenous
solution.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
And summing that up with the
particular solution.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And that is the total solution.
So total solution is the sum of

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
the homogenous and the
particular solutions.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
And the method has three steps.
As I said before,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
we will be using this method
again and again with every

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
differential equation that we
encounter in this course.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And you won't encounter a while
lot.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
The first step we find the
particular solution.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:39.000
The second step,
find the homogenous solution.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:47.000
The total solution is the sum
of the two.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
And then find ---

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
There will be some unknown
constants depending on the

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
equation that you have.
And in the end we simply find

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
the unknown constants by
applying the initial conditions

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
that we have.
Boom, boom, boom.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Particular.
Homogenous.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Find constants.
Three things.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
So let's go about solving this
equation and apply those three

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
conditions.
Again, remember,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
what I am doing now for the
next 10 minutes or 15 minutes is

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
using math that you know about
to simply solve this first order

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
of differential equations.
There is nothing really new

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
that I am going to talk about
here.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
One is to find the particular
solution vCP,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
which will then be added into
the vCH to get me the solution.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So the way you find the vCP is
you find any solution that

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
satisfies this equation.
This is the equation.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
You find any solution that
satisfies it.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And find the simplest possible
solution that money can buy.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Find it.
That's the particular solution.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Any solution is fine.
In this case,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
a really simple one would be
vCP equals VI.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Let's see if a constant works.
One thing you will realize in

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
differential equations is that
they are actually much simpler

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
than they seem.
And the reason is that almost

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
every time you have to assume
you know the answer,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
and then you are checking to
see what you assumed was

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
correct.
Assume the answer is this like

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
you are really smart,
and then check it out and say

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
oh, yeah, that must have been
the answer.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
So here we assume that I think
VI is going to work so let's try

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
it out.
Substituting in here.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
RC dvc/dt is 0.
vi is a constant.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
So I get vi equals vi,
so therefore this is a

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
particular solution.
Done.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I substitute vi here.
So dvi/dt=0.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
This vanishes and vi=VI.
Bingo.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Therefore, VI is a solution to
this equation.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
So I am done with my vCP.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
And in general what you have to
do is use trial and error.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
By trial and error try out a
bunch of solutions until you get

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.000
lucky.
In general, again,
in all of 6.002 for many of the
excitations a simple constant

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
usually suffices.
Our second step is to find the

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
homogenous solution.
And we can also do that very

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.000
quickly.
And to do that we have to find
a general solution to the
homogenous equation.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:52.000
The homogenous equation is the
same differential equation but

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:04.000
with the drive set to zero.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
We want to follow a set pattern
to solve the differential

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
equations here,
and the set pattern is find

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
vCP, vCH, find constants.
And to find vCH we are also

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000
going to follow a set pattern to
find the homogenous solution.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
So we set the drive to zero,
so vi is set to be zero.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And I need to find a general
solution to this.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
As I promised earlier,
diff equations are really,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
really simple because the way
we are going to solve them is we

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
are going to assume we know the
answer and then go check it.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
So let's try Ae^st.
Let's try and see if this can

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
solve this particular equation
for some values of A and S.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I am telling you that the
solution is going to be of this

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
form.
Assume it.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And then simply go ahead and
find me A and S,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
and do that by substituting it
back into the equation and find

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
out the corresponding As and Ss.
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:36.000
I get RC.
I substitute this back up so I

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:50.000
get dAe^(st)/dt+Ae^st=0.
And let me plug that in and see

00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:00.000
what comes.
I get RCAse^st+Ae^st=0.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
I want to discard the trivial
solution of A being 0.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
That is a trivial solution so I
will discard that.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
And what I will do is cancel
out the As from here,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
assuming A is not zero,
and cancel e^st here.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:28.000
And what is left is RCs+1=0.
What this is saying is that if

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
I can find an S such that this
is true then Aest is a general

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000
solution to my homogenous
equation.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
This is easy enough.
And so S=-1/RC.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000
If I choose my S to be -1/RC
then the simple math that I have

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000
gone through shows me that this
must be the solution to the

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
homogenous equation.
Or in other words

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
vCH=Ae^(-t/RC).
All this is saying is that

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Ae^(-t/RC) is a solution to my
homogenous equation.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
A is an unknown constant.
A is some constant.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
I don't know what that is yet.
Notice RC has popped up again.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
And the cool thing about RC is
that, this is time,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000
this also has units of time.
We commonly represent RC as

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
some time constant tau,
as units of time.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Associated with that circuit is
the time constant tau,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
which is simply RC.
I commonly write this as

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Ae^(-t/tau).

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
I am very the end here.
I have the particular solution

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
here.
I have got the homogenous

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
solution there.
I need to tell you about

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
something else.
The way I found the homogenous

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
solution was in four steps.
I assumed a solution of the

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
form Ae^st.
I created this equation here in

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
S.
This is called the

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
characteristic equation for that
circuit.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
We will see this time and time
again for RC and other forms of

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
circuits.
Assume a solution of this form.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Construct the characteristic
equation.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Find the roots of the
characteristic equation.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
In this case it is an equation
in S.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
So this is the root.
And then form the solution

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
based on that root.
Four steps.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Ae^st, characteristic equation,
root and then write down the

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
general homogenous solution.
Four steps there.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
And finally I want to write
down the total solution.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
And the total solution is
simply vCP+vCH.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
And vCP was VI and vCH was
Ae^(-t/tau).

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
tau was simply RC.
That is my solution.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Now, remember the last step.
The last step was form the

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:59.000
total solution and find out the
remaining constants.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Find out the remaining
constants by using my initial

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
conditions.
At t=0, I know that vC=V0.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
I know that.
And so therefore I can

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
substitute t=0 to find the
constant.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
So I know that VO=VI+A.
t=0, this thing becomes 1,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:35.000
and so I get this equation from
which I get A=V0-Vi.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
In other words,
my solution vC is simply

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
VI+(VO-VI) e^(-t/tau).
So the last 15 minutes have

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
just been math.
No electrical engineering here,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000
but electrical engineering
stopped at the point where you

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
wrote this differential equation
down, went through a bunch of

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
math and came up with a
solution.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Purely mathematically.
So here I simply used math to

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
get you the solution.
And, as I have been promising

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
you throughout this course,
in the next lecture I will give

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
you an intuitive EE method of
doing it.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Real electrical engineers,
real EECS folks don't do it

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
this way.
Real EECS folks do it

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
intuitively.
And I will show you how to do

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
it in four easy seconds in the
next lecture.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000
But you need to understand the
foundations of how this comes

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
about, and so this is the
answer.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
You can also get the current iC
is simply Cdvc/dt.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
I won't do that for you,
but you can simply

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
differentiate it and get the
current.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
So I can plot for you vC,
time t, vC.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000
The intuitive way of looking at
this is I have VI which is the

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:15.000
final value of the voltage.
When t is infinity this part

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
goes to zero so the vC is simply
VI.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:26.000
And then there is a component
V0-VI which decays according to

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
this starting out at an initial
value of V0.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Notice when t is zero vC is V0,
you can see that in the

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
equation, and so it starts out
at V0 and ends up at VI.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
I start here,
I end up here.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000
And this portion V0-VI decays
out over time like this.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:04.000
And this decay is governed by
the RC time constant or tau.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
I am going to show you very
quickly a couple of examples of

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000
wave forms, one that goes like
this and one that looks like

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
this.
This is when I start with some

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:28.000
value V0 and I don't apply any
input, it should decay down to

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
zero, t, t, vC,
vC.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
If I apply zero for VI then
this should simply decay down to

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
nothing over time.
And if I apply some VI but

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
there is no state in the
capacitor then that same

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
equation is going to look like
this.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
You can go and confirm for
yourselves that when I apply

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
some input but the capacitor has
zero state, I start at zero,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000
I finish up at VI and my wave
form looks like this.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
There you go.
That's the first one.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.000
The second one where I have 5
volts on the capacitor and no

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
input.
Assume that at time equals zero

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
I take away an input,
short the input voltage to

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
ground for example,
apply zero volts.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000
You will see the decay from 5
volts to 0 volts.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.000
And in the first case I start
with zero volts in my capacitor,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
I apply input of 5 volts,
and notice that at t=0 the

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000
capacitor rises up to that
level.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
So notice that these circuits
with capacitor and resistors are

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
typified by wave forms that are
exponential rises and

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000
exponential decays.
We will see more of that next

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
time.

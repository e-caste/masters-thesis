WEBVTT

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.260
PROFESSOR: Why don't
we get started.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.070
Good afternoon--

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.060
to stretch the literal meaning
of the word considerably.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.690
What a miserable
day out there.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.470
I get to and from the boonies
via the commuter rail.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.480
And this morning, we sat there
for an hour part way in

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.140
because a tree had fallen across
the railroad track.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.550
I don't know who went out to do
it, but somebody had to get

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.860
a saw and saw the tree up and
take it off the tracks before

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.580
we could proceed into Boston.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.440
Even with that, I was
sort of reluctant

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.520
to get off the train.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.600
I saw how it was pouring
outside.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.360
So I am highly flattered that
you decided to trudge through

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.810
the puddles and show
up this afternoon.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.060
All right, this is a momentous
occasion because we are

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.770
exactly at this point, halfway
through the term.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.600
And this is when we are about
to change gears from our

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.520
discussion of symmetry theory
and switch over to physical

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.530
properties of crystals and the
way in which symmetry impacts

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.250
on those properties.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.690
What I wanted to do primarily
today, though, is to say a

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.580
little bit in a very fast and
very simple way about the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.910
nature of crystal structures
because that is one of the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.360
primary uses of symmetry
theory.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.520
It's to describe the periodic
arrangements and symmetrical

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.700
arrangements of atoms
in crystals.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.410
So it's the language that's
necessary to describe such

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.210
arrangements, particularly when
they're beyond the red

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.710
balls at the corner of the cube
and black balls in the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.370
middle of the faces level
of structure.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.850
Let me first, for your amusement
and edification,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.740
pass out another problem set.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.730
This has only two
problems on it.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.840
You are not really equipped to
do it yet because we haven't

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.520
talked about space groups.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.970
So don't worry about
doing that now.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.510
But I wanted to get it in
your hand so that you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.770
could look it over.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.310
It's a good problem set on which
to end this part of the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.840
discussion--

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.650
but there's another
one that I'll be

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.100
passing out next week--

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.930
because this is an example of
how you can use the notions of

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.610
symmetry that we have
established to say some fairly

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.320
profound and non-obvious things
about the nature of

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.850
atomic arrangements.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.960
So that's the purpose
of this problem set.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.050
It is to give you an opportunity
to see the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.230
surprising things that can fall
out of our material that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.170
we now have at our disposal.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.140
Let me begin by telling you
where we left off last time.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:07.670
We had completed deriving the
so-called Bravais lattices,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.940
the three-dimensional
space lattices.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.310
The process by which we did
this was to take our

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.460
two-dimensional space groups,
the plane groups, and say

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.610
that, if we add a third
translation, we will have

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.510
generated a space lattice.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.210
But these different nets in
the base of the cell are

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.600
special and determined by the
fact that there are symmetry

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.710
in these nets.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.300
So if we take, for example, a
net that is exactly square--

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.120
it's square because there's
a fourfold axis there.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.520
And that fourfold axis, in a
space lattice, pokes not only

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.760
into the base of the cell but
extends up through space.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.050
So you must pick a third
translation such that the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.840
symmetry elements line up.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.960
We would take each of the
crystallographic plane groups

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.000
and pick a third translation.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.260
You end up with almost all of
the lattices that you're going

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.570
to get except for the ones that
involve cubic symmetries

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.400
that are inherently
three-dimensional.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.810
And the reason for that is
that the more complex

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.660
three-dimensional point groups
are, for the most part,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.340
obtained by adding inversion to
the simple symmetries that

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.690
exist in two dimensions.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.290
But inversion doesn't require
anything of a lattice.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.850
So you can immediately say that
2M and 2/M are compatible

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.640
with the same sort of space
lattice because the symmetry

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.730
2/M is nothing more than what
you get when you add inversion

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.220
to either a twofold axis
or a mirror plane.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.290
And, finally, another way of
classifying crystals, and a

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.650
broader way of classifying
them, is according to the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.480
coordinate systems that
are necessary to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.730
describe the lattices.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.305
And these are called the
crystal systems.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.270
And, as a mnemonic device for
keeping straight what the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.370
crystal systems are as opposed
to the crystal classes, which

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.920
is another word that we haven't
used but it's another

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.640
word for the point groups, the
crystal systems goes with

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.510
coordinate systems.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.200
And it's simply a word to
describe the shape of the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.480
lattices, family of lattices,
that we've described.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.450
And we distributed a handout
last time that gave the names

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.470
of these systems and the
relations that exist between

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.620
the edges of the unit cell,
which we use as the basis for

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.670
our coordinate system
and also the labels

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.090
that we put on them.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.030
I have another sheet, which
I'll pass around, which is

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.980
nothing new.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.720
It just assembles--

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.780
I'll give you two sheets,
which I'll pass around.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.410
The first is an assembly of
the crystallographic point

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.130
groups in a somewhat neater and
tidier way than we had on

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.020
the sheet that we passed
around last time.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.480
So this is a picture of all
32 of the point groups.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.630
Again, beware of the fact that
mirror planes and guides to

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:30.100
the eye that split things up
into 90 degree segments or 60

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.560
degree segments come
out deceptively

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.530
similar on these sheets.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.540
But there with the
representative pattern are the

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.050
arrangements of symmetry
elements, a representative

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.750
pattern of motifs, and the
international and [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.990
symbol for all 32 of the

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.520
three-dimensional point groups.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.490
And then the next sheet I'll
pass around takes the point

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.160
groups and groups them together
with the lattices

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.660
that can accommodate them and
the crystal system that

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.740
describes the arrangement
of axes in the lattice.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.730
So this is, in a nutshell,
everything that we've covered

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.090
up to this point.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.880
And, at this point, I have
to say that there is some

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.160
disagreement on how many
crystal systems exist.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.180
And even though people who
work with symmetry and

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:33.350
mathematics are usually
rational, almost to a fault

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.190
logical individuals, there are
several junctures as you build

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.300
up a body of knowledge where
you could go either way or

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.680
adopt either convention.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.910
You sort of got to pay your
money and take your choice.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.700
And this occurs in our
arrangement of point groups

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.460
and lattices among the
crystal systems.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.080
This occurs in the hexagonal
crystal system.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.980
Symmetry 3 and the other point
groups that can be derived

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:09.010
from it can be placed either in
a hexagonal lattice, that

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.890
is to say, a third translation
C that is exactly at right

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.760
angles to a pair of
translations, A1 and A2, which

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.460
are 120 degrees apart.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.840
Or a three-fold symmetry can go
into this funny double-body

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.980
centered hexagonal lattice,
which could be defined, if we

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.159
were masochistic and enjoyed
working in an oblique

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.340
coordinate system, could be
defined instead in terms of a

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.000
rhombohedral lattice, which
had the special

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.860
characteristics that three
translations are identical by

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.360
symmetry, called therefore A1,
A2, and A3; and the angles

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.080
between the more equal alpha 1,
alpha 2, alpha 3; and they

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.730
could be anything we wished.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.230
So that is a unique sort of
crystal system and unique sort

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.730
of coordinate system.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.830
There are those who would say
that if this is the case, we

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.600
really have seven crystal
systems--

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.760
triclinic; monoclinic;
orthorhombic; tetragonal;

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.790
hexagonal; and then this one
that is compatible only with a

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.870
three-fold axis and that is
called the trigonal system or,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.410
by some folks, the rhombohedral
system; and then,

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.590
finally, the cubic.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.870
Well isn't that a rational
and logical thing to do?

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.840
Yeah, question at this point?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.605
AUDIENCE: Do you have any extra
copies of the sheet

00:09:27.605 --> 00:09:29.350
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.680
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.270
There should be more than
enough floating around.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.866
This one here?

00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:37.364
[? AUDIENCE: The ?]

00:09:37.364 --> 00:09:37.862
[? chart ?]

00:09:37.862 --> 00:09:38.858
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [? not the ?]

00:09:38.858 --> 00:09:39.360
[? chart ?].

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.860
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.020
I'll give you--

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.220
I think there are
more back there.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.610
But why don't you take
one for now?

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.230
Yeah, so it's a perfectly
reasonable thing to do is to

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.500
set up the trigonal system as
a separate coordinate system

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.650
to describe the rhombohedral
lattice.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.070
The problem that creates,
however, is that if you do

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.800
this, there is no longer any
one to one correspondence

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.430
between the point groups and
the crystal systems.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.590
A crystal with symmetry 3, for
example, can fit into it

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:22.620
either in a hexagonal lattice
or a trigonal lattice.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.380
US So sometimes a crystal with
point group 3 would have to be

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.770
called a hexagonal crystal,
sometimes a trigonal system.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.760
But which is it?

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.170
Well it can be either.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.770
So admitting the trigonal system
as a separate crystal

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.550
system breaks down the one to
one correspondence between

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.720
point groups and crystal
systems.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.330
The very pragmatic reason for
not admitting the trigonal

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.530
system as a separate
crystal system

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:58.150
is that, although you can in
this funny triple hexagonal

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.590
cell define a primitive trigonal
cell that has a

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.900
special geometry, nobody in
their right mind, as I

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.310
indicated earlier, would
want to work in such

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.710
a coordinate system.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.540
Better to take the triple
cell, pay the price of

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.650
three-fold redundancy, and yet
have two interaxial angles

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.100
that are 90 degrees and one
that's specialized at 120.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.620
That's a much more convenient
reference system for our

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.270
description of crystal
properties.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.520
One final thing I'll comment
on but won't say anything

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.350
about very much--

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.690
I always do that.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.400
I say I won't say anything about
it but, and then launch

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.470
into a 10 minute digression.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.120
Off in the right hand corner is
something called the Laue

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.340
group of which there are 11.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.330
The Laue groups are those of the
point groups that contain

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.940
the operation of inversion.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.690
And the reason they're called
the Laue groups is that one of

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.950
the primary ways, other than
looking at crystal morphology

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:08.140
to determine the symmetries of
a crystal, is to look at the

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.090
way it diffracts x-rays.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:15.010
So if we had, for example a
tetragonal crystal and there

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:19.010
were lattice planes in here that
were related by 90 degree

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.960
rotations, then if we brought
in an x-ray beam at such an

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.700
angle to satisfy Bragg's law and
saw some sort of intensity

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:35.620
that came off, if we rotated the
x-ray beam 90 degrees, we

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.420
ought to see diffraction at
the same angle and with

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.300
exactly the same intensity.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.650
So either by moving the x-ray
beam, or simpler thing would

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.550
be to leave the x-ray beam
fixed, since it's attached to

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:53.500
an x-ray generator that weighs
a ton or more, instead move

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.240
the crystal relative
to the x-ray beam.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:03.490
Now what would you do in this
way of thinking to determine

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:09.530
whether a crystal had the
operation of inversion in it?

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:14.870
If this is the set of planes
with indices HKL, you, again,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:20.680
would bring in an x-ray beam
at an angle theta, in out.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.790
Look at the intensity from
the set of points HKL.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.370
And then look at diffraction,
both in terms of the Bragg

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.290
angle theta and in terms
of the intensity.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.830
Look at that diffraction from
the planes that were related

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.640
to HKL by symmetry.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.460
Well what plane is related
to HKL by symmetry?

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.490
It's these planes down here
which have indices minus H,

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.130
minus K, minus L.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.430
So if we did the corresponding
experiment to what I did to

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.450
the left, we'd bring in an
x-ray beam like this.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.310
It would be diffracted
at some angle theta.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.560
And we'd look at the intensity
for the set of planes minus H,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.870
minus K, minus L.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.334
Is that going to be
any different?

00:14:05.334 --> 00:14:06.170
No.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.690
Right-minded person would
say, why should this

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:09.870
intensity be different?

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.680
All we're doing is bouncing
the x-ray beam off the

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.800
opposite side of one in the same
set of lattice planes.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.040
So why should the intensity
be any different?

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.400
In this case, clearly if the
set of lattice points is

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.500
rotated by some finite angle,
we are not going to see

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.410
equivalent diffraction
from planes that

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.850
are 90 degrees apart.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:42.460
So the upshot is that the
diffraction symmetry of a

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.900
crystal, the way in which planes
with indices that are

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.250
related by symmetry diffract
in terms of position of the

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:54.110
beam and intensity, the
diffraction symmetry of a

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.340
crystal always looks as though
that crystal possessed an

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.600
inversion center.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.880
So, therefore, to--

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.650
and I qualify this by saying,
to a good approximation--

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.200
the only point groups that
you could determine and

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:13.000
distinguish from one another by
x-ray diffraction are the

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.570
point groups that contain
an inversion center.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.950
Almost, but not quite.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.010
If we look a little more closely
at what is doing the

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.490
scattering, it is not
the Bragg planes.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.560
These are imaginary, shimmering,
absolutely planar

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.970
things that are constructs that
we use to interpret the

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.315
process called diffraction.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.090
Inside the crystal what is
actually doing the diffraction

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:45.380
is a collection of atoms, each
of which are scattering the

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:45.980
x-radiation.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.410
And that physically is what
causes the diffraction.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.810
And the resultant intensity is
the addition of all the little

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.200
wavelets scattered by these
separate atoms.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.800
So in terms of the atomistics
of what is involved, to look

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.850
at diffraction from the set of
planes HKL and contrast that

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.570
with the diffraction for the set
of planes minus H, minus

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.870
K, minus L, we're coming in
from opposite directions.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.300
And here the beam would hit--

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.320
let's call the atoms, if I did
not do so already, let's call

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.155
them A and B. A for
a and b for big.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.620
Diffraction from the set of
points HKL would pass through

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.730
the sheets of A atoms first
and then impinge on the B

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.910
atoms, whereas in the opposite
direction, the x-ray beams

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:44.120
would impinge upon the
B atoms first and

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.420
then hit the A atoms.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.860
Does that make a difference?

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.380
Aha.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.440
Believe it or not, it does.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.030
And I can't explain why without
going into a very

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.210
detailed discussion
of diffraction.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.570
But if you compare the
intensities that are scattered

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:07.220
by these two sets of planes,
which are related by inversion

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.940
and therefore just opposite
sides of one another, it does

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.380
make a difference which
atom the x-ray

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.060
beam encounters first.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:23.700
And the difference in intensity
is on the order of

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:29.720
3% to 5%, although by picking a
radiation appropriately for

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.360
the particular chemical species
in the crystal, you

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.140
could increase this perhaps
to 10% or 12%.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.000
But that is something that you
could not do until synchrotron

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.990
radiation came along, which
could actually tune the

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.660
wavelength to a particular value
that you wish to use and

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.130
not use something that was
spewed out by an x-ray tube

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:56.550
that had a target such as
molybdenum or copper or

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.330
chromium, perhaps.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.060
OK, so you can with this
careful measurement of

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:07.140
intensity distinguished between
the opposite sides of

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.410
the given set of Bragg planes,
unless, of course, the crystal

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.970
did have inversion in it.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.120
And then there would be
no difference at all.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.800
It requires a very careful
experiment, though, because

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.180
there are many things
that could make

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.470
the intensities different.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.605
For example, absorption
by the crystal.

00:18:23.605 --> 00:18:26.250
If the crystal has an
irregular shape, the

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.290
absorption, which can easily
be factors 10, 20, or even

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.260
more, the absorption would be
different for x-ray beams

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.330
coming in those two
orientations.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.860
So in any case, as I say, I
won't say anything about it.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.860
But 10 minutes later,
that's the

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.020
meaning of the Laue groups.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.440
These are the point groups that
have inversion in them.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.970
That effect that I just
described, by the way, is

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.570
called anomalous scattering
or anomalous dispersion.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.930
There's really nothing anomalous
about at all.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.460
It has to do with the way
electromagnetic radiation

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:10.180
interacts with the clouds of
electrons that are distributed

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.770
about the nucleus
of each atom.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:24.520
Where we will go from here to
finish up symmetry theory will

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:30.150
be to now take the 32
crystallographic point groups

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:37.530
and to drop those point groups
into each of the distinct 14

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.170
Bravais lattices.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.450
And then we'll need combination
theorems to deduce

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.360
where the additional symmetry
elements arrive.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.450
And when we go through that
process, if we were to do this

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:54.310
exhaustively, we would find that
there are 230 distinct

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.880
three-dimensional symmetries
that involve point group

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.410
symmetry operations
and lattice type.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.200
I saw several faces blanch.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.110
Don't worry.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.040
We're not going to do that.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.380
What we will do next time is
do a small handful and then

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.590
conclude by showing you how this
information is tabulated

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.490
in the international tables.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.010
And the quick, immediate answer
to that question is

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.630
that the problem set that I
passed around has two pages

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.800
for two different point groups
that show the way that this

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.360
information is tabulated in
the international tables.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.840
So that's where we'll end up.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.960
And we'll come pretty close to
completing that when we meet

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.210
on Thursday.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.710
I heard no sighs of relief.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:43.670
I heard no cheers.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.610
So you are presumably
still engaged in

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.320
this material somewhat.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.750
I have two things I
would like to do.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.110
We talked about crystal systems
and point groups.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:21:00.670
And let me now ask, do you think
there is a crystal known

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:05.590
for every one of the
point groups?

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.840
Think so?

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.510
I saw some skeptical
shakes of the head.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.920
The answer is yes, but
just barely for some

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.355
of the point groups.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:25.760
One of the very rare point
groups, in terms of structures

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.150
that populate it, is our high
symmetries but which lack

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.360
inversion or mirror planes.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.290
One very, very rare point
group is 432--

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.785
just axes arranged in a cubic
arrangement with no mirror

00:21:41.785 --> 00:21:43.550
planes or inversion centers.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.580
And my rationalization of that
is that if an arrangement of

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.490
atoms has to conform to all of
these rotational symmetries,

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.960
it's pretty hard for it to do it
and have that assemblage of

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.210
atoms assume the lowest possible
energy state if it

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.950
doesn't pick up in the process
inversion or mirror planes as

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.090
additional symmetry element.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.440
Sort of satisfying for me.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.880
But that's not a rigorous
argument.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:16.320
OK, let me now take a poll.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.160
Do you think, using the broader
cut of the crystal

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.360
systems, do you think there's
a crystal known for every

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.420
crystal system?

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.850
Are there triclinic, monoclinic,
orthorhombic,

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.070
tetragonal, trigonal,
hexagonal,

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.770
cubic crystals known?

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.750
Yeah.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:40.010
That's a pretty realistic
expectation.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.835
And that is indeed the case.

00:22:41.835 --> 00:22:45.550
But now let me cut this
a little finer.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.430
Which do you think is the most
popular crystal systems for

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.920
real materials and which do
you think is the rarest?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:58.980
OK.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:04.880
Who thinks triclinic crystals
are the most common?

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.500
OK, there are pessimists.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.370
What is the definition
of a pessimist?

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.600
The pessimist is somebody you
should borrow money from

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.740
because they'll never expect
to be paid back.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.182
Who would say cubic crystals?

00:23:22.182 --> 00:23:25.640
There are naive [? optimists. ?]

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.560
Now I will reveal all.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.150
The answer is, it depends.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.640
Depends upon whether you're
talking about, interestingly,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.630
inorganic materials or whether
you're talking

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:40.985
about organic materials.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:52.860
If you look at inorganic
materials, the most popular

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.570
crystal systems are--

00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:01.740
and the results are, first
of all, cubic.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.870
Is this not a benign world
in which we live.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.560
Most inorganic materials--

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.020
if you're a material scientist
who works with metals and with

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.260
ceramics, you're going to work
with cubic materials, thank

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.710
God, most of the time.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.780
The second most popular--

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.295
by a considerable margin but
there are still a lot of

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:24.545
them-- is orthorhombic.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:39.140
And the third most popular,
shortly behind orthorhombic

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.065
and almost in a tie, monoclinic
and tetragonal.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.470
We'll launch into a quick
overview of crystal symmetry.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:25:02.500
And we'll see why inorganic
materials have high symmetry.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:08.250
It's true, in particular, when
the material is held together

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.680
by ionic bonding.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.020
If the bonding is ionic, it's
non-directional and atoms of

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.040
opposite charge will therefore
try to get as close as

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.440
possible to the atoms
of opposite charge.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.750
And because atoms of like charge
repel one another, the

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.940
surrounding atoms will
try to be as widely

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.660
separated as possible.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.970
And this grouping of atoms,
positive around negative,

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.770
tends to have a lot
of symmetry.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.340
And, therefore, the way in which
these groups are linked

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.840
together has a lot
of symmetry.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.820
OK, I said organic materials.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.940
And I'll pass around some
actual numbers that were

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.960
assembled a long time ago but
are still, in terms of

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.780
proportion, still valid.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.410
The organic compounds are broken
down into whether these

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.240
are compounds based on rings or

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.330
extended, lopsided molecules.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.740
And the numbers are very
different depending on that.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:12.170
But, for organic molecules
[? material, ?]

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:22.030
monoclinic is the most common,
then orthorhombic.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:37.200
And shortly after orthorhombic
comes way, way behind is

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.440
tetragonal and triclinic,
which are almost tied.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.130
And I think I can rationalize
this observation, as well.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:04.760
Organic materials contain
discrete molecules.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.630
And if we've got something-- and
I'm going to, since I know

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.960
I'm among friends, display
my abysmal

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.070
ignorance of organic chemistry.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:18.080
I am unapologetically and
unabashedly inorganic and even

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.000
non-metallic in my research
interests.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.270
So let's suppose we have
something that's composed of

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:27.720
various strange rings with
little side groups sticking

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.690
off like this, another one off
like this, and then maybe

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:36.460
another ring up like this.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:41.900
That, to me, looks like a
reasonable molecule in terms

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.520
of my ignorance of organic
chemistry.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.520
So if there are these finite
groups and you're going to put

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.130
them together in a crystal,
what are you

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.210
going to try to do?

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.380
They're going to be held
together by very weak van der

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.510
Waals forces, which are
non-directional.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.640
So think of the outline of this
molecule as being some

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.300
ugly thing like a ham hock.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.290
And then your problem, if the
forces between these molecules

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:09.980
are non-directional, how do
you close pack ham hocks?

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:15.350
The way you would do it would
be to put down a row of them

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.800
in a close-packed sequence.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.580
So we'll put down things
that look like this.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.810
And then, maybe to make them fit
together, dovetail another

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.660
one in here.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.360
And maybe something like that.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.930
And then for the next row down,
and you would maybe put

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.000
the nose of one in here.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.540
And then put the other one in
here, the nose of one here,

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.800
and something like that--

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.050
being very schematic.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:53.610
The lattice that describes this
packing is not going to

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:54.170
be orthogonal.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:57.040
It's not going to be square
with high symmetry or even

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.140
have two orthogonal
translations.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.570
It's going to be something that
has this as translations.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.270
There's going to be an A
and a B that is not at

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.040
right angles to it.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.780
And the B translation will have
different links, simply

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.100
because the thing that you're
putting together in close

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.750
packing has a very
irregular shape.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.390
So I think that is the reason
why molecules, discrete

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.800
molecules that try to achieve
something that is as close

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.140
packed as possible, will have
translations in them that are

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.210
of unequal length and making
arbitrary angles with respect

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.440
to one another.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.660
So having kept you guessing for
so long, let me pass out

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.690
another sheet.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.810
This was a compilation that
was done a long time ago.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:44.480
And there were only 9,000
crystals for which complete

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.510
crystallographic data
had been obtained.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.170
This was way back in 1967.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:55.350
As I say, there's much
more data now,

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.920
easily in order of magnitude.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.280
But I don't think
the proportions

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.480
will change very much.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.031
They'll stay about the same.

00:30:03.031 --> 00:30:04.815
Let me pass out these sheets.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.390
So make sure you memorize them
because the first question on

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:17.000
the next quiz is, how many
out of 8,759 crystals

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.250
are actually triclinic?

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.050
I would never do that.

00:30:27.077 --> 00:30:30.320
All right, any comments
or questions?

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:30.798
Yes, sir.

00:30:30.798 --> 00:30:33.188
AUDIENCE: Why would organic
molecules of such odd shapes

00:30:33.188 --> 00:30:34.622
even be crystalline
to begin with?

00:30:34.622 --> 00:30:37.490
Why wouldn't they just
be amorphous?

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.790
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.980
Clearly the interatomic
forces are very

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.140
directional and very strong.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.130
And that's going to hold the
molecule into a fixed

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.486
configuration.

00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:49.230
AUDIENCE: Didn't you say there
were van der Waals forces?

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.710
PROFESSOR: But they're these--

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:56.180
even for something that is not
ionic or metallic, there still

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.690
are weak attractive forces
between these molecules.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:00.220
Why?

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.590
Well, the charges are not
uniformly distributed over

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.620
these molecules.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.250
So there are going to be some
van der Waals forces that tend

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.220
to hold them together.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.810
And a van der Waals force is
essentially non-directional.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.770
So if you have this weak force,
you're going to be able

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.070
to squish the crystal
into something

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.020
amorphous very easily.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.710
And organic materials are
usually very subject to

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.140
plastic deformation.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.110
But if you assemble the
molecules carefully from

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.970
solution, or by vaporization,
condensation, they're going to

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:38.080
want the order if they are
solidified with enough

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.340
mobility to rearrange themselves
in the lowest

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.590
energy configuration.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.190
I think what you're saying is
these are not going to be very

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.130
strongly bonded crystals.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.980
They're going to melt
at low temperatures.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.580
But, nevertheless, prepare them
properly, and the lowest

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.730
energy state will be ordered.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:57.724
AUDIENCE: I'm sure
[? they're ordered. ?]

00:31:57.724 --> 00:31:59.712
But would it be such that you
have [? translational ?]

00:31:59.712 --> 00:32:01.700
symmetry?

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.682
Who's to say it's going to have
a definite pattern that

00:32:04.682 --> 00:32:06.680
will repeat itself?

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if there
are attractive forces--

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.600
let me again use a hand-waving
argument.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.030
If you've got a bunch of
particles and they aggregate

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:19.340
here in the lowest energy
configuration, that is going

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.320
to be the lowest energy
configuration.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.190
And a similar group of
atoms will want to do

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.850
the same thing here.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.780
And if there are interactions
between these groups, they're

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.395
going to arrange themselves
in an order configuration.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.340
That is simply saying--

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.610
this is a very weak qualitative
argument-- says if

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.080
you have a configuration which
is the lowest energy

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.290
arrangement here, any other
place in the system where

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:47.160
those atoms get together and
congeal are going to assume

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.801
that same configuration.

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.540
OK?

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.610
Other comments or questions?

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:58.760
This is all very qualitative but
actually concerns matters

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.620
that we are describing a
language to describe.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.000
Yes, there are.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.020
If you look at this table that
came around, if you look at

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.780
cubic organic materials
out of--

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:23.990
there--

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.160
what is the number?

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:31.440
117 out of what looks to
be several thousand.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.280
Yes, there are cubic
organic crystals,

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.720
but very few in number.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.130
Hexagonal--

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.760
56 out of a rather
large number.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.970
All right, when we took a poll
a week and a half or so ago

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:59.160
and said, how many of you had
seen any material and crystal

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.800
chemistry in solid state
chemistry in a previous class

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:09.600
on structure and bonding or
crystal chemistry, and only a

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.880
few people tentatively twitched
a hand slightly.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.449
So what I'd like to do for the
rest of this session, since

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:23.739
this is what symmetry theory is
developed to describe, I'd

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:28.040
like to say something about
structures and why they form

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.159
the way they do to give some
qualitative insight.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.409
This is a fat pack of notes.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.639
And I'll go over it quickly with
you and lead you by the

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.650
hand through it.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.739
But this is not material
for which I'll hold you

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:46.929
responsible.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:50.420
In fact, I'll turn my back and
those who want to get home

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.380
early because of the rain
can tiptoe out.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:56.290
And I won't even notice who you
are unless everybody goes.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.460
And then I'll feel very hurt
because I wrote these out.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.710
And it took a lot of trouble.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.420
All right.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:15.140
I have to apologize and say that
most of what is described

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:20.400
in these notes applies to ionic
bonding and, to a lesser

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.980
extent but still in large
measure, to metallic

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.920
structures.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.720
And what is the reason
for that?

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.850
It's because the metallic bond,
to a fair approximation,

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.140
an ionic bond rigorously, if you
believe Coulomb's law, is

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.500
a non-directional
sort of bonding.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.380
So the structures that are
assumed, the structures that

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:48.390
are the lowest energy
configuration turn out to be

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:53.790
determined by interatomic
distances and ionic or

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.290
metallic sizes.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:02.930
The Coulombic interaction that
holds ionic compounds together

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.800
is a central force.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.650
And one of the features of
electromagnetism is that, if

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.450
you have some distribution of
charge about center and

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.290
another distribution of charge
of a different sort about a

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:20.870
another center, the cohesive
force between, let's say, a

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:27.300
positive ion and a negative ion
is, along a line, joining

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.520
their centers.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.970
And, secondly, you can take,
once you're outside the

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.760
distribution of charge, you
can clump all the charge

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.920
together at the center
of the distribution.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.700
So that's what makes the
ionic bond so simple.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.155
And that's why everybody who
talks about bonding and

00:36:46.155 --> 00:36:49.350
structure discusses ionic
bonding because organic

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.535
chemistry is just too complex
in comparison.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.715
So let's look at
a given cation.

00:36:56.715 --> 00:37:01.700
And cations generally tend to be
smaller than anions because

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.640
you've removed electrons from
the outer configuration.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.980
We'll look at some effective
sizes of ions in just a bit.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.650
But you've stripped electrons
off to make a positively

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.550
charged ion.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.340
You've added electrons on to
make a negatively charged ion.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.710
So when you add electrons, the
ion functions has [? always ?]

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:20.020
had a larger radius.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:28.820
So let's bring up a B minus
ion as a neighbor.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:36.660
And for those two species,
there will be, if we put

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.360
energy as a function of
separation D, there's going to

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:46.360
be a Coulombic attractive
force that goes as 1/D.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.350
But when the electron
configurations get in to close

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:53.970
proximity, at small separations,
the electrons

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.940
will start to push one another,
beginning with the

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.240
outer electrons first, into
higher energy states.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.160
And the energy of interaction,
due to the interaction of

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.480
orbitals, will increase the
energy of the system.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:15.240
And the result then is that
the net potential, as a

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.310
function of distance for
an isolated ion pair--

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.660
I was looking for some colored
chalk and it's gone-- is

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.750
something that rises steeply
at low separations and then

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:28.230
levels out more gradually
at larger separations.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:33.390
So this then would be an
equilibrium separation, D0,

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.360
for that ionic pair.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.942
If we got energy out, and for
that isolated ionic pair it'll

00:38:42.942 --> 00:38:46.130
be just exactly this
much energy, E0.

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:49.880
If it weren't for
a pair of ions--

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:54.890
let's take another A and bring
it into the system.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:59.960
And there's a lot of room to
put still another A around.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.200
And we can add that
to the system.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.920
And every time we bring up an
additional neighbor, we get

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.080
approximately this much energy
out of the system.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.860
But not quite because there
will also be repulsive

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:20.890
interactions between the
ions of like charge.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:21.850
OK?

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.290
But to a good approximation
to within about 10% to be

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:28.530
quantitatively, every time we
bring up another neighbor, we

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.290
get out the same amount
of energy again by

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:34.060
forming this group.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.895
And all that works splendidly
until--

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:46.090
let me now look at the
arrangement of anions about

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.560
the little cation because
they will have to

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.640
have a shell as well.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.980
So if we have a small cation
and we bring up a big fat

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:59.150
anion, there will be, first
of all, two consequences.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:03.490
These ions of like charge will
interact repulsively.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:08.320
So the lowest energy situation
is going to be one in which

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:16.990
these neighboring ions arrange
themselves so that the

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.260
repulsive energy is minimized.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.730
And we're going to get the
maximum separation between all

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:28.240
of these anions and get the
minimum energy when they

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.750
arrange themselves on the
corners of a regular

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.670
polyhedron.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:37.540
And that's where symmetry
starts to come in to the

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.650
importance of ionic
structures.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:45.080
That, for this particular
configuration of anions, the B

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.920
ions might be on the corners.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.710
And I am not drawing them in
contact now just so it'll be

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.090
easier to draw.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:57.590
The B ions will be equidistant
and tend to arrange themselves

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.285
on the corner of the
regular polyhedron.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.770
If we got energy up by bringing
up extra neighbors,

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:11.430
we will reach a point where the
B ions will essentially be

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.280
in contact.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:20.770
And the A ion is rattling
around in a hole.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.020
It can touch perhaps
two neighbors.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.170
And we will get the full
amount of energy on.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.310
But for the other two neighbors,
we're going to be

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:28.400
out here on this curve.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.500
And we won't get nearly
as much energy out.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.545
But at the same time, we're
paying the price energetically

00:41:34.545 --> 00:41:39.600
of all of these repulsive
interactions between the

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.610
surrounding neighbors
of like charge.

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:47.960
So the second consideration is
that, as we said, first of

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.380
all, this group of atoms, which
is referred to as a

00:41:51.380 --> 00:42:03.980
coordination polyhedron,
it first

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.975
of all will be symmetric.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:18.020
And then the number of
neighbors, the number of ions

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:23.780
of one charge that are
coordinating the others--

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.690
and that's something called
the coordination number,

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.470
introduce some jargon--

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:45.200
has an upper limit that is going
to be determined by the

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.450
size of the ions.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:03.930
So these are the two
basic tenets of

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:07.110
ionic crystal chemistry.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.890
So having established those
points, we can do some

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:19.320
geometry and assume that the
ions are hard spheres or at

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.330
least elastic spheres with some
stiffness because it's

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.190
going to take energy to perturb
the orbitals of the

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:32.440
electrons and, just in terms of
simple geometry, calculate

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:38.030
the range of radius ratios RA/RB
where A is the central

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:41.680
ion in the polyhedron and B is
the surrounding ion, and do

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.860
this for different coordination
numbers, picking

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.570
polyhedra in which the
surrounding ions of like

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:52.070
charge are as widely separated
as possible.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.850
So starting at the beginning,
coordination number one would

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:57.440
be a pair of ions.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.190
Obviously no constraints
whatsoever on

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:01.390
the relative sizes.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:07.010
RA/RB can be anywhere it likes
between zero and infinity.

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.420
For coordination number two,
again the surrounding ions

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.510
want to be as widely separated
as possible.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:15.780
So it'll be a linear chain.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.880
But, again, the central ion
can become as small or as

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.730
large as it like.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:23.450
So the range of radii is between
zero and infinity.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:26.000
For coordination number three,
the polyhedron will be an

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.680
equilateral triangle.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:32.110
And if you calculate the
geometry, when the B ions are

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:38.220
exactly in contact, you have a
little 30, 60, 90 triangle in

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.860
which one edge of the triangle
is RB and the

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.850
other is RA plus RB.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:45.350
And you can manipulate that into
the form where you can

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:50.030
show that there will be a lower
limit RA/RB, which is 2

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.800
over the square root
of 3 minus 1.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:56.940
And that turns out to be
a magic number, 0.155.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.830
Going to coordination number
four, you'd say, aha.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.460
That's going to be
square group.

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.360
No, a square group would not
keep the surrounding ions of

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.540
like charge as widely separated
as possible.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:12.010
And the geometry which would
keep them as widely separated

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:15.300
as possible but yet in contact
with the central sphere would

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.670
be a tetrahedron.

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.440
The Bs would be arranged
on alternating

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.260
vertices of a cube.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:28.480
The magic number there turns
out to be 0.225.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.120
Coordination five--

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.570
very, very rare.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:38.530
Five is a crystallographic
abomination because five-fold

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.200
symmetry does not conform
to a lattice.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.930
But there would be,
in principle,

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.285
one five-fold group.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:55.630
And that would be a trigonal
prism where you have three Bs

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:59.520
arranged on an equilateral
triangle about the central A.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.730
And then you have one A up here,
another B up here, and

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:05.790
another B down here.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:11.770
So this, then, is a bipyramid,
a triangular bipyramid.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:17.550
And you can derive a range of
radius ratios for this.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:21.050
And this is a dandy problem
to give on a problem set.

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:27.330
But you find that the range of
radius ratios RA/RB is the

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:36.350
same as for six-fold
coordination, which is the

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:39.630
next one considered
on the handout.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:44.850
So we six coordination with
the corners on a regular

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.300
arrangement would be
an octahedron.

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:52.480
And the permitted range there
is 0.732 to infinity.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.700
Five coordination, the trigonal
prism, leads to

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.770
exactly the same
range of radii.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:04.410
And the reason is, if you look
at the geometries, this

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.490
triangle here is the same
for both an octahedral

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:14.410
coordination and a trigonal
pyramidal coordination.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:18.350
Notice as we chug on that the
lower limit to the radius

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:21.980
ratio is gradually increasing.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.440
And if we go to coordination
number eight, cubic

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:29.110
coordination, it goes
up to 1 to infinity.

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:34.650
And for coordination number
12, RA/RB has to

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.850
be exactly 1 period.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:38.580
And that would be what
you achieved in the

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.830
close-packed number.

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:50.390
OK, turning the page.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:54.540
There is also going to be a
range of radius ratios that's

00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:01.170
determined by the number of As
that can be packed around a

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:11.940
central B. And doing exactly the
same calculation, if, for

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:19.270
example, four-fold coordination
permitted in

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:29.240
terms of RA/RB, the range
is 0.225 to infinity.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:35.220
If we want to know the limits
for packing of A around B with

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:41.300
tetrahedral coordination, this
would give us numbers RA/RB

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:46.840
that were exactly the same range
of numbers because we've

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.700
just changed the labels.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.280
If we want to put everything on
the same basis, in terms of

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.450
one particular radius ratio,
if we do anion to cation

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:03.930
radius ratio, the range would
be 0.225 to infinity.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:09.170
If we take the reciprocals of
these numbers for four-fold

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:12.520
coordination of B, this
would be 1 over

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:17.460
0.225 to 1 over infinity.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.880
So this will give us--

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.880
this is zero.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:22.960
This is infinity.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:31.840
So there'll be a range of radius
ratios, 0.225 less than

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:40.970
RA/RB, less than 1 over 0.225,
which turns out to be 4.44.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:46.160
So this would be the range of
permitted radius ratios for

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:53.560
CNA equals 4 and CNB equals
the same thing, 4.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.640
So there's going to be an upper
limit that's imposed by

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.810
the packing of As around B and
a lower limit that's imposed

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:08.450
by the packing of Bs around A.

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:10.420
But what are going to
be the coordination

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.270
numbers of A and B?

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:13.290
Let me finish this up.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:15.700
And then we can take
our break.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:24.180
I'm going to now restrict things
rather drastically.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:39.370
I'm going to consider binary
compounds in which all cations

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:53.560
have the same coordination and
all anions with the same

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.810
coordination.

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.210
And the implication there is
there's only one type of

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.582
coordination number for both.

00:51:08.582 --> 00:51:10.720
And that's not always
true in compounds.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.630
Sometimes you find a given
species that has two different

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.995
coordination numbers in a
more complex compound.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:28.970
If that's the case, if this is
the A ion and this is the B

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:33.790
ion, let me consider
the chemical

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.185
composition of a bond.

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:45.410
And that's going to translate
into the same

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.600
thing as the compound.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.270
So let's suppose there's a
number of Bs around the As,

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:53.335
which is, by definition, the
coordination number of A, and

00:51:53.335 --> 00:51:56.670
a number of As around a B and
that is, by definition, the

00:51:56.670 --> 00:52:00.990
coordination number of B. So let
me look at a wedge that's

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:03.260
associated with this bond.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:07.130
And this is an amount of an A
atom, which is 1 over the

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.220
coordination number of A.

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:14.390
And if I do the same thing for
the B ion the part of the B

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:17.900
ion associated with one bond
is going to be 1 over the

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:21.070
coordination number of B. So
we can say then that the

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:32.500
composition of a bond is going
to be A subscript 1 over the

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:36.970
coordination number of A, B, 1
over the coordination number

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:38.910
of B.

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:42.290
The chemists abhor fractional
subscripts on a chemical

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:43.510
composition.

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:46.820
So let's multiply this by
the product of the two

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.070
coordination numbers.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.620
And what we'll find is that the
formula of the compound

00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:01.620
with integer subscripts is going
to be A, C, and B; B

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:10.350
coordination number of A. And
that is a subject to a very

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:15.800
drastic set of assumptions that
each species A and B has

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.230
just one coordination number.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.740
OK, so doing this in terms of
composition, just turning this

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:27.610
result around.

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.170
And then we'll quit and
take a stretch.

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:39.850
This says that if we look at a
particular composition, AnBm,

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:47.230
something like TiO2 or Al2O3,
then the coordination number

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:51.100
of A in proportion to the
coordination number of B is

00:53:51.100 --> 00:54:01.490
going to be equal to the
ratio of M to N.

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:06.500
And the more ions of one charge
that we can pack around

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.200
the other, the lower
the energy will be.

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:16.480
And, therefore, the coordination
numbers will be

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:33.560
the maximum permitted values of
CNA and CNB, subject to the

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:37.510
constraints of radius ratio.

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.540
In other words, to conclude very
quickly with one specific

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:46.590
example, if we look at a
compound like Al2O3, an

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:50.040
important ceramic and a
gemstone, this says that the

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:55.080
coordination number of Al to the
coordination number of the

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:59.110
oxygen has to be equal
to three to two.

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:07.500
So possible structures might be
aluminum with coordination

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.850
number three, oxygen
with coordination

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:14.820
number equal to two.

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:19.410
Or aluminum could have
six coordination.

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:22.010
The oxygen could have
four coordination.

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:25.560
Or the aluminum could have
12 coordination.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:29.390
And the oxygen could have
eight coordination.

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:34.940
Those three possibilities.

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:38.530
Next we have to use the ionic
sizes to see what constraints

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:41.530
there are that are going to
limit the maximum coordination

00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:44.720
numbers because the greater the
number of neighbors, the

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.030
lower the energy.

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:49.820
And, in the case of aluminum
oxide, it turns out that it's

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.460
six to four.

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.500
And this is determined
by the radius ratio.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:01.810
And you know what?

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:06.220
If we used the ionic radii for
Al3 plus and O2 minus, we were

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:07.970
right one the nose.

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:12.740
That is the nature of the
structure of aluminum oxide--

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:17.780
aluminum with octahedral
coordination by oxygen and

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:24.200
oxygen with a tetrahedral
coordination of aluminum.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.850
And that is the actual
structure.

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:32.720
The three-dimensional linkage
would have to be such that

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.615
ions of like charge have the
maximum possible separation.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:43.050
And to keep you beyond your
patience for just a little

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:44.220
bit, what is that going to be?

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.960
We can use very simple
considerations there.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.120
If we have coordination
polyhedra and we want to join

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.920
them together, the worst
possible situation is to have

00:56:53.920 --> 00:57:00.140
them share edges because the
central ions then had minimum

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.390
separation.

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:09.940
The better situation would be to
have to the polyhedra share

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:16.180
corners and have the ions in the
center of these triangles

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:20.740
form a straight line with
the shared ions.

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:23.460
For a three-dimensional
polyhedron, the sequence of

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.950
increasing repulsive energy
would be shared faces for

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:30.240
something like cubes,
shared edges--

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.440
that would be lower energy but
not the best you could do.

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.990
Shared corners would be the
best possible arrangement.

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:39.690
As you make each of those
transitions, you take the

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:42.960
central ion and keep the
separation between the

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.480
neighboring ion of like charge
as low as possible.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.865
The interaction energy would
be as low as possible.

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:54.620
All right, so let
me stop there.

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.150
I think we're probably about
halfway through.

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:03.930
We can then determine ranges
of radius ratio for various

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:05.310
stoichiometries.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:09.940
And all this is just a fantasy
unless we can say, do ions

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:15.380
have sizes that are the same
from compound to compound?

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:18.750
And, if so, how do we
determine them?

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:24.290
I hope that intriguing pair of
questions will keep you here,

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:29.790
dry and warm, rather than
heading off early.

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:35.630
OK, so let's take our usual
10-minute break and resume to

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:36.880
wrap this up.

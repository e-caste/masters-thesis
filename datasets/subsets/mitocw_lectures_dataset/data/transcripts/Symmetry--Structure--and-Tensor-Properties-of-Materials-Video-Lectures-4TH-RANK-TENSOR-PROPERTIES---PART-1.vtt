00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.970
PROFESSOR: This, as you know, is
the last lecture of thermal

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.820
tensor properties of crystals
for the semester.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.140
Come on, can't somebody
go, aww, just to

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.120
make me feel good?

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.060
At least nobody said yay, so
that makes me feel good, too.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.780
So I guess on balance I come
out feeling pretty happy.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.450
What I'm going to do today is
to talk a little bit more

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.060
about forthright tensor
properties, which we've not

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.520
said much about.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.450
And I'm going to look at some
scalar moduli and look at them

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.590
for a couple of different
symmetries and restrictions on

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.410
the compliances.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.720
The surfaces that you might
expect turn out to be really,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.630
really weird.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.800
Because these will be fourth
order variation with the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.470
direction cosines.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.310
So when you take trigonometric
functions and raise them to

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.710
the fourth power, you get severe
anisotropies for a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.910
great many of the
scalar moduli.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.050
I'm sorry to say, years ago when
I made the acquaintance

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.220
of a computer programmer in
course six who was looking for

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.230
something challenging to do in
connection with material

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.040
science and engineering,
I said, wow, have I got

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.150
something for you.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.410
How about doing some
computer graphics?

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.890
And this was a few years
ago when such

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.870
products were fairly rare.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.010
And how about making a program
that would let us see visually

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.580
how some of these scalar
moduli will vary with

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.770
direction and provide the
provision so you can turn them

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.670
over in space, just as you would
pick up a model in your

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.490
hands and rotate it around
till you finally came to

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.680
appreciate it?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.750
And then for something like a
triclinic crystal, where there

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.870
are almost a couple of dozen
different moduli, how about

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.290
allowing people to scale up or
scale down the value of one of

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.340
the elastic constants
and let them see

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.890
how the shape changes?

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.720
And oh, that was-- he went
to work on it for a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.400
semester and came back.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.240
And it was a gorgeous thing.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.850
You could take a monoclinic
representation of three

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.830
dimensions of Young's modulus.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.330
Say you want to change S31.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.010
And it would change
by a factor of 10.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.630
You'd see a big nose blow out
on the surface and then

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.780
contract down again.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.990
And you could turn around.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.180
Anyway, the program having told
you how marvelous it is,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.010
it's no longer supported because
of the operating

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.850
system that it operated under
having done defunct.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.140
But anyway, that was a fun
thing to play with.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.220
AUDIENCE: What operating
system?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.570
PROFESSOR: I don't even
remember anymore.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.570
It was a fairly obscure one.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.440
Was not only the system, but it
worked through a software

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.366
package which operated
on that system.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.790
All right.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.020
So we're going to talk today
about fourth rank tensor

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.270
properties.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.710
The most important--

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.640
in fact, probably the only ones
you've ever heard of, are

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.740
the elastic, stiffnesses, and
compliances, which are ways of

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.230
representing strain in
terms of stress or

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.600
stress in terms of strain.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.300
I think I'll sort of see
how the time plays out.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.310
If I finish just about
everything that I'm hoping to

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.040
say by on the hour, I think I'll
just go an extra five or

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.140
10 minutes.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.510
And then comes a great, grand,
and traditional event at MIT.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.210
All semester long I've been
grilling you with problem sets

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.610
and quizzes, and you've had to
dance through your steps just

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.480
because I told you to.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.410
Now how's this for
reciprocity--

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.800
you get to evaluate me.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.470
You get to grade me.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.460
MIT, at the end of every
semester, has a course

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.780
evaluation.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.585
It's submitted anonymously by
you, so you could really vent

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:36.250
your spleen without ever having
called to task for it.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.090
So when we finish, either for
our break or at the end of a

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.800
slightly extended first session,
I will bow, to

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.350
thunderous applause,
I hope, and exit.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.790
And then you will be left alone
to fill out the course

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.680
evaluation.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.250
Corinne will collect them from
you, and she will deliver them

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.660
over to department
headquarters.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.760
The results will be tabulated,
and so will the comments.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.120
But they will not be in your
hand, all of which I

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.930
recognize, having spent
hour after hour

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.200
grading your quizzes.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.780
So they will be submitted
to me in a

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.290
completely sanitized fashion.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.866
I won't know who said what.

00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:27.390
A final question that I will
answer before you ask it, what

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.590
about the quizzes?

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.310
How are you doing on them?

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.390
Well, I have come
to hate them.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.730
I think I will give one-question
quizzes from now

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.160
on the future.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.960
It takes me about five
to seven minutes

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.860
to grade each question.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.430
And there are about 25 of you.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.710
So it takes me, to grade one
question, somewhere between

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.810
two and 1/2 and three hours.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.910
And there are 10 questions
on the two quizzes

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.240
remaining to be graded.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.060
And so I let you do the
arithmetic, and you can see

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.860
what sort of torment I've been
living in the last few days in

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.380
return for the torment
I put you through

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.600
for two brief hours.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.590
So wow.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.470
I will leave it to you to decide
who's getting the worst

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.830
of this deal.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.170
OK, fourth rank tensors.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.540
Elasticity's probably the only
one you can think of.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.130
Let me give you an example in
this handout, an example of

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.610
another forthright
tensor property.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.410
And this is the piezoresistive
effect, the way electrical

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.760
resistance of the material
changes in response to an

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.810
applied stress.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.560
It's a pretty exotic property.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.950
I had never heard of it until
I was at a meeting of the

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.010
American Crystallographic
Association and somebody,

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.200
believe it or not, from
Texas Instruments--

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.080
so you better bet that this
property is useful in

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.260
technology--

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.500
fellow named Ahmed Amin got
up and gave a talk on the

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.330
piezoresistive effect.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.840
And he had marvelous slides at
the outset that defined the

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.370
effect

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:06.430
So what you have here on these
few sheets is a few pages that

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.460
define the piezoresistance
effect.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.990
We're not going to do
anything with it.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.890
It's a fourth rank tensor, so
it will proceed to transform

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.810
like other forthright tensors,
such as elastic stiffness and

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.060
compliance.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.800
I should warn you about these
following pages, which were

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.560
slides that he used
at his talk.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.680
He seems to have done the
lettering with a magic marker.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.840
Because all of the I's and J's
are indistinguishable, which

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.720
makes interpretation of what
he's saying here a little bit

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.780
challenging.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.160
And then the other thing that
throws one off is that he uses

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.220
x to represent stress.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.310
I don't know what field or in
what discipline the elements

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.280
of stress are called xij, but
this is what he does.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.880
And once you figure that out,
the interpretation of what he

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.900
has said here is fairly
apparent if

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.120
you think about it.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.970
Anyway, he takes a state of
zero stress and strain and

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.420
expands it as a series, and
then picks off different

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.490
coefficients.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:25.520
And one of them is a set of
moduli which he calls pi, pi

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:37.150
subscript ijkl, which relate
stress, xkl in his notation,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:44.910
to a change in the density,
delta row ij.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:50.760
So here's a fourth rank tensor
property that will indeed have

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.960
to conform to all the
restrictions for the moduli

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.560
that we have defined
for the elastic

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.810
stiffnesses and moduli.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.220
All right.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.250
Let me then turn to
stress and strain.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:13.130
We introduced the relation
between stress and strain, but

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:20.120
didn't really go into detail on
the bizarre absorptions of

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.900
factors of two or four that have
to be done in order to

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.420
make this come out in a nice,
clean matrix form.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:38.460
So let me remind you of where
these silly factors came in.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.462
We took our stress tensor, sigma
1 1, sigma 1 2, sigma 1

00:09:43.462 --> 00:09:52.190
3, 2 1, 2 2, and 2 3, sigma 3
1, sigma 3 2, and sigma 3 3.

00:09:55.982 --> 00:09:59.370
The tensor had to
be symmetric.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.720
The off-diagonal term sigma
ij had to be equal to

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.590
the term sigma ij.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.070
And this was for the reason
of mechanical equilibrium.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.260
These off-diagonal terms, sigma
ij and sigma ij, we saw,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.160
exerted a torque on a body.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.900
And unless they were equal,
the body would undergo an

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.830
angular acceleration.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.040
And then we renumbered these
according to the convention

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.670
that as we would march down the
diagonal of the tensor and

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:39.170
take pairs of subscripts, 1 1,
2 2, 3 3, represent them by a

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:45.095
single 1, 2, and 3, then march
up the side to define a sigma

00:10:45.095 --> 00:10:47.960
4, sigma 5, and a sigma 6.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.410
If you remember that little
algorithm you can always keep

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:55.180
straight what these reduced
subscripts represent.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.080
So with that definition, then,
the stress tensor reduced to

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:09.490
sigma 1, sigma 6, sigma 5, sigma
6, sigma 2, sigma 4,

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:17.755
sigma 5, sigma 4, sigma 3.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:26.090
And that takes a tensor and
degrades it to a matrix.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.520
Because there is no law of
transformation for this

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.780
representation of the
elements of stress.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:40.860
OK, then we do something very
similar with the strain

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:48.990
tensor, epsilon 1 1, 1 2, 1 3,
epsilon 2 1, epsilon 2 2,

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.970
epsilon 2 3, epsilon 3 1,
epsilon 3 2, epsilon 3 3.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.750
And we saw that for physical
reasons this tensor also had

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:01.860
to be symmetric.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:12.430
We had to have epsilon ij
identical to epsilon ji, the

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.750
reason being that if these
off-diagonal shear strains

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.840
were not equal, the state that
we would be defining was one

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:27.280
of actual deformation combined
with rigid body rotation.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.840
So unless this was the case,
the definition performed by

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.630
the tensor epsilon iij
would define rigid

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.350
body notation as well.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.830
OK.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:47.180
We use the same process of
renumbering to convert this

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.580
from a tensor to a matrix.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.450
And we got this into a form,
epsilon 1, epsilon 6, epsilon

00:12:54.450 --> 00:13:02.792
5, epsilon 6, epsilon 2, epsilon
4, epsilon 5, epsilon

00:13:02.792 --> 00:13:04.510
4, epsilon 3.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.800
But in order to do that,
we saw we had to

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.140
consume a factor of two.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.690
So there is a factor of
two built into the

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.410
off-diagonal terms.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:28.210
And what we have put in here
is we converted this to

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:35.010
actually epsilon 1, 1/2, epsilon
6, 1/2, epsilon 5.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.190
And I should have written that
this way to begin with.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:45.480
So all these factors of two
appear so that when we combine

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:52.550
these epsilons we get a nice,
clean matrix relation between

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.430
stress and strain that doesn't
involve factors of two.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.190
And that's a great convenience
if we're going to be doing all

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.510
of our deformation within
the framework of

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.760
one coordinate system.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.800
OK.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.550
So if we now use these
definitions to write the

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.830
stress in terms of strain, we
will set up our fourth rank

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.580
tensor property.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:30.510
If we do this first for the
stress in terms of strain, you

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.250
would have a tensor element of
stress sigma 1 1, which would

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:47.270
be equal to C1 1 1 1 times
epsilon 1 1 plus C1 1 2 2,

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:55.950
epsilon 2 2 plus C1 1
3 3, epsilon 3 3.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:05.440
And then we would have, in
addition, off-diagonal

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.560
elements of strain.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:21.990
We'd have C1 1 2 3 times epsilon
2 3 plus C1 1 3 2

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:34.590
times epsilon 3 2 plus C1 1 2 1,
epsilon 2 1 plus C1 1 1 2,

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.790
epsilon 1 2 plus C1 1--

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.720
and I should have made this 1
3 so that the other integers

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.970
come out right.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:16:02.815
And C1 1 1 2 times an epsilon 1
1 1 2 plus a C 1 1 2 1 times

00:16:02.815 --> 00:16:05.040
an epsilon 2 1.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.000
So that is one line
of the relation

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.230
between stress and strain.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:16.570
And when we condense this to a
matrix form, it is surprising,

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.530
once we expand it once more,
at how cumbersome this

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.250
expression is.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.450
Now, why do I remind
you of all this?

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.710
Isn't it nice to work in the
form of a fixed coordinate

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:32.335
system where we can use a
matrix for the Cijkl's?

00:16:32.335 --> 00:16:37.500
The answer is, fine, unless
you want to change the

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.050
coordinate system.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.780
And you might want to do that
for practical reasons such as

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:49.270
cutting out a specimen which
makes it convenient to define

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.820
the stiffnesses and compliances
relative to a

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:57.770
coordinate system taken
along the logical

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.640
directions in the specimen.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.140
And the other reason for doing
it, and that is what I want to

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.089
do a little bit of this
afternoon, is to derive the

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.710
symmetry restrictions on the
stiffnesses and compliances.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.890
You cannot transform a matrix
representation of the

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.319
stiffness or the compliance.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.160
You can only do this for the
full-blown tensor arrangement.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.680
So having collapsed down, which
we'll do momentarily

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.470
just to remind you of how it
goes, we will have to expand

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:30.120
again to derive symmetry
restrictions.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.580
Do not exit at this point.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.180
We're not going to do any of
these calculations in their

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.520
full glory detail.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.020
We'll just set up the problem
and then jump immediately to

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.660
the outset.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.570
So how does this pay out if we
try to make the condensation?

00:17:47.570 --> 00:18:00.670
I remind you again that the
symbol C stands for stiffness,

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:10.010
and the symbol S, which we'll
see later, the Sijkl's are

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.260
call compliances.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:20.630
And the perversity of that
semantic description of these

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:25.380
tensor elements is perverse for
reasons that I have never

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.500
really been able
to understand.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.930
So if we go down to matrix form,
we'll write instead of

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.230
sigma 1 1, simply sigma 1 1.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:41.880
We'll call this C1 1 times
epsilon 1 plus C1 2

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.620
times epsilon 2.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.180
So far so good.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.560
C1 3 times epsilon 3.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.580
And now we have problems,
because epsilon 2 3 was

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.360
defined as 1/2 of epsilon 5.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.990
Now we'll have a C1
5 here, and then a

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:11.930
C1 3 2 is C1 5 again.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.580
And this also is 1/2
of epsilon 5.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.900
And then similarly,
this is C1--

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.350
I'm sorry.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.600
This is C1 4.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:35.540
This is C1 5 times 1/2 of
epsilon 5 plus C1 5 times 1/2

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:45.760
of epsilon 5 plus C1 6 times
1/2 of epsilon 6 plus C1 6

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.010
times 1/2 of epsilon 6.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:56.090
So this, given the way in which
we had defined matrix

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.660
strain, initially in
connection with

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.680
piezoelectricity when we entered
the realm of third

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.520
rank tensors, this
will play out OK.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:12.780
This says that sigma 1 is simply
C1 epsilon 1 plus C1 2

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.280
times epsilon 2 plus C1
3 times epsilon 3.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.310
And now the 1/2 gets absorbed,
and it's simply C1 4 times

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.900
epsilon 4, and so on.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.410
If we look at another line, one
that involves some of the

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:37.740
off-diagonal terms and strain,
if we, for example, look at

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:46.330
sigma 2 3 and we write this down
as sigma 2 3 times 1 1

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:58.180
times epsilon 1 1 plus C2 3 2 2
times epsilon 2 2 plus C2 3

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:07.670
3 3 times epsilon 3 3 plus C--

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.040
and I'll just write down a few
of these additional terms.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:22.330
This would be C2 3 3 2 times
epsilon 3 2 plus C2 3 2 3,

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.390
epsilon 2 3, and then other
terms for additional terms,

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.560
and epsilon ij with i not equal
to j, which are going to

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.490
behave the same way.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.870
So if we convert this, we go
to sigma, and we would call

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.120
this sigma 4.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:46.560
This would be C4 1 in matrix
notation times epsilon 1 plus

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:55.390
C4 2 time epsilon 2 2 plus
C4 3 times epsilon 3.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:59.620
And now this matrix element
would be C4 4.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.810
And in place of the tensor
element of strain epsilon 3 2,

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.500
we would write 1/2
of epsilon 4.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:18.780
And the next term is again a C4
4 times a 1/2 epsilon 4 and

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.370
the terms in epsilon 5
and epsilon 6 would

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.830
behave the same way.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.200
So you can see that the factor
2 is absorbed, and this

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:32.030
becomes simply C4 4
times epsilon 4.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.460
So all the factors of
2 have disappeared.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:40.070
And we can say, provided we
remember the way we have

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:45.580
condensed the elements of tensor
strain, we can say with

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.750
complete confidence that in our
matrix notation, sigma i

00:22:50.750 --> 00:23:01.530
is Cij times epsilon j where i
goes 1, 2, and 3, and j goes

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.965
1, 2, 3 all the way up to six.

00:23:07.176 --> 00:23:09.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.240
PROFESSOR: No.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.140
No, no, these are the--

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:13.740
yeah, I'm sorry.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.990
Yeah, inj.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.660
So it's a six by six
matrix, right.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.380
Right you are.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.400
And this is a six by six.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.192
And in here are 36 businesses
stiffnesses.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:48.040
OK, any comments other
than, yuck?

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.430
And again, if you stay
in one coordinate

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.530
system it's not so bad.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:54.950
In fact, instead of having nine
by nine 81 terms you have

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.000
36 stiffnesses.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.455
And that's a great
convenience.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:18.150
Unfortunately, things are not
quite so simple if we work

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.720
with the compliances represented
by the symbol S.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:30.490
And if we attempt to write
strain in terms of stress,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:38.245
we'll have an S1 1 1
1 times sigma 1.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:52.550
We'll have an S1 1 2 2 times
sigma 2 2 plus an S1 1 3 3

00:24:52.550 --> 00:25:02.444
times a sigma 3 3 plus an S1 1
2 3 times a sigma 2 3 plus an

00:25:02.444 --> 00:25:15.590
S1 1 3 2 times a sigma 3 2,
and an S1 1 2 3 3 1 times

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:23.520
sigma 3 1 plus an S1 1 3 times
a sigma 1 3, and then other

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.790
off-diagonal terms which I
won't bother to mention.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:32.200
So if we convert this to matrix
form, epsilon 1 1 would

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.550
be replaced by the matrix
term epsilon 1.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:44.980
S1 1 1 1 would become S1 1, and
this would be sigma 1, and

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:55.325
an S1 2 times a sigma 2, plus
and S1 3 times sigma 3.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:03.370
And now we have a problem,
Houston.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:12.270
Because we would have an S1 4
times a sigma 4 plus an S1 4

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.380
times sigma 4.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:21.950
And now in the sigmas there is
no factor 1/2 in the matrix

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:26.520
representation of stress as
there was with strain.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.770
Because we ate the factor
of 2 in defining strain.

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.580
But now there is no factor
of 2 and stress.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.020
So we're going to have to
do something with that.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:41.790
So this would give us some
additional terms, S1 5 times

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:47.210
sigma 5, and then an S1 5
times a sigma 5 again.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.990
So what are we going to do?

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.860
Again, we're stuck.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:27:01.530
We can either say that epsilon
i is equal to Sij times sigma

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:11.350
j if j is not equal
to 4, 5, or 6.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:15.170
Or we can absorb, again, a
factor of 2 in the definition

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.510
of the compliances.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.060
And that, again, since we will
usually be working in one, and

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.650
the same coordinate system, is
the convenient thing to do.

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:30.600
So what we will do is
to define this as S1

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.480
4 times sigma 4.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:42.450
And in so doing, we have to
combine the factor of 2 into

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.600
the definition of S1 4.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:53.250
So S1 4 would be equal to 1/2
of S1 1 2 3 plus S1 1 3 2.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.840
So it's going to be 1/2 of one
of these equal terms that

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.880
involve one on-diagonal
subscript and one

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.930
off-diagonal subscript.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:14.730
So this is the only way we're
going to be able to write a

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.185
nice, clean matrix
representation.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.536
Things get worse.

00:28:22.536 --> 00:28:23.390
AUDIENCE: Sir?

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.180
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.590
AUDIENCE: You're sure
of your [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:34.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this would
be equal to 2S1 4.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.160
I'm sure it's 1/2.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.240
I'm not sure of what term
would go in front.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.370
So I would have 2S1
4 times sigma 4.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:43.710
And if I want to write this--

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.340
I'm sorry.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:50.480
Let me go back to the full
matrix expression.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:29:00.580
I would have S1 1 2 3 times
sigma 2 3 plus S1 1 3 2

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.640
times sigma 3 2.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.920
I know that sigma 2 3 is equal
to sigma 3 2, so I could write

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:18.490
this as S1 1 2 3 plus S1 1 3 2
just simply times sigma 2 3,

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:19.810
one of them.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:25.860
Now what I would really like to
do is to write this as S1.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.250
Let's change this to sigma 4.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.590
I would like to write
this as S1 4.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.800
So it follows then that
S1 4 is equal to S1 2

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.570
3 plus S1 1 3 2.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:45.060
And that is the other way
around, isn't it?

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:45.930
Thank you.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.593
I knew there was a factor of
1/2, but it goes in here.

00:29:48.593 --> 00:29:52.204
AUDIENCE: And then there's
no 2 at all.

00:29:52.204 --> 00:29:56.578
If you wanted to say that S1 1
2 3 is equal to S, 1 1 3 2,

00:29:56.578 --> 00:30:00.480
then you would have S1
4 equal to 2S1 1 3 2.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.140
PROFESSOR: OK, you're
right, you're right.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.090
So it's this.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.090
Let's leave it at that.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:09.740
But if these are equal, we could
say-- and we did show

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.950
that the compliance tensor is
symmetric, so we could say

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:25.405
that this is equal to
2S1 1 2 3 or 2S1 1 3

00:30:25.405 --> 00:30:27.560
2 as they're equal.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.370
I told you it was going to get
bad, but I didn't think I

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:42.380
would be contributing to it
the extent that I am.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.450
I don't know if you really want
to see this, but this

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:50.708
gets even worse when we deal
with something like epsilon 2

00:30:50.708 --> 00:30:57.450
3, where this is a term
that would be

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.015
replaced by epsilon 4.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.260
And then all of our absorbed
factors come back to haunt us.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.540
Let me go through
this quickly.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:19.640
This would be S2 3 1 1 times
sigma 1 1 plus S2 3 2 2 times

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:38.445
sigma 2 2 plus S2 3 3
3 times sigma 3 3.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:47.590
And then we'll have these terms,
off-diagonal terms S2 3

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:59.720
3 1, sigma 3 1 plus S2 3 1 3
times sigma 1 3, and so on,

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.970
other terms.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:11.900
OK, and going from epsilon 2 3
to epsilon 4, we have to put

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.220
on a factor 1/2.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:26.520
And that says that that 1/2 is
going to create problems in

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.090
the first term in
this expansion.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.050
We'd call this sigma 1 1.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:33.870
We'd like to call this S4 1.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:39.290
But what is S4 1 from what
we have defined here?

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.460
It's the sum of two
tensor elements.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:53.110
So we will have to define, now,
again, S4 1 equals the

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.220
same as we did before.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:04.180
It's going to be equal to the
term S2 3 1 1 plus S3 2 1 1 1.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:13.060
And therefore if I put a 1/2 in
this definition, then that

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.000
will cancel, so far.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.040
But then in the terms that
come down in the lower

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.370
quadrant of the matrix--

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:23.320
and I will just right
in two terms.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:29.852
We've got an S2 3 31 that
we would write as S4

00:33:29.852 --> 00:33:39.920
4 times sigma 4.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:47.370
And then I would have another
term, S4 4 times sigma 4.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:57.090
But the S4 4 really is a sum
of two tensor elements.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:05.490
So my definition of an S4
4 is that it should be--

00:34:09.395 --> 00:34:12.639
AUDIENCE: Isn't that sigma
5 [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.879
PROFESSOR: You're right,
you're right.

00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:17.420
Yeah, this is 5.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.900
So this was right, 3 1,
and this is sigma 5.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.130
You're right.

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:27.755
And I go to S4 5, yeah.

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:34.920
No, sigma--

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.668
OK, yeah.

00:34:37.668 --> 00:34:40.760
OK, let me cut to the chase.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.960
What we're going to have to do
is to put in not the factor

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.940
1/2 that we had here,
but there's going to

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.350
be a factor 4 that--

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:51.600
something like S--

00:34:55.192 --> 00:34:56.620
which one are we dealing with?

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:17.950
Things like S2 3 3 1,
something like S4--

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.440
and we're dealing with 5.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:34.840
S4 5 is going to be defined as
S1, S2 3 1 3 plus S2 3 3 1

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:41.040
plus S3 2 1 3 plus S3 2 3 1.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:52.090
So we're going to have to put in
a factor of 1/4 in front of

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:57.930
the S4 5 in order to accommodate
for those terms.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:05.090
So our definition, then, in
going from tensor compliances

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:10.060
to matrix compliances is
much more complicated.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.820
And the rule-- and just to
summarize this, I gave you a

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.510
handout last time.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.810
The necessary conventions to
absorb these factors of 2 and

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.450
4 is that--

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.105
and I didn't bring it with me.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.480
OK, I just simply did not
bring it with me.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.110
So I wouldn't attempt
to summarize it.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:53.980
All right.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:57.370
So hopefully I've convinced you
of nothing other than that

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.320
these conversions are messy.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:15.200
But the summary is that for the
compliances, the Sijkl,

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:26.700
you take this equal to
Slm if l and m are

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:32.590
equal to 1, 2, or 3.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:54.550
Then you have to replace Sijkl
by 1/2 of Slm if i, j, or kl

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:58.710
is 4, 5, or 6.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:07.620
And then you have to write Sijkl
as 1/4 of Slm if i, j,

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:15.870
and kl are 4, 5, or 6.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.450
But once you're into the
coordinate system, which will

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:26.630
be fixed in matrix notation,
things are simple, since you

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:29.030
don't have to worry about
these factors of 2 or 3.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.650
The reason I did this is I
would like to now talk a

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:42.070
little bit about how one can
define important scalar moduli

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.430
that describe a particular
phenomenon.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:47.840
If you ask the question, how do
mechanical properties vary

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:54.500
with direction, we've got six
unique elements of stress.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.080
And we've got six independent
elements of

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.980
strain that can work.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.340
And if you wanted to show how
each one of those elements

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.160
varied with the other
one, you'd need 36--

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.640
6 times 6, 36--

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.530
representation surfaces
and this is

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.590
not going to be fruitful.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.010
So just as we did for
piezoelectricity where we

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:20.230
could define a scalar modulus
which represented the

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:24.190
component of polarization normal
to a very thin plate--

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:27.540
making it a thin plate means
you're going to measure

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.610
primarily the charge on the
large surface, because

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.200
polarization is charge
per unit area.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.740
So if you looked at the surface
of a plate with x1

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.960
normal to the plate, you are
going to have a specimen that

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.840
primarily gives you a measure
of P1, or the charge on a

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.050
surface normal to x1.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:53.060
And then you could apply any
of six different states of

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.390
simple stress.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:58.250
And one thing that you could
do is squeeze it with the

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.350
tensile stress in the same
direction as the

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:01.390
normal to the surface.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:04.775
And that was the longitudinal
piezoelectric modulus.

00:40:04.775 --> 00:40:09.530
Then on the quiz you looked at
another modulus that related a

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:16.580
component of polarization on
another surface in response to

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:22.290
a tensile stress that was
not parallel to it.

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:25.630
There are a number of such
moduli and mechanical

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.760
properties.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:32.210
Probably the most important
one is something called

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:35.100
Young's modulus, which I'm
sure you've all heard of.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:48.490
And Young's modulus involves
taking a very long rod of the

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:52.560
material and hanging
a weight on it.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.390
And that weight will
induce a strain.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:03.940
And if we take this as the
direction of x1, we will, with

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:09.350
Young's modulus, relate the
change of length to the

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:11.220
initial length of the rod.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.130
And my question now is,
rhetorically, do we want to do

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:24.895
this in terms of stiffnesses
or compliances?

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.780
Does it make any difference?

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.650
Yeah, makes a lot of difference
in terms of the

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.670
simplicity of the result
that you get.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:41.460
Suppose we wanted to do this in
terms of the compliances.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.775
What we'd be then applying
would be a sigma 1.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.990
And this would be given
by the compliance C1 1

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:57.990
times the strain E1.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.750
That looks like exactly
what we want.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:04.590
This delta l over l for this
one-dimensional specimen with

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:07.990
a one-dimensional directional
applied stress, this would be

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:10.710
simply epsilon 1.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.700
And that's force per
unit area here.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.680
This would be sigma 1 1.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:20.070
And it looks as though what we
want is a C1 1 1 that relates

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:21.510
a sigma 1 1 to an epsilon 1 1.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:29.070
Is this going to be a definition
that I would want

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.650
to make for describing this?

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.600
My colleague here shakes his
head very seriously.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.920
No.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.069
Do you want to share
your reservation?

00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:44.999
AUDIENCE: Because as I recall,
Young's modulus, once strain

00:42:44.999 --> 00:42:48.203
is weaker output [INAUDIBLE]
in terms of stress you're

00:42:48.203 --> 00:42:52.080
going to want a compliance.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.940
PROFESSOR: That's one answer.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.826
AUDIENCE: You could
theoretically get either one

00:42:55.826 --> 00:42:57.076
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.420
PROFESSOR: If I could restate
your objection, we can't

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.650
impose a strain to
get a stress.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:09.630
We really stresses the
independent variable,

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:10.880
practically speaking.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.640
We can stress it, but we can't
instantly say, [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.400
develop a epsilon 1.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.292
Yeah?

00:43:16.292 --> 00:43:17.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.970
PROFESSOR: You betcha.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:20.660
That's the reason.

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.490
Added onto this is not only this
term, but there will be a

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:27.930
C1 2 times epsilon 2 plus
a C1 3 times an

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.780
epsilon 3, and so on.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.860
So we're not going to be able
to get a nice, tidy relation

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:37.120
between the tensile strain that
we're measuring and the

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.580
tensile uniaxial stress that
is produced there.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:47.270
So the relation of stress in
terms of strain that involves

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:51.020
the stiffnesses is just
not going to work.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:59.550
But if we would instead express
epsilon1 in terms of a

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:06.844
compliance, a matrix compliance
S1 1 times sigma 1,

00:44:06.844 --> 00:44:09.100
that's all that she wrote.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.010
We're measuring this by design
by selecting an elongated

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:18.220
specimen for which we'll
primarily be seeing epsilon 1.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.230
This is not to say these
other strains exist.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:28.460
There will be lateral strains
here that will be epsilon 2

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.500
and epsilon 3.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.510
There will be shear strains.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:34.080
Sounds mind-boggling.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.803
You pull the sample in
this direction, and

00:44:36.803 --> 00:44:38.200
what it does is shear.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.430
Well, if this were a single
crystal, that would happen.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:43.000
And these would be other
components of deformation.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.740
But if we measure a pi sigma 1
and measure epsilon 1, then

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.990
this is the way we have
to define it.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:58.470
And the definition of Young's
modulus is that 1 over S1 1 is

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.620
sigma 1 over epsilon 1.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.265
And this is Young's modulus.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:17.660
I would hasten to observe that
it is unfortunate that this

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:22.900
very practical modulus involves
the S's, which have

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:27.230
all these complicated
factors of 2 and 4.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:33.760
And therefore, if we try to go
to a particular symmetry and

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.360
ask the question, how does
Young's modulus change as we

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.700
cut this rod in different
orientations

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:42.950
from the single crystal.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:52.690
So I would like to illustrate
for you how we would do this.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.030
I'm going to take a very,
very simple example.

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:10.370
If you look in the table of
symmetry restrictions that I

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:17.570
passed out a couple of times
ago, prior to the quiz, for an

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:26.740
isotropic the tensor has a
different form than it does

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.960
for a cubic crystal.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.940
Cubic crystals are elastically
anisotropic.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:35.520
But the form of the stiffness
tensor for an isotropic

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:44.255
material was S1 1, S1 2,
S1 2, 0, 0, 0, S1 2, S1

00:46:44.255 --> 00:46:48.730
1, S1 2, 0, 0, 0.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:52.980
Then the diagonal terms, if the
material was isotropic,

00:46:52.980 --> 00:47:00.460
was 2s1 1 minus S1 2 for this
term, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, and

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:09.035
again, a 2S1 1 minus S1 2 plus
a 0, and then 0, 0, 0, 0, 2S1

00:47:09.035 --> 00:47:11.060
1 minus S1 2.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.870
OK.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:19.840
Let me now derive Young's
modulus as a function of

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:25.330
direction and show that,
in fact, this says that

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:29.730
regardless how you orient the
rod, the value of Young's

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.110
modulus will stay the same.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.230
Let me also do something else
first, though, which is

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:43.940
something we should have
scratched our head over when

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.200
we first encountered it.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.420
Here's something curious.

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.480
When we looked at symmetry
constraints on single

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:08.720
crystals, we found that for a
cubic crystal, C6 6 had to be

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:17.420
equal to 1/2 of C1 1 minus C1
2 if the stiffnesses were to

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:24.830
be independent for all symmetry
transformations.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:33.580
For the compliances, however,
we found that S6 6 had to be

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:40.170
equal to 2 times S1
1 minus S1 2.

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:44.010
Two very different equalities
between tensor elements to

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:49.800
make the elastic behavior be
invariant to the symmetry

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.520
transformations of
a cubic crystal.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.160
How come?

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.680
How come these are
so different?

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.920
Well, they have to be, in terms
of the tensor, the same

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.640
sort of a quality.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.850
And the reason they don't look
the same is because of our

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:09.350
different absorption of the
factors of 2 and 4 in defining

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:15.810
the stiffnesses an in defining
the compliances.

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:21.650
Remember that for the Cijkl's
there was no factor of 2 or 4

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:24.830
introduced in defining
the matrix elements.

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:26.820
So this one is OK.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.790
This is a true equality between
tensor elements, for

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:33.045
any tensor whatsoever of fourth

00:49:33.045 --> 00:49:35.770
rank for a cubic crystal.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:39.380
For these terms, these
are off-diagonal.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.730
This is an off-diagonal
compliance.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:52.550
And our definition is that Sijkl
is equal to Smn, for m

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:56.070
and n not equal to 4, 5, or 6.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:57.920
Here's this crazy thing again.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:08.560
It's equal to 1/2 of Smn for
m or n equal to 4, 5, or 6.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:16.470
And it's equal to 1/4
of Smn for m and n

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:20.330
equal to 4, 5, or 6.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:29.075
So S6 6 here is actually
4S1 2 1 2.

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:41.080
And that's supposedly equal to
2S1 1, which is really S1 1 1,

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.330
minus S1 1 2 2.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:53.550
And this says that 1/2 of S1
2 1 2 is equal to S1 1 1 1

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:56.170
minus S1 1 2 2.

00:50:56.170 --> 00:51:02.850
So this is exactly the same
constraint on tensor elements,

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:05.900
when we take out these
factors of 2 and 4

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.130
that have been absorbed.

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.760
So this, in fact, although it
looks very different with

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:13.230
those factors absorbed, is
exactly this same relation.

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:17.360
So the symmetry constraint
is the same.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.208
AUDIENCE: How'd you
get 1/2 there?

00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:20.140
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.860
How did I get 1/2 here?

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:29.770
It's 4S1 2 2 had to be equal
to 2S1 1 minus S1 2.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:31.220
And this was the equality.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.190
I'm working up this way.

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:36.780
So this was the statement in
the matrix forms of the

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.010
compliances that I handed out.

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:40.770
Looks different from the
term on the left.

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:45.400
So I wrote this now in terms
of the matrix elements.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.270
And the factor of
4 comes in here.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:53.300
The 2 was here in the equality
that had to be held that the

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.640
tensors stay invariant.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.340
And if I bring this 2 over on
the left-hand side, it's

00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:58.896
exactly the same as when--

00:51:58.896 --> 00:51:59.888
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
it be 2 now?

00:51:59.888 --> 00:52:01.138
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:03.856 --> 00:52:05.344
[INAUDIBLE] the right side.

00:52:09.312 --> 00:52:12.220
PROFESSOR: No, this is just
replacement of the matrix

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:15.352
terms with the definition
of the tensor.

00:52:15.352 --> 00:52:16.828
AUDIENCE: Right, but
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:16.828 --> 00:52:18.796
AUDIENCE: You're just dividing
4 by 2, right?

00:52:18.796 --> 00:52:20.272
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:52:20.272 --> 00:52:22.732
AUDIENCE: So wouldn't that
make [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:22.732 --> 00:52:24.208
PROFESSOR: Oh, ha, OK.

00:52:24.208 --> 00:52:26.504
AUDIENCE: You want to be able
to [INAUDIBLE] by 4, so it'd

00:52:26.504 --> 00:52:30.112
be S12 1 2 equals 1/2
the difference

00:52:30.112 --> 00:52:31.600
to be equal to that.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.865
PROFESSOR: OK, OK.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.280
Thank you.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.860
OK, let me then go back to
what I started out to do.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:53.630
And I will write just one line
of how we would go about

00:52:53.630 --> 00:53:00.630
expanding this just to indicate
how intricate it is,

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:03.690
and then I'll give a few
examples for two point groups

00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:05.575
of how Young's modulus varies
with direction.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:09.130
OK.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:17.060
What we're going to say, then,
is that one of these

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:27.990
compliances, S1 1 1 1 prime is
going to be equal to l 1/4

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:40.980
times S1 1 1 1 plus l 2/4 times
S2 2 2 2 plus l 3/4

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.230
times S3 3 3 3 .

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:54.340
And just now doing what we know,
that any Sijkl prime is

00:53:54.340 --> 00:54:07.740
going to be Cii, Cj capital J,
Ck capital K, Cl capital L--

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:11.110
these are direction cosines
now, not stiffnesses--

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:12.360
times Sijkl.

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:21.290
So it's a quadrupole summation
over all of the non-zero

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:22.230
tensor elements.

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:24.640
So what I'm doing now is
taking these terms and

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.480
expanding them to the
full tensor form.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:33.670
So S1 1 1 1 prime, that's
the first term in

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.950
the transformed tensor.

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:46.860
That's going to be these terms
plus l1l2 squared times S1 1 2

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:54.558
2 plus S2 2 1 1 plus l1 squared
l3 squared times S1 1

00:54:54.558 --> 00:55:06.920
3 3 plus S3 3 1 1, and then
still another term, l2 squared

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:12.350
l3 squared times S2 2
3 3 plus S3 3 2 2.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:25.330
And then there will be terms
of the form l2 squared l3

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:38.100
squared times, again, four
terms, S3 2 3 2 plus S1 2 3 3

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:48.280
plus S2 3 3 2 plus S2 3 2 3, and
then similarly, terms in

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:54.260
the squares of l1 and l2, and
these would involve four terms

00:55:54.260 --> 00:56:00.340
of the form S1 2 1 2 plus
permutation 0, and then l1

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:09.080
squared l3 squared times, again,
four terms, S1 3 1 3

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.520
and permutation 0
for four terms.

00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:15.420
OK.

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.510
So what do we have now?

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:23.580
We have an expression
for S1 1 1 1 prime.

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:33.210
And this is, in fact, 1 over
Young's modulus E. And we've

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:38.560
done this summation over the
supposed non-zero tensor

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:43.565
elements in the matrix for
an isotropic material.

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:50.390
And if I simplify this, and
this will be just one more

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:58.600
tedious and then we can see,
that is for these equalities,

00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:04.110
we ought to, for l1, l2, l3,
get the same value, S1 1.

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:06.020
And that is indeed
what happens.

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:11.070
So the summation, if I simplify,
is l 1/4 times S1 1

00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:19.850
plus l 2.4 times S2 2 plus
l 3/4 times S3 3.

00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:26.240
And then a collection of terms
plus l1 squared l2 squared, S1

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.860
2 plus S2 1.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:38.570
And then similar terms in l1 and
l3, l1 squared l3 squared,

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:47.160
S1 3 plus S 3 1 plus l2 squared
l3 squared times

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.050
S2 3 plus S3 2.

00:57:54.400 --> 00:58:00.231
And then some terms that stand
by themselves, l2 squared l3

00:58:00.231 --> 00:58:11.410
squared times S4 4 plus l1
squared l2 squared S6 6 plus

00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:14.620
l1 squared plus l3 squared
times S5 5.

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:23.620
And consolidating this, this is
going to be equal to l 1/4

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:32.700
plus l 2/4 plus l
3/4 times S1 1.

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:37.760
And then combining terms in the
second power of direction

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:43.110
cosines, l1 squared l2 squared
plus l1 squared l3 squared

00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:44.960
plus l2 squared l3 squared.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:57.190
And this is all times 2S1 2
plus 2S1 1 minus 2S1 2.

00:58:57.190 --> 00:59:00.260
So S1 2 drops out.

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:10.170
And all this will be simply l
1/4 plus l 2/4 plus l 3/4.

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:13.570
And then I'll add in the other
terms here that involve

00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:16.085
products of squares of
direction cosines.

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:28.400
And all this is times S1 1.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.660
But this turns out to be equal
to simply l1 squared plus l2

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:36.480
squared plus l3 squared, the
sum of the squares of the

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:42.900
direction cosines of our rod,
quantity squared times S1 1.

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:46.060
And this term inside the
parentheses is 1.

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:54.830
So indeed, S1 1 prime
is equal to S1 1.

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:59.600
So the value of Young's modulus
has not changed with

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:05.260
direction if the form of the
compliance tensor is like so.

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:13.600
And I think you would probably
have taken my word for that,

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.370
but it was intended primarily as
an example of how, when S1

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:22.630
1 prime is the reciprocal of
Young's modulus, how you would

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:26.260
set up a transformation
for S1 1 prime.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:30.660
And the form of this polynomial
would be exactly

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.090
the same, even for a triclinic
crystal, if you included all

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:38.220
the non-zero terms
in this fashion.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.880
All right, so let me wrap things
up in another couple

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:49.530
minutes for some cases that
are real symmetries, where

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:51.060
Young's modulus is
anisotropic.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:01:01.360
And working in exactly the same
way for the tensor that

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:08.390
is the appropriate one for a
cubic crystal, we would lift

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:13.700
out the form of the
stiffness matrix.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.540
The reciprocal of Young's
modulus is S1 1 prime, so what

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.310
we're saying is we have
a long, skinny rod.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.200
This is x1.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.740
And what we're doing, if this
is a single crystal, is

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:30.730
examining how Young's modulus
changes as we change the

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:35.030
direction of the rod to a new
orientation, x1 prime, that's

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:41.220
described by direction cosines
l1, l2, L3, relative to x1.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:47.670
The expression that results by
exactly the process that we

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:53.400
muddled through a moment ago is
that for a cubic crystal,

01:01:53.400 --> 01:02:05.470
the form of S1 1 prime as a
function of direction does

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:07.160
indeed give anisotropy.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:16.420
Isaiah It's S1 1 minus 2
times S1 1 minus S1 2

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:20.450
minus 1/2 of S4 4.

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:24.090
Remember, for a cubic crystal, 1
1, 2 2, and 1 4 are the only

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:25.700
non-zero terms.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:29.285
And then this is times a
polynomial l1 squared l2

01:02:29.285 --> 01:02:36.520
squared plus l2 squared
l3 squared plus

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.150
l3 squared l1 squared.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:44.120
So this is, again the reciprocal
of Young's modulus.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:50.460
And it turns out to have a
constant term, S1 1 , which is

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.620
what we found for the
isotropic material.

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:59.070
But from that, as the direction
cosines change, we

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:04.475
subtract off a term that is a
linear combination of 1 1, 1

01:03:04.475 --> 01:03:07.930
2, and 4 4.

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:15.100
So the question is, is this
positive or negative?

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.360
The direction cosines are all
squared, so this term here is

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.960
always going to be positive.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.860
So are we going to take the
thing that we found for an

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:29.150
isotropic material, which was
a constant, Young's modulus,

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:34.570
which was 1 over S1 1 prime,
and that's equal to the

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:37.670
Young's modulus E.

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:42.020
Are we going to add or subtract
something to it?

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:46.830
Well, it turns out that if you
look at real materials, it can

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:49.960
be either positive
or negative.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.355
It's usually positive.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:02.350
So that says we are going to
subtract off a term which goes

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:05.620
as products of squares
of direction cosines.

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.970
And this is something that's
going to be zero along the

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:14.790
direction 1 0 0.

01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:22.640
So along the reference axes
x1, x2, x3, which if you

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.900
remember, where this form of
the matrix came from was

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:30.570
taking the axes along the edges
of the cubic crystal.

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:35.730
It turns out that this is going
to be equal to 1/3 along

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:37.040
the direction 1 1 1.

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:51.300
So if this term is plus, nothing
gets added onto the

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:55.410
surface in the directions that
correspond to the four-fold

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:59.900
axes or the twofold axes
of a cubic crystal.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.440
Nothing gets added
on if it's plus.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:07.690
But along the body diagonals,
this takes on a value of 1 3,

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:10.360
so a positive thing
gets added on.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.420
And the best way I can describe
this surface-- it's

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:14.910
not a simple surface--

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:20.470
it looks like a cube
with fuzzy edges.

01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:23.330
So we had a cube and started
to dissolve it.

01:05:23.330 --> 01:05:25.930
So this is how the reciprocal
of Young's

01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:27.760
modulus varies with direction.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.280
If, on the other hand, this
term is negative--

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.690
so this is what you get
if it's positive.

01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:47.150
If it's negative, again, you
start with the basic isotropic

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:51.650
variation of 1 over S1 1 1.

01:05:51.650 --> 01:06:00.490
If it is negative, and there's
one metal, that's molybdenum--

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:04.480
molybdenum has a negative value
of these compliances.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:15.002
It looks like a surface that has
indentations along the 1 1

01:06:15.002 --> 01:06:16.440
1 direction.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.760
So it looks like something
with a dimple in it.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:28.820
There is a final case, which
is not realized for any

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:33.070
material that I know
of, if that term is

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:34.320
0, then it's isotropic.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.800
Let me give you one other
variation that comes straight

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.270
out of [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:53.320
And this is for a hexagonal
crystal that might be a

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.010
hexagonal close-packed
crystal.

01:06:57.010 --> 01:07:01.810
For zinc specifically, which
is a hexagonal close-packed

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:12.810
metal, the form of the matrix is
S1 1, S1 2, S1 3, 0, 0, 0,

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:24.880
S1 1, S1 2, 0, 0, 0, S3 3,
0, 0, 0, S4 4, 0, 0, S4

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.260
4, 0, and S4 4.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:35.470
In the values of these specific
compliances are 8.4

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:52.651
for S1 1, for S1 2 1.1, for S1
3, minus 7.8, for S3 3, 28.7,

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:56.940
for S4 4, 26.4.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:03.190
And these are all in units of
10 to the minus 12 meters

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:04.440
squared per Newton.

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.720
That's good old MKS units.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.090
It turns out that there are 10
to the 2 meters squared per

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:23.014
Newton per 1 centimeter
squared per dyne, if

01:08:23.014 --> 01:08:24.430
you like CGS units.

01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:38.729
The form of the reciprocal of
Young's modulus, it turns out

01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:40.369
to be a surface of revolution.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:48.290
This is x3, which is the
direction of C. And that's the

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:54.240
surface of revolution and the
value of S1 1 prime as a

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.930
function of the angle theta.

01:08:57.930 --> 01:09:00.950
That's the only parameter we
need examine the variation

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:03.660
with since it's a surface
of revolution.

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:09.930
S1 1 prime is equal to S1 1
times the sine of theta to the

01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:16.170
fourth power plus S3 3 times
the cosine of theta to the

01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:26.520
fourth power plus S4 4 plus
2S1 3 times sine squared

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:32.040
theta, cosine squared theta.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:35.439
So it's a fairly exotic surface,
even as a surface of

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:36.750
revolution.

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:40.680
And what this looks like, it's
something that peaks out at 3

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:47.810
times 10 to the minus 12
centimeters squared per dyne

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:51.630
along the direction of C. It's
something that comes down very

01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:55.740
sharply as you approach the
normal to the C axis.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:01.320
And then there's a cute little
wiggle just near the axis.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.680
So it looks something
like that.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.950
Not a terribly isotropic
surface, and a variation of

01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:12.060
Young's modulus of 3 to 1 in
the direction parallel to C

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.590
and perpendicular to C. So
there are lots of exotic

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:16.840
surfaces of this sort.

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:20.330
All right.

01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:21.850
I did run a little bit over.

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:26.350
And I will absent myself and
let you express yourself

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:29.420
candidly on the questionnaire.

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:34.140
Except for these numbers that
I just put up on the

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.410
blackboard, I haven't really
said anything about, much

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:39.240
about, numbers.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.900
So let me pass around some
examples, not for metals,

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.513
which we just looked
at, but for oxides.

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:58.360
And this is interesting, because
you'll remember there

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.330
was an additional equality
between the stiffnesses called

01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:04.020
the [? Kowshi ?]

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:08.270
equality, which was supposed to
hold for physical reasons,

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:11.840
not for reasons of symmetry, if
the forces were central, if

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.240
the crystal was under a state
of no stress, and if all of

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.690
the atoms were situated at
a center of symmetry.

01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:24.040
The first set of data that you
have on the top sheet is for

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.080
MGO, which is cubic.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.550
It's predominantly
ionic compounds.

01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:33.180
And the atoms are all
octahedrally coordinated.

01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:36.950
So all of the requirements
for the [? Kowshi ?]

01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:38.630
equality should hold.

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:42.465
And you can see they're
not really exact.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:46.070
And that's probably due to
the covalent character.

01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:51.860
The two different sets of data
here are for measurements by

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.000
two separate observers.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.290
The second page is for
aluminum oxide.

01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:02.300
And again, you see the order of
magnitudes of the numbers

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:05.710
on the order of 10 to the 12
dynes per centimeter squared

01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:09.875
in general, and variation from
one to another for a lumen of

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:11.285
a factor of about four.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.230
I meant to bring the book in,
but I left it behind in my

01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:19.950
rush to come off.

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:21.440
Where do you get
these numbers?

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.940
And it's hard to really find.

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:31.120
And the book from which I took
these data are by two workers,

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.430
Simmons and Wang.

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:41.980
And it's called Handbook
of Elastic Constants,

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:45.340
I think that is.

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.000
And this is a book that was
published by MIT Press.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.370
Valuable repository of data,
but it's all numbers.

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:58.860
And there are many, many
materials in here.

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:00.660
Simmons and Wang, interestingly,
are

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.180
geophysicists.

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:05.410
Why should geophysicists
care about stiffnesses?

01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:05.640
Why?

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.130
Because these guys are going all
over the face of the earth

01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:11.710
setting off little bits of
explosive that send off

01:13:11.710 --> 01:13:12.730
seismic waves.

01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:16.160
And they probed the interior
of the earth by the

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.760
propagation of elastic waves.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.930
And the elastic waves depend
on the square root of

01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:26.490
stiffnesses over the density
of the material.

01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:29.910
So they're very, very interested
in the elastic

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:33.120
properties of particularly
rock-forming minerals.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.400
Another interesting comment on
this book is that there is no

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:43.140
set of data for a single
triclinic crystal.

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:46.430
Too many stiffnesses that are
independent, I guess, and too

01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:50.560
few materials that, fortunately,
are anisotropic

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.810
and triclinic.

01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:55.660
OK, I am going to quit.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.800
And thank you for
your attention.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.620
You've been a good class.

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:05.480
And we've covered all sorts of
exotic aspects of the behavior

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.190
of crystalline materials.

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:11.245
And you might think with some
justification that you know

01:14:11.245 --> 01:14:14.210
all there is to know about
symmetry and tensor properties

01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:14.940
of materials.

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:17.100
But nevertheless, I would
caution you that you don't

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:18.630
know everything.

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:23.710
So I have a final handout fill
in the chinks, the cracks that

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:24.890
we've not been able to fill.

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:31.720
And this is a set of data that
is titled "Think You Know

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.050
Everything?" And this will fill
in some things that you

01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:38.366
really don't know.

01:14:38.366 --> 01:14:41.110
And it has a lot of very
useful items on here.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:45.280
For example, there are
293 different ways to

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.036
make change for $1.

01:14:48.036 --> 01:14:50.570
You didn't know that.

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:55.000
2/3 of the world's eggplant
is grown in New Jersey.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.630
I'm a native of New Jersey, and
even I didn't know that.

01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:01.790
The longest one-syllable word
in the English language is

01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:05.950
"screeched." OK.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.290
And so it goes.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.640
In most advertisements--

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.230
this is one I never checked
out-- in most advertisements

01:15:18.230 --> 01:15:23.502
the time displayed on a watch
is 10 minutes after 10:00.

01:15:23.502 --> 01:15:26.090
Don't know why.

01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:31.740
How many ridges are around
the edge of a dime?

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.840
118.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.600
And how many little dimples
are there on a

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.836
regulation golf ball?

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:47.370
If you count them up, you'll
find that there are 336.

01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:52.310
So I'll end with one for the
benefit of some of our

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:53.310
visiting students.

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:58.640
In England, the Speaker of the
House is not allowed to speak.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.870
There is my oxymoron
of the day.

01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:02.560
And with that I shall
leave you, and I

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.630
hope you enjoy these.

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:05.430
It's one of these things
that circulates

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:09.750
around on the internet.

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:16.560
So as the sheet finishes, now
you do know everything.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.080
So I'll leave you, and again I
thank you for your faithful

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:19.750
attendance.

01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:29.910
And you shall see me when you
come to call for your quizzes.

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:33.990
And I will, as most of you
requested, send out an email

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:36.410
to let you know when you can
come and pick those up.

01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:37.740
So again, thank you.

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:41.230
Enjoy the mid-term break.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:44.610
And take advantage of some of
the really interesting things

01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:48.150
that go on extracurricularly
around the institute.

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:49.100
So that's it.

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:52.340
Thank you, and au revoir.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:58.542
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.720
SHIMON ULLMAN: Now for a
different, entirely different

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.490
type of issue that
has more to do

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.580
with recognition, some
psychophysics, some computer

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.090
vision.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.430
But you will see at the end
the motivation was really

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.490
to be able to, be
able to recognize

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.940
and understand really
complicated things that are

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.150
happening in natural images.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.500
Now, when we look at
objects in the world,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.480
people have worked a lot
in object recognition,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.490
and we can recognize
well complete objects,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.650
but we can also recognize a
very limited configuration

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.260
of objects.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.349
So we are very good at
using limited information

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.100
if this is what's
available in order

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.890
to recognize what's in there.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.720
And this is some
arbitrary collection.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.970
I guess you can
recognize all of them.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.400
Some of them, if you think
about a person or even a face--

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.950
this is a very small
part of a face--

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.410
everybody I guess knows
what it is, right?

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.010
It's not even a recognizable,
well-delineated part

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.730
like an eye.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.390
You see a part of a person here.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.730
We know what it is, right?

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.760
I mean, everybody
recognizes this, and so on.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.440
Now, I think that
the ability to be

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.900
able to get all the information
out even from a limited region

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.240
plays an important role
in understanding images.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.940
And let me motivate
it by one example.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.720
I'll go back to it at the end.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.820
When we look at these images,
we know what's happening.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.934
We know what the action here is.

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:57.850
All the people are
performing the same action.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.530
They are all drinking, even
drinking from a bottle, right?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.370
But the images as images
are very different.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.160
If you look at each image,
if you stored one image

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.050
and you try to recognize another
image based on the first one,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.000
it will be difficult. The
variability here can be huge.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.100
But if you focus on
where the action really

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.350
takes place, the most
informative part where

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.776
most of the answer is already
given to you of what's

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:23.900
happening here, which is
where the bottle is docked

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.650
into the mouth, you can see
that now these diverse images

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.480
becomes virtually almost
a copy of one another,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.040
almost the same.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.470
So if you manage to
understand this and extract

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.710
the most informative
part, although it's

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.710
limited and so on,
the variability

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.480
will be much, much reduced.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.277
The variability here
is much, much reduced

00:02:47.277 --> 00:02:49.860
compared to the variability that
you have in the entire image.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.150
So most of the other stuff
is much less relevant,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.230
but this is where the
information is concentrated.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.470
And in the limited,
restricted configuration,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.530
recognition will be much easier,
and will generalize much better

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.510
from one situation
to another because

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.950
of this principle of
highly-reduced variability

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.660
in the delimited image.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.160
So we became interested.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.080
As you see, it's useful.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.510
But it's also-- to deal
with small images and still

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.990
recognize the limited images,
you'll see it's much more--

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.727
there are some very
challenging issues.

00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:34.310
And I want to discuss
it a little bit,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.990
and then also discuss what it's
good for a little bit more.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.460
I will show you
some human studies.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.834
What we wanted to
see is what are

00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:45.560
the minimal images that
people can still recognize.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.690
We examined some computational
models, and I will give you--

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.780
will not keep the secret.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.840
It turns out that
well-performing current

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.090
schemes, including
deep networks,

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.450
cannot deal well with
such minimal images.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.420
And, from this, I want to
discuss some implications

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.530
in terms of representations in
our system, brain processing,

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.210
and things like this.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.470
And quite a number of people
have been involved in this.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.342
Here are the names.

00:04:14.342 --> 00:04:16.550
Some of them are in the
Weizmann Institute in Israel,

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.730
and a few that--

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.769
Leyla is here.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.500
Leyla Isik, she is here in the
summer school, and a student,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.460
Yena Han, at MIT doing
some brain imaging

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.120
on this, which I will
mention very briefly.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.740
So I'll start with
the human study.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.780
We are looking for minimal
atomic things in recognition,

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.490
and the experiment
goes like this.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.970
You show a subject an image
and ask them to recognize it,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.150
just produce a label.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.040
So this is a dog.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.350
If they say a dog,
they recognize it.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.760
And if they recognize
it correctly,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.770
we generate five descendants
from this initial image.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.110
If this image was,
say, 50 by 50 pixels--

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.710
and I'll tell you about
pixels in a minute.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.810
But say it's 50 by 50 pixels.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.400
We make it somewhat smaller.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.070
We reduce use it, because
it's still not minimal.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.870
And we reduce it in five ways.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.740
We either copy it at
one of the four corners

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.000
to create, say, a 48
by 48 image by taking

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.880
two pixels from
this corner here,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.770
or this corner here, and so
on and so forth descendants.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.210
And we generate-- we
also take the full image.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.310
Keep it as is.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.800
We do not crop it.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.240
We just reduce the resolution.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.610
So we resample it so some
details start to become lost.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.310
Instead of 50 by 50 pixels, it's
also a full image but 48 by 48.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.980
And then we give each
one of these images--

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.000
now we have five.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.870
We give each one-- this is
beginning to expand as a tree.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.750
Each one of the five is
given again to a subject.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.210
If they recognize it,
again five descendants

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.700
are being generated, and
we explore the entire tree

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.400
until we find all
the sub-images which

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.470
are minimal and
can be recognizable

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.660
in this original configuration.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.110
Now, this is challenging
psychophysically

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.210
in terms of number of
subjects, because we

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.130
use a subject only once.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.820
Because if you
show a subject this

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.000
and he recognizes
it, if you show him

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.590
the same subject,
a reduced image,

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.430
he will recognize the image
based on his previous exposure.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.950
So you don't you do not
want to use him again.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.390
So you don't use him again,
and you show the other images

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.256
to a new subject.

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:33.130
And this requires a
large number of subjects.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.960
So 15,000 subjects
participated in this experiment

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.890
online by Mechanical Turk,
together with some laboratory

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.070
controls to see that they
are doing the right thing,

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.020
and how it compares with
the same experiment done

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.930
under laboratory
conditions, and so on.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.140
So the way we define the
minimal image for recognition

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.970
is in this tree.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.080
Here is an image.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.990
This image is recognizable.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.970
And then we create
the five descendants,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.920
and none of the descendants
is recognizable.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.030
So this is recognizable.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.800
Nothing here is recognizable.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.220
So it's minimal because
you can no longer reduce it

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.060
either by resolution going
here or by reducing the size.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.830
Any manipulation like this
will make it unrecognizable.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.470
Technically, when
I'm-- in my measuring,

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.730
if I'm using numbers that
the image is 50 pixels or 35

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.640
pixels, and so, it's
actually well-defined.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.380
I mean not the
pixels on the screen.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.080
You can take the image and
make it bigger or smaller

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.130
on the screen.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.174
But the number of sampling
points in the image

00:07:35.174 --> 00:07:35.840
is well-defined.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.900
When you give me an
image, a particular image,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.980
I can tell you how many sample
points you need in order

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.440
to capture this image.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.960
Technically, for those of you
who know it, it's twice the--

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.540
if you do a Fourier transform
and take twice the cutoff

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.540
frequency, the highest frequency
in the Fourier spectrum,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.640
this is, by the sampling
theorem of Shannon,

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.820
this is the number of
points you need in order to.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.390
So when I said that the
image was 35 pixels,

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.230
I don't really care.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.980
You can make it somewhat
smaller or larger

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.440
on the screen by interpolation.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.360
It doesn't change the
information content.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.240
It's well-defined
notion mathematically

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.390
how many points, discrete
points or sampling

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.870
points in these images.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.850
So a very interesting
thing that we

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.870
found when we found
these minimal images

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.850
is that there is a
sharp transition when

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.230
you get to the level
of the minimal images.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.789
So you go down and
you recognize it.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.640
And then there is
a sharp transition

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.410
that it suddenly becomes
unrecognizable, basically,

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.450
to the large majority of people.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.380
So it can change a little bit,
and I'll show you some examples

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.400
for you to try to see how
these minimal images look

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.460
like at the recognizable
level, at the unrecognizable.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.800
This is the recognizable level.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.790
This is the
unrecognizable level.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.830
So to show it to you
as examples here,

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.310
I will show you first
the unrecognizable one,

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.920
the one which people
find, on average, more

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.820
difficult to recognize.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.810
And if you recognize
it, raise your hand.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.684
Don't say what you
see, because this

00:09:17.684 --> 00:09:18.850
will influence other people.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.259
Just raise your hand if
you recognize the image.

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:24.300
And then I'll show you
the more recognizable one,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.470
and let's see if
more hands show up,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.690
if the distinction between the
recognizable and unrecognizable

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.190
holds here.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.820
I'll just show you a couple
of examples from the--

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.790
OK, so I'll.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.840
OK, so this is the
one which is supposed

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.292
to be difficult to recognize.

00:09:39.292 --> 00:09:41.500
If you see what it is, if
you know what's the object,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.650
raise your hand.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.570
OK, good.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.830
OK, don't say what it is.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.826
We have two.

00:09:49.826 --> 00:09:52.362
Let's see here.

00:09:52.362 --> 00:09:53.724
OK, certainly more hands.

00:09:53.724 --> 00:09:54.390
What do you see?

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.232
What do you think?

00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:56.116
AUDIENCE: Should I say it?

00:09:56.116 --> 00:09:56.560
SHIMON ULLMAN: OK.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:56.920
Now you can say it because--

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.500
AUDIENCE: A horse.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:57.990
SHIMON ULLMAN: A horse.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.750
Right.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.882
So let me show
them side by side.

00:10:01.882 --> 00:10:03.340
So you see that
it's very difficult

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.350
to recognize what's not recog--

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.460
this is, you can
see the statistic.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.760
This is recognized by
93% of the subjects.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.620
30 subjects saw each
one of these images.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.290
93% recognized this.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.480
3% recognized this.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.920
And you look at
the image and you

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.380
see that they are
very similar images,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.747
and it drops from 90% to 3%.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.330
So you can see the two images,
and you can see the similarity,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.540
and you can see the large drop.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.340
This is part of the entire
tree which is being explored.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.240
This is the farther.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.360
This is the recognized one.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.624
The minimal image.

00:10:38.624 --> 00:10:41.290
And you can see that even reduce
the resolution, which is really

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.240
not a big manipulation, but
this is a drop in performance.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.270
And you can see all the--

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.060
so we used 50% as our criterion.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.360
So the parents should
be recognized at higher.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.920
This should be
recognized at lower.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.830
But typically the
jump is very sharp.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.430
Let's try two more or
something just for fun.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.974
If you can recognize
it, raise your hand.

00:11:06.974 --> 00:11:08.330
OK.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.360
Nobody, just for the record.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:10.970
OK.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:11.470
Look around.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.100
You can see many.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.766
What do you see?

00:11:12.766 --> 00:11:13.550
AUDIENCE: A boat.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.910
SHIMON ULLMAN: A boat.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.410
Right.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.670
So you can see the two images.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.210
So 80% on this.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.870
0% here.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.850
And you can see that
what's really missing here

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.300
is the tip here.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.737
And, clearly, this tip is--

00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:29.320
there are many
contours in this image,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.180
but this particular corner sharp
makes an enormous difference,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.086
and it goes from 80% to 0%.

00:11:38.086 --> 00:11:39.820
OK, let me skip.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.698
Just one more.

00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:46.040
OK, let me skip this.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.260
This is somewhat easier.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:47.780
OK.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.710
This is some--

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.180
OK, at least one,
two, and three.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.010
OK.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.769
How about this one?

00:11:53.769 --> 00:11:54.560
Everybody, I think.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.425
Or maybe we are missing one.

00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:58.550
So, again, you can see that
the difference-- if you

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.175
look at the two,
there is a difference,

00:12:00.175 --> 00:12:01.570
and it's this thing here.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.380
But it's not a very
big part of the image.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.940
It's crucial, you know.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.360
You have to be trained on this.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.860
It's part of your
representation.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.990
It's important.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.730
You go from almost
90% to 15%, roughly.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.760
So it's important.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.050
So you can see that the drop
is typically very, very sharp.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:25.820
And it's also-- the sharp
transition is also interesting,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.140
in the sense that if it
drops from, like the horse,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.040
from 90% to 3%, or
even here, it also

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.780
says that we all carry
around in our head

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.790
a very similar presentation.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:43.360
Because if each one of
us, based on the history

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.540
and visual experience,
would be less or more

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.550
sensitive to various
features, then we

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.050
will not find this
sharp transition.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.410
Different people will lose
it at different points

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.360
in the manipulation.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.020
But at 90%, 90% of the
people, roughly everybody

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.310
recognizes it.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.950
You remove a feature
and it goes to 3%.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.990
So everybody is using the
same, or very similar,

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.450
representation, which I find
somewhat surprising, at least

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.540
for some of these images.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.460
We don't all have the
same kind of experience

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.710
with horses, or with
battleships, or things

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.660
like that, and still
the representation

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.320
is very strikingly similar
across individuals.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.470
The experiment was done
on 10 different objects.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.490
These are the initial objects.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.020
I showed you the object at the
beginning of the hierarchy,

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.390
and then you start the
manipulation to discover all

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:41.550
the minimal images inside them.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.330
And here, so we ended up
with a very nice catalog.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.640
We have a database of
all the minimal images

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.120
in all of these 10 images
in all of the children,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.030
the unrecognizable ones.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.990
So, in terms of
modeling and in terms

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.140
of exploring visual features
and what is necessary in order

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.180
to recognize, and so on,
there is a very rich data

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.210
set here of all
the minimal images

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.970
in all of these 10 images.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:09.680
Here are some more pairs
of recognizable and

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.750
unrecognizable.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.830
We already saw
this in principle,

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.220
but just to show some--

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.600
in some cases, it's pretty
clear what may be going on.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.160
For example, this is horse legs,
the front legs of the horse.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.050
This seems to be important.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:29.060
You can see that very
often it's a tremendously

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.970
small-- in this fly image,
very small differences,

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.530
very hard to pinpoint.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:38.870
And it's glass that you've
got in the eyeglasses.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.280
Something here is
missing a little bit.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.500
But very small things
in a very reliable way

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.820
cause this dramatic change.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.340
As was mentioned here,
somebody mentioned, said

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.770
the inflection and point, you
can manipulate psychophysically

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.900
a bit more.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:15:00.980
For example, here, this
was another version

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.720
of a minimal image.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.430
It was cropped at two locations.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.730
You can crop only
the left side, or you

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.480
can crop only the bottom
side, and you can try

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.820
to see what makes a difference.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.370
So you can really zoom in
on the critical features.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.800
In terms of number of
pixels, the impression

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.440
is that it's surprisingly small.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.870
So I guess you can recognize
that this is an eagle.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.800
This is an airplane.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.883
And the number of pixels--

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.290
those of you who know
vision, your retina

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.760
has 120 million pixels.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:44.890
The fovea, which is the area of
very high acuity, is 2 degrees.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.380
It's about 250 by
250, 250 by 200 pixel.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.940
This is the area at the
center, an area of high acuity.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.940
But you can recognize
things with, I don't know,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.690
15, 20 pixels.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.040
It's 1/10 of your fovea.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.205
It's tiny, tiny.

00:16:01.205 --> 00:16:03.050
You can make it
larger, but in terms

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.020
of how much visual
information, I

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.320
find it surprising that
you need very, very little.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.710
It's also interesting that
it's very useful, in the sense

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.280
that it's very redundant.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.060
If you have the capacity, if
you have a visual system that

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.120
can recognize individually each
one of these minimal images,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.490
and in fact they can be
recognized on their own,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.540
then a full image like
this contains a high number

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.500
of partially overlapping
minimal images.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.550
Some of them are large.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.280
You can see each one of
these frame, colored frame,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.380
is a minimal image,
shown not necessarily

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.290
at the right resolution.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.050
You can reduce the
resolution of things.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.660
But you can see that some
images are essentially

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.250
low-resolution representations
of the entire object,

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.170
like almost the entire eagle.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.480
But some of them just
contain something

00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:00.590
relatively small around
the head and the eye.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.410
For the eye region,
you can see that you

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.069
can get a low-resolution, again,
thing of almost everything.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.050
But just the corner
of the eye and things

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.670
like that are enough.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.619
We find, in general, it
seems that things that

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.839
are related to humans,
you have a large number

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:18.530
of these minimal images.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:24.619
So they provide a sensitive
tool to compare representations

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:28.610
to see what's missing
in the sub-image which

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.730
made the image become
unrecognizable.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.720
So we call them
sometimes, these are

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.830
called minimal
recognizable configuration.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.370
We call them configuration
but not images.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.770
Not parts.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.925
Not objects because
they are not objects.

00:17:43.925 --> 00:17:46.400
And not parts because, as
we saw in the examples,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.330
they do not have to be
well-delineated parts.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.630
They are more like
local configuration.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.445
But, anyway, minimal images.

00:17:57.998 --> 00:18:00.620
The next thing
that we did is, we

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:10.860
were wondering if this kind
of behavior, the ability

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.910
to recognize these images
from such minimal information

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.880
requires-- it places
an interesting

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.970
challenge, or an interesting
test of a recognition system,

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.030
because you really
have to extract and use

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.440
all the available information.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.210
By definition, this is minimal.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.760
If you do not use all
the information that's

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.120
in this minimal
image, then you don't

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.630
have the minimal information.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.290
You have less than
that and you will fail.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.770
So a system that
is not good enough

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.230
will fail on these minimal
images, or the ability

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:48.240
to recognize them means that
you really can suck out all

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.160
the relevant information out.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.500
So we were wondering what
will happen if we show it

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:58.560
to various computational
algorithms that performed well

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.564
on full images.

00:18:59.564 --> 00:19:01.230
What will happen when
you challenge them

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.600
with things which
are, by nature,

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.780
designed to be non-redundant?

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.760
So here is what I will do.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.560
It's not a computer
vision school.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.480
I will not go too much
through the details

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.060
of the computational
schemes, just

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.230
to show you what was happening.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.500
And the bottom line is that
they are not doing a good job.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.480
Two things happen.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.850
First of all, when you train
a computational system,

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.190
you do not see the same
drop that you see here,

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.130
that it recognizes one and
doesn't recognize the other.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.320
You don't have a
drop in recognition.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.500
This sort of phase
transition that

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.810
characterizes the
human vision system

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:44.650
is not reproduced in any of the
current recognition systems,

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.060
including deep network
and any other ones.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.730
And, secondly, they are not
very good at recognizing them.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.280
Regardless of the gap, that
there is a sharp transition

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.420
or not, they do not get
good recognition results

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.095
on these minimal images.

00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:02.690
They do not suck all the
necessary information.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.490
So in the full
images, it's like we

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.400
had an image of a
side view of a plane.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.367
So we are training on airplane.

00:20:10.367 --> 00:20:11.700
You can think of a deep network.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.470
We actually tried a whole
range of good classifiers.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.090
And in all of these
good classifiers--

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.506
those of you who
are not in vision

00:20:19.506 --> 00:20:24.840
probably got enough at the
beginning of this summer school

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.410
that they have a feeling for a
classifier in computer vision.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.010
It's a system, an algorithm,
a system, a scheme,

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.870
that you give it
training images.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.900
You don't have to specify, you
don't tell it what to look for.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.490
You just give it lots
of images and tell them

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.420
all these are of the same class.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.250
And then it calibrates itself,
and adjusts parameters,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:45.750
and so on.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.810
And then you give it new
images, and the system

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.830
is supposed to tell you if it's
a new member of the same class

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:53.680
or not.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.200
So, in this case,
we train the system,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.940
giving them full side
views of an airplane.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.710
But then we gave
them just the tails.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.890
Compared to random pictures
taken from known images,

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.590
the question is do they
reliably can tell you

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.370
that this is a tail
of an airplane, part

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.230
of the previous class?

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.910
Or they would be
confused and they

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.990
will give even higher score
to things which do not

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.470
come from airplane at all?

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.430
So we started this when
deep networks were still not

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.160
the leaders, and we had
some other things, like DPM,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.230
and including HMAX,
which is a very

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.580
good model of the human visual
system and performs very well.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:45.680
And so we included it as well,
and deep network as well.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.300
This is the HMAX.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.730
This is convolutional
neural networks.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:55.100
You probably got the idea,
it's just worth pointing,

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.570
I find it interesting in the
computer vision community

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.790
that you have Olympic
games every year.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.790
It's something which is
very structured and very

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.390
competitive, and very
nice in this regard,

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.830
that there is the
Pascal challenge,

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.980
and the ImageNet challenge,
and it's well run.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.930
And people who think
that they have a better

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.630
algorithm than others
can submit an entry,

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.330
can submit an algorithm.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:23.070
Everybody gets training images
that are distributed publicly,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.380
but there are secret
images used for testing.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.170
And you can train your
algorithm on the available data.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.200
Everybody uses the same data.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.850
And then you submit
your algorithm,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.360
and the algorithm is run by the
central committee on the test

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.410
images.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.900
And the results are published,
and everybody knows who's

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.380
number one, who's number two.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.520
You have the gold medal
and the silver medal.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.570
It's very competitive,
and in some sense

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.060
it's doing very good things.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.490
It's sort of driving
the performance up.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.670
It also has some
negative effects,

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:03.610
I think, on the way
things are being done.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.340
One negative is
it's very difficult

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.370
to come up with an
entirely new scheme which

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.980
explores a completely new idea.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.990
Because, initially,
before you fine tune it,

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:20.340
it will not be at the level of
the high-performing winners,

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.400
and until it establishes
itself as a winner,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.870
it will not get credit.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.980
So it sort of becomes a
little bit conservative

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.330
in this regard, which
is the unfortunate part.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.390
So, as I told you, and I
will not go in great detail,

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.920
the two basic outcomes
is that the gap

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.480
between the recognizable and
recognizable-- these two bars

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.150
are the gap for human vision.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.280
That's the whole
group of horse images.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.045
The parents are
highly recognizable.

00:23:56.045 --> 00:23:59.910
The children, the offsprings,
are not recognizable.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:00.840
Very large drop.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:07.080
This drop is not
recaptured in this model,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.480
in any of the model.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.430
If you have a deep
network, or you

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.470
have one of these
classifiers, what

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.960
is recognized and not recognized
depends on the threshold.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.914
You can decide that.

00:24:16.914 --> 00:24:18.330
It gives you a
number, and it says

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.860
that I have this
and this confidence

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.090
that this belongs to the class.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.890
So what we did here is
that we tried to match.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.300
We had a class of images,
and people recognized them

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.760
at 80% recognition.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.650
So we put the threshold in the
artificial, the computer vision

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.160
system, at such a level
that it recognized correctly

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:45.180
80% of the minimal images.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.340
So you match them.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.210
And then we looked at how
many of the sub-images

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.574
passed the threshold.

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:54.240
And you get-- this
is for deep network--

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.980
that, instead of a gap, you
actually got an anti-gap.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.390
It actually
recognized a few more.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.890
But this should not confuse you.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.625
It does not mean that the deep
network did better than humans.

00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:08.280
It actually did much
worse than humans,

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.677
although the bars
here are higher.

00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:12.010
And the reason is the following.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.220
You can always, even in
a very bad classifier,

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.300
you can get 80% recognition by
just lowering the threshold,

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.540
and then 80% of
the class examples

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.710
will exceed the threshold.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.600
The question is how
many just garbage image,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.430
non-class images, will also pass
the threshold at the same time.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.130
If you get 80% of the
class but also lots

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.270
and lots and lots of
completely false positive,

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.920
negative images,
non-class images

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.240
are also saying I'm an airplane,
then that's bad performance.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.250
So just these high bars
do not say anything.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:53.370
The actual recognition
levels were very low.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.260
We can see here
for deep networks

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.640
that this high bar is the
performance on new airplanes.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.720
So for airplanes
it did very well.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.810
But the percent correct that
it did on minimal images

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.500
were 3%, or 4%, were
very, very, very low.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:14.700
So it did very bad recognition
on the minimal images.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.460
So recognition of
minimal images does not

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.920
emerge by training any
of the existing models

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:27.790
that I know in the world,
including deep network models.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.510
Now, the second test
was, as was asked here,

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:34.440
is that we did
another large test.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.080
All of these things,
actually, were a lot of effort

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.024
and time-consuming.

00:26:39.024 --> 00:26:40.065
Because now we have this.

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:43.570
This was in the original
test, was a minimal image.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.410
I don't know if this
was a minimal image.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:51.090
Then we collected a
range of tails of planes

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.300
like this for many
other airplanes.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:00.810
And we ran another
Turk experiment, which

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.340
was pretty large
because we wanted

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:09.090
to verify that each one of
these patches that we added

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.480
to our test and we were going
to use for testing recognition,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.710
was indeed a minimal
image for recognition.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:19.110
So each one of these patches,
and there were 60 of those,

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.350
we ran psychophysically.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.190
And we saw that
it's recognizable,

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.690
and if you make it small,
if you try to reduce it,

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:28.830
it's unrecognizable.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.540
So each one of these
is individually

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.950
also a minimal image.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.430
So here we did training
and testing on--

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.220
so this is some
examples of this.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.580
So here are various images
of fly, and each one of them

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.720
was tested on 30 subjects
on the Mechanical Turk.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.790
And the results are that, in
terms of correct recognition,

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:54.830
there is a substantial
improvement from 3% to 60%.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.550
But 60% is not very large.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.630
People recognized them--

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.170
I should say you should
look at the false alarm.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.890
The number of errors,
I will show you later.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.830
The number of errors
that, even after training

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:18.050
on minimal images, the
performance of the deep network

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.590
and all the other models
on the minimal images

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.810
is far worse than
human recognition

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.080
levels, human performance,
on the same image.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.450
So it's not just the
gap is not reproduced.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:34.010
Even training with
minimal images,

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.010
the performance
is not reproduced.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:42.010
The errors, or the
accuracy, is far worse

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.240
in all the models,
including deep network,

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.790
compared to human vision.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.540
So these systems do not do it.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.460
It remains to be--
you can always ask,

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:57.060
what happens if I train it
with 100,000 images and I add

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.480
and add more and more examples?

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.880
This we couldn't-- this
becomes more and larger.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.210
But with the
experiments we've done,

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.610
which are quite
extensive, it does not

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.840
begin to approach
human accuracy.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.480
Humans are much better.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.690
And I'll show you.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:20.240
I think it's not just a
competition, who does better.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.100
I think there is
something deeper there.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.670
And that's what I
want to go next.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.020
Let me skip some.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.390
These are the error comparison.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:30.390
And you can see, just as we saw,
in a lot of different examples,

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.980
0 errors for humans, 17%
error in the deep networks,

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.540
and so on.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.581
So those are big differences.

00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:39.080
OK.

00:29:42.895 --> 00:29:45.690
A related thing which, I
think, gets to the heart

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.260
of what's going on, that humans
can do with these minimal

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.470
images and model, at
the moment cannot,

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:57.020
is that we not only recognize
these images and say this is

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.760
a man, this is an
eagle, this is a horse.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.710
Once we recognize it,
although the image

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:06.150
itself is sort of atomic, in
the sense that you reduce it

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.390
and recognition goes away,
but once we recognize it

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.880
we can recognize sort
of subatomic particles.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.470
We can recognize
things inside it.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.700
So if this is a
person, we ask again

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.230
in the psychophysical
test to tell us

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:24.910
what you see inside the image
using various methodologies,

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.490
which I'll not go into.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.500
But people recognize this.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.810
This is a person
in an Italian suit,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.730
for those of you who
could not recognize it.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.260
But once people
recognize it, they say,

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.560
this is the neck of the person.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.240
This is the tie.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:40.830
This is the knot of the tie.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.300
This is part of the jacket,
and so on and so forth.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.270
I mean, they recognize
a whole lot of details,

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.620
semantic internal
details inside.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.960
If they see this is the
horse, the contrast is low,

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.210
but they see the ear,
and the other ear,

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.200
and the eye, and the mouth.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.600
But if you reduce the image,
they lose the recognition

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.110
completely.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.720
Once they recognize it,
they recognize a whole lot

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.970
of structure inside.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.879
And I think that the
structure, by itself,

00:31:08.879 --> 00:31:10.920
is the more interesting
part, because, really, we

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.150
don't want to see a horse.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.400
We don't want to see a car.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.120
We want to know where the car
door is, where the knob is.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.880
We want to recognize all
the internal details.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.720
But the ability to recognize
all of these internal details

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.430
is, automatically,
it's also helping you

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.240
with improving the
recognition and rejecting

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.780
sort of false detections.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.760
Because these are
images the deep network

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.510
thought that are good
images of a man in a suit.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.630
But once you dive inside and you
say, where exactly is the neck

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:42.210
and where exactly is the tie,
and is it the right structure

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.560
that I expect?

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.160
The answer is that it's
not quite appropriate.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.760
And you can use that so that
this internal interpretation

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.570
is, first of all, the more
important goal of vision.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:57.270
But, in addition,
once you do it,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:01.350
you can reject
things that appeared,

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:08.130
based on the causal structure,
to be correct, and in this way

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.230
you can get the
correct recognition.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.499
And, for this
reason, my prediction

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:16.290
is that it will be very
difficult to get it

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.170
with current deep network,
because what you'd need

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.380
is not only to get the label
out but to be able to dive

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.730
down and get the correct
interpretation, and inspect it.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:28.010
And it has some properties.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:32.670
The tie, the knot in the
tie is slightly wider

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.484
than the part under
it, and so on.

00:32:35.484 --> 00:32:37.650
So you have to check for
the-- you know these things

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.890
and you check for them.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:41.955
And if you don't do it,
then the recognition

00:32:41.955 --> 00:32:45.210
will remain limited.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.210
Now, when you look at
it and you say, OK,

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.190
and we try to develop
an algorithm--

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:53.400
which we'll actually dive
in and we'll do the internal

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.760
interpretation, and we'll do
them correctly and we'll reject

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.260
false alarms, and so on--

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.480
it turns out that this is
an interesting business.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.070
You have to be very
accurate, and some

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.330
of the properties and relations
that you need to extract

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.530
are very specific to
certain categories

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.770
and are very precise.

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:11.550
For example, this was
selected by deep network

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.130
as a very good example
of a horse head.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:18.540
And, basically, it does
have the right shape.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.220
But, for example,
people reject it.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.730
We asked people who did not
accept it as a horse head,

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:26.600
and they said, for example, that
these lines are too straight.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.140
It looks like a man-made
part rather than

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.180
a part of a real animal.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.320
That was a repeating
answer, for example.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.550
But deviation, how
straight is it and so on,

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.800
this is a bit tricky.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.720
And also it didn't
have quite the ear

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.150
that you do expect here.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:50.850
So we think that the kind of
feature that you need in order

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:53.400
to do this internal
interpretation of interest

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.586
depends on relatively
complicated properties

00:33:56.586 --> 00:33:57.960
and relations that
you don't want

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:05.200
to spend time and effort
doing in a bottom-up way

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.790
all over the entire
visual field.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.840
If certain two contours
smoothly are in a corner,

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.670
or if something is really
straight, only semi-straight.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:19.199
I mean, to do all of these
computations my hunch is,

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:22.130
to do all of these
complicated things,

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.110
you need them only in a small--

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:28.199
you need some specific ones
for some specific classes

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.130
at some specific locations.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:36.050
So the right way to do
this kind of computation,

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.530
the right architecture,
seems to me

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.604
a combination of bottom-up
and top-down processing.

00:34:40.604 --> 00:34:42.270
And we know that, in
the visual system--

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.060
this is a diagram of
the visual system, which

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:49.380
is supposed to show that we have
lots of connections going up,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.969
but also a lot of
connections going down.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:55.020
And the suggestion that
I would like to put up--

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.480
and I think it's
what's happening here--

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.370
is that we have something
like deep network

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.820
that does an initial
generic classification.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:03.560
It's bottom-up.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.850
It has some kind of--

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.080
was trained on many categories.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.680
It is not sensitive to all of
these small and informative

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.340
things that you need for
internal classification.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:20.320
And it proposes a lot of-- it
gives you initial recognition,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.750
which is OK.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.660
It's especially OK when you
have a complete object and not

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.990
something challenging
like a minimal image.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:31.350
Because you may be wrong on a
couple of the minimal images,

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.910
but you have 20 of
them in each object.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.630
So if two are wrong,
it's not too bad.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.800
So, under many
circumstances, you

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.720
will be OK in terms of
general recognition.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.140
But what this does is it
doesn't complete the process,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.290
but it sort of triggers the
application of something which

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:51.210
is much more class-specific,
that it says,

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.800
oh, it looks like a horse.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.585
Let's check if it has,
or let's now complete

00:35:55.585 --> 00:35:56.520
the interpretation.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.920
It's not just a
validation, but you really

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.260
want to know where is the
eye, where is the ear, where

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.540
is the mouth, and so on.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.226
You want to know maybe if
the mouth is open or closed.

00:36:05.226 --> 00:36:06.350
You want to feed the horse.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:07.440
You want to pet the horse.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.420
I mean, when you interact with
objects, all of these things

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.050
are important.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.360
So you continue
your understanding

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.830
of the visual scene.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.340
But this is not this generic
bottom-up recognition,

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.530
but you are looking
for specific structures

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:24.810
that you learned about when you
interacted with these objects

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:25.770
before.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:27.930
And then you test
specific things.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:28.880
Where is the eye?

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.840
There should be a round
thing roughly here,

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.530
and so on and so forth.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.740
So these are more
extended routines

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:43.800
that you're applying to
the detected region, sort

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:49.502
of directed from above, and
you know what kind of feature

00:36:49.502 --> 00:36:53.426
to look for at
different locations

00:36:53.426 --> 00:36:55.230
within the minimal image.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:58.290
And this kind of ongoing,
continuing interpretation

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:01.380
is not just inside,
internally, to what

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.220
you succeeded to recognize,
but sort of spread

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.490
over the entire image.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.640
For example, if you
look at this image,

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.650
what do you see here
in this image here?

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.380
Anyone want to suggest
what we see here?

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.380
AUDIENCE: A face, maybe.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:16.590
SHIMON ULLMAN: Sorry?

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.699
AUDIENCE: A face.

00:37:17.699 --> 00:37:18.740
AUDIENCE: A woman's face.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.170
AUDIENCE: A woman's face.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:19.810
SHIMON ULLMAN: A woman's face.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:20.590
What is the woman doing?

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:21.381
AUDIENCE: Drinking.

00:37:21.381 --> 00:37:22.420
SHIMON ULLMAN: Drinking.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:22.750
Right.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.370
So it's a woman drinking,
for those of you

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:25.245
managed to recognize.

00:37:25.245 --> 00:37:28.066
This is the woman, and
she's drinking from a cup.

00:37:28.066 --> 00:37:29.020
Now, we tested it.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.050
The woman is actually
a minimal image.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.600
If you remove the cup,
you show this image,

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.210
people recognize it
at a relatively high.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:41.720
Nobody recognizes this
is a glass when you just

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.360
show the glass on its own.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.000
We think that the actual
recognition process

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.610
in your head starts
with recognizing

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.740
what is recognizable
on its own, sort

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.530
of the minimal configuration
which you know what it is.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:54.462
You don't need help.

00:37:54.462 --> 00:37:55.420
You don't need context.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.419
You don't need anything.

00:37:56.419 --> 00:37:57.440
This is a woman.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.210
This is the mouth.

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.310
And you can continue from
there in the same way

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.450
that you can
recognize internally

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:05.350
that this is the
nose, and the nostril,

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.460
and this is the upper
lip and lower lip.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.230
In the same way that you can
guide your interpretation

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:13.480
process internally,
you can also say

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.160
that the thing which is docked
at her mouth is a glass.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.050
Some results from--
this has been

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:25.060
implemented by Guy Ben-Yosef,
who is also now a part of CBMM.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.840
And this internal
interpretation begins

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.860
to work interestingly well.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.230
We started to do at
MIT some MEG studies,

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.640
because if this is correct,
if the interpretation

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.230
process and the correct
recognition of minimal images

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.890
and the following full
interpretation process

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:48.915
is driven by its--

00:38:48.915 --> 00:38:53.110
requires for completion,
it requires the triggering

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:56.950
of top-down processing,
that we could see it using

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.780
the right kind of imaging.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:08.530
In this case, we started to do
minimal images in MEG images.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.690
MEG is-- I think you--

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.140
was MEG already mentioned
here in any of the talks?

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.980
So MEG, as you know,
it doesn't have

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.450
very good spatial resolution.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:20.390
It's not like fMRI, but it has
very good temporal resolution.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:31.120
And what Leyla-- it
was led by Leyla Isik.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.340
And what we've
done here is trying

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.850
to let subjects in the MEG
recognize minimal images.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:42.247
And we took the electrodes from
the MEG and trained a decoder.

00:39:42.247 --> 00:39:44.080
The decoder is trained
to say whether or not

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.130
the image contains, say,
an eagle in this case.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.410
And we had various images.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.090
And the question
is, we can follow

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.930
the performance of the
computational decoder that

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.560
tries to say now the
image, now the electrode,

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.160
the pattern of
electrodes, allow me

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.390
to deduce that there is
an eagle in the image.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.140
And we see that the decoder is
successful, you can see here,

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.370
at about 400 milliseconds.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:11.510
This is late for vision.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:15.790
The initial bottom-up initial
recognition is more like 150,

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.830
or something like this.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.240
And we also get the same results
when we do psychophysics,

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:27.670
that in normal images you
can recognize them at--

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:31.050
you can get good
recognition after, say,

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.930
exposure of 100 milliseconds
followed by a mask

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:36.970
to recognize correctly
at the human level,

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:43.420
to get to the human
level that we get.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.370
With minimal images,
you have to give

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:49.450
enough time, which we
suspect is enough time,

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:54.540
to allow the application of the
top-down interpretation within.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.100
And if you don't give
enough time, then

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.920
people degenerate and
become deep networks,

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.530
and you get the same kind
of performance, roughly.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:07.750
But this is all still
unpublished and still running,

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.920
and we need more subjects.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.550
And all of this is looking
in the right direction,

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:16.150
and looking in providing
support for top-down processing

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.855
for this.

00:41:16.855 --> 00:41:21.044
And this, by the
way, it's interesting

00:41:21.044 --> 00:41:22.960
methodologically, because
it's very difficult.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.200
With real images, it's so rich
and you get so much information

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.010
already in the way
of going up and

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:31.330
because of these redundancies,
that even if you make

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:34.510
20% error, it doesn't really
matter because you have

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:38.440
redundancy, you
have many multiple,

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.450
sufficient minimal images
within any object, and so on.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:44.560
So it's very
difficult to tease out

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.160
the effect of where exactly the
top-down information starts.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.590
Where do you need it?

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.820
Where exactly you fail
if you don't have it.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.530
So we think you need it for
this internal interpretation

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.500
and for the correct
recognition of minimal images.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.040
And here you can start seeing
good signals in the MEG.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.540
It provides you sort of a
tool that is pretty unique

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.910
and allows you to
do these things.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.410
So let me add what is
a very informal thing

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.800
but where I think this is going.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.850
I think that when you
look at difficult images,

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.670
like action recognition
that we discussed below,

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:26.720
many things that we
do depend not on sort

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.760
of cause label of there
is a person there,

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.640
or there is an airplane,
or there is a dog.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.080
But, really, things
depend on the fine details

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.580
of the internal interpretation.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.300
And so if you can
turn off what I

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.460
think is the top-down part
of class-specific top-down

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.130
processes, I think that many
of these fine distinctions

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.750
that we make all the time-- and
it's what vision is all about.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:55.760
Vision is not about
giving cause categories--

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.640
will go away.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.520
And so these things will
become more and more

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.200
an important part of vision.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:05.549
Let me look at this variability
in action recognition.

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:07.340
But let me show you
some specific examples.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.814
This is something that
confuses current classifiers,

00:43:12.814 --> 00:43:15.230
that in most of them it seems
that the person is drinking.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.450
Because there is a
person, there is a bottle,

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:22.690
and the bottle is
close to the mouth.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.550
So the person is drinking
at this rough level

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.270
of description.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.760
But, obviously, here
this person is drinking,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.120
this person is pouring, right?

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.450
Something very-- is this
person drinking at the moment?

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:36.050
Yes or no?

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.365
AUDIENCE: No.

00:43:36.365 --> 00:43:36.680
SHIMON ULLMAN: No.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.180
Why not?

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.040
She's holding a cup, and
it's not far, and maybe

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.040
on the way to the mouth.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.220
We know that she's
not drinking, right?

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.304
But why exactly not?

00:43:44.304 --> 00:43:45.720
And, again, this
is something that

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.680
is picked up as drinking by
many recognition systems.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.600
But something is wrong here.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.300
All of these things, these
are different objects

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.650
and different actions that
the people are performing.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.900
This is drinking from a straw.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.800
This is smoking.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.880
And this is brushing
their teeth.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.780
But this depends on, you have
to go to the right location

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.110
and decide exactly
what's happening there.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:09.370
It's the kind of thing
that we do all the time.

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:10.820
Some more challenges.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.680
These are just sort
of informal challenges

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:18.110
to show you how we can deal with
fine interpretation of details

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.290
of interest in the image.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.978
What is this arrow pointing at?

00:44:21.978 --> 00:44:22.914
AUDIENCE: Bottle

00:44:22.914 --> 00:44:23.382
SHIMON ULLMAN: Sorry?

00:44:23.382 --> 00:44:23.850
AUDIENCE: Bottle.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:24.230
SHIMON ULLMAN: Yeah.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.396
But above the bottle, there
is something else there.

00:44:26.396 --> 00:44:27.600
AUDIENCE: Fingers.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.736
SHIMON ULLMAN: Sorry?

00:44:28.736 --> 00:44:29.444
AUDIENCE: Finger.

00:44:29.444 --> 00:44:31.441
SHIMON ULLMAN: Fingers, right.

00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:31.940
Let's see.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.970
Just playing this time.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:35.832
What is this arrow pointing at?

00:44:35.832 --> 00:44:36.540
AUDIENCE: Zipper.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.580
SHIMON ULLMAN: Zipper.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.287
Let's see.

00:44:38.287 --> 00:44:39.620
Here are two challenging things.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.453
Here are two arrows.

00:44:40.453 --> 00:44:43.068
What is this one pointing at?

00:44:43.068 --> 00:44:43.651
AUDIENCE: Cup?

00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:44.234
AUDIENCE: Tea.

00:44:44.234 --> 00:44:44.962
AUDIENCE: Cup.

00:44:44.962 --> 00:44:46.330
SHIMON ULLMAN: All right.

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:48.196
Next to the cup,
right, is also--

00:44:48.196 --> 00:44:49.320
this is really challenging.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.520
Let's see if some folks.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.463
What is this one pointing at?

00:44:52.463 --> 00:44:53.171
AUDIENCE: A tray?

00:44:53.171 --> 00:44:53.610
AUDIENCE: A tray.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:54.444
SHIMON ULLMAN: Tray.

00:44:54.444 --> 00:44:56.068
So the tray, think
about it, it's this,

00:44:56.068 --> 00:44:58.580
but you match it with this thing
here in order to make sure,

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.900
to know that it's a tray.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.530
It's not something that
will be easily picked up.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:06.702
I mean, I'm looking for
difficult things which

00:45:06.702 --> 00:45:07.910
are a little bit challenging.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.160
And you say, ah, I can get it.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.280
But this level of detail,
interpreting the fine details

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.910
and images in a top-down
fashion happens all the time.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.640
Is this person smoking?

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.530
Of course not, and we
are not fooled by it,

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:22.520
and we immediately zoom
on the right things.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.130
And, really, all the information
is here at the end of the--

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:28.610
and so on, and so
on, and so forth.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:32.140
I mean, we were looking
at dealing visually

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.570
with social interactions,
understanding

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:37.300
the social interactions
between agents.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.850
And, again, it's very
difficult to do correctly,

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.830
and it depends on subtle things.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:45.640
I mean, you can get
something rough OK.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.635
For example, is this
sort of an intimate hug,

00:45:50.635 --> 00:45:54.760
or this just a cordial hug
of people who are not--

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.500
we know exactly what's
going on, right?

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.690
And it turns out that
the features are not

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.340
that easy to get.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.490
This was picked up
incorrectly by something

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:05.770
that we designed
for people hugging.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.840
And it's not very far
from people hugging,

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.120
but it doesn't fool us, right?

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.520
But they are not really hugging.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.380
On social interactions,
we know interactions

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.475
even between non-human agents.

00:46:17.475 --> 00:46:18.850
I mean, this
interaction, is this

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:22.090
is threatening interaction
or a friendly interaction?

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:23.100
What do you think?

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.330
Yeah.

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.270
Correct.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.127
I think so too.

00:46:26.127 --> 00:46:28.460
Anyway, I think that all of
these things that we can do,

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.070
and I think that
vision is about this.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:31.870
It's not about
looking at this room

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:34.210
and saying that this is a
computer and this is a chair.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:36.460
It's about understanding
the situation

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:41.950
and making fine judgments,
and interacting with objects.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:48.780
And, in fact, we're looking at
is part of we're doing at CBMM.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.280
We are looking at the problem of
asking questions about images.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.430
So we want a system
that you can give it

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:58.030
an image and a
question, and then we

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:01.870
want the system to be able
to process the image in such

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.690
a way that will give you a
good answer to the question.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.190
This is interesting
because it means

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:09.240
that it's not just a
generic pipeline of running

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.550
the image through a
pipeline, sort of fixed

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:13.780
sequence of operations.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.270
But, depending on what
you're interested in,

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:19.870
the whole visual process should
be directed in a particular way

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.700
to produce just the
relevant answer.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:27.345
And we looked at a set of--

00:47:27.345 --> 00:47:30.640
with students, we looked at
a set of some 600 questions

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.900
that we gave people on the
Mechanical Turk images.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.600
And we say imagine some
questions about these images.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.390
Ask some question
about these images.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.220
And they came up
with some images.

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.500
We looked at them, and
an informal observation,

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.250
initial observation, is
that most of these questions

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:51.100
that people invented
to ask about images,

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.170
you needed some
things which depended

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.950
on precise internal
interpretation of the details.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:59.500
So it's things that
come up all the time.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.200
You have to dive into
the image and analyze

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.730
the subtle cues that will tell
you that these are not hugging,

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:10.360
and this is not threatening,
and this is not an intimate hug,

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.480
and so on and so forth.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.290
And this is what we are--

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.030
the whole story of
the minimal images

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.590
and the internal interpretation.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.560
The real goal
eventually is to be

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:26.860
able to identify the important
visual features and structures

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:28.690
which are important
for this, and thinking

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:32.830
about the automatic
learning of how to extract

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:38.260
the internal structure
that will support

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:43.630
the interpretation of all these
interesting and meaningful

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.480
aspects of images that, at
the moment, we do not have.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:53.090
OK, let me skip this.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:58.720
OK, I think I've said all
of these conclusions already

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.610
in the final comments,
so let me stop here.

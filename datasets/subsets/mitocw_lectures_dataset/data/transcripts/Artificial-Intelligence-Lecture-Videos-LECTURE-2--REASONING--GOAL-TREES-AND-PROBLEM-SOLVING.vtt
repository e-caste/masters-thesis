WEBVTT

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.380
What we're going to
talk about today, is goals.

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.550
So just by way of a little warm up exercise,
I'd like you to look at that integration problem

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:40.750
over there. The one that's disappeared.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.840
So the question is, can you do it in your
head? Probably not. The question is, if a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.260
program can do that, is a program, in any
sense of the word, intelligent? That's a background

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.880
task I'd like you to work on as I talk today.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.000
So today we're going to be
modeling a little bit of human

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.720
problem solving, the kind that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.100
is required when you do symbolic integration.
Now, you all learned how to do that. You may

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.579
not be able to do that particular problem
anymore, but you all learned how to integrate

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:16.950
in high school 1801, or something like that.
The question is, how did you do it, and is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.539
the problem solving technique that we are
trying to model by building a program that

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:29.610
does symbolic integration, is that a common
kind of description of what people do when

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.110
they solve problems.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.120
So the answer to the question is,
yes. The kind of problem solving you'll see

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.280
today is like generating tests, which you
saw last time. It's a very common kind of

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.799
problem solving that we all engage in, that
we all engage in without thinking about it,

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.650
and without having a name for it.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.470
But once we get a name for it, we'll get power
over it. And then we'll be able to deploy

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.658
it, and it will become a skill. We'll not
just witness it, we'll not just understand

00:01:55.658 --> 00:02:00.950
it, we'll use it instinctively, as a skill.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.650
So there you are, you've got that problem,
there's your problem, and what do you do to

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.060
solve it? I don't know, look it up in a table?
You'll never find it in a table because of

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:21.670
that minus sign and that 5. So you're going
to have to do something better than that.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.640
So what you're going to do, is what you always
do when you see a problem like that. You try

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.090
to apply a transform, and make it into a different
problem that's easier to solve. And eventually,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.040
what you hope is that you'll simplify it sufficiently,
that the pieces that you've simplified to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.450
will be found in some small table of integrals.
So how long is this table? It's not the case

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.690
that we're going to look at a table with 388
elements, because this is not a big table

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.860
of integrals. This is what a freshman might
have in a freshman's head, after taking a

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.739
course in integral calculus.

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.400
One of the interesting questions is, how many
elements have to be in that table to get an

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.180
A in the course? We're interested in how much
knowledge is involved, that's one of the elements

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.980
of catechism that I've listed over there,
that will be part of the gold star ideas suite

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.400
of the day.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.769
So we'd like to take that problem, and find
a way to make it into another problem that's

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.800
more likely, or closer to being found in the
table. So what we're going to do is very simple,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.720
graphically. We're going to take the problem
we're given, and convert it into another problem

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.579
that's simpler. And we're going to give that
process and name, and we're going to call

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:46.900
it problem reduction.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.269
And so, in the world of integral calculus,
there are all sorts of simple methods, simple

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.010
transformations, we can try that will take
a hard problem and make it into an easier

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.659
problem. And some of these transformations
are extremely simple and always safe. Some

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.629
of them are just, well let's try it and see
what happens. But some of them are safe, and

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:18.879
I'd like to make a short list of safe transformations
right now.

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:25.490
Now I'm going to be going into some detail.
And that detail will be grungy. And the question

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.159
is, why do I do it? And it's educational philosophy,
is why I do it. So here's the educational

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:38.110
philosophy. At one level, you want to have
a skill. But if you're going to have a skill,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:47.629
you have to understand it. So if you're going
to have a skill you have to understand it

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:54.330
one level down. If you're going to understand
it, you have to have witnessed it on a level

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.389
lower than that.

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.569
So I'm not just going to talk about the idea
of problem reduction, because if I were just

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.969
going to do that, then we could all go home
now. So I'm going to show you a particular

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:10.919
example of it, so you understand it better,
and I'm going to show you the detail at an

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.199
even lower level than that. So you will witness
the stuff that makes it possible, to understand

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.419
the stuff that makes it possible, to build
a skill. So that's why I'm going through the

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.539
grungy detail.

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.349
So I don't know, let's see. Maybe we can get
some hints from that example, but I wonder

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:34.569
if somebody could volunteer a simple transformation
that always is a good thing to do. Yes, Sebastian.

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.729
AUDIENCE: Take the constants out.

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.819
SPEAKER 1: Take the constants out. So we'll
make that number two. And we'll say that the

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:53.680
integral c f of x dx is equal to c times the
integral f of x dx. Other suggestions? Yes.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.449
AUDIENCE: Trig substitution.

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:03.569
SPEAKER 1: Trig substitution. Now this is--
no, that's for day two. We don't do trig substitution

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:10.229
here under stuff that's safe, always works,
never any doubt, there are simpler things.

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:17.319
These are the safe transformations. What you're
giving me is a heuristic transformation. Often

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:22.779
is helpful, doesn't necessarily always work.
We're going to divide our transformations

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.729
into those two categories. So I need another
safe one.

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:37.740
SPEAKER 1: The architects are sitting over
there. Divided not only by nationality, but

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.020
by course. What?

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.280
AUDIENCE: The sum of integrals is the integral
of the sum.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:07:05.360
SPEAKER 1: The sum of integrals is the integral
of the sum. Now what's missing? What's number

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.220
one? You're probably thinking it's already
there, because you've given me the transformation

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:16.159
that involves a constant. And you can think
of minus 1 as a constant.

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:20.270
But whether you use a separate transformation
or not, of course depends on how you represent

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.889
the knowledge. And all of this knowledge,
all of this whole thing, was written in an

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:32.749
early form of Lisp. As a consequence, the
way in which minus was represented is different

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:38.069
from the way minus 1 is represented. So we
need one more transformation. Or rather, Jim

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:42.469
Slagle needed one more transformation, when
he wrote his famous transformation program.

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:53.599
And that was that if you have the integral
of minus f of x, that's equal to, minus the

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.989
integral of f of x.

00:07:56.989 --> 00:08:01.099
So that almost completes our safe transformation
set. There's one more that I'm going to supply

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:05.800
you, because I don't think you'd guess it.
Why should you? It's number four. There are

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.489
more than this, this is a sample. And these
are the ones we're going to need in order

00:08:11.489 --> 00:08:14.989
to solve that problem, by way of illustration.

00:08:14.989 --> 00:08:24.439
So the fourth one is that, if you have the
integral of p of x, over q of x, then you

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:31.159
divide. If you can reach way back into high
school and figure out how to divide polynomials.

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:37.179
But if the degree of the numerator is greater
than the degree of the denominator, then it's

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:42.120
a knee-jerk always win, you must do it, divide
it out.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:50.259
So this, then, forms the core of an integration
program, that will integrate almost nothing.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:56.490
But actually, almost nothing is integrable
anyway, so it's a good head start. So let's

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:05.620
see how we would put this into some kind of
procedure. Some kind of framework for deploying

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:12.600
the knowledge that we're beginning to develop.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:32.920
What we're going to do is, apply all safe
transforms. That's our first step. Then we're

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:52.440
going to look in the table, and then we're
going to do a test to see if we're done. And

00:09:52.440 --> 00:10:02.400
if we are, we report success. But, we're not
likely to get done with just that stuff.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:10.000
But you know what, there was one transformation
up here, which breaks my little diagram. Which

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.709
one is it? It's the third one, right? Because
this picture does not reflect what happens

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:24.680
when you apply number three. Because it breaks
the problem up, not into just one problem,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:33.240
but into a whole bunch. So we have to extend
our graphical device for talking about this

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:47.220
by a little bit, and show what is called an
"and node".

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:55.230
So we've got a program core, we've got a table
of integrals, we've got a few transformations,

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.810
we've got an architecture, a way of putting
that stuff together. And now we can try it

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:06.370
out on our sample problem. So let's have a
go at that.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:20.149
Let's see, this one immediately transforms
into 5x to the fourth over 1 minus x squared

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:28.649
to the 5/2 dx. And that in turn, immediately
transforms into the integral of x to the fourth

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:36.620
over 1 minus x squared to the 5/2, dx.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:42.699
This program, by the way, is a dawn-age program.
This was written by a nearly blind, and subsequently

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:48.319
completely blind, graduate student by the
name of James Slagle in 1960, a long time

00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:54.509
ago. The reason I gave it to you today is
because, that by describing it, I am giving

00:11:54.509 --> 00:12:01.079
you a one-lecture course in artificial intelligence.
He anticipated so much of the subsequent 20

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:08.689
years, that talking about his program, which
is possible in one day, is a miniature introduction

00:12:08.689 --> 00:12:10.389
to the whole field.

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:17.899
So Slagle, as he was doing this on an antique
computer, almost no memory, almost no speed,

00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:25.019
only slightly faster than mice running around
on a treadmill. He was able to write a program

00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:31.769
that did extremely well when benchmarked against
freshmen. And the way you benchmark against

00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:39.249
freshman, of course, is you give it an examination,
drawn from the previous MIT finals for four

00:12:39.249 --> 00:12:46.100
or five years, the hardest problems. And this
was the hardest problem that it solved.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.769
So at this point, with what we've got so far,
we would be stuck. We have no transformation

00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:59.540
that can take us further, so we need something
else. And what we need by way of something

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:08.939
else, is some transformations that we will
describe as-- perhaps we'll call them, heuristic

00:13:08.939 --> 00:13:20.279
transformations. A funny word, meaning a method
that often works isn't guaranteed to work.

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:27.540
It's not an algorithm in the usual sense that
we talk about algorithms. But rather, it's

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.430
an attempt.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:35.519
So these things I'm going to talk about now,
are sometimes useful, not always useful. Sometimes

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:42.209
take you into a blind alley, don' always work.
But you can't get an A in calculus without

00:13:42.209 --> 00:13:49.379
knowing some of them. So you said, some kind
of trig substitution. So here is some kind

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:56.329
of trig substitution. We'll call this heuristic
transformation A.

00:13:56.329 --> 00:14:10.790
You have a function sine x, cosine x, tangent
of x, cotangent of x, secant of x, and cosecant

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:20.899
of x. And we all know from high school trigonometry,
that we can rewrite that as a function of

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:36.990
sine x, and cosine x. Or we can rewrite that
as a function of tangent of x, and cosecant

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:51.550
of x. Or we can rewrite that as function of
cotangent of x, and the secant of x. So that's

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:57.089
a transmission from trigonometric form, into
another trigonometric form. It's not always

00:14:57.089 --> 00:15:02.990
a good idea, sometimes it helps.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:25.370
Well that's just part one of our suite of
heuristic transformations. Stop. There are

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:32.459
others that we need to have in our repertoire,
in order to solve the problem. One of them

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:38.629
is a family of transformations, which I'll
show you only one. It goes like this, if you

00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:53.899
have the integral of a function, of the tangent
of x, then you can rewrite that as the integral

00:15:53.899 --> 00:16:05.850
of a function of y over 1 plus y squared dy.
So that's a transformation from a trigonometric

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:11.360
form into a polynomial form. So it gets rid
of all that trigonometric garbage we don't

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.319
want to deal with. And there's a whole family
of things like that, just as there's a family

00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:22.699
of transformations like so, but this is enough
to give you flavor.

00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:30.949
Now there's a C that we need as well. And
that's going to be your proper knee-jerk reaction

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:39.640
when you see something of the form 1 minus
x squared. What do you do when you see that?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.940
What's that Rhana?

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.340
Rhana: 1 + 6  * 1 - 6

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.180
Well wait a second. We could do that.
But there's another thing we can do.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:57.260
Christian, have you got something you can
suggest? Where's our Hungarian? Our Turk,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.460
our young Turk. Yeah, what do you think?

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.060
AUDIENCE: I actually don't remember. I mean,
I think it might have been 10.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.859
SPEAKER 1: Well, let's see. Cosine squared
plus sine squared equals 1. So, what's that

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:22.060
suggest to you? So it suggests that we make
a transformation that involves x equals sine

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:27.640
y. So [? Silla ?] doesn't actually have to
remember that anymore because going forward,

00:17:27.648 --> 00:17:31.640
she will never have to integrate anything
personally in her life, she can just simulate

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:49.010
the program.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:53.760
So these go from polynomial form, back into
trigonometric form. So you have three of these

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:59.289
heuristic transformations. We've got four
safe transformations. Let's see if we can

00:17:59.289 --> 00:18:11.160
make any progress on our integration problem.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:19.600
OK so keeping track of what we've been using,
this is safe transformation number one, this

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:24.890
is safe transformation number two. What do
we do next? We decided there were no more

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:31.190
safe transformations that apply. But now we
can look at our heuristic transformations

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.150
and behold, we see what?

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.820
AUDIENCE: C

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.920
SPEAKER 1: What?

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.460
AUDIENCE: Applying transformation C.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:50.710
SPEAKER 1: Transformation C suggests that
we do x equals the sine y.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:57.490
And now we get the integral of sine to the

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:11.380
fourth y over cosine to the fourth y dy, right.
All good, I see some confused, worried, concerned

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:19.320
looks. Maybe I've made a mistake, perhaps
I should use notes. Well no, wait a minute.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:26.429
For those of you who have a concerned look,
remember that if x equals a sine y, then dx

00:19:26.429 --> 00:19:33.940
is equal to cosine y dy. That's why it's cosine
to the fourth not cosine to the fifth, as

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.580
you were perhaps thinking it might be.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:45.880
So now we've made some progress. We look at
this, we say, are there any safe transformations

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:52.450
that apply? And the answer is, no. Now we
look for a heuristic transformation that might

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:58.029
apply, and I say, what do you see? Which one?
What's that?

00:19:58.029 --> 00:20:05.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.740
SPEAKER 1: She said something unintelligible,
but what she probably said is, that this looks

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:17.029
like a pattern that might match with the heuristic
transformation A, right? Because we have a

00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:22.320
function in which the variable is buried,
universally in sines, or cosines, or tangents,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.649
or cotangents, or secants, or cosecants. And
we know we can rewrite that in one of three

00:20:27.649 --> 00:20:35.549
ways. It's already written as a function of
sine and cosine. But we can also rewrite that

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:41.809
in terms of tangent and cosecant. Or cotangent
and secant.

00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:50.370
So when we do that, we can go this way, and
we can get the integral of 1 over the cotangent

00:20:50.370 --> 00:21:03.120
of x dx. That's g3 up there. Or we can do
it down this path, and get the integral of

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:11.200
tangent of x dx. And of course, those are
both to the fourth.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:23.140
But know what, I've broken my little graphical
diagram again. Where did it go, it's disappeared.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:35.100
There it is. How have I broken it? Because
with transformation A, I've introduced a possibility

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.220
that a particular problem can be transformed
into more than one kind of problem, any of

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.470
which will be the solution to my problem.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:22:00.740
So far I've got an and node, but now I've
got to introduce an or node. Because now we

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.210
have an example of something that can be solved
one of two different ways, and we don't care

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:10.399
which one it is. Now you'll notice that there's
already some confusion here, because how can

00:22:10.399 --> 00:22:13.970
you tell the difference between an and node
and an or node. So the universal convention

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:20.190
is, you draw an arc over the and nodes. And
that makes it look like an A, so it's easy

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.850
to remember. So those are and nodes.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:30.200
And now, we have the method of problem reduction,
and this is sometimes called a problem reduction

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:45.750
tree. Sometimes it's called an and/or tree,
and sometimes it's called a goal tree, because

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:53.100
this tree of problems is a tree that shows
how our goals are related to one another.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.800
So these are items for your vocabulary that
are all synonymous. Problem reduction tree,

00:22:57.809 --> 00:23:02.200
and/or tree, goal tree, all the same thing.
Now you have a name for it, you've got some

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:11.279
power over it. So when we get a situation
like this, unlike the previous situation,

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:31.880
which we suggested might come up in transformation
A. Let's see, we've got one, two, C, and this

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:40.010
one is A, it's an or node. Which one of these
problems do we work on?

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:45.360
Well Slegle, who considered himself to be
modeling a freshman, modeling the intelligence

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:52.200
of a freshman, modeling something that, after
all, you have to be pretty smart to do, right.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:57.460
Most people don't know how to do integration.
Everybody at MIT knows how to do integration.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.100
You would think that somebody, therefore,
that knows how to do integration is pretty

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.980
smart. What would a smart person do, when
faced with this choice?

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:12.669
Well, a smart person would say, which of these
two problems is easier? So how do you think

00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:21.800
you might determine which of two, or many
algebraic expressions is the easiest to integrate?

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.960
What's your name?

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.120
AUDIENCE: Andrew Carrol.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.500
SPEAKER 1: Andrew, what do you think?

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.039
AUDIENCE: Based on whichever one feels more
familiar.

00:24:28.039 --> 00:24:30.010
SPEAKER 1: Feels.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.809
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:32.340
SPEAKER 1: Feels.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:32.570
AUDIENCE: You asked, how would I decide.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.760
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, how would you decide? How
would you feel it?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.990
AUDIENCE: I would feel that the tangent is
more familiar.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.679
SPEAKER 1: Which one?

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:42.850
AUDIENCE: I feel that the tangent [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.409
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, but I wonder how we could
make it a little bit more precise, this idea

00:24:44.409 --> 00:24:52.349
of simplicity. The young Turk has a suggestion.
What?

00:24:52.349 --> 00:24:57.969
AUDIENCE: I had a suggestion until you said
this idea of simplicity. So then I realized

00:24:57.969 --> 00:25:02.909
that what I was about to suggest wasn't going
to clarify simplicity, but I was going to

00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:09.280
say, whichever one we've had more encounters
with, or more experience with.

00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:12.410
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, if there was something here
with a hyperbolic tangent, you might say,

00:25:12.419 --> 00:25:15.950
well, stay away from that. [? Yinid ?]?

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:21.399
AUDIENCE: To which one of those the easier
transformation is applied on the next step.

00:25:21.399 --> 00:25:24.819
SPEAKER 1: Like, somebody do a little look
ahead, and see which kind of thing would be

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.640
next to you? I don't know, maybe. Oh, we've
got lots of people, all at the same time.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.200
I don't know all your names yet. Shoot. Erica,
I know you.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.840
AUDIENCE: What's look it up in the table and
see [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.300
SPEAKER 1: Oh, you could look it up in the
table and see if something is in it, you could

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:46.840
do that. But this is tangent to the fourth,
so that's not in the table. Ariel?

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.620
AUDIENCE: I choose the one without the reciprocal.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.800
SPEAKER 1: Why?

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:57.740
AUDIENCE: It is because when people see one
it's like, oh man, it jut not going to work.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.120
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, we're on the right track.
Claire?

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.480
AUDIENCE: On an extremely simple level, I
choose whichever one has the least symbols

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.680
in it.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.060
SPEAKER 1: The fewest symbols in it. Now we're
really getting somewhere, because you can

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.640
measure that, right, there's a little program
Why Brett, there you are.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:19.800
AUDIENCE: I would say, every [INAUDIBLE] expression
can be written as, having a number of functions,

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.500
we could say all these functions, multiplied
together, divided, and you can just choose

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.980
with the least amount of [? iterations ?].

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.760
SPEAKER 1: Well I heard it, perhaps others
didn't but what Brett said, is he suggested

00:26:31.769 --> 00:26:38.040
that we should measure depth of functional
composition. So the number of symbols may

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.779
not matter, because if you have x plus x plus
x plus x, out to a hundred, that would not

00:26:42.779 --> 00:26:49.620
be hard to integrate. But if you've got something
that is really deeply nested under a lot of

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.860
functional compositions, that could be a problem.
And that's in fact, what Slegle decided to

00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:00.440
use, after trying several alternatives.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:06.370
So if we measure the depth of the functional
composition, this is the winner, and we put

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:11.399
the other one on the shelf, at least for the
moment. And now we have tangent to the fourth

00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:18.809
x dx. Do I need the safe transformation supply?
No. Which of the-- you know something has

00:27:18.809 --> 00:27:24.440
to apply, otherwise it wouldn't be up here
as an example. So what of the heuristic transformation

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.289
supply? Elliott.

00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:26.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.240
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, B bravo. Military
background or something like that. Maybe

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:38.160
he flies airplanes. OK so B says, it is in
fact a function of the tangent. And when we

00:27:38.169 --> 00:27:43.529
do that, we've got to make a substitution,
that y is equal to the tangent. So that means

00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:55.799
that this becomes the integral of y to the
fourth over 1 plus y squared. And that's by

00:27:55.799 --> 00:28:08.059
transformation B, and the transformation is
y equals tangent of x. The tangent-- I guess

00:28:08.059 --> 00:28:17.450
I've lost track of the fact that I've already
transformed a y, but relabeling doesn't matter.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:25.769
All right so that's progress, maybe. But don't
see this in any of the heuristic transformations,

00:28:25.769 --> 00:28:30.340
what do I do now? I didn't have to look in
the heuristic transformations, because one

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:39.370
of the safe transformations applies. Because
this thing is a rational function and the

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:44.120
degree of the numerator is greater that the
degree of the denominator, so I have to divide.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:52.240
And when I divide, and that by the way is
number four, I get what? Is anybody good high

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.960
school algebra that can help me out with that?

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:59.740
AUDIENCE: Y squared minus 2 plus negative
2 over 1 plus y squared

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:15.679
SPEAKER 1: Exactly, y squared minus 1 plus
1 over 1 plus y squared, I think. Now what?

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:31.009
Now we're really getting close to getting
through this, because that is a sum. And by

00:29:31.009 --> 00:29:38.070
virtue of the fact that it's a sum, that divides
into three pieces, and the top piece is the

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:44.399
integral of y squared, the middle piece is
the integral of minus 1, and the bottom piece

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:51.929
is the integral of 1 over 1 plus y squared
dy in all cases.

00:29:51.929 --> 00:30:06.929
Gosh, if I look this up, I've found it. That's
up there, that's letter B. So I'm done with

00:30:06.929 --> 00:30:16.409
that. This one I can transform again, by virtue
of 1, and now I get the integral dy. That's

00:30:16.409 --> 00:30:24.750
in there, that's B as well. As this one, I
don't know. But I'd better keep track of what

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.669
I'm doing here. This is in the and node, so
I've got to do all of those. I can't give

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:38.139
up on that last thing. And that and transformation
is transformation number 3. So this is in

00:30:38.139 --> 00:30:46.710
the table, this is in the table, we still
have this to do, but that's C, heuristic transformation

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:58.659
C. We have 1, plus y squared, then with the
transformation C, with y-- this is y squared--

00:30:58.659 --> 00:31:09.149
y equals tangent of z And then we get to the
integral of dz and that's in the table and,

00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:10.889
we're done.

00:31:10.889 --> 00:31:16.120
So now we've solved the problem. It's the
hardest problem that appeared in that half

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:24.009
decade on MIT 18 01 finals. This is exactly
the problem that was given, except that it

00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:30.080
started here. I put the other two pieces on
just to illustrate a couple of the transformations.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.480
But that's a problem that it solved.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:42.320
And now that we've seen an example, we can
finish up what we talked about a little bit

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:51.779
ago, having to do with the architecture of
this thing. So far, all we've done is talk

00:31:51.779 --> 00:31:58.039
about the safe transformations, but now we
know that if we're not done, we need to find

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:06.860
a problem to work on

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:17.159
using that depth of functional composition
business. And then after that we apply heuristic

00:32:17.159 --> 00:32:28.819
transformation.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.540
And the way Slagle
designed his program is,

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.600
he found just one problem to work on,
did one transformation,

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.600
then went back around the loop. Because these
heuristic transformations are a little harder

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:44.679
to apply than the safe ones. So I'll given
you an accurate portrayal of what this program

00:32:44.679 --> 00:32:51.169
did, except for one thing. Which I would like,
now, to go back and patch up. And that thing

00:32:51.169 --> 00:33:09.009
is over here. What to do with something like
this. Well we got to that in a board that's

00:33:09.009 --> 00:33:15.350
disappeared, but when we tried to deal with
this, we had to find a heuristic transformation.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:20.289
And when we decided to work on this, it must
have been the case that this was the simplest

00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:24.370
problem at a leaf node that has not yet been
solved.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:32.559
So what's the functional composition depth
of this? It's 3. Back over here, we have something

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:37.649
that has a depth of functional composition
of 2. So when the program actually ran on

00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:44.029
this particular problem, it stopped a few
inches short of the finish line, And went

00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:48.720
back and screwed around with that other problem
for a little bit, before it gave up and came

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.919
back here.

00:33:50.919 --> 00:33:55.669
So it's always looking across the whole tree,
the leaves of the tree. Whenever it has to

00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:59.970
find a place to work on with the heuristic
transformation, it happened to look at all

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:04.159
the leaves of the tree that had not yet been
dealt with, tried to find the easiest one,

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:08.550
and that could involve a lot of backing up
and starting over on a branch of the tree

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:14.710
that it had previously ignored. A small detail,
not a particularly important one.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:35.620
Now where are we. We've got that guy there.
We've got our complete architecture. We've

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:44.300
got our solved problem. And now we can start
reflecting on what we've done. We can say,

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:49.900
for example, how good an integration program
is this? And the answer is, it was pretty

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:57.970
good. This machine that Slagle was using was
a machine that was over in building 26. And

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.900
we were so proud of it, that it was behind
glass, and you could go there and watch the

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:10.610
tape spin, it was really a delight. 32k of
memory, that's 32k of memory. It's amazing

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:17.440
that he was able to do anything with a machine
of that size.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:29.740
Let's see, let's get us a clean one.
Can't do board geometry and talk at the same

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:40.220
time. We can now ask some questions about
how well the program performed. It was given

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:49.000
56 of the hardest problems, and it got 54
right. What happened when it didn't get the

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.310
other two? Well, you might be right if you
said, oh it probably ran out of memory, since

00:35:55.310 --> 00:36:01.280
it had 32k. But in fact, it just was lacking
2 transformations that were needed, in order

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:09.930
to solve the whole entire set of final quiz
problems. So when a program fails, that's

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:15.270
often the most interesting question you can
ask. This is an exception. This failed for

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:20.670
uninteresting reasons on 2 of the 56 problems
that it was given to.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:30.750
And now the next question you can say is,
what is the depth of the tree in the maximal

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:36.370
case? And the answer is, it's that case we
just worked out. And since I've once again

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:42.880
lost the whole tree, I'll tell you that it's
depth was 7 when you take off that minus 5.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:51.090
So in the worst case, this thing had to get
down seven levels.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:37:00.380
That's the worst case, a more interesting
question is what was the average depth? And

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:09.900
that was approximately 3. And now we're beginning
to say something, not only about Slagle's

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:16.450
model of how a freshman works, but we're beginning
to say something about the nature of the domain.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:21.980
In the domain of calculus problems, integrals
expressions that are given to freshman, in

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:29.670
that domain, the average depth of problem
reduction needed to solve the problem was

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:35.270
3. So that's not very complicated. If it were
10, you would say, wow, how can anybody ever

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:42.260
do those problems? If it were 5, you'd say,
well only people destined to be math professors

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:48.590
are going to get anything right. If it's 3,
us ordinary mortals can do a pretty good job.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:38:06.040
Another question of even greater interest
is, how many branches were unused? Here's

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:10.910
a branch that turned out to be unused, it
didn't pursue that. And so you might say,

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:17.850
well maybe there are a lot of unused branches.
Maybe you have to be pretty smart about your

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:21.160
method for determining what problem to work
on, because otherwise you'll go down a lot

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.580
of rat holes.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:30.250
And guess what, here's another statement about
the domain. In the domain of problems that

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:38.060
freshmen could work on a final, the number
of unused branches is about 1. So that means

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:45.690
this tree keeps itself together, and doesn't
run down to a very large, bushy, useless tree.

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:52.320
So this means that the depth of functional
composition, which Brett suggested as a technique

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:59.750
for recognizing the right problem work on,
was a choice that didn't actually matter.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:05.710
Because the tree doesn't grow deep, it doesn't
go broad. It doesn't matter what you use to

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:10.110
decide what to work on, because in the worst
case, you'll just generate a couple of extra,

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:14.150
useless nodes. But they very quickly run to
find a dead end, so you don't have to do anything

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:19.020
more with them.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:24.280
So now the next thing we need to do is back
even further away from this program, and ask

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:29.370
ourselves some questions about the nature
of what we've been doing. And that brings

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:34.170
me to the things I've got on that upper right-hand
board. One of those things as a catechism

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.020
having to do with knowledge.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:41.050
And what we've done informally as we went
through this program was, we've asked questions

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:48.530
such as, what kind of knowledge is involved
in doing this? Well knowledge about transformation.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:54.770
Knowledge about how goal trees work and when
we're done with a problem. Knowledge about

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:59.520
what things don't need to be transformed,
because you can look them up in a table. That's

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:05.890
the kind of knowledge that is involved in
doing 18 01. And if you do 18 0 circuit theory,

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:11.020
6 0 circuit theory or 6 0 Maxwell's equations,
this is the same thing.

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.020
You have to ask questions of this sort,

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:17.430
about the nature of the knowledge involved,
and question number one is always, what kind

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:23.440
of knowledge is involved? Is it Kirchhoff's
laws, Maxwell's equations, what is it?

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.440
The next question is, how is the knowledge
represented? And our answers here are, well

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.700
all this stuff, ultimately was represented
in list best expressions. Some of the

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:37.040
knowledge was recorded in a table [? of best
?] expressions to show what transformations

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:43.930
there are. There was a similar table of integrals.
Knowledge about goal trees was embedded in

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:49.970
the procedure, so it was procedurally represented.
And so for each of the categories of knowledge,

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:56.550
there's a way it gets represented. How is
it used? Straightforward, transformations

00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:02.390
are used to make the problem simpler. The
table is used to trim off and to serve as

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:06.530
the bottom of the tree. Those are the ways
in which the knowledge is used.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:13.440
And then there's the question of course of,
how much knowledge is required. Something

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:19.180
that's useful to know if it's late at night,
you have 2 finals the next day, and you're

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.640
not sure which course you should study. So
how much knowledge might you suppose was actually

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.960
in this program? I've shown you a glimpse
of the kind of knowledge that's involved in

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.710
the program. I've answered a little bit of
question 5, what exactly. But how much knowledge

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:36.910
was involved. You might be surprised by the
answer.

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:44.540
First of all, the table of integrals. I've
listed only 3 things there. There are lots

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:50.770
of other things you can think of, like integral
of e to the x is e to the x. But in the end,

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:58.310
what Slagle found is, a table only 26 elements
was enough to solve all of these problems.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:11.320
How about the transformations here, the safe
ones, about 12. How about the heuristic ones,

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:17.490
about 12. So just a few bits and pieces of
knowledge, here and there, are sufficient

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:22.370
to do everything you need to do, in order
to do the integration problems on a calculus

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.520
final. That was a surprise.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:31.140
Another surprise of a similar kind, also about
knowledge, is that the relationship between

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:40.400
the method to be used, and the characteristics
of the problem, was almost a diagonal table.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:46.850
That means that you could, in this domain,
make the right transformation almost all the

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:52.300
time if you're a little bit smart, and never
back up. That was an observation made by Joel

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:58.210
Moses, who became subsequently our provost
here at MIT for a while. And he wrote a program

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:05.760
that could solve anything. It would beat the
most dedicated mathematicians at integration.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.610
And its descendents are in MATLAB today.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:12.570
But this is how it all works. And now you
can write one of these things yourself. Partly

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:18.300
because you now have this catechism. This
is the kind of stuff you should ask any time

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:24.320
you're dealing with a new domain. It will
make you smarter. And this is of course, meta

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:30.970
knowledge, this is knowledge about knowledge.
So this tired aphorism isn't quite what we

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:43.810
are going to complete ourselves with. We're
going to say that knowledge about knowledge

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:45.850
is where the real power is.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:52.790
Now there's one final thing that this program
does for us. It tells us something about our

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:58.280
appreciation of what it means to be intelligent.
You know that in the beginning of this hour,

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:04.260
I asked you to think about whether a program
that could do symbolic integration would be,

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:12.480
in any way, or should be considered to any
degree, intelligent. And I'm imagining that

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:17.820
even in these days of MATLAB, and whatnot,
many of you said well, yes, I learned how

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:23.190
to do that at MIT, or late in high school,
so it must be smart.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:29.410
But now that we've completed this discussion,
I also expect that your feeling of intelligence

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:34.740
in this program is somewhat diminished. Because
what happens is that, when we understand how

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:39.890
something works, it's intelligence seems to
vanish. You've seen this in your friends,

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:46.740
right? They solve some problem, they seem
super smart. Then they tell you how they did

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.830
it, and they don't seem so smart anymore.

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:59.860
So let's conclude our discussion today was
a little story. A long time ago I was talking

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:08.030
with a student who said, computers cannot
be intelligent. And I said, OK, maybe you're

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:12.100
right, but let me show you this program. So
I showed him the integration program, working

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:18.580
on problems like this. And after I showed
him a couple of those examples, he says, well,

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:23.460
all right, I guess maybe they can be intelligent.
I'm learning how to do that, and it's not

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:30.830
always easy. Then I made a fatal mistake.
I said let me show you how it works, and we

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:35.280
spent an hour going through it like this.
And at the end of that time, he turned to

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:42.050
me and said, I take it back, it's not intelligent
after all. It does integration the same way

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.840
I do.

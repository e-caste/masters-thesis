WEBVTT

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.770
We would now like to look at
two-dimensional collisions.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.310
And what we'd like to look at
is in the laboratory frame--

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.710
so I'll call that the lab
frame-- in which we have

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.370
a target particle, which
I'm going to call 2,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.710
and an incoming particle
1, which is coming in

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.800
with some initial velocity.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.960
After the collision,
let's imagine

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.700
that the target
particle is going out

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.980
at a certain direction.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.570
So we'll call that 2.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.450
And the target particle
has a velocity v2 final.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.530
And the initial particle that's
going in this direction-- we'll

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.730
call that 1.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.390
And that is it's
outcoming velocity.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.930
Now in this collision, we
want to ask ourselves first,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.420
what quantities are
constants of the motion.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.000
Well, let's assume
no external forces,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.890
therefore momentum is constant.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.750
And we can write our
momentum equation

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:10.480
as m1 v1 initial equals m1
v1 final plus m2 v2 final.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.700
Now recall that
momentum is a vector.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.230
And so what we have here
are two-- the unknowns here

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.840
are our two outcoming vectors,
v1 final and v2 final.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.380
And a vector in two
dimensions has two quantities.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.770
We can discuss-- we can
write that as components.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.289
Or we can write it in terms
of magnitudes and directions.

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.360
Now experimentally, we often
will measure the directions

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.280
of the outcoming
particles, which

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.970
I will now indicate by theta
2 final and theta 1 final.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.789
And so, when we write our
two momentum equations,

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.190
we can either write
it as components,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.660
or we can write it in terms
of magnitudes and directions

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.740
and do vector decomposition.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.430
Now because we measure
the outcoming directions,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.260
we're going to choose to do
magnitudes and directions.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.090
So let's indicate
a little notation.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.800
We'll say that the magnitude
of v1 initial is v1 i.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.550
And the magnitude of
v2 final is v2 final.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.380
And the magnitude of
v1 final is v1 final.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.690
And so now, when we look at
our two momentum conditions,

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.940
we can-- we now also
have to introduce

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.530
unit vectors for directions.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.990
So let's call i hat that way
and j hat in this direction.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.570
And in our i hat
direction, we have

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.070
only the incoming momentum.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.470
And we can write that
as m1 v1 initial.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.430
It's positive because we've
chosen the forward direction

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.360
as our i hat direction.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.950
Now in terms of the outgoing
momentum in the i hat

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.890
direction, we have to
do vector decomposition

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.150
of both of these vectors.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.800
And they both have
positive components.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.690
So we have m1 v1 final-- that's
the magnitude-- cosine theta

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.030
1 final plus-- positive
sign, because they're

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.010
both in the positive
direction-- v2 final magnitude

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:28.870
times-- we need that little-- m2
v2 final cosine theta 2 final.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.760
And that is our i hat direction.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.920
Now the j hat
direction-- remember,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.340
we have to be careful, because
we're taking positive j hat up.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.420
So our particle 2 has a positive
component in the j direction.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.700
And our particle 1 has
a negative component

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.020
in the j direction.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.329
The incoming momentum-- there's
no momentum in the j direction.

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.970
So we have a 0.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.000
And that's equal to
positive m2 v2 final.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.462
And that's a sine theta 2 final.

00:03:58.462 --> 00:04:00.170
Now, here's where you
have to be careful,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.350
because this one is negative.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.080
Component is in the
negative j hat direction.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.710
And we have m1 v1 final
sine theta 1 final.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.040
And these two represent
our momentum equations.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.110
Now we also have to think--
let's think about energy.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.420
Again, we have to know
something about this collision.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.320
And our assumption will be
that this particular collision

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.730
is elastic.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.770
And that means the
initial kinetic energy

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.480
is equal to the
final kinetic energy.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.909
Energy is a scalar.

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.090
We've been describing our
incoming velocity vectors

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.780
in terms of magnitudes.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.620
So we can write our
elastic energy condition

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.000
as the incoming kinetic
energy squared--

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.250
that's the kinetic
energy incoming--

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.470
is equal to 1/2 m1 v1
final squared plus 1/2

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.570
m2 v2 final squared.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.010
And that is our kinetic
energy condition.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.100
Let's label this equation
1 and equation 2.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.350
Now, it's very
important to realize

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.370
which quantities are given and
which we need to solve for.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.640
So in this problem, because
the two outcoming velocities--

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.560
unknowns-- we have
four unknowns.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.790
Those unknowns can be written
in terms of the two velocity

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:32.450
final and the other
one, v2 final.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.909
Those are our vector quantities.

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.200
But recall, in terms of
the scalar magnitudes,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.820
we have that v1 final.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.940
And I'll just write the
other ones down-- v2 final,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.810
and the two outgoing
directions-- theta 1 final

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.240
and theta 2 final.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.110
So these are our four
unknown quantities.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.230
But you can see we only
have three equations.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.190
And therefore, if we want
to determine the outcomes,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:10.280
we need to measure one
additional quantity.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.280
Now that's very useful
when doing problem solving,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.290
because when you start
to read a problem,

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.330
and you look at
what's being measured,

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.200
you can right away determine
which of the four quantities

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.890
has been given.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.330
You may be given an outgoing
magnitude of the velocity,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.480
or you may be given one of
these scattering angles.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.420
And so that's how we approach
two-dimensional elastic

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.440
collision.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.587
Of course there's
algebra now to solve

00:06:35.587 --> 00:06:37.670
for any particular quantity
that you're interested

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.280
in, provided you have this
extra additional information.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.360
PROFESSOR: So what I
want to do today is--

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.210
I want to introduce this
to you very quickly--

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.900
is-- and I was going to show
you this at the end of the last

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.130
class--

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.990
if we simply go to the far end
of the scale, the picometer

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.729
scale-- you see carbon.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.700
I'm not going to start you with
carbon, that is a little dull.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.100
But over the next few weeks--

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.470
few classes, rather, because we
have to do this in fast order--

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.200
we will cover details
of carbohydrates,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.090
amino acids nucleosides,
and phospholipids

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.420
and how those building
blocks are put together--

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.380
their properties, their
ability to interact and engage

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.400
in non-covalent interactions
with other molecules

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.160
and the ability to
make polymers out

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.420
of some of these, such as the
nucleosides and the amino acids

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.760
and the carbohydrates,
which then start

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.170
to create the richness of life.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.690
We will also discuss today
the super molecular chemistry

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.080
of phospholipids as they
make micelles and lipid

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.520
bilayers, which are the
key boundary of cells.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.928
So this is very important.

00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:28.470
And then in the
following week, we'll

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.020
go to some of the bigger things
like proteins, nucleic acid,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.480
polymers-- for
example, here's RNA.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.660
So the course will
literally do this--

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.940
take you from one end of
the scale to the other.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.760
So I want you to get a
sense of these dimensions.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.580
I want to mention one sort
of fairly stupid thing

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.850
with respect to how chemists
and biochemists talk

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.850
about certain metrics,
certain distances that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.280
are pertinent to biology
and biochemistry.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.830
Engineers tend to talk about
micrometers and nanometers.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.850
There is one unit that chemists
and biologists use quite a lot,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.755
it's the Angstrom
after a Finnish or Sw--

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:15.270
no, not Finnish.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.520
I think it was a Norwegian.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.170
And that is equivalent--

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.430
10 Angstrom equals 1 nanometer.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.843
So when you're
looking at scales,

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:26.760
we tend to talk about
Angstrom because they're

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.680
a convenient number.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.810
But don't get fooled by this.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.540
It can be a little bit
confusing because it's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.840
10 to the negative 10.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.600
So a nanometer is 10
to the negative 9,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.210
you know that quite frequently.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.730
Picometer-- 10 to the negative
12, micrometer-- negative 6.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.120
But the Angstrom is just
a funny unit we use a lot,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.960
and it's 10 to the negative 10.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.090
So just to make sure there's no
ambiguity about that particular

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.100
detail, OK?

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.940
All right.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.110
So today's lecture will focus
on the molecules of life.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.560
And in particular, I'm going to,
through the next few classes,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.947
introduce you to the
various molecules of life.

00:03:04.947 --> 00:03:06.780
But first of all, we
have to do a little bit

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.150
to understand chemical bonding.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.980
And in particular,
we want to look

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.520
at both covalent and
non-covalent bonding

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.890
because covalent bonding is
important-- it's the structure,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.170
it's the framework.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.380
But non-covalent bonding
is what gives us dynamics.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.630
These are much
weaker forces that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.480
can be broken and
remade very readily that

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.820
are essential for
things like forming

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.810
the DNA duplex,
folding your proteins,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.850
associating the lipid bilayer.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.060
All of those are
non-covalent forces

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.130
and they are dynamic
because they're weak,

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.920
you can break one
relatively easily as long

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.600
as you're ready to make
another one in its place.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.530
So I will spend a little
bit of time on that.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.780
And then today, we'll talk
about lipids and membranes.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.060
But first of all,
let me introduce you

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.810
to some of the molecules of life
in this rendition that's done

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.940
by David Goodsell at Scripps.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.690
So up in the top corner
here, you look at 2.3

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.770
is the three dimensional
structure of a protein.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.990
It's folded into
a globular state

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.230
through non-covalent forces.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.410
I brought a little 3D
model of a protein for you

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.700
to look at and take
a look at later.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.670
That was one of the
suggestions I made.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.400
You could coordinate
printing a 3D model

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.830
as one of your later projects.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.980
We will learn about the
forces that hold the polymer

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.230
together-- the covalent forces.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.020
But then the
non-covalent forces that

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.880
make globular
structures that are

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.440
very important for function.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.420
They're not much use
as unraveled spaghetti.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.250
They're way more useful as their
three dimensional structure.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.430
Down here in the corner
is a carbohydrate.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.460
It really looks pretty
pathetic in this rendition,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.740
but carbohydrates
have a lot of value,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.950
particularly in energy
storage but also in things

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.610
like the extracellular
matrix and as entities

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.910
that signal information
between cells.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.070
There's a lot of
communication done

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.560
by cell surface carbohydrates.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.170
Over here you see the
canonical structure

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.240
of double stranded DNA.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.310
We'll look at the
covalent structure

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.580
of those single
strands, but then we'll

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.060
focus in on the non-covalent
interactions that

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.110
make the double-stranded DNA and
store genetic information which

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.090
is also central to life.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.180
And then lastly on this,
but we'll cover this today,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.280
is a lipid bilayer.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.340
It's a fascinating
supramolecule structure

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.000
that really is at the heart
of how all your cells are

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.650
held in a compartment
surrounded by a lipid bilayer.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.200
So by the time we start
talking about those,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.770
you'll understand the forces
that put in place that lipid

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.430
bilayer that arguably-- and I've
read articles that say this--

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.190
that the evolution
of lipid bilayers

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.070
is as important as
the genetic code.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.130
Because if cells did
not have a surrounding,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.760
did not have an inside where
you could concentrate reagents

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.720
and macromolecules
and do biochemistry,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.590
life wouldn't exist
in the same way.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.790
OK, so let's take a look at the
composition of living systems.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.950
And remarkably, we
are about 75% water.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.080
So most proteins
are very hydrated.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.140
There's a lot of water in cells.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.530
There's a lot of water outside
of cells in the matrix.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.080
And really, we sort
of survive weird.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.682
We survive in an
aqueous environment.

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:37.640
And the thing that you
also want to think about

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.150
is when we think about
non-covalent forces,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.570
these are forces put
in place in water.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.230
We don't live on a
far distant planet

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.320
where we're in sort of liquid
methane or anything like that.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.630
So water is critical to life.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.380
The establishment of the
hydrosphere when Earth first

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.630
formed, the
evolutionary events that

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.190
happen after that were really
hand in hand with the fact

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.410
that it was an
aqueous environment.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.240
Because forces are
different whether they

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.140
are in hydrophobic environments
or hydrophilic environments.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.480
And really, you'll start
to get appreciation

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.140
for that as we move forward.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.890
So this basically suggests that
if I put one of you in a giant

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.060
desiccator and pumped out all
the water I could possibly pull

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.920
out, there'd be about sort
of-- depending on your weight--

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.570
40 pounds of things left behind.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.000
Of what's left behind,
the majority of it

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.120
is going to be biological
macromolecules-- whoops.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.290
And then the rest of
it, that little sliver,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:42.090
are things like ions and small
molecules-- calcium, magnesium,

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.080
iron, manganese, those
small inorganic ions

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.500
as well as small molecule
metabolites that are

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.660
involved in central metabolism.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.000
Let's now look at
the macromolecules

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.020
and their sort of proportions
relative to each other.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.540
The smallest sliver
of the lipids,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.250
which we'll talk about today.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.560
Then you have the
nucleic acids that

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.780
are critical for
information storage.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.440
You have proteins, which make
the largest piece of the pie.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.320
And carbohydrates,
which are is the 25%.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.820
So you can see how
important carbohydrates

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.330
are because of their proportion
being relatively large.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.460
The lipid proportion, though, is
small but absolutely critical,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.282
harking back to the
membrane bilayer.

00:08:27.282 --> 00:08:29.240
Because if we didn't have
the membrane bilayer,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.580
once again, we wouldn't
have life in the same way

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.750
that we have it now.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.809
So that gives you a sense of the
relative proportions of things.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.710
And frankly, when I
discuss the macromolecules,

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.010
I really like to start
with lipids because

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.560
of the membrane bilayer, but
because their structures are

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.910
comparatively simple relative to
amino acids and nucleic acids.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.460
So we can get a
few of the basics

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.150
of the chemical structures
down and how we render them

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.760
on paper so that we can
do that with lipids,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.230
which are a little simpler.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.190
Now life, to a
chemist, they have

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.050
to sort of worry
about this entire mess

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.520
of the periodic table.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.970
But the good news for you
is for biological systems,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.130
we deal with very
focused components

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.790
of the periodic table.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.570
So those biological
macromolecules

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.620
are made up largely
of only six elements--

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:27.140
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and
oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.080
So that makes the
amount of stuff

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.880
you need to know about basic
covalent structures way

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.460
more simple than it is for
the average chemist who

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.730
has to worry about everything
down here in the nether regions

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.290
and-- whoops, what
are you doing?

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.380
And the things that
are radioactive,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.690
all kinds of other things.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.440
You don't have to worry
about any of that.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.140
So the covalent bonding
we will talk about

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.130
is amongst those six
different elements.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.900
And they make up 98%
of the cellular mass.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.110
And then the other components
that are important in cells

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.880
are some metal ions--

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.060
the alkali and
[? alkalia ?] elements.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.380
So sodium, magnesium, potassium,
calcium-- those are all

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.030
quite important in life.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.130
And then these
transition metal ions

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.730
that are really important in
enzyme catalysis, for example.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.720
But we will not cover
very much of that.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.610
But those are what are known as
trace elements that are very--

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.380
transition metal
elements that are very

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.600
important for biochemistry.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.910
And then last of all,
there are some rogue ones

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.310
that there's even smaller
amounts in physiologic systems.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.950
These are things like chromium,
molybdenum, and tungsten,

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.870
selenium, and iodine.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.420
And of those, certain
of these elements only

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.670
are found in totally
bizarre organisms.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.820
So for example, you and I
don't have much molybdenum

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.420
and tungsten, I don't
think, unless it

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.240
slipped in there by accident.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.780
But you and I definitely
need selenium and iodine

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.620
as trace elements.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.330
Does anyone know
where iodine comes

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.290
and figures most prominently?

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:01.790
Yeah?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.260
AUDIENCE: Thyroid.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.800
PROFESSOR: Thyroid, absolutely.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.670
So the thyroid hormone is
a small organic molecule

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.040
with several iodines in it.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.090
And we need-- absolutely
need-- iodine in our diet

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.810
in order to build the
thyroxine hormone that

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.480
deals with a lot of
aspects of metabolism.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.270
So we don't need a lot.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.160
And if we get too
much, it's bad for you.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.980
But we definitely need
traces of these elements.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.970
Now I will spend a very
small amount of time

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.140
just laying down the basics
of organic chemistry bonding.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.130
Now who have you either
taken the chemistry GIR

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.445
or had high school
chemistry quite recently?

00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:45.530
Is that pretty much all of you?

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.810
And now if you didn't put
your hand up, don't worry.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.650
We're here to bring you up
to speed if you need it.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.770
Frankly, if you just know
what's on the next two or three

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.180
slides, you're in great shape.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.180
All the information that you
need has been condensed .

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.400
But if it's a little
bit out of nowhere,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.380
you could come see
me in office hours

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.780
and I can just run
through things for you

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.700
and we can just get
you up to speed.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.740
There is no need
for pre-knowledge,

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.200
I just need an idea of how
much pre-knowledge you have.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.380
So when we talk about
covalent bonding

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.900
and start to think
about the elements that

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.900
are critical for life,
it's important to consider

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.030
the electronic structures
of these elements

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.790
and why they happen to be
the chosen elements, OK?

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:33.360
The most important thing about
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.420
oxygen, phosphorus,
and sulfur is they

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.780
love to make covalent bonds.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.080
A lot of metal ions
form salts, you

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.380
know-- sodium chloride or
many other different salts.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.370
But covalent bonds
are the main structure

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.840
of all macromolecules.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.130
Strong bonds between
elements, such as these six

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.930
in particular-- these six--

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.170
where they share electrons
in covalent bonds

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.270
rather than form
ionic interactions

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.700
where somebody gives an
electron to someone else

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.290
and you have a plus-minus
type interaction.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.110
So these shared bonds
are important for life.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.920
So it's good to understand why
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.510
and oxygen, and then phosphorous
and sulfur are so important.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.030
In order to understand
the covalent bonding

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.550
of these elements,
it's useful to know

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.710
the electronic
configuration, but you

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.300
could live without that.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.010
The most important thing
is that covalent bonds,

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.660
such as the one between
carbon and hydrogen here,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.630
reflect a shared
pair of electrons--

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.180
one from the hydrogen,
one from the carbon--

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.550
to make a stable covalent bond.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.980
Because of its
electronic configuration,

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.970
carbon is neutral when it
has four covalent bonds.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.430
Nitrogen is neutral when it
has three covalent bonds.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.080
But there's an extra lone
pair of electrons that are not

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.660
forming bonds in
neutral nitrogen.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.710
And oxygen is neutral when
it has two covalent bonds.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.680
These could be with hydrogen,
they could be with carbon,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.010
they could be with several
of the other elements.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.832
For carbon, we don't deal
with charged states of carbon

00:14:10.832 --> 00:14:12.290
because they're
pretty high energy.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.560
They may be high
energy intermediates

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.030
in an enzyme catalyzed
reaction, but they're not

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.940
sitting there as high
energy intermediates

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.850
in your macromolecules.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.480
The key thing you want to notice
is for all of these elements,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.450
the valence shell is complete
with eight electrons.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.340
But these lone pairs--

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.520
and I-- or bunny ears, as
people like to call them--

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.540
really feature very prominently
in biochemistry and biology

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.860
because they are places for
hydrogen bonding interactions.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.850
So we run a lot on
electrostatic hydrogen bonding

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.070
and hydrophobic interactions.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.980
If we know where the
lone pair electrons are,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.440
we know one part of a
hydrogen bonding interaction.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.120
It turns out that
in biology, we're

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.810
mostly at pH 7 or in that
range except for a few sub

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.370
cellular compartments.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.820
But at pH 8, nitrogen
lone pair of electrons

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.530
will pick up a proton to become
a positively charged nitrogen.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.210
And you'll mostly see that
as a positively charged.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:19.260
So the side chain of lysine,
which has an NH 3, an NH 2

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.360
at the very end
of a carbon chain,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.450
is most commonly protonated
and positively charged.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.570
So it could be involved
in an interaction.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.130
So we can consider both the
neutral and the positively

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.720
charged state of nitrogen.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.540
For oxygen, that
oxygen lone pair

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.260
can pick up a proton to
form the hydronium ion.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.340
So that's a positively
charged OH group.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.310
So it would have an
extra proton, using up

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:52.800
a lone pair and three hydrogens,
or it could give up a proton

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.170
to form the hydroxide ion.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.030
And those are the states of
oxygen that are most common.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:02.730
So in that, we've kind of
dispatched those first four

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.920
of the six elements.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.440
Phosphorus and sulfur
are a little tricky,

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.910
but there is some good news.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.130
Sulfur copies oxygen,
so you don't really

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.110
have to worry too
much about sulfur.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.850
You'll just consider
it to really

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.700
be sort of an older
sibling of oxygen

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.340
where all the chemistry
is very, very similar.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.940
Sulfur, or the negatively
charged sulfur anion,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.410
are both important.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.270
Phosphorus is different.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.310
Phosphorus does
not tend to show up

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.095
in the version that
copies nitrogen.

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:40.000
It is capable of adopting
higher oxidation states.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.350
And all of the phosphorus
you meet in biochemistry

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.110
for the most part-- there's
a few odd things in weird

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.090
organisms--

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.890
is going to be in the form of
an oxidized form of phosphorus,

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.240
which generally has one,
two, three, four, five

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.770
bonds to phosphorus.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.350
It can take on a
higher oxidation state.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.240
And you will see phosphorus.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.300
Phosphorus in the phosphate form
is absolutely essential to life

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.060
because it's the place where
we store a ton of reactivity

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.339
for the reactions
of nucleotides,

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:16.329
adenosine triphosphate,
adenosine diphosphate,

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:21.310
the phosphodiester backbone in
nucleic acids, phosphorylation

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.349
of amino acids to
form phosphoproteins.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:30.100
It's always in this state
with all the extra oxygens

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.430
and that configuration
of bonds, OK?

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.520
If you know this, you've got
a lot of the covalent bonds

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.270
under control.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.650
So any questions about this?

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.840
Is everyone all right?

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.280
I know it might
be-- it's probably

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.230
a refresher for most of you.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.480
The next thing I just
briefly want to mention

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.520
is the most typical
functional groups that

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.920
occur in biological molecules.

00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:05.900
And you may, say, well, what
does it mean, functional group?

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.480
Usually it's a place
where the action happens.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.490
If you have a large
molecule that's

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.780
a bunch of carbon-carbon and
carbon-hydrogen covalent bonds,

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.850
there's not a lot going
on unless you can really

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.880
rip those bonds apart,
but they're high energy.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.070
But functional
groups are oftentimes

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:26.040
where chemistry happens
or biochemistry happens.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.445
So there's the OH hydroxyl.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.590
We, as chemists and
biochemists, will

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.010
tend to use an R where
we mean something else.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.840
So we don't write out
a whole structure,

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.320
we would just put R OH equals--

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.870
I'm going to just say anything.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.600
So for example, if R was CH 3,
CH 2, you would have ethanol.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.900
But I'm keeping it more generic.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.010
The next functional
group that is important

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.240
is the carboxylate group,
or the carboxyl group.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.660
Looks like this.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.203
Now when we look
at these molecules,

00:19:05.203 --> 00:19:07.370
you always want to sort of
think where the lone pair

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.570
electrons are.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:15.080
There's two on oxygen, two
on oxygen, two on oxygen.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.530
So that actually shows you where
the rest of the electrons are.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.030
This is the carboxyl group.

00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:27.440
But in nature, in
physiologic systems,

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:34.930
this shows up most commonly
in its anionic form.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.150
That's important
because when we start

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.470
to think of interactions between
enzymes and their substrates,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.600
or the folding of
proteins, we're

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.750
thinking of something with a
negative charge, not a neutral.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:53.480
So this group loses a proton
to form the carboxylate group.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.875
And if you want to know
where the lone pairs are now,

00:19:56.875 --> 00:19:58.000
that's what they look like.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.060
So those are two
of the key ones.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:08.510
Let's now go to nitrogen.
That is the neutral amine.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.060
But as I just
mentioned to you, that

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:25.640
will very commonly
pick up a proton

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.930
and be in the positively
charged state.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.790
Now when I show you
both of those guys

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.790
in the positively charged state,
what you could immediately

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.850
tell me is that if I have
an amino acid with one

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.030
of these groups and a
nearby amino acid with one

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:44.790
of these groups, they could form
an electrostatic interaction

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:49.120
between themselves-- plus and
minus complementing each other.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.053
So if you know
the charge states,

00:20:51.053 --> 00:20:52.470
you're much better
off because you

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:57.090
can tell where non-covalent
types of ionic or electrostatic

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.810
interactions occur.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.480
So these are very important.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.220
Then there's the
phosphate group--

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:14.660
it's often ionized-- and
the sulfhydryl group.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:21.020
So phosphate-- the
sulfhydryl group

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.820
is also called the thiol group.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:29.830
And I'm sure I've spelt
that wrong because hydryl--

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.940
they look like that.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.540
And the most common
state of the sulfhydryl--

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.680
well, not the most common--

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.870
can also appear as
the anionic structure.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.680
So that's the basic
functional groups.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.710
Now there are two more
functional group assemblies

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.240
that you will see a lot
in physiologic systems

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.930
that are basically composites
of some of these structures.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.840
Because when we have
single building blocks,

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.490
we need to join
them to each other

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.720
through different
types of chemistries.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.200
So I want to show you
the types of chemistry

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.270
that you get by forming
a composite of hydroxyl

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:12.460
and a carboxyl group and a
composite of a carboxyl group

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.570
and an amide.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.730
Because the polymer
that's the protein

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.290
polymer has building blocks
that have a means and carboxyls,

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.830
but they're all put together
into what polymeric structure

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.540
where those groups have been
joined in a condensation

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.040
polymer.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.220
So let me just show you
what those look like.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.420
And then we'll be done
with the functional groups.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:43.800
So there are-- the first one--

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:52.928
because I've drawn them
in this order, OK--

00:22:52.928 --> 00:22:53.470
is the amide.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:13.440
And the other one is the ester.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.900
When you do these two reactions,
if you do them in the lab,

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.730
they're called
condensation reactions

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.940
because as you
form that bond, you

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.770
kick out a molecule of water.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:34.810
These are really important
new functional groups to you

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.590
because your proteins are
held together by amide groups.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.450
In fact, they're so
important in proteins,

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:45.590
we often call them
peptide groups.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.990
You'll see more
about that on Monday.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.190
And the esters are
really important.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.670
For example, in
derivatives of glycerol

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.940
that make fatty acids
or phospholipids,

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.760
you'll see esters
occurring again and again.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.660
The other composite group
that you can also see

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:13.525
is with the phosphate
plus an alcohol.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.610
And what that group
looks like is as follows.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:23.110
And you're going to see
this sort of endlessly

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.220
in nucleic acids.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.070
Let's keep the
charges all even here.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.590
And this is what's known
as the phosphate ester.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:48.650
OK, and that is yet
another condensation

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.950
where you kick out water.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.710
All right, so let's just
run back to this image.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.230
And we can sum it all up.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.750
Those are all the groups
that I just described to you.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.200
And if you want, you can
go back and put lone pairs

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.000
of electrons on everything.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.040
And then the composite
groups that I

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.830
want to mention to
you in particular

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:11.990
are the amide and the ester.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.990
And they're very important
in physiologic systems.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.170
They are the bond
that holds together

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.660
the biopolymer in many cases.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.560
Not shown on this picture
is the phosphate ester--

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.540
I've added that this
year because it's

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.640
kind of important--

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.230
is a similar condensation
reaction between phosphorus

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.230
and an alcohol, and
that in particular

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:41.260
is the bond you'll see that
holds together nucleic acids.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.210
And now one sort
of thing that we

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.340
won't go into a lot of detail--

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.100
I want you to notice
that this nitrogen here

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.050
has a lone pair of electrons.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.710
It picks up a
proton very readily.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:58.190
The amide nitrogen is not so
willing to pick up a proton

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.500
because it messes up the
rest of its chemistry.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.660
So that nitrogen
in an amide tends

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.790
to be observed as a neutral.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.090
However, that hydrogen can be
involved in hydrogen bonds.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.880
OK, any questions
about that before we

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.416
move on to non-covalent bonds?

00:26:13.416 --> 00:26:15.560
Is everything clear?

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.710
Now I try to put
everything in one place

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.420
so you have it in front of you.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.700
What I've put on
those two slides

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.030
is what you need to know about
organic covalent bonding.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.950
It doesn't go beyond it.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.710
I will say there's a
tiny bit of memorization,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.000
but once you commit
that stuff to memory,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.180
you're in a good
place with respect

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.820
to understanding how
the molecules of life

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.310
are put together.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.810
OK.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.070
Now what is more
important to me once we've

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.670
put those structures in place
is non-covalent bonding.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:09.140
Because to me, non-covalent
bonding is synonymous with

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.500
dynamics--

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.100
forces that can be readily
broken and reassembled, broken

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.360
and reassembled.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.140
The energy, the strength of
a typical bond between two

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.990
carbons or a carbon
and a hydrogen

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:32.030
is on the order of 90 to
100 kilocalories per mole.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.520
It takes a lot to
break those bonds.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.890
We can't break them
at will to go and do

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.930
some biological activity.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.950
But the range of energies
of the non-covalent bonds

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.840
are far more modest.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.075
They range from--
so this is covalent.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.890
But the non-covalent
range from 1, maybe

00:27:54.890 --> 00:28:00.060
to about 10
kilocalories per mole.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.330
So when you think
about those forces,

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.780
they're readily broken
and made, broken and made.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.840
And what's so amazing about
protein and nucleic acid

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.290
structure is that
you can gradually

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.520
break a bond while you're
making another non-covalent bond

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.140
so you can have the dynamics
of the structure that

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.990
define a lot of its
functional properties.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.230
Because structures
are dynamic, an enzyme

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:28.190
that's a composite of a lot
of non-covalent interaction

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.770
combined a substrate
can gradually

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:34.280
form a set of covalent
bonds with that substrate

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.430
but then can start changing
the shape of that structure

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:41.030
and that shape in order to
go through a catalytic cycle

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.510
to do chemistry and then
to liberate products.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:50.450
That is all driven by changes
in non-covalent bonding.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:53.930
Subtle changes that
occur without big energy

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:58.820
barriers that would be necessary
to break the covalent bonds.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.870
So shown at the top here, you
see the average bond energy

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.550
of covalent bonds.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.050
This small number is
something, for example,

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.510
between two chlorines.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:09.920
That's a pretty weak bond.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.070
But of course, we don't have
a lot of them running around.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.050
So really, carbon-hydrogen,
carbon-carbon,

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.780
they're at the higher end--

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.590
about 100 kilocalories,
80 kilocalories per mole.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.750
The other important
interactions, though, that

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.630
make up the non-covalent
interactions are as follows.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:35.360
So the first important
one is the ionic bond.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:42.080
It is also called
a salt bridge or

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.970
an electrostatic interaction.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.300
Why we give three
names for this probably

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.930
comes from which type of
chemist decided to define them.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.150
They are all the same things.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:30:01.810
They are basically interactions
between a positively charged

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.190
entity, a protonated amine; and
a negatively charged entity,

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.350
a deprotonated carboxylate.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.960
Those are about the strongest
of the non-covalent bonds,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.110
but it's very variable
because it depends

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.910
a lot on their environment.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:19.240
If those two entities are in
a hydrophobic environment,

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.640
they're going to charge
right for each other

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.610
to form a strong
electrostatic interaction.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.550
But if those are out in
water, each of those groups

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.310
could be solvated
by water and they'd

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.230
have to give up
solvation in order

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.410
to form a good
electrostatic interaction.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.240
When we talk about
protein folding,

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.830
we'll go into that in a
little bit more detail.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.580
So the reason why this
says very variable

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.910
is not to drive you crazy.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.450
It's just they're very variable.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.150
But they will still
range, I would say,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.090
from 2 to 10 kilocalories.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.850
Come on.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.710
So those are important--
easy to pick out.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.360
The strongest of the set.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.950
If Dr. Ray gives
you a problem set

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.750
and starts asking you to pick
out non-covalent interactions,

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.240
that's the one you
take care of straight

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.790
away because it is
the most obvious.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:14.040
The next most important,
though, is the hydrogen bond.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:20.290
Now hydrogen bonds
have been known

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.892
to mystify people for
years because people

00:31:23.892 --> 00:31:25.600
are like, how do I
pick these things out,

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.892
how do I pick these things out?

00:31:26.892 --> 00:31:30.070
I'm going to give you a
foolproof way of picking out

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.370
hydrogen bonds so you will
never be at a loss for hydrogen

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.510
bonds, OK.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.850
Well, how do we recognize them?

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:45.010
They are between hydrogens that
are on electronegative elements

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.435
such as oxygen--

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.080
of course, there's other
things attached here--

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:59.150
or on nitrogen, or on sulfur.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.090
So all of those three
functional groups

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.030
can serve as
hydrogen bond donors.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:09.020
They can give a proton in
a hydrogen bond and share

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.830
that proton between a
hydrogen bond acceptor, OK.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.705
So these are all going
to be known as donors.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.450
So you can recognize them.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:25.670
This-- carbon is not
a hydrogen bond donor.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.500
Carbon's got his
hydrogen and he's not

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.570
giving it away to anybody
for love or money.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:30.980
Its holding on tight.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.580
So this is not a
hydrogen bond donor.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.420
OK?

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.590
Now what are the
hydrogen bond acceptors

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:41.637
are places where that hydrogen
would want to sit-- yes.

00:32:41.637 --> 00:32:43.470
AUDIENCE: There's the
two lines next to it--

00:32:45.513 --> 00:32:47.930
PROFESSOR: Actually, they just
read-- they could be double

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.050
or they could be single,
but I was just putting them

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:54.020
so that you see that the
nitrogen has one, two, three

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.190
bonds to it.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.480
OK, yeah.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.050
It could alternatively also
be the form of nitrogen--

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.750
just to confuse you--

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.290
that has an extra proton that
could be the protonated version

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.390
because that can still
be a hydrogen bond donor.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.070
OK.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.200
Now what are the
hydrogen bond acceptors?

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.050
They are any place where
you have a lone pair.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:20.410
So let's just think
of a carbonyl group--

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:21.840
two lone pairs.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:29.440
A hydroxyl group--
two lone pairs.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.960
A nitrogen that is
not protonated--

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.300
one lone pair.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.070
Those are the hydrogen
bond acceptors.

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:47.420
So as long as you
know your structures

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.330
in the functional groups and you
know where the lone pairs are,

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.060
you can figure out where there
could be a hydrogen bond.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.590
So all of these
types are acceptors.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.520
OK.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.900
So in protein
biochemistry, for example,

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.280
those kinds of hydrogen
bonding is very, very important

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.370
to form the three-dimensional
structures of proteins.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:18.210
And the reason why is
because in a protein,

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:25.150
proteins are made
up of amide bonds

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:30.290
where this Hn can be a donor,
this O can be an acceptor,

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.030
and you can get networks of
hydrogen bonding interactions

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.850
to establish
structures of proteins.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.670
When a small molecule
binds to a protein,

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.560
it may look to fit
in a place where

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.460
it can maximize electrostatic
interactions and the hydrogen

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.960
bonding interactions.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.530
So we'll ask you to start
to be able to pick out

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.130
hydrogen bonding.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:57.860
So here you saw the
electrostatic interaction.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.070
Here is a typical hydrogen
bonding interaction

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.040
between a hydroxyl
and a carbonyl group.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.080
I couldn't spot
that very readily

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.780
unless I remembered that there
were lone pairs of electrons

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.130
there, OK.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.450
The other two ty-- any
questions about that?

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:15.200
Any questions about
hydrogen bonding?

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.820
Are you comfortable
with thinking

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.760
you could derive your way to
figuring out where they are?

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.950
You'll see them used
a lot, so they'll

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:26.030
become more and more familiar
to you as you move forward.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.920
OK, good.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:34.595
The last two types
of interactions

00:35:34.595 --> 00:35:43.880
are the hydrophobic interactions
and van der Waals forces.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.430
I never get the
spelling right, but I'll

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.030
get the concepts over you.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.870
Now hydrophobic interactions
are incredibly important.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:02.170
So when you think of folding
a protein driven solely

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:05.620
by electrostatic interactions
and hydrogen bonding,

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.760
you have a bit of a problem
because all of those groups

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.840
are hydrogen bonded to water.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.970
So you'd have to
get rid of the water

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:15.430
before they could make
interactions with each other.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:16.600
Does that makes sense?

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.320
Because we are in water.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.590
We're folding in water.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:23.110
Hydrophobic interactions are
really great because they

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.810
want to form in water.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:29.230
If you're making, you know,
a batch of salad dressing,

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.290
oil and vinegar, and you
shake it up, what happens?

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.760
It separates.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.340
The oil goes to the top, the
vinegar goes to the bottom.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.030
Why?

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:41.030
Because of hydrophobic
interactions in the oil phase.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:43.630
So if you have a
large protein that

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.730
has a bunch of
hydrophobic groups,

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.120
they will want to
collapse out of the water

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.200
to interact with each other.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.380
And then hydrogen
bonding and electrostatic

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.880
will fall into place.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.810
So hydrophobic interactions
are a very important and vital

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:02.890
force in nature in the
non-covalent bonding.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:05.410
And those are
literally interactions

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:09.700
amongst molecules that have
a lot of CH and CC bonds.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.560
The final force
that's shown up there

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.505
is the van der Waals force.

00:37:13.505 --> 00:37:15.130
And we don't worry
too much about that,

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:20.020
but it is simply the interaction
between very weakly polarized

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.840
carbon-hydrogen or
other types of bonds

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:28.840
where there's a little bit
of a dipole between the bond

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.840
and they form little
dipolar interactions.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.610
But mostly, I think
you really want

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:36.400
to focus on the
electrostatic, the hydrogen

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.930
bond, and the hydrophobic.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.990
These are more minor and it's
a little bit of a subtlety.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.520
So let's focus on those three.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:48.685
All right, so with that
said, the key thing for you--

00:37:48.685 --> 00:37:50.060
what do you need
to be able to do

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.710
is understand them and recognize
them in complex systems.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.240
Lastly I'm just
going to leave this.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.040
It's going to stay
in your notes.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.660
We in biochemistry tend to
use line angle drawings.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.530
It's kind of complicated to draw
these sort of great big things

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.010
with all the hydrogens and
oxygen and stuff spelled out,

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.530
so we use the line
angled drawing.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.950
There's some shown here
for different molecules.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:19.520
And the rules are laid out
so that you can go and just

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.470
figure out, do a
bit of practicing,

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:23.360
and just figure out
the line angle drawing

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.500
and what it means.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.100
Basically, every line
represents a bond,

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.440
every vertex represents
a carbon atom.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.310
But what you do
show on the drawings

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:36.330
are the non-carbon atoms.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.550
So for example, oxygen, or
nitrogen. And when you show,

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:44.180
you imply the hydrogens
that are bonded to carbon

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.220
but you have to show
the hydrogens that

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.250
are on nitrogen or
oxygen, for example,

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:52.120
and you have to figure out what
your charged state might be.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.620
So I'm going to
leave you with that.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.510
All right.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.040
OK.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.970
So what we've learned so far is
these basic forces in biology

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:03.470
are critical for the assembly
of the building blocks

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.600
of biological macromolecules.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.300
What I want to talk to you
about now-- and we'll probably,

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.300
because I've spent a
little bit of time on that,

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.260
spill over a little
more to next week--

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.540
but I'm going to talk to
you about the first class

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.430
of macromolecules,
which are the lipids.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:19.970
So what makes something a lipid?

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:23.300
These are the most sort
of complicated mixture

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.680
of biological molecules.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.140
And formally, they're not
really macromolecules.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.760
They're small molecules.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.390
But what's common to all of
them is that they are very rich

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:35.630
in carbon-carbon and
carbon-hydrogen bonds

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.380
because all of these--

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.680
the line angle drawings
of all of these

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.620
would suggest to you that
the dominant feature of all

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.770
these molecules is
a bunch of CC and CH

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.640
ions, which makes the
molecules quite hydrophobic.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.970
There are no functional
groups there.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.050
And they behave
very differently.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.800
For example, they would
have a tough time dissolving

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.790
in water in some cases.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:02.990
And so this complicated
looking set of molecules

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.840
can be distilled out
as being very rich

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.830
in carbon-hydrogen and
carbon-carbon bonds.

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.840
And we call those
collectively lipids.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.900
And they have a lot of
different functions.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.550
So for example, triglycerides,
such as shown here,

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.420
with three ester bonds
are storage for energy--

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.860
things like estradiol,
things like steroids.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:32.150
They have this 6-6-6-5
arrangement of rings.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.075
All your steroid hormones
kind of look like that.

00:40:35.075 --> 00:40:38.000
A lot of CH bonds.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.710
There are some vitamins.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:43.160
So for example,
retinol is a vitamin.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.720
It's also a lipid.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:49.630
And then there are the
phospholipids shown down here.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:53.380
I just briefly want to mention
a little bit about retinal

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.140
and retinol, which are crucial.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.110
Retinol is a critical vitamin.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:02.050
It comes actually
from carotene, which

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:03.880
is a molecule that
you find in a lot

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.120
of orange and yellow
fruits, such as carrots.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.610
But the oxidized
product of retinol

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.370
is this lipid called
retinal, which

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:15.550
is central to the
process of vision.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:19.750
So retinal binds to proteins
that sit in the membrane.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:24.710
When light shines on them, the
shape of the retinal changes.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.100
It goes from a
particular configuration

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.080
of the double bond
to a different one.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.920
The shape just changes, and that
sends a signal to your brain.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.430
So lipids are important,
absolutely essential,

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.130
in vision and sight
because they are involved

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.580
in the signaling process because
their shapes change and send

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.230
signals.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.550
Other types of lipids--

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.400
so these things-- and we
call them fatty acids mostly

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.420
because they are greasy
long-chained acids

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:58.760
with a long hydrophobic tail and
a hydrophilic end group here.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.980
These molecules
are also what are

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.830
known as amphipathic
because they have

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.440
a sort of split personality.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.910
They have a hydrophobic moiety
and a hydrophilic moiety.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.250
Whenever you see amphi at
the beginning of a word,

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.640
it means in both.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.760
So both hydrophilic
and lipophilic.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.200
So these are important.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.000
And these are very
important components.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.680
You probably heard
a lot of press

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:28.880
about some of the fatty
acids and how bad trans fats

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.390
are for you and how you
should be careful to make sure

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:37.430
your diet is rich in cis
fats rather than trans fats

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.000
because the trans fats are
contributors to coronary heart

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.970
disease.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.780
So you may wonder, what's the
relationship between heart

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.230
disease and these two types
of lipophilic components

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.940
which are in the body?

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.680
So let me describe to
you that relationship.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.930
Remember that cis fats are rich
in things like the nut oils

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.570
and fruit oils,
such as olive oil.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:05.180
So coronary heart disease is
associated with trans fats.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.000
What's the linkage, what's
the biology in that?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.380
So the story is
related to cholesterol.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:17.210
Cholesterol is a critical
component in our membranes.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.460
The trouble is we have to
be able to move cholesterol

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.480
around.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.290
But it's so hydrophobic it
doesn't dissolve in water, OK?

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:27.740
So in the body, your
cholesterol is moved around

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:31.100
in the form of lipoproteins
that bind to the cholesterol

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.110
and take it to the
different organs

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.210
where it is needed, all right?

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.100
And so the
lipoproteins can either

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:41.540
be low density and
associate with cholesterol,

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.480
or they can be high
density, and those also

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.400
associate with cholesterol.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.240
The high density lipoproteins
are kind of large.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.560
In fact, they're fairly agile.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:55.340
They don't stick to
arteries and vessels,

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.200
and they can be
excreted in the liver

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.020
or move around the bloodstream
without any problem.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:03.440
It's the low density ones that
are problems because they're

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.780
low density and
they kind of stick

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.610
to the walls of your
arteries and start

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.160
making buildups and
then plaques, which

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.510
contribute to heart disease.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.350
So the low density
ones have cholesterol,

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.920
but they're very small, sticky,
and it's a physical interaction

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.940
with your blood vessels and they
start to clog your arteries.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.840
What's the relationship to
saturated and trans fats?

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.630
It's that they increase
the low density

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:33.150
lipoprotein in preference
to the high density.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:35.180
So if you have a
lot of trans fats,

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.880
you make a lot of low
density lipoproteins,

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.190
it's trying to carry
cholesterol around,

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.320
but it gets stuck to
your blood vessels

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.980
and you start to clog
your blood vessels.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.270
That contributes
to heart disease.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.930
So these lipophilic
molecules are important.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.150
They are places to store energy.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:57.680
They are critical to hormones
and signaling, for example.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.680
But there are some
complications with disease

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.260
because certain
types of fatty acids

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.790
contribute to heart disease.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:05.477
Yeah.

00:45:05.477 --> 00:45:07.019
AUDIENCE: Is it a
lower density if it

00:45:07.019 --> 00:45:08.610
doesn't have a bend in it?

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:10.190
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:13.550
the density is of the
entire physical particle.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:18.710
It's a nanoparticle that
would show a different density

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.260
respective to how
it floats in water.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.070
So the density is really
the physical metric

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:28.060
of the entire particle as
opposed to just the molecule.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.680
It might be different because
of the way it compacts,

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.070
but the important thing
about the trans fats

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.560
is that they really
contribute to making

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.580
the protein that forms
the low density particles.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.850
OK, all right.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:45.180
So I'm just going
to introduce these--

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.990
not quickly, but I'll
show you some cool images

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:50.760
at the beginning
of the next class.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.840
This is the last group
of lipidic molecules,

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.830
and they are actually--

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:59.970
whoops-- esters
and phosphoesters

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:03.100
of fatty acids with glycerol.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.220
This is a small
molecule that forms

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.000
esters through its oxygen
to these long chains

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.770
and also to phosphate.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:15.960
And these contribute to
really important functions

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.960
in the body.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.170
They are also
amphipathic because they

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:24.060
have a hydrophobic component
and a hydrophilic component.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:27.210
And we often draw them in
a shorthand form like this

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:30.860
to represent this head
group and these tails.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.870
And I want to just leave you
with this wonderful image

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:37.010
of the sorts of
supramolecular structures

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.850
that these kinds of
phospholipids can form.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:48.660
So supramolecular is a very
important term in biology

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.180
as it is in engineering--
supramolecular.

00:46:54.379 --> 00:46:58.230
It means it's a structure that's
above the molecular level.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.940
It's an aggregation
of different molecules

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.850
to make a super molecule
with different properties

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:07.190
from the individual components.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:18.400
Phospholipids self-assemble--
and that's another important

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:18.900
term--

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:23.040
into supramolecular structures
that are very, very important

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.360
in living systems.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:29.430
Some of them just are useful
in other sorts of engineering

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:32.310
approaches, such as
liposomes and micelles,

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:35.250
but the most important
supramolecular structure

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:38.160
of a phospholipid
is the lipid bilayer

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.120
that surrounds your cells.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.500
And what happens is you
simply put those molecules--

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.540
the phospholipids
in water and they

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.900
will self-assemble on their
own into these supramolecular

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.050
structures.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:54.570
Whether they form micelles
or liposomes or bilayers

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:59.280
is dependent very much on
the tails of the lipids--

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.950
what sorts of shapes
and structures you get.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.980
But in physiology--
in human physiology--

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.780
the phospholipids
that we have want

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:10.170
to form these bilayer
structures that have incredibly

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.770
important properties.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.520
Most importantly that
they are semi-permeable

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.450
and they can wrap, form the
boundary to certain cells.

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.910
So I will continue with
the final discussion

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:23.520
of this on Monday
before we move forward

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.220
to the amino acids,
peptides, and proteins.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.490
And I just quickly want
to move you to ask you

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:34.140
for Monday to try to catch
a read of the section 3.2

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.850
in the text if
you have a chance.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.180
It'll give you a nice preview.

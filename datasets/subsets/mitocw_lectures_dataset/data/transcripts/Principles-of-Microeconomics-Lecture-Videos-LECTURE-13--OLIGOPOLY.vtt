00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.400
JONATHAN GRUBER: All right,
why don't we get started?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.600
Today we're going to move
on to, finally, the most

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.340
realistic market structure.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.260
We talked about perfectly
competitive markets.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.680
Now, that was a very
useful, extreme example

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.952
to help us think about
economic efficiency.

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:29.910
We then flipped over to
talk about the somewhat

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.009
more real estate
case of monopoly,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.550
but still, very few markets
have only one participant.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.940
A true monopoly is rare
in the private market.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.000
What most markets are
marked by are probably

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.580
more features of
oligopoly, which

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.840
is a market with a small
group of firms competing

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
with each other, but with
barriers to entry that keep out

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.833
an unlimited number of firms.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:56.250
Think about these
as markets where

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.990
there are some
barriers to entry,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.270
so firms just can't
consciously enter and exit

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.570
like they could in
our IBM/Dell example,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.180
but where there's small
enough barriers to entry

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.788
that a few firms have
gotten in, not just one.

00:01:08.788 --> 00:01:10.080
So it's not a natural monopoly.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.270
It's not like only one
firm can be in there.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030
Multiple firms are in
there, but they only

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.780
know they have to
compete with each other,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.600
not with the big, wide world.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.200
So for example,
the classic example

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.060
of an oligopoly industry
would be the auto industry.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.393
Auto manufacturers
clearly compete.

00:01:26.393 --> 00:01:27.810
Clearly, if you
watch any sporting

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.520
event and watch how much
advertising that goes,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.270
they're clearly competing
with each other.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.900
They're comparing to
each other all the time.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.110
But most of the
cars in the world

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.660
are produced by fewer than
10 auto manufacturers.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.910
The notion that we have a
perfectly competitive market

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.940
of thousands of sellers
selling identical goods

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.290
is clearly not right when
it comes to buying a car.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.830
So that's the model we're
going to want to focus on

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.820
for the next few lectures.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.992
Now, within an oligopoly
market, whenever

00:01:59.992 --> 00:02:01.450
we think about this
market, we want

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.910
to start by noting that
within this market,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.740
these limited sets
of competitors

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.730
can behave in two ways.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:15.170
They can behave cooperatively
or non-cooperatively.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.930
Cooperatively
means that they can

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.250
form what's called a cartel.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.270
So when there's an
oligopoly market

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.380
and the firms cooperatively get
together and make decisions,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.250
that's called the cartel, the
most famous example of which

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.130
is OPEC, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.860
which are the set of countries
that control about 2/3

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.830
of the world's oil,
led by Saudi Arabia,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.140
is the major player in OPEC.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.080
It's a cartel of
about a dozen nations.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.170
And what they do is they
control the vast majority

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.270
of the world's oil reserves.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.970
And by behaving cooperatively,
they essentially

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.610
turn themselves into a monopoly.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.550
OPEC acts as if they've
got the monopoly in oil.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.770
Certainly they used to.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.770
Now it's getting harder.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.180
Other non-OPEC countries are
starting to produce more oil

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.610
and it's breaking down.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.590
But for a long time,
they were essentially

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.577
the cooperative
producer of oil, and act

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:25.910
essential like a monopoly,
and they made lots of profits

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.890
like a monopoly.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.413
That kept prices high, they kept
production inefficiently low,

00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:31.580
and they made lots of money.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.783
However, that's a great
outcome for producers,

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.200
but as we'll talk
about next time,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.430
it's actually a hard
outcome to enforce.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.120
Turns out to be hard to
keep cartels together.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.490
And so typically,
oligopoly markets

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.130
behave in a non-cooperative
way, with the participants

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.750
competing with each other, not
cooperating with each other.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.060
In this case, you can actually
get them driving their profits

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.970
down far below the
monopoly level,

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.610
and indeed, perhaps even all the
way to the competitive level.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.860
So you can think about markets
as a competitive as one

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.260
extreme and the monopoly
as the other extreme,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.090
oligopoly in between.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.250
A cooperative oligopoly
market, like cartel,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.940
will end up close to
the monopoly outcome.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.998
A non-cooperative market will
end up somewhere in between,

00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:21.040
and we're going to model
today's where in between

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.010
do they end up.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.820
Now, to think about
this, we're going

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.090
to have to turn to a
tool, which has really

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.460
become a dominant tool in
economics over the last 40

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.370
years, which is the
tool of game theory.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.390
Game theory.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.060
So basically, we're going
to think of oligopoly firms

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.700
as engaging in a game.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:57.210
And as with any game, you
need to know two things.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.090
One is you need to
what's the strategy,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.610
and the second is you need to
know when is the game over.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.326
What's the equilibrium?

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.590
And that's, essentially,
what you do with any game.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.870
And so basically, the
key with game theory

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.290
is that we are going to
find the equilibrium,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.330
and that's going to
yield for us the strategy

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.950
that players are going to use.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.295
However, equilibrium in a
game is not well-defined.

00:05:33.295 --> 00:05:34.670
It's not like a
set of rules that

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.380
are printed out, like monopoly.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.550
In a non-cooperative oligopoly
market, the equilibrium,

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.050
you have to actually come up
with different concepts of what

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.770
equilibrium is.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.470
There's not a hard and
fast scientific rule.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.450
And the typical
one that's used is

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:57.140
called the Nash equilibrium,
the Nash equilibrium,

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.188
named for John Nash, the famous
mathematician, who economists

00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:04.355
have claimed as their own,
even though he was really

00:06:04.355 --> 00:06:05.230
a mathematician.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.760
But we gave him the
Nobel Prize anyway.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.590
And if you think of
economists, probably

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.757
one of the most famous, you
all know about the movie

00:06:11.757 --> 00:06:14.510
and book Beautiful Mind.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.720
He is based on the
father of game theory.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.290
So basically, what is
the Nash equilibrium?

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:30.220
The Nash equilibrium is defined
as the point at which no player

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.520
wants to change their
strategy, given what

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.580
the other players are doing.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.710
So the point at which no player
wants to change its strategy,

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.490
given what the other
players are doing.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.480
So in other words, every player
is happy with where they are.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.490
Given what every other
player's decided,

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.410
I'm happy to do
what I've decided.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.350
So I've got a strategy,
and given the strategy

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.250
other players are using, if I'm
happy with my strategy, then

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.640
that's in equilibrium.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.120
So this is a super
abstract concept,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.340
so let's illustrate
it with an example.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.040
And the classic
example of game theory

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.350
is the prisoner's dilemma,
which many of you, I'm sure,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.362
know about, maybe
the most of you,

00:07:18.362 --> 00:07:19.570
but let's just go through it.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.210
This is the thing from the
old cop movies you see,

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.730
where they arrest two guys and
they put them in separate rooms

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.920
and they basically
interrogate them separately.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.042
They're put in separate rooms,
and let's say that these guys

00:07:36.042 --> 00:07:37.000
get told the following.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.670
They each get told separately
the following thing.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.410
They get told that right
now, if nothing else happens,

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.260
there's enough evidence to send
them each away for one year.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:55.000
However, they're told, if
they turned on their friend

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and say their friend's
guilty, then they go free

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.620
and their friend
gets five years.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.010
If their friend turns on them,
then the friend goes free

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.820
and they get five years.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.500
But if they both turn on each
other, they both get two years.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.590
Set up as if they both stay
silent, they both get one year.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.380
If one turns, then that
person gets to leave

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.070
and the person gets five years.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.250
But if they both turn, then
they each get two years.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.040
So how do we think
about decision-making

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.010
in that context?

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.720
The way we do that is we write
down, we call, a payoff matrix.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.690
We write down in matrix
form this decision.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.940
So let's think about what a
playoff matrix looks like.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.809
Up here is prisoner
B, and here you

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:48.020
have prisoner A. Prisoner A.
And prisoner A can remain silent

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:54.210
or they can talk, and
prisoner B can remain silent

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.080
or they can talk.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.390
And then we just
write down, what

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.760
are the outcomes,
or the payoffs,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.932
from these different strategies?

00:09:03.932 --> 00:09:07.190
So prisoner A says nothing
and prisoner B says nothing,

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.900
then A gets one year
and B gets one year.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.290
If prisoner A says nothing
and prisoner B says, oh yeah,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.360
prisoner A is
definitely guilty, then

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.620
prisoner A gets five years
and prisoner gets zero years.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.230
If the opposite happens,
if prison A says,

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.170
yeah, B's guilty, and B
doesn't say anything about A,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.980
then A gets zero years
and B gets five years.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.212
But if they both say
the other one's guilty,

00:09:36.212 --> 00:09:37.420
then they each get two years.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.095
OK, that's the payoff matrix.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.320
And now we want to ask,
given this payoff matrix,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.820
what is the right strategy
for each prisoner to pursue?

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.730
And the way we do this in the
Nash equilibrium concept is we

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.940
look for a dominant strategy.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.520
Is there a strategy that
I would pursue regardless

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.913
of what the other person does?

00:10:06.913 --> 00:10:08.330
And if there is,
I'll pursue that.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.247
Because remember, the
Nash equilibrium concept

00:10:10.247 --> 00:10:13.010
is, what do I want to do, given
what the other person is doing?

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.802
If I have a strategy
I want to do no matter

00:10:14.802 --> 00:10:17.050
what the other person is
doing, then I'll do it.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.790
So when asked, is there
a dominant strategy?

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.960
Is there a strategy that is
the best thing to do, no matter

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.210
what the other guy does?

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.765
Well, clearly, if
they're cooperating,

00:10:29.765 --> 00:10:32.390
if these were stupid police and
they sat them in the same room,

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.170
told them and then left, the
two guys could cooperate.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.810
Well, clearly, the dominant
cooperative strategy

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.485
is for both of us
to remain silent.

00:10:40.485 --> 00:10:42.110
That's the dominant
cooperate strategy.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.420
And as a team, we only
get two total years

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.360
in jail, where everything
gets many more years in jail.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.000
So if they're buddies
and they trust each other

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.022
and they cooperate, then that's
clearly the right strategy.

00:10:53.022 --> 00:10:54.980
But let's say the police
are smart and put them

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.850
in separate rooms.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.290
Well, what's the dominant
non-cooperative strategy?

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.690
What is the strategy that A
or B, say A, should produce?

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.000
Yeah?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.020
Why?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.490
AUDIENCE: Either way, you're
going to get less years.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.615
Like if you're the only
person silent and you talk,

00:11:11.615 --> 00:11:14.170
you get zero, and if
they talk and you talk,

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.468
you only get two versus five.

00:11:15.468 --> 00:11:16.510
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.240
For prisoner A in
this first row--

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.050
compare the first column.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.240
We'll say prisoner B is silent.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.250
Then clearly, you're
better off talking than not

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.420
talking, zero rather than one.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.240
Let's say prisoner B talks.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.880
Then you're still better off
talking than not talking.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.750
So no matter what B
does, you should talk.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.190
Likewise, prisoner B, no matter
what A does, B should talk.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.870
So the non-cooperative
equilibrium

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.450
is actually this outcome.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.280
They both end up talking.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.400
You get sort of a
race to the bottom.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.222
The non-cooperative
outcome is much worse

00:11:52.222 --> 00:11:53.680
than if they could
have cooperated.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.360
So basically, what
you get is that

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.120
the non-cooperative
equilibrium is always

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.810
worse for the players than
the cooperative equilibrium.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:11.940
And this was like an
unbelievable insight of Nash.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.880
Before Nash, we always
thought competition

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.640
was always and everywhere good.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.990
We always thought more
competition is better,

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.300
for the reasons we talked
in the first 10 or 12

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.190
lectures of this class.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.112
Nash was the first one
to say, no, actually,

00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:26.070
competition can be bad.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.153
Cooperation can be better.

00:12:27.153 --> 00:12:29.670
I don't know if you remember
the scene in a Beautiful Mind

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.650
where they're picking
up girls in the bar.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.670
And he described
basically a Nash strategy,

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.070
how competition will lead
to the worst outcome.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.180
And basically, that's
what you see here,

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.465
that competition can
actually lead to a worse

00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:45.340
outcome than cooperation,
and that was really

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.900
Nash's brilliant insight.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:57.660
Now, this is a cute example
with prisoners, but actually--

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.000
well first, two points.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.260
First of all, this
generally shows you

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.070
how you do gain favor
with Nash equilibrium.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.040
Basically, you look
at the payoff matrix,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.860
you find the dominant
strategy, and then

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.710
you find where those dominant
strategies intersect.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.210
And here, the
dominant strategies

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.040
intersect at this
cell, therefore

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.990
that's the equilibrium.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.860
So that's basically how you do
game theory in a game theory

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.850
kindergarten level.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:26.930
You look at the matrix.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.090
You find each player's
dominant strategy.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.700
And you find the point at
which those dominant strategies

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.160
intersect, and at that point,
that's the equilibrium.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.710
Now, that's all well and good
for a simple example like this,

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.410
but let's actually apply
to an economics example.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.690
Let's think about advertising.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.160
So think about Coke and Pepsi.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.230
Right now, let's think about
their decision to advertise.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.910
Now, obviously it's
a simple problem.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.130
Obviously Pepsi
should just be illegal

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.370
because Coke is way better.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.330
But sadly, it's not, and
sometimes I have to drink Pepsi

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.770
and I'm very sad.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.010
But nonetheless, in the real
world, we have Coke and Pepsi

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.230
and they have to decide
how much to advertise.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:14.130
Now, the dominant
cooperative strategy

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.770
would be to say,
look, advertising

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.820
costs us a ton of money.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.430
Let's just split the market.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.722
Let's have a monopoly
market and just split it.

00:14:22.722 --> 00:14:24.180
We're close to
splitting it anyway.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.130
Coke's got some more of it.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:25.830
We're close to splitting it.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:26.460
Let's just split it.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.115
Yeah?

00:14:27.115 --> 00:14:28.815
AUDIENCE: Can you
actually do that?

00:14:28.815 --> 00:14:30.070
JONATHAN GRUBER: What?

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:30.280
AUDIENCE: Can you
actually do that?

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.070
Because I remember,
there were places

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.590
that you get where
you aren't allowed

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.630
to sell in the same place.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.255
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK, but that's
different than the cooperative.

00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:38.810
That's imposed not by
Coke and Pepsi jointly.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.180
That's imposed by Pepsi
saying to a university campus,

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.050
for example, we will
cut you a better deal

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.882
if you'll agree
not to sell Coke.

00:14:46.882 --> 00:14:47.840
That's not cooperation.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.760
That's competition.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.300
So there's cooperative strategy.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.660
What if they don't cooperate?

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.460
Well, let's imagine we have
the following payoff matrix.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.630
You've got Pepsi up here,
and they can advertise or not

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.860
advertise.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:10.490
And you've got Coke here,
and they can advertise or not

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.260
advertise.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.485
And let's say the payoff
matrix is the following.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.480
Let's say the total amount
of profit to be made

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.640
is 16 whatever,
billion, whatever

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.670
units you want to
make it, $16 billion.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.100
And let's say if there's
no advertising, Coke gets 8

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.717
and Pepsi gets 8.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:43.370
But let's say
advertising costs money.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.700
It costs 5, $5 billion.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.340
So let's say if
they both advertise,

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.620
then they still end up
splitting the market,

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.550
but they only make 3.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.370
C equals 3, P equals 3.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.540
I'm sorry, advertise.
yes, you're right.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.230
C equals 3, P equals 3.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.425
And here C equals 8, P equals 8.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.880
So basically, you
have a situation

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.200
where they both end of
splitting the market either way,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.590
but they just split a smaller
net profit if they advertise.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.290
So clearly, they'd
rather be here than here.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.330
But what happens in the
off diagonal elements?

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.220
Well, let's say also that if
Coke advertises but Pepsi does

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.050
not, then let's say Coke
ends up making $13 billion

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.120
and Pepsi ends up making minus--

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.640
I'm sorry, if Coke advertises
and Pepsi does not,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.510
they split money.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.700
And Pepsi makes negative 2.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.950
They actually lose money
because they have fixed costs

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:53.700
and they don't sell anything.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.500
Nobody buys Pepsi.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.065
It'll lose money.

00:16:56.065 --> 00:16:57.440
And let's say if
Pepsi advertises

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.770
and Coke doesn't, then
Coke makes negative 2

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.000
and Pepsi makes 13.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.710
So actually, if you
don't advertise,

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.800
you're really screwed, and the
other guy is really screwed.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:07.980
Yeah?

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.930
AUDIENCE: Does this include
the cost of advertising?

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.347
JONATHAN GRUBER:
This does include

00:17:11.347 --> 00:17:12.890
the cost of advertising.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:18.220
But it's just Coke gets a huge
market, expands its market.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.220
So now let's play the game.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.170
Well, now let's say you're Coke.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:30.973
You say, well, if I advertise
and Pepsi advertises, I make 3.

00:17:30.973 --> 00:17:32.890
But if I don't advertise
and Pepsi advertises,

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:33.640
I make negative 2.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.730
So I should advertise.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.700
If I advertise and Pepsi
doesn't advertise, I make 13.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.180
If I don't advertise and Pepsi
doesn't advertise, I make 8.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.630
So either way, my dominant
strategy is to advertise.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.730
And likewise, Pepsi
does the same thing.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.110
I screwed up writing this
compared to my notes,

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.380
but it's good because
it shows you--

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.380
I flipped the matrix, but
the logic is the same.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.660
It helps you not just
memorize cells of the matrix

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.980
but learn the logic.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.700
The point is either way,
the dominant strategy

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.750
is to advertise, so
they both advertise.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.430
So real world example
of how you can end up.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.470
Now, so much of Pepsi
and Coke do this.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.060
Actually, there was an
industry that did this.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.870
So when I was a kid, you never,
ever saw ads for liquor on TV.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.200
There were beer ads and wine
ads, but no hard alcohol ad.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.440
No bourbon, no whiskey,
no nothing, gin.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.870
All these Captain
Morgan's ads we see now,

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.020
they didn't exist
when I was a kid.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.520
But it wasn't because the law.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.880
It was because the hard liquor
industry cooperatively agreed

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.300
none of them would advertise.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.690
So they actually imposed
the cooperative equilibrium,

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.747
and then that broke down.

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:37.580
I don't know the story
of how it broke down.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.180
But it broke down.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.013
Now they all advertise,
and they're probably

00:18:40.013 --> 00:18:43.360
all worse off than they were
when they didn't advertise.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.610
We'll talk next time about
why it probably broke down.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:46.780
I don't know the stories.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.347
I have a rough sense, and we'll
talk about that next time.

00:18:49.347 --> 00:18:51.930
But this is the point of how a
non-cooperative equilibrium can

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.840
drive you to a bad outcome.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.260
Now, basically,
this doesn't just

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.730
apply to prisoners
or businesses.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.688
It applies to people, too.

00:19:01.688 --> 00:19:03.480
So let's say poor Hector
back there has had

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.190
a fight with his girlfriend.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.622
And they've had a big fight.

00:19:07.622 --> 00:19:08.830
They've going a little while.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.360
They've had a big fight.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.090
And Hector has got to decide,
do I apologize or do I wait

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.010
for her to apologize?

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.770
Well, the last
thing Hector wants

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.470
is to go up there and apologize
and have her say, forget it.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:22.940
I'm breaking up with you.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.000
That'd be the worst.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.400
If he knows she's going to
be like, oh, I'm sorry, too,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.850
then he'd be happy to do it.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.940
But what if he goes, no
I'm breaking up with you,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.720
and she's thinking
the same thing.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.580
So what happens, they break up.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.900
We've been through this
many times in our lives.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.060
This is the
non-cooperative strategy.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.560
Basically, if you know what the
other person is going to do,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.970
your dominant strategies to be
an asshole, and basically that

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.720
happens a lot in the
context of the real world.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.280
So now we have this
sad-sounding outcome,

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.700
that basically game theory leads
to bad outcomes for producers,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.060
at least.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.470
But this is what's
exciting about game theory.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.380
So when I went to
grad school, back

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.530
when dinosaurs roamed
the earth, game theory

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.980
was taught barely
in the sequence.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.270
It was like an extra
course, taught a little bit.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.400
Now it dominates the teaching
of microeconomics, in economics.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.380
And it doesn't dominate, but
it's a whole like component

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.750
of our core
microeconomics education,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.510
because it's given such
a cool set of tools

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.040
to think about these decisions.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.090
Now, I can't give you even 1%
of the flavor of game theory.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.910
If you want to learn more, I
highly suggest you take 1412,

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.190
which our game theory class,
and you can learn a ton.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.982
But let me show you
one interesting wrinkle

00:20:39.982 --> 00:20:43.590
of the things game theory
can do, to go beyond this.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.690
And that's to imagine that Coke
and Pepsi are not playing a one

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.980
shot game, but a repeated game.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.110
Repeated game.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:07.250
So now imagine that Coke
says to Pepsi the following,

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:13.440
I promise to not advertise as
long as you don't advertise.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.245
But if you ever advertise,
I will advertise forever.

00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:19.620
Coke says to Pepsi,
I promise not

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.390
to advertise as long
as you don't advertise,

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.930
but if I ever catch
you advertising,

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.770
I'm going to advertise forever.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:29.610
So think about Pepsi
choice in period 1.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.050
Pepsi's choice in period 1.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.972
In period 1, they could
say, ha, stupid Coke.

00:21:33.972 --> 00:21:35.430
I'm going to jump
on and advertise.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.380
They promised not to advertise.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:45.440
So if Pepsi advertises, they're
going to make 13 in period 1

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.200
because Coke's taken
themselves off to the side.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:54.857
But after period 1, they're
going to make 8 forever.

00:21:54.857 --> 00:21:55.440
No, I'm sorry.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.720
They're going to make 3 forever.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.860
Because Coke's
going to advertise.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.985
They're going to advertise.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:03.177
They break down to the
non-cooperative equilibrium,

00:22:03.177 --> 00:22:04.010
if Pepsi advertises.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.710
Now, what if Pepsi
doesn't advertise?

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.590
As long as it doesn't advertise,
then it gets to deal with Coke,

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.850
so it makes 8 forever.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.495
We'll talk later in the course
about how you combine numbers

00:22:17.495 --> 00:22:19.370
that happen at different
times, but trust me,

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:23.390
8 forever is a way better
deal than 13, than 3 forever.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.810
So actually, by having
this be a repeated game,

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.730
Coke has solved the
prisoner's dilemma.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.790
It's essentially imposed
a cooperative equilibrium

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.490
on the problem.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.950
So that's how repeated
game can fix this.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.890
But-- this is where the game
gets really exciting-- that

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.570
only works if this
game never ends,

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.610
because once Coke
or Pepsi thinks

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:53.510
there's an end to the game,
the entire thing breaks down.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.630
So imagine, for example, that
Coke makes the offer to Pepsi,

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.310
but Pepsi is worried
that in 10 years,

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.007
the government is
going to outlaw soda.

00:23:01.007 --> 00:23:03.340
The government said, look,
we're heading that direction.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.635
Soda is going to be
illegal in 10 years,

00:23:05.635 --> 00:23:06.760
so I don't want to do this.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.500
I'm sorry, I have
that in my mind.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.230
So Coke offers the deal
now, what do I think?

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:19.000
Well, let's think about Pepsi's
decision in the ninth year.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.900
They've made 8, 8, 8, 8,
8, and they get to year 9.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:28.110
Now in year 9, they know that
next year there's no more game.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.370
So what should they do?

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:30.970
Advertise.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.750
Grab the 13 in the last period,
because Coke can't punish them

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.360
because the game's over.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.670
But Coke knows this.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.950
So what's Coke going to
do in the ninth year?

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.860
Advertise.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:48.000
It's going to advertise, so
they're both going to make 3.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.465
Well, if Pepsi
knows Coke's going

00:23:49.465 --> 00:23:51.550
to advertise in the ninth
year no matter what,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.640
what should Pepsi
in the eighth year?

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.475
Advertise.

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:56.350
And if Coke knows Pepsi
is going to advertise

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.017
in the eighth year,
what should Coke do?

00:23:58.017 --> 00:24:00.750
And so on, and it ends up that
they both advertise all the way

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.480
through.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.430
So the game breaks
down if it's an end.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.535
This is really kind
of neat, and this

00:24:06.535 --> 00:24:07.910
is what game theory
is all about,

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.350
is how do you think
through these more

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.210
complicated scenarios that
are much more complicated

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.680
than the prisoner's
dilemma, and actually

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.360
think about how firms and
individuals might actually

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:14.860
behave?

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.904
Yeah?

00:24:15.904 --> 00:24:18.196
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it also
be advantageous if they just

00:24:18.196 --> 00:24:20.780
advertised the first year
instead of these contracts,

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.010
kind of what we were
talking about earlier?

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:24.100
JONATHAN GRUBER: Sure.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.380
And once again, that's
what you cover in a field

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.380
course like game theory.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.382
What about alternative
forms of contracting,

00:24:29.382 --> 00:24:30.840
with exclusionary
contracting, what

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.952
we call tying in contracting?

00:24:32.952 --> 00:24:34.160
That's great, and they would.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.890
But that's why you
got to take 1412, OK?

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:37.390
Yeah?

00:24:39.927 --> 00:24:41.510
AUDIENCE: Would it
be a better outcome

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:45.845
if they cooperated and switched
periods of advertising?

00:24:45.845 --> 00:24:49.022
Like for the first period,
they get 13, they get minus 2.

00:24:49.022 --> 00:24:50.480
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Yeah, the way I've

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.188
set this problem up,
if they could commit

00:24:52.188 --> 00:24:54.050
to that, that would be right.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.670
But you'd have to commit to it.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.090
Because then the period that
Pepsi promised to take off,

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.700
if they actually advertised that
period, then Coke's screwed.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.730
So that would work as a
repeated game solution,

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.230
but it wouldn't work as
a non-repeating game.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.760
It would work as an infinite
repeated game but not

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.290
a non-infinite repeated game.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.255
Good question.

00:25:14.255 --> 00:25:16.310
OK, other questions?

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.367
All right, so that's the
basis of game theory.

00:25:18.367 --> 00:25:19.950
That's just a taste
for the excitement

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.500
that you can learn
with game theory.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.105
But in fact, in
economics, we like

00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:24.980
to write those as fun
examples, but we really

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.457
prefer to do math.

00:25:26.457 --> 00:25:28.040
So let's actually
think about the math

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.510
of how we take game
theory concepts

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.040
and put them in practice.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.880
And the way we do that
is through the concept

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.960
of the Cournot model.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.550
The Cournot model of
non-cooperative oligopolies.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.957
So the Cournot model of
non-cooperative oligopoly

00:25:48.957 --> 00:25:50.290
is the standard workhorse model.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.720
It takes this
intuition and puts it

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.340
into the optimizing
math we've been

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.630
doing so far in this class.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.030
Now let's imagine
non-cooperative case,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.907
but now let's imagine
not just two choices,

00:26:02.907 --> 00:26:04.990
but realistically, there's
a whole set of choices.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:13.010
Then how would you
behave in that case?

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.240
So let's imagine that
there's two airlines, United

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.930
and American.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.370
So we have an oligopolistic
two-firm airline industry.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.380
Obviously, the math can
extend to more firms,

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.180
but just to start, and I'll
talk about that next lecture.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.780
But for now, imagine a two-firm
industry, United and American.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.280
And because the hub
and spoke system

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.200
we discussed last
time, let's imagine

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.380
that they're the only two folks
that go from Boston to Chicago.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.910
Because it's hub
and spoke system.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.260
The only folks that go
from Boston to Chicago

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.640
are United and American,
and they do, in fact,

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.930
dominate that line.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.200
So let's imagine
they're the only folks,

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.880
and say no other firms
can compete on this route

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.250
because they can't get
slots at the airport.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.310
So the question is,
how do these firms

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.450
decide how many flights to run?

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.420
It's not just advertise, don't.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.400
It's literally a
continuous decision

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.480
of how many flights to run every
day and how much to charge.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.650
They've got to
make that decision.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:11.970
And the Nash equilibrium
here, the subset of Nash,

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.790
for this example, is called
the Cournot equilibrium.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.010
And the Cournot
equilibrium exists

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:22.380
when a firm chooses
a quantity such

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.770
that, given the quantity
chosen by the other firm,

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.000
they don't want to change.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.410
So a firm chooses, essentially,
a profit-maximizing quantity,

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.640
given the quantity
chosen by the other firm.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:41.640
And that profit-maximizing
quantity, then you're

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.530
in Cournot equilibrium,
if you have

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:48.000
chosen a quantity that is
profit-maximizing, given

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
what the other firm is doing.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.120
So basically, how do we
actually carry this out?

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.480
Let's talk about the steps.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.415
So the first step, I'm
going to talk intuitively

00:28:01.415 --> 00:28:03.040
about the math, what
we're going to do,

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.900
and then I'm going to
talk mathematically

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.710
and graph what we actually do.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.580
There's essentially three steps
in solving for the Cournot

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.200
equilibrium.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.270
The first is ask how your
demand changes when some of it's

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.540
absorbed by other firms.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.320
So the first is solve for
your residual demand function.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.940
What does your demand
curve look like,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.630
given what the other firm does?

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.010
That's step 1.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.450
Step 2 is then you develop
a marginal revenue, which

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:37.930
is a function of the
other firm's quantity.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:38.750
Little q.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.103
It's multiple firms.

00:28:41.103 --> 00:28:43.270
The other firm's-- that's
really bad, hard to read--

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.312
the other firm's quality.

00:28:44.312 --> 00:28:46.030
So your marginal
revenue is a function.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:47.290
Typically, it's a function--

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.540
I'm sorry-- of both your
quantity and the other firm's

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.740
quantity.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.485
A function of both your quantity
and the other firm's quantity.

00:28:53.485 --> 00:28:56.110
We develop marginal revenue as
a function of your own quantity.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.190
We know how to do that.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.440
Now we develop a margin as
a function of your quantity

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.010
and the other firm's quantity.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.800
Then you simply set
this marginal revenue

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.980
equal to marginal
cost, and that delivers

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.200
you a conditional answer.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.670
That delivers you your
optimal quantity as a function

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.170
of the other firm's quantity.

00:29:19.805 --> 00:29:21.680
Well, that doesn't do
us a whole lot of good,

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.680
except there's two firms.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:32.170
So the fourth step is we do the
same thing for the other firm

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.330
and get the same
kind of equation.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.620
Then what do we have?

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.840
Two equations and two
unknowns, so we solve.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.440
So what we do here
is essentially

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.230
the same thing we did before,
but now your marginal revenue

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.650
is not just a function
of your own quantity,

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.200
it's a function of the
other guy's quantity.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.430
Same with the other guy.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.222
That gives you two
equations, two unknowns.

00:29:54.222 --> 00:29:54.740
We solve.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.560
And the point at which
both firms are happy

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.562
is the Cournot equilibrium.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.807
That's confusing, so let's
actually look at that.

00:30:05.807 --> 00:30:07.890
We'll do this both graphically
and mathematically.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.390
Let's start with figure 13.1.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:15.260
To make things easy, let's
start by imagining that American

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.390
Airlines is a monopoly.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:22.870
Let's start with the world with
an American Airlines monopoly.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:30.250
And let's say that the demand
function is P equals 339

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:35.555
minus Q. That's the demand for
flights from Boston to Chicago.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.842
And let's say that the marginal
cost, to make life easier--

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:46.300
it could have a cost function
and make your life difficult,

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.890
and maybe someday I'll do that.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.390
But for now, to
make your life easy,

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:54.418
let's just say it's a flat
marginal cost of $147.

00:30:54.418 --> 00:30:56.460
I'm not going to make life
difficult with solving

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.840
for marginal cost functions.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.180
For now, it's just a flat
marginal cost of $147.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.290
No matter how many flights they
do, it's $147 per passenger.

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:09.640
So if you're a monopolist,
how do you solve this problem?

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.805
Well, first you derive your
marginal revenue function.

00:31:12.805 --> 00:31:14.430
Well, what's marginal
revenue function?

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:21.840
Well, revenues is P times Q,
which is 339 minus q squared.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.607
So your marginal revenue
function is 339 minus 2Q.

00:31:27.607 --> 00:31:29.190
That's your marginal
revenue function,

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:30.840
if you're the monopolist.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.380
What's your marginal cost?

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.930
Well, I just said it's $147.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.550
And then you just solve.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:43.650
And when you solve that, you get
that Q, the optimal quantity,

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:47.620
is 96 flights.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.685
And then how do
you get the price?

00:31:50.685 --> 00:31:52.560
How do you get the price
of monopoly problem?

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.900
How do we know
what the price is?

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.615
Yeah?

00:31:55.615 --> 00:31:57.990
AUDIENCE: Where the quantity
intersects the demand curve.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.120
JONATHAN GRUBER: You've
got to plug it back

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.238
into the demand curve.

00:32:00.238 --> 00:32:02.530
Take that quantity, plug it
back into the demand curve.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:10.860
So the price is 339
minus 96, or 243.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.000
So I just solved the
monopoly problem quickly,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
but that's what we've done
already in this class.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.110
And you could see that
in the graph here.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.840
In figure 13.1, you've
got demand curve,

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.160
which is P equals
339 minus Q. You've

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.050
got a supply curve, which is
the flat marginal cost of $147.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:33.030
You develop a marginal
revenue function,

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:36.733
which is 339 minus 2Q.

00:32:36.733 --> 00:32:38.150
As in our previous
example, that's

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.210
just basically an inward
shift of the demand function.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:46.090
That intersects marginal
costs at 96 flights.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.250
We have 1,000
passengers per quarter.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.980
It doesn't really matter.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.850
It's just all standardization.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.350
And then to get the price, you
read it off the demand curve.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:33:00.120
You say 96 flights means the
price of $243 per flight.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:06.130
OK, that's what we do if
American was a monopolist.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.580
Now, however, American
is not a monopolist.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.400
American deals with United,
and American doesn't know

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.890
what United is going to do.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.750
So what does American do?

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:21.630
Well, let's say American
has to deal with the fact--

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.850
it now has to recognize
that it's got its own demand

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:28.900
function, qa, which
is the total quantity

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.770
in the market minus qu.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.200
So it has a residual
demand function,

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:41.380
which is the total demand in the
market minus what United sells.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.920
So suppose, for example,
American thinks--

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.400
American's got a
spy inside United--

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.500
and American says,
ha, I think United

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.382
is going to fly 64 flights.

00:33:53.382 --> 00:33:54.840
So imagine American
thinks United's

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.550
going to fly 64 flights.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:05.250
Well, in that case, if they're
going to fly 64 flights,

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:12.159
then my demand function is
p sub a equals 339 minus q

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:19.320
sub a minus 64, because
the big quantity

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.670
is little qa plus little qu.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:30.520
So my demand function is
339 minus q sub a minus 64.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.239
Or in other words, my
residual demand function

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:46.090
is that p sub a equals
339 equals 275 minus qa.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.480
So if I think United's
going to fly 64 flights,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.670
then my effective demand
function is 275 minus q.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.260
And then I'm done.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.990
Then I just solve for, what
would I do as a monopolist,

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.600
given the other guy's
flying 64 flights?

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.560
So you can see that
in figure 13.2.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.260
So I have a demand function.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.050
I say, well, if United's going
to fly 64 flights, that demand

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.882
function gets shifted in by 64.

00:35:14.882 --> 00:35:17.090
And then I'm going to do
the same thing I did before.

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.396
I solve for marginal revenue.

00:35:19.396 --> 00:35:21.490
I'm going to solve
for marginal revenue

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.210
and I intersect that
with marginal cost.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:28.480
That's going to happen at 64
flights and a price of $211.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.738
So basically, it's
the same exercise.

00:35:30.738 --> 00:35:31.530
It's not that hard.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.380
You just first take out
what United is going to do.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.330
The problem is American
doesn't have a spy.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.060
They don't really know
what United's going to do.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.370
They have to essentially
develop a strategy,

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:46.060
given the possibilities
of what United might do.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.420
They have to say, look, I
don't know what q sub u is,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:54.940
so I have to devise my optimal
strategy given q sub u.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.790
In other words, I have
to simultaneously solve

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:01.540
for what I would do at every
possible quantity United

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.890
would sell.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.810
I have to solve what I would
do for every possible quantity

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:07.560
United would sell.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:12.180
And we call this
developing your reaction,

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.770
or best response curve.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.840
Your reaction curve or
your best response curve,

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.500
which is, what is the
best thing to do, given

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.372
what the other guy's doing?

00:36:25.372 --> 00:36:26.830
What is the best
thing to do, given

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.770
what the other guys doing?

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:34.030
You could see that in figure
13.3, we show how that works.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.320
That shows best response curves.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.740
So for example, look at the
intersection on the y-axis,

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.160
where the red line
hits the y-axis.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.020
That was our
monopoly equilibrium.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.710
I'm sorry, where the blue
line hits the x-axis, my bad.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:54.760
We're doing American.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.670
Look at where the blue
line hits the x-axis.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.970
That is assuming
zero United flights.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:02.650
Where the blue
line is the x-axis

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:04.210
is where there's
zero United flights.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:07.260
Well, we know what
American would do there.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.720
They would fly 96 flights.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.760
We already solved that.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:18.370
Now look at the point where
United is flying 64 flights.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:22.752
Well, we also know what
American would do then.

00:37:22.752 --> 00:37:24.710
We know that we solved,
in the previous figure,

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:27.130
they would then do 64 flights.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:31.540
And in general, what that blue
line is is for every quantity

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.642
that United flies, what
does American want to fly?

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:44.640
So meanwhile, United is
doing the same mathematics.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.250
Imagine, to make life easier--
we'll almost always do this

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.360
to make life easy--

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.830
imagine United has the same
marginal costs as American,

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:56.440
and obviously faces the
same market demand curve.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.670
Well then, literally, their
math is totally symmetric.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.860
If American wasn't
in the market,

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.920
you'd have where the red line
intersects the vertical axis.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.720
If American was
flying zero, United

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.390
would flight 96 flights,
because their problem

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.140
is identical to American's
monopoly problem.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:17.920
So the red line is United's
best response curve.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.470
So we've graphed, for
every possible amount

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:22.420
of flights that
United does, what's

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:24.803
American's optimal
amount of flights.

00:38:24.803 --> 00:38:26.470
We've solved for every
amount of flights

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.140
that American does with
United's also amount of flights.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:34.320
Where those lines intersect
is the Cournot equilibrium.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.820
Why is that the
Cournot equilibrium?

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.520
Because at that
point, both firms

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.800
are doing the best
they can, given

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.790
what the other firm's chosen.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.760
Or in other words,
to say this is

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.770
given what the
other firm's doing,

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:49.080
neither firm wants to deviate.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.077
The profit-maximizing choice
is to be where they are, given

00:38:53.077 --> 00:38:54.160
the other firm's behavior.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.760
So basically, the
Cournot equilibrium

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.943
is the only equilibrium that's
possible in this market.

00:39:03.943 --> 00:39:04.610
And why is that?

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.170
So for example, imagine that
American came in and said,

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.407
look, I like doing 96 flights.

00:39:10.407 --> 00:39:11.490
I love being a monopolist.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.800
I'm just going to do 96 flights.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.210
I'm going to do 96 flights,
I'm going to charge $243.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.280
Well, in that case, American--

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:26.800
United, I'm sorry-- would
happily come in at $242

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.440
and undercut them and
sell lots of flights,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.330
because that's still
well above marginal cost.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:37.190
So that's not an equilibrium
because United and American are

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.690
choosing different outcomes.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:41.390
It's only equilibrium if
they're both to the point

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:45.010
where the same outcome
makes them both happy.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.290
So that's the graphics.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.577
Let's do the math here.

00:39:48.577 --> 00:39:49.660
Let's do the Cournot math.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:58.470
In general, the residual
demand for American

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:07.020
is that p equals 339
minus qa minus qu.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.760
Remember, big Q is qa plus qu.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:16.590
Since the demand function
is 339 minus big Q,

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.296
I simply broke big
Q into qa and qu.

00:40:19.296 --> 00:40:22.080
Stop me if this is all unclear.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.620
Simply broke the big Q
into those two components.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.615
So that means that
American's revenue function--

00:40:28.615 --> 00:40:32.100
it's called revenue A,
revenue for American--

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:40.920
is 339 times qa minus
qa squared minus qaqu.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.965
This is a new term.

00:40:42.965 --> 00:40:44.340
This was the old
revenue function

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.757
we had when they
were monopolists.

00:40:45.757 --> 00:40:49.730
Now we've got this new term
that didn't exist before.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:53.600
So that means the marginal
revenue for American

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.980
is now 339 minus 2qa minus qu.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.720
So now their marginal
revenue is actually

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.670
a function now of
their own behavior,

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:08.220
but their competitor's behavior.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.090
That's the new margin
revenue function.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.770
But the profit maximization
rule is the same.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.840
We just set that equal
to marginal cost.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.430
We set it equal to
147, and you solve.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:24.180
And what you end up getting
is that q sub a star--

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:36.160
the outcome of q sub a is
96 minus 1/2qu star, or qu.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.950
qa star is 96 minus 1/2qu.

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.350
If you solve this equation,
that's what you get.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:45.390
That's 1/2, 1/2 qu.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.850
So now we have the
optimal quantity,

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.960
but it's a function of
what the other guy does.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.400
That's a problem, except that
we use the same math for United.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.347
Now, if the problem's
symmetric, you

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:57.680
don't have to do the math again.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.930
You know the best response
function will be symmetric,

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.620
but that won't
always be the case.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.380
So I'm going to
shortcut here of saying

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.250
the best response
function for qu

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:11.920
is q star u equals
96 minus 1/2qa.

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:16.940
So I've just written down
the best response function.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.610
This corresponds to the graph.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:23.360
So q star a, that's
the blue line.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.910
It's 96 minus 1/2u.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:32.420
q star u, that's the red
line, 96 minus 1/2qa.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.920
That's their best
response function.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.827
Now once again, to remind you, I
could simply skip to this step,

00:42:36.827 --> 00:42:39.160
but normally you'd have to
solve through for both firms.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.950
They might not have identical
best response functions,

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.690
or symmetrical best
response function.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.640
Well now we're golden.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.900
We have two equations
and two unknowns.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.210
We know how to deal with that.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.520
And you solve them
and you get the qa

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:57.820
star equals qu star equals 64.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.150
You solve those two
equations and two unknowns.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:06.300
So 64 is the solution
of that system.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.860
What's the price?

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.000
Someone raise their
hand and tell me.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.040
What's the price?

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.967
Without looking at the graph.

00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:15.467
Yeah?

00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:16.321
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:16.321 --> 00:43:18.071
JONATHAN GRUBER: And
how did you get that?

00:43:18.071 --> 00:43:20.705
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:20.705 --> 00:43:22.580
JONATHAN GRUBER: You
got to plug in 64 twice.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.872
A lot of people get this wrong.

00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:25.490
They'll say, oh, 339 minus 64.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:29.360
But no, it's 339 minus 128,
because they're each flying 64

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.400
and the price comes from the
total demand in the market.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.733
So the price is $211.

00:43:36.733 --> 00:43:38.275
That's an important
mistake to avoid.

00:43:38.275 --> 00:43:39.150
A lot of people get here.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.970
They'll be super excited.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:40.750
They're tired.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:42.790
They throw the 64 back
at the demand equation.

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.300
But remember, demand's a
function of the total market.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.410
If symmetrically
they're each doing 64,

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:49.950
then the price is
going to be $211.

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:53.200
And that is the Nash
or Cournot equilibrium.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:58.180
Both firms are happy to fly
64 flights at a price of $211.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.970
Neither firm wants to deviate.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.430
And you know that because
you've maximized their profits.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.720
When United is flying 64,
the profits of American

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.300
are maximized at flying 64.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.640
When American's flying
64, the profits for United

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.680
are maximized at flying 64.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.300
Therefore, that is the Nash
or Cournot equilibrium.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.860
Now, when we get to reality,
things might not always

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.360
work out so neatly.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.830
Things might not be symmetric.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.380
You might also not
have an equilibrium.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.410
How could you not have
an equilibrium here?

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:36.325
How could that
happen graphically?

00:44:36.325 --> 00:44:37.200
What would that mean?

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:40.408
Yeah?

00:44:40.408 --> 00:44:41.950
AUDIENCE: The curves
don't intersect.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:42.867
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:44:42.867 --> 00:44:45.225
The best response curves
might not intersect.

00:44:45.225 --> 00:44:46.600
You might not get
an equilibrium.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.225
We don't know what
the hell to do then.

00:44:48.225 --> 00:44:50.220
All chaos breaks loose.

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.520
But you might not get an
equilibrium in this market

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.150
because the best response
curves might not intersect.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.120
In reality, in life, you could
have funky best response curves

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.470
that are non-linear or you could
have multiple intersections.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.840
We call it multiple equilibria.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.910
And then it becomes an
indeterminate problem

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.680
and you have to figure out which
equilibrium they settle at,

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.013
and that involves higher order
mathematics that you talk

00:45:12.013 --> 00:45:13.770
about in more advanced classes.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:15.720
So this is the
simplest, easiest cases.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.960
Symmetric case where linear best
response functions intersect

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.460
is your easiest case.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.950
But in general, the
general way to solve this

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:26.670
is the same, which is use
the principle of game theory.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.640
Look, go back to the
prisoner's dilemma.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.580
All we're doing here was
creating best response

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.220
functions.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.470
It's just there wasn't a line.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.060
It was just a point.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.387
The best response function
was what we laid out here.

00:45:38.387 --> 00:45:40.470
All we did with these
United and American examples

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.420
was go to a continuum and
develop best response functions

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.060
around the best response point.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:46.560
Yeah?

00:45:49.758 --> 00:45:51.550
AUDIENCE: If the Nash
equilibrium is always

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:54.140
worse than when
they're cooperating,

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.560
why is it so hard to
maintain a [INAUDIBLE]??

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.750
JONATHAN GRUBER: We'll
talk about that next time.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.510
Other questions?

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:02.630
OK, let's stop there.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.950
We'll come back.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:05.440
Next time we'll talk about,
why don't we all just get along

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.650
with Mr. Rogers once?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.720
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to lecture

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.040
number two.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.400
In this lecture, I would like to
discuss some basic concepts

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.040
of finite element analysis with
regard to the analysis of

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.590
continuous systems.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.710
We discussed in the first
lecture already some basic

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.965
concepts of analysis of
discrete systems.

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:47.080
However, in actuality, in the
analysis of a complex system,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.600
we are dealing with a continuous
system, and there

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.660
are some additional basic
concepts that are used in

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.310
analysis of continuous
systems, using

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.870
finite element methods.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.150
And those additional concept
that are used, I want to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.069
discuss in this lecture.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:09.370
Well, when we talk about the
analysis of a continuous

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.010
system, we can analyze that
system via a differential

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.320
formulation or a variational
formulation.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.430
If we use a differential
formulation or variational

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.920
formulation, of course we obtain
continuous variables,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.380
and we have an infinite number
of state variables, or rather,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.180
if we talk about displacements,
a U

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.300
displacement, for example, of a
rod, as I will be discussing

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.220
just now, we will have infinite
values of that

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.520
displacement along the rod.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.100
In the differential formulation
or the variational

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.330
formulation, we would have to
solve for that continuous

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.970
variable along the rod.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.470
Well, we will also notice that
in the analysis of a complex

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.940
system, we cannot solve the
differential equations that we

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.539
are arriving at directly,
and we have to resort

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.020
to numerical methods.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.840
Now, some concepts that have
been used for a long time are

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.310
the weighted residual methods.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.980
These have been used by
Galerkin least squares

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.410
approaches to solve the
differential equations that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.100
govern the equilibrium motion
of the system approximately.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.420
In the variational formulation,
the Ritz method

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.580
has been used for quite
a long time.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.800
These are classical techniques,
therefore,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.280
weighted residual method
and the Ritz method.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.580
And what I want to show to you
in this lecture is how the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.780
finite element method is really
an extension off these

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.110
methods, or how this method, the
finite element method, is

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.050
related to these classical
techniques.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.180
Well, when we talk about the
differential formulation, we

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.060
are looking at the differential
equilibrium, or

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.020
the equilibrium of
a differential

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.020
element of the system.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.350
Now, I want to show to you the
basic ideas of a differential

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.240
formulation by looking at,
or analyzing, this rod.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.090
Here we have a rod that is fixed
at the left-hand side,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.120
on rollers.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.640
x is a variable along the rod.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.530
u is the displacement of that
rod into this direction.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.730
The rod is subjected, as shown
here, to a load , R0

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.400
at its right end.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.420
Notice that in this analysis, we
assume that plane sections

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.950
remain plane.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.300
In other words, a section that
was originally there at time t

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.150
greater than 0 has
moved to here.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.830
And this movement here is
the u displacement.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.070
But notice that the vertical
section here remains vertical

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.170
during the motion.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.280
So at every section, we have
only 1 degree of freedom.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.010
There's no rotation
of that section.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.810
However, this one degree
of freedom, u, varies

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.320
continuously along the rod.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.900
Therefore, the rod itself has
really an infinite number of

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.510
degrees of freedom.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.020
For this very simple
system, we could

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.160
obtain an exact solution.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.080
However, I want to show you how
we proceed in analyzing

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.580
this rod via differential
formulation, a variational

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.700
formulation, and so on,
simply as an example.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.630
Therefore, the basic ideas,
really, that I will be putting

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.090
forth to you, that I will be
discussing with you, are

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.710
really the important things that
I want to expose to you.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.260
It's not the analysis of this
very specific problem.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.270
It's really the basic idea that
I want to clarify to you

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.970
by looking at this
one problem.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.010
Well, for this problem here,
the governing differential

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.210
equation of motion
is shown here.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.500
Notice u once again is the
displacement of a section.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.410
That is, this displacement here
at that coordinate x.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.540
c is given here as square root E
over rho, where E is Young's

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.960
modulus of the material,
rho is the mass

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.910
density of the material.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.320
t, of course, is the
time variable.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.850
Notice the cross-sectional
area a here, I have also

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.150
written down here.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.320
This cross-sectional area
cancels out on both sides, as

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.880
you will see just now.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.550
Now this question here is
obtained in the differential

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.980
formulation by looking at the
equilibrium of an element.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.070
And we might consider this to be
the element that I will now

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.590
focus our attention on.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.540
Here we have that element
drawn again.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.450
This element here of length dx
is subjected at its left side,

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:17.420
because x comes from here as a
variable and brings us up to

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.950
this station.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.360
At the left side here, the
element is subjected to sigma,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.110
the stress sigma.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.140
At the right side, we have
the stress sigma plus

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.070
partial d sigma dx.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.370
This here really means nothing
else than a d sigma, an

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.450
increment in the sigma.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.020
Well, the equilibrium
requirement for this element

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:48.560
here is now that the force on
this side here, that is, sigma

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.780
times a on this side, which is
actually this one here, I

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.900
should have pointed
to this one--

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.730
and this force here, which is
the force on the right side.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.430
If we subtract these two forces,
that must be equal to

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.970
the force applied.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.030
Or rather, the d'Alembert
force.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.020
Notice that if we look at this
element, there's a force on

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.540
the right, there's a
force on the left.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.890
And this being the force on the
right, let's call that,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.580
say, R1, and let's
call that R2.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.770
So I put here R1,
I put here R2.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:38.860
And R1 minus R2 must be equal to
the d'Alembert force, which

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.930
is due to the inertia
of the material.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.750
This is the basic Newton's
law applied to this

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.060
differential element.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.870
Now, if we referred back to
how we proceeded in the

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.680
analysis of a discrete system,
we really proceeded in exactly

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.650
the same way.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.470
But our element then was a
discrete element, a discrete

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.380
spring element.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.200
We now use the same concept, but
apply those concepts to a

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.340
differential element.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.120
So this is the equilibrium
equation of the element.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.660
The constitutive relation
is given here--

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.670
that the stress is equal
to e, the Young's

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.470
Modulus, times the strain.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.780
This is the strain.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.770
And notice once again, since we
are considering sections to

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.720
be remaining plane, and simply
move horizontally, the only

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.960
strain that we're talking
about is this one.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.370
If we combine these two
equations here, we directly

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.110
obtain that equation here.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.270
Notice as I mentioned earlier,
a cancels out.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.100
If a is constant, that's why
a does not enter into this

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.770
equation, and this substitution
for sigma into

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.420
here gives us the second
derivative here.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.260
Of course, this part here
cancels out that part there,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.910
and that second derivative
is this one here.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.710
The E brought over to this
side gives us a 1 over c

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:07.240
squared, where c, once again,
is defined as shown here.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.210
The important point, really, is
that we are looking here in

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.035
the differential formulation at
a differential element of

00:09:15.035 --> 00:09:20.130
length dx at a particular
station x.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.670
That we're looking at this
element and we establish the

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.620
equilibrium requirement
of that element.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:34.820
R1 minus R2 shall be equal to
the mass of the element times

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.760
the acceleration.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.450
We also introduced a
constitutive relation.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.640
So far, clearly, we have used
two conditions for the

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.830
solution of the problem.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.030
The first one is the equilibrium
condition.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.990
The second is the constitutive
condition, or constitutive

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.810
requirement.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.960
We have to ask ourselves,
where do we satisfy the

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.420
compatibility condition?

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.750
Because there are always these
three conditions that we have

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.840
to satisfy.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.940
Well, the compatibility
condition is satisfied by

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:10.940
solving this differential
equation for this rod, and

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.820
obtaining a u that
is continuous.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.080
In other words, a u that tells
that all the sections have

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.930
remained together.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.730
We did not cut that bar apart.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.280
In the discrete system analysis
of the spring system

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.330
of lecture 1, if you were to
think back to it, we had to

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.510
satisfy the compatibility
condition explicitly, in

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.950
establishing the equilibrium
equations, because we had to

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.340
make sure that all the springs
remain attached to the carts.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.800
Here we satisfy the
compatibility condition by

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.900
solving this equation
for a continuous u.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.070
Well, the boundary conditions,
of course,

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.130
also have to be stated.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.610
And here we have a boundary
condition on the

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.380
left end of the rod.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.930
Remember, please, that the rod
is fixed at its left end, so

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.090
we have this condition here,
and clearly u must be 0 for

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.240
all times t at x equals 0.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.930
At the right end, we
apply a load R0.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:17.160
And there we have, this being
here the area times the stress

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.820
at x equals L, E
times a du dx.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.300
Notice that E du dx is, of
course, the stress, and so we

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.160
have here this total force
at the right end

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.600
being equal to R0.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.070
We also have initial conditions
for the solution of

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:40.310
this equation that I showed to
you, this equation here.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.320
We have to have two spatial
conditions, two boundary

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.640
conditions, one at the left
and one at the right end.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.150
The ones that I just
showed to you.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.870
We also have to have to have two
initial conditions, one on

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.580
the displacement and one
on the velocity.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.570
Well, their initial conditions,
in this particular

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.680
example, might be
as shown here.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.190
At time 0, all of the
displacement are 0.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.400
And at time 0, all
the velocities

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.470
along the rod are 0.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.160
So the basic differential
equation given here, once

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.740
again, plus these boundary
conditions, plus these initial

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.700
conditions, define the
complete problem.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.540
I also like to point out here
that this boundary condition

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.820
here, which does not involve any
derivative, is called an

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.380
essential, or displacement
boundary condition.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.690
An essential boundary condition
because it does not

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:40.090
involve any derivative when,
and this is important, the

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.060
highest derivative in this
differential equation is 2.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.390
The right-hand side boundary
condition is called a natural

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.110
force boundary condition.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.150
It's really involving forces.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.000
And it involves, as a highest
derivative, a derivative of

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.280
order 1 when the differential
equation here involves as the

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.740
highest derivative a derivative
of order 2.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.480
So in general--

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.830
and this is a very
important point--

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.360
we can say the following.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.970
If the highest order of the
spatial derivative in the

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:24.650
problem governing differential
equation is 2m, in our case, m

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.350
is equal to 1 for our problem.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.730
The highest order of the spacial
derivative in the

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.840
essential boundary condition
is m minus 1.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.380
In other words, in this
case, of order 0.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.060
The highest order the spatial
derivative in the natural

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.380
boundary conditions that I just
discussed is 2m minus 1,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.590
which is 1 in our
particular case.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:51.030
Then if we talk about this
problem, we talk about a C m

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.190
minus 1 variational problem.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.440
It will become apparent
to you later on why we

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.560
call it this way.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.980
C m minus 1 means continuity
of order m minus 1.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.790
In fact, in the Ritz analysis
that we will be performing

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.570
later on, that I will discuss
with you later on, we find

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:14.420
that we need, in the solution of
that kind of problem, only

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:20.080
continuity in the Ritz functions
of order m minus 1.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.610
Well, let us now look at the
variational formulation.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.510
I mentioned earlier that we have
two different approaches.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.670
The first approach is a
differential formulation, the

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.080
second approach is the
variational formulation.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.690
The variational formulation
operates in much the same way

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.760
as I introduced it
to you for the

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.320
analysis of discrete systems.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.620
We talk about pi a functional,
being equal to the strain

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.150
energy minus the potential
of the loads.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.390
Now for the rod, the strain
energy is given here.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:55.260
Notice this is 1/2 times the
stress times the strain, and

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.290
integrated over the total volume
of the element, or of

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.320
the rod, I should rather say.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.240
The total potential of the
loads is given here.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.060
I could have written it this
way, with a minus out there

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.550
and a plus in there--

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.440
same thing.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.860
This, then, is really nothing
other than the loads

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.620
multiplied by the total
displacement.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.590
And of course, there's an
integration involved here,

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.480
because the body forces, the
body loads that I introduced

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.560
here, fB, are varying along
the length of the rod.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.740
I introduce these fB body forces
because I want to use,

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.560
later on, the d'Alembert
principle, put these, in other

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.230
words, equal to minus the
acceleration forces, and can

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.620
directly apply what I discussed
now, also to the

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.860
dynamic analysis of this rod,
which we considered in the

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.790
differential formulations.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.670
Together with stating pi as
shown here, we also have to

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.620
state the left-hand boundary
condition, which is an

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.550
essential boundary condition.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.570
We have to list all the
essential boundary conditions

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.860
here, or the displacement
boundary conditions.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.020
Essential and displacement
mean the same

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.220
thing, in that sense.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:10.410
Well, then we invoke the
stationality of pi.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.890
We are saying that del pi shall
be equal to 0 for any

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:20.500
arbitrary variations of u that
satisfy, however, the

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.590
essential boundary conditions.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.340
This boundary condition here.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.380
So this has to hold, this
statement shall hold, for any

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.930
arbitrary variations in u.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:36.460
However, del u 0 shall be 0,
that satisfy, in other words,

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.980
the essential boundary
condition.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:46.330
Well, if we apply this variation
on pi, we obtain

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.920
directly this result here.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:56.600
Notice that this part here is
obtained by applying the

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.750
variation on this part here.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.430
The variation operator operates,
del operates, much

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.730
in the same way as a
differential operator.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.990
So this tool cancels this at
1/2, and we are left with EA

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.849
del u del x times the variation
on del u del x.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.819
And that is given right there.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:26.119
The variation on this part here
gives us simply a del u

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:32.370
times fB, and a del uL times R.
Of course, uL is equal to

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:37.980
is the displacement at x equal
to L. And this is, therefore,

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.290
the final result.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:45.360
Now if we look at this, we
recognize, really, that this

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.360
is the principle of virtual
displacement.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.180
It's a principle of virtual
displacement

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.420
governing the problem.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.760
In general, we can write this
principle as follows.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.400
Notice that here, we have
variations in strains, which

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.270
is that part there.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:08.610
The real stresses are given
there, which are those.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:14.310
And here we have variations in
displacement, those operating

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.120
on the body forces.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.030
There, there.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.640
Notice, I sum here over all
body forces in general.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.360
We have three components
in fB--

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.030
the x, y, and z component.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.460
So I list these components in
a vector that I call fB.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.560
Similarly, of course, we have
three displacement components

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.520
that appear here in this vector
U. Tau in general has 6

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.870
components.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.750
Del epsilon also has
6 components.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.830
Putting their transpose on the
del epsilon vector means that

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.380
we're summing the
product of the

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.230
strains times these stresses.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.330
Similarly, we are summing
here the product of the

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.620
displacement components times
the force components.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.445
We also have here
a contribution

00:19:00.445 --> 00:19:02.270
due to surface forces.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.420
fS are the surface forces.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.540
3 components, again, these are
the variations in the surface

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.610
displacement.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.510
So this part here, del uLR,
really corresponds to this

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.200
part here, involving
surface forces.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.450
So the surface forces read
again, and the variations in

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.430
the surface displacements,
are those here.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.240
Now notice that this principle
here, or this equation, I

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.540
should rather say, once again
has to be satisfied for any

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.810
arbitrary variations in
displacements that satisfy the

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.610
essential boundary conditions.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:42.100
For the problem of the rod,
these del u's have to satisfy

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.840
the condition that the variation
at the left-hand

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.670
boundary on u is 0, because
that is the

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.390
essential boundary condition.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.880
Also, of course, notice that
this variation in the u's

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.750
corresponds to these variations
in the strains.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:05.230
In other words, these strains
here are obtained from the

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.650
variations in the
displacement.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.460
That's important.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.630
They are linked together.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.980
So if we impose certain
variations in the

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.520
displacement, we have to impose
here the corresponding

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.981
variations in strains.

00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:22.770
Of course, these variations in
the displacements give us also

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.590
variations in surface
displacement.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.580
So these here are again
linked up with that.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.090
Later on in our formulation of
the finite element method, we

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.990
will write the variations in
the strains here as virtual

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:40.210
strains, arbitrary
virtual strains.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.490
And we are talking about the
strain vector with a

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.830
bar on top of it.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.650
Similarly, a bar here, a
bar here, instead of

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.050
the variation sign.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.900
However, the meaning is
quite identical--

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.030
what we are saying here, and
this is the principle of

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.030
virtual displacement that we
will be talking about later

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:01.050
on, when we formulate the finite
element equations, what

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.190
we are saying here really is
that this equation has to be

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:09.860
satisfied for any arbitrary
virtual displacements and

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.550
corresponding virtual strains.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.260
However, the virtual
displacements have to satisfy

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.590
the displacement boundary
conditions, the essential

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.280
boundary conditions.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.880
Well, from this, or rather that,
which of course these

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.810
equations are completely
equivalent, we

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.120
can go one step further.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.600
And if we go one step further,
by applying integration by

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:42.050
parts and recognizing that this
part here is completely

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.780
equal to that, by that I mean
taking the variation on the

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:52.518
derivative of x is the same as
taking the sorry... by taking

00:21:52.518 --> 00:21:58.290
variation on the derivative of
u with respect to x, that is

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:03.020
completely identical to first
taking the variation on u, and

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.760
then taking the differentiation
of that

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.530
variation on u with
respect to x.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.770
Well, if we recognize that
these two things are

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:19.200
identical, then using
integration by parts on this

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.210
equation here, which means,
really, on that equation here,

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.560
for the special case of
the rod that we're now

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:32.680
considering, we directly obtain
this equation here.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.060
The integration by parts is
performed by integrating this

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.830
relation here first, and notice
that if we do integrate

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.910
this, we want to lower the
differentiation of the virtual

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.230
part here and increase the order
of differentiation on

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.210
this part here.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:58.620
And that then directly gives
us these two terms

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.700
and that term here.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:08.830
If we then also list this part
here together with what we

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:13.810
obtain from that part, we
directly obtain this equation

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.680
here, and we proceed similarly
for the coefficients of del

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.500
uL, and we obtain
this part here.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.230
So this equation here is
obtained by simply using

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:30.970
integration by parts on, I
repeat, this equation here.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.420
We have not used
any assumption.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.980
All we did is a mathematical
manipulation of this equation

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.980
in a different form.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.500
And this is the new form
that we obtained.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:49.260
Del u0, of course, is the
variation of u at x equals 0.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.500
Now when we look at this
relation, we can extract now

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.310
the differential equation of
equilibrium and the natural or

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.230
force boundary conditions.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.350
How do we extract them?

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.970
Well, the first point is that
I mentioned already earlier,

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:09.690
this part here is 0, because
del u0 is imposed to be 0.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.310
So that part is 0.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.850
We can strike it out directly.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.770
Now when we look at this part
here and that part here and

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:23.570
recognize that del u is now
arbitrary, we can directly

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:28.420
extract the relation that this
must be 0 and that must be 0.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.430
How this is done?

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.890
Well, first of all, we
recognize that this

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:37.370
integration here really goes
from 0 plus to L minus, if you

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.320
want to be really exact.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.020
Because at the boundary, we have
the boundary conditions.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:48.140
Of course, this 0 plus means it
is infinitesimally close to

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:53.350
0, and L minus, we are
integrating up to a distance

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:59.680
infinitesimally small to
actually L. So putting the 0

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.010
plus and L minus here is just
for conceptual understanding

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.260
really necessary.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.950
Well, if we then impose the
following variations, say that

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:14.680
del uL is 0, is exactly 0,
then this part is out.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.190
And then we only have to
look at this part.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:25.810
Now we can apply any arbitrary
variation on u from 0 to L

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:30.590
minus, and this, then, this
total integration, must be

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.490
equal to 0.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.920
It must satisfy the
0 condition.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:40.060
And that can only be true when
this part here, what is in the

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.340
brackets, is 0.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.470
Because if this is not 0, I can
always select a certain

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:50.310
delta u which, when multiplied
by that and integrated as

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.920
shown here--

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.080
remember, this part
is not there--

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.840
will not give us 0.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.810
So therefore, this
part must be 0.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.950
And that is our first condition,
which is the

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.960
equilibrium condition of
a differential element.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.340
It's the equilibrium condition
of a differential element.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.710
Now, if we say, let us look at
the right-hand side boundary,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.520
and put del u0 everywhere along
the length of the rod,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:28.310
except at x equals exactly L.
Then this part would be 0, and

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:33.780
this part here is non-zero,
provided--

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.460
or rather, this part
would be present.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.850
And the only way that this part
can be 0, as it must be,

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:46.850
is that this part here, the
coefficient on del uL, is

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.020
actually 0.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.810
So this way, we have extracted
two points, two conditions.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.920
This part must be 0 and
that part must be 0.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.830
We extract these conditions
by looking at specific

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.340
variations on u.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:05.610
First we look at the variation
on u where del uL is 0, and

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:11.000
otherwise arbitrary from
x equals 0 to L minus.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.200
And then we can directly
conclude this must be 0, and

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.730
second time around, we say,
let del u equal 0 from x

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.380
equals 0 to L minus, which makes
all of this integral 0,

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:27.910
and we can focus all our
attention on this part here,

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.630
and we directly can conclude
that this part now

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.070
must also be 0.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:36.000
So this way, then, we extracted
the differential

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.490
equation of equilibrium and
the natural boundary

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.370
conditions.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.580
Very important.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.700
Differential equation of
equilibrium and the natural

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.540
boundary condition.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.780
And now we really recognize.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.280
of course, that if we put fB
equal to the d'Alembert force,

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:59.920
or minus the d'Alembert force,
equal to this right-hand side,

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.910
substitute from here back into
there, cancel out A, we

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.840
directly obtain this
differential equation.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.565
Notice that c is E divided
by rho square root

00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:10.860
E divided by rho.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.070
Now, the important point really
is that by having

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:25.400
started off with this pi
functional and that condition,

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.150
this condition also, and that
the variations on u at x

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:35.620
equals 0 shall be identically
0, we directly can extract

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.820
from this pi functional the
differential equation of

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.850
equilibrium and the natural
boundary conditions.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.070
The natural boundary conditions,
in fact, are

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.200
contained right in there.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.450
That's where the natural
boundary conditions appear.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.250
The essential boundary
conditions are there, and have

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.940
to be satisfied by
the variations.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:02.350
So in general, then, we find
the following points.

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:06.860
The important points are that
by invoking del pi equals 0

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:13.730
and using the essential boundary
conditions only, we

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.790
generate the principle of
virtual displacement, an

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.880
extremely important fact.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.680
And this will be the starting
equation that we will be using

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.210
to generate our finite element
equations later on.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.570
We also can extract the
problem governing

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.030
differential equation.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.200
Therefore, the problem governing
differential

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.700
equation is contained in the
principle of virtual

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.990
displacement, and this one is
contained in del pi equals 0,

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.880
in the del pi equals
0 condition.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.610
Of course also satisfying the
essential boundary condition.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.460
We also can extract the natural
boundary conditions.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.770
So these are also contained,
in essence, in pi, and as I

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:58.270
showed to you, they're contained
really in w.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.640
That's where they appear.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.310
Now in the derivation of the
problem governing differential

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.630
equation, we used integration
by parts.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.050
And the highest spatial
derivative in

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.700
pi is of order m.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:17.430
We used integration by parts m
times, and what we're finding

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.970
is that the highest spatial
derivative in the problem

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.350
governing differential
equation is then 2m.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.840
And this then puts together the
complete structure of the

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.970
equations that we're
talking about.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.730
Here I have another view graph
that summarizes the

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.880
process once more.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.060
We are starting with the total
potential pi of the system

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.350
being equal to the strain
energy minus the total

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.910
potential of the loads.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.070
We're using this condition and
the essential boundary

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.250
condition--

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.610
very important--

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.030
to generate the principle
of virtual displacement.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.920
At this stage, we can solve the
problem, and we will do so

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.870
by using finite element
methods.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:02.190
We can, however, also go on from
the principle of virtual

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:06.920
displacement using integration
by parts, and then we would

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.665
derive the differential equation
of equilibrium and

00:31:09.665 --> 00:31:12.050
the natural boundary
conditions.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:13.820
We can solve the problem.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.250
Well, we can solve the problem
at this level really only when

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.010
we can solve the differential
equation of equilibrium,

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.150
subject to the natural
boundary conditions.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:27.290
And that we can really only do
for very simple systems.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:32.550
Therefore, this process here,
from here onward, can really

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:36.000
be followed only for relatively
simple systems.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.760
For complex systems, shell
structures, complicated shell

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.640
beam structures, plane stress
systems, real engineering

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.820
structural analysis systems,
this is not possible, and we

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.760
stop right there, and we solve
our problem this way, using

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.200
finite element methods.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.320
Now, the one important point,
however, I want to make once

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.600
more clear--

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.910
when we proceed this way, we are
deriving the differential

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.470
equation of equilibrium for
each differential element.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.410
And this means that when we go
this route for the simple

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:19.045
systems that we can go this
route, we satisfy the

00:32:19.045 --> 00:32:23.200
equilibrium condition on each
differential element.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.910
However, when we go this route,
we will find that we

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:31.430
only satisfy the equilibrium
conditions in a global sense,

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:36.150
in an integrated sense, using
finite element methods, and

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:42.300
that to actually satisfy the
equilibrium conditions in a

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:47.130
local sense, meaning for each
differential element, we have

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:52.670
to use many elements, and only
then, of course, our finite

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.040
element solution will converge
to the solution that we would

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.660
have obtained solving the
differential equation of

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.950
equilibrium.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:05.270
Therefore, when we start from
the principle of virtual

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:09.880
displacement, if we, as I will
show you, use many elements,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.440
we really obtain the same
solution as here.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.040
However, if we do not use
many elements, if we

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.140
use a coarse mesh--

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.470
we will talk about a coarse
mesh later on--

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.790
then we will see that we only
satisfy the equilibrium

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.605
conditions in a global sense for
the complete structure, in

00:33:26.605 --> 00:33:29.410
an integrated sense for the
complete structure.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.390
For each finite element, we will
satisfy the equilibrium

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.180
conditions, but we will not
satisfy the equilibrium

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:40.610
conditions accurately for each
differential element--

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:46.760
dx, dy, dz being arbitrarily
small--

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.230
in the continuous body.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.650
That will become clearer, then,
when we actually go

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.120
through an example.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:34:00.120
Now I mentioned earlier that
a whole class of classical

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.850
methods are the weighted
residual methods.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.730
In the weighted residual
methods, we proceed in the

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:06.910
following way.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.139
We consider the steady state
problem, which is given here,

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:11.860
with these boundary
conditions.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.840
Now this operator L2m
phi equals R--

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.830
this L2m is the operator that
governs the problem.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:24.920
Like in our particular rod
problem, L2m would be equal to

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.460
delta u delta x squared.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.500
So the highest derivative in
this spacial operator being

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.830
2m, in this case, 2,
for our example.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.560
The boundary conditions can
be written this way.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.380
And the basic step, then, in the
weighted residual and the

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.730
Ritz analysis is to assume a
solution all of this form,

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:51.550
where phi bar gives us the
assumed solution ai are

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.560
parameters that are unknown,
and fi are bases functions.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.800
These are functions that
have to be assumed.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:05.000
Well, there is, of course,
considerable concern on what

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.750
kind of functions to choose.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:10.220
In the weighted residual method,
these functions here,

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.070
if you directly operate on this
equation here, should

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.730
satisfy all boundary
conditions.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:19.830
Notice that in the weighted
residual method, here I'm

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:24.940
really talking about going on
this view graph through the

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.480
differential equations of
equilibrium and natural

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.870
boundary conditions, deriving
them, if you want, via this

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:34.090
route, and then trying to
solve the problem here

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.370
numerically.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.340
We will actually, as I said
earlier, in the finite element

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.050
process, go this route, but we
can also go that route with

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.710
the weighted residual methods.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:49.930
In fact, there is a close
relationship between using

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.860
weighted residual methods at
this level and the Ritz method

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.230
at that level, the way I will
be describing it later on.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:59.440
But in the weighted residual
method, this is the

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.340
assumption.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:06.000
And then if we look at this
equation here, we can

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.990
construct an error
R, substituting

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.780
from here into there.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:16.270
And that capital R error is
given by this equation.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.540
Notice that this is, of course,
our trial function

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.550
that we have.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:24.290
And if the right-hand side is 0,
everywhere over the domain,

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:28.130
then of course our error would
be 0, and we would have solved

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.570
our equation that we're
looking at here.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.470
That is the equation
we want to solve.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:38.400
Since if all of these functions
fi satisfy all of

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.490
the boundary conditions, then
we are satisfying these

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:45.170
equations, and all we have to
worry about further is to

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.630
satisfy this equation.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:50.390
If R is 0, we would also satisfy
the differential

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:51.880
equation of equilibrium,
and we would have,

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.510
in fact, the solution.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:57.560
However, that, of course, would
be a very lucky choice

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.150
on the fi functions.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.350
In general, R will not
be identically 0

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.890
all over the domain.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:09.910
In fact, how much R, or how
close R will be to 0 will of

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.890
course depend on the ai.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:17.270
And this is then basically
our objective, namely, to

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:21.310
calculate ai values that are
making this R, this left-hand

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.350
side capital R, as close
as possible to 0.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:25.660
And that can be achieved
via the

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.170
Galerkin method, for example.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.380
This is the basic process.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:33.150
Here we're substituting the R.
These are the trial functions,

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.290
and we're integrating the
product of these over the

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.830
total domain.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.340
The domain here, in the case
of our rod, would simply be

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.880
the volume of the rod.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.780
This is the mechanism that
generates to us n equations in

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.550
the trial parameters ai.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.770
In another approach, the least
squares method, we would

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:59.900
operate on the square of the
error, and minimize the square

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.750
of the error when integrated
over the total domain with

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.910
respect to the trial
parameters ai.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:10.720
That again gives us n equations,
and we set up these

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.410
n equations just as we're
doing here, to

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.730
solve for the ai.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:19.820
Knowing, then, the ai, we can
back substitute into this

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.510
assumption here, and now
we have our approximate

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.320
solution, phi bar.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.590
If the trial functions have been
selected to satisfy the

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.770
boundary conditions, then of
course phi bar will satisfy

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.500
the boundary conditions.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.650
However, what phi bar will not
satisfy exactly is this

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.836
equation here.

00:38:37.836 --> 00:38:41.110
However, we have minimized the
error in the satisfaction of

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:45.790
this equation in some sense
using the Galerkin method or

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.280
the least squares method.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:52.950
These methods can also be
extended when the fi trial

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:57.460
functions do not satisfy all
of the boundary conditions,

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.620
namely, not the natural
boundary conditions.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.410
They can be extended to their
places, but classically, they

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.640
have been used with trial
functions that satisfy all

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.140
boundary conditions.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:14.360
When we were to extend the
Galerkin method for the case

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.510
where the trial functions do
not satisfy the natural

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:22.430
boundary conditions, then we
really talk basically about

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:27.050
already a Ritz analysis, and
that is the next procedure

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.860
that I want to introduce
to you.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:35.670
Now of course, if we wanted to
really start deriving the Ritz

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:39.310
method from the Galerkin
approach--

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:42.020
in other words, if we wanted to
derive this Ritz analysis

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.580
method from the Galerkin
approach, we would have to

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.460
extend, first of all, this
Galerkin approach to include

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.440
the natural boundary conditions,
and then we would

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.340
have to perform integrations on
this equation, and we would

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.510
obtain the Ritz analysis
method.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:03.240
The actual way of starting, of
introducing the Ritz analysis

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.790
method, is to introduce
it as a separate tool.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.750
And it is introduced in
the following way.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:15.370
Let pi be the functional of the
C m minus 1 variational

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.690
problem that is equivalent to
the differential formulation

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.360
that we talked about earlier.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.960
Now, the differential
formulation that I talked

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.120
about here is this one.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.380
That's a differential
formulation.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.380
And as an example once again,
the operator L2m is del 2 u

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.400
del x squared.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.430
There's a constant here.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.610
We could also put an EA
in front here, but

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.080
that only is a constant.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.280
It doesn't change the character
of the operator.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.690
But this is basically the
operator for the problem that

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:50.660
we considered, and of course,
our boundary conditions are

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.380
also there.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:41:00.270
So if we have a pi functional
that is equivalent to the

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:03.120
differential formulation given
in those two equations that I

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.350
just pointed out to you again,
then in the Ritz method, we

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:10.320
substitute the trial functions,
phi bar--

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.780
let us look at them again,
these are the trial

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.230
functions--

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:21.870
into pi, and we generate n
simultaneous equations for the

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:27.660
parameters that appear in this
assumption here by invoking

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.770
the stationality of pi.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:36.890
Notice that by invoking that
del pi is 0, we really say

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:44.130
that del pi ai is 0 for all i.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.820
And that gives us the condition
which we used to set

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:51.740
up the individual equations
that we need to set up to

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.900
solve for the trial
parameters ai.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.980
Well, let us look at some
of the properties.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.080
The trial functions used in the
Ritz analysis need only

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.550
satisfy the essential boundary
conditions, an extremely

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.840
important fact.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.260
In the classical weighted
residual method, as I pointed

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.020
out, the trial function should
satisfy all boundary

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:13.730
conditions.

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:16.540
Therefore, they can be very
difficult to choose.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.750
In the Ritz analysis method,
we only need to satisfy the

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.080
essential boundary conditions.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.780
The application of del pi
equals 0 generates the

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.010
principle of virtual
displacement.

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.640
I mentioned that to you
earlier already.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.460
And therefore, in effect, we use
in the Ritz analysis this

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.270
principle of virtual
displacement.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:41.380
By invoking del pi equals 0,
we minimize basically the

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.670
violation of the internal
equilibrium requirements and

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:49.070
the violation of the natural
boundary conditions.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:55.050
Well, remember that invoking
del pi equal to 0 and then

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:58.400
using integration by parts, we
actually generate, we could

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.020
generate the differential
equations of equilibrium and

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.160
the natural boundary conditions
the way I've shown

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.270
it to you, for the simple
bar structure.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:09.910
Now, what I'm saying here is
that we do not want to

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:12.230
generate these differential
equations of equilibrium and

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:13.180
natural boundary conditions.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.140
However, please recognize that
they are contained in the

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.980
equation del pi equals 0.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.500
Therefore, by substituting our
trial functions, we violate

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.150
the internal equilibrium
requirements and the natural

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:29.410
boundary conditions, but
we will see that we are

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:34.630
minimizing that violation in
these conditions here.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.930
Also, we will see that we
generate a symmetric

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.960
coefficient matrix, and K and
the governing equations then,

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.370
our KU equals R, that
we want to solve.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:49.670
And that is really the basis of
the finite element method

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.370
for the analysis of continuous
systems.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:56.180
Let me now go in detail
through an example.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:01.330
Here we have is simple bar
structure which has an area 1

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:06.860
square centimeter from A to B,
and from B to C, B being this

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.995
point here where the
area changes and C

00:44:08.995 --> 00:44:10.500
being that point there.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.850
From B to C, we have
a varying area.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.420
This variation in the
area is shown here.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:21.750
It's 1 plus y/40 squared is the
area at any station y, y

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:25.290
being measured from point
B, as you can see here.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.200
The length here is
100 centimeters.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.340
This length is 80 centimeters.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.340
The structure is subjected to
a load of 100 newtons here.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:36.930
Notice that this arrow really
lies on top of that dashed

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.390
line we just separated out for
you to understand that there

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:41.290
is this arrow.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.810
So this is the load
applied at the

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.820
mid-line of this structure.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:51.690
We assume once again for the
structure also that there is

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:54.840
only the following displacement
mechanism.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:00.670
If a section was originally
there, and it is a vertical

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:04.260
section to the midline, then
it has moved over, and I

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.730
grossly exaggerate now, to this
position, where this is

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.530
the displacement that we're
talking about u.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:15.050
Grossly exaggerated,
of course.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:18.400
So we're having a bar structure
subjected to a

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.550
concentrated load fixed
at the left end.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:27.360
And our objective now is to
solve this structure, to solve

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.300
for the unknown displacement u,
being 0 here, of course as

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.180
a function of x, when
this structure is

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.130
subjected to that load.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:41.690
Well, in the calculation of
this example, I want to

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:44.590
display to you as many
of the concepts

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.090
that we just discussed.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:50.580
Here we have pi being equal
to this value here.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.050
The strain energy
is given here.

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:57.090
Notice this is 1/2 times the
stress times the strain

00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:00.190
integrated over the volume
of the structure.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:04.800
The integration goes from 0 to
180, because that is the

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.750
length of that structure.

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:11.860
The total potential of the
external load is 100, which is

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.270
the intensity of the load times
the displacement at x

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:18.910
equal to 180... at
x equal to 180.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:22.120
Well, the essential boundary
condition is that u is

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.180
0 at x equals 0.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.260
I'd like to now consider
two different cases

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.880
for the Ritz analysis.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.580
In the case one I want to use a
function that spans u, which

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.550
spans continuously--

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:38.430
and let me draw it out here--

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:44.760
from u, from x equals
0, to x equals 180.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.530
That is the endpoint.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.510
So here we have this function,
this part here and that part

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.800
there, these are the two trial
parameters that we

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.010
want to solve for.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:58.200
And we will select them, we will
calculate them, rather,

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.820
using the Ritz analysis.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:09.860
Case two, I also use trial
functions, but notice now that

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.740
I'm performing the following.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.190
We have a domain AB--

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:15.680
let me go back once more--

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.510
a domain AB, and a domain BC.

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:24.280
And I want to now use one
function for AB and one

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.820
function for BC.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:35.020
The AB function is simply this
one here, a linear variation

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:36.280
up to this point.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:40.220
Now notice that UB is our
trial parameter--

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.700
that's the one we don't know,
our trial function parameter.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.150
x/100 is simply is the function

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:47.210
that I'm talking about.

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:50.100
And notice that this function
only is applicable for this

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:54.580
domain where, let me put down
here the length that is x

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.270
equal to 100, and this is
here x equal to 180.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:04.650
Now for this part here, I
use this function here.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:07.680
Now notice what this
function does.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:13.130
Well, if we look at this part
here in front, it involves uB,

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:15.980
which is also there,
and it involves uC.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.770
uB, by the way, is the physical
displacement right

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:21.460
here into this direction.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.390
Of course, I'm plotting u
upwards here to be able to

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:25.420
show it to you.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:31.610
But the displacement, uB, is the
displacement of this point

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:33.340
B to the right.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:38.460
uC is the displacement of this
point C to the right.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:42.730
Then we recognize that this part
here corresponds really

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:45.490
to a variation such as that.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:51.590
Notice when x is equal to 100,
which is that point, this

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:53.560
function here is 1.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:49:00.380
When x is equal to 180, which is
that point there, this part

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:04.870
is equal to 0, because 180 minus
100 is 80, divided by 80

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.480
is 1, and 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.580
So this dashed line
corresponds to

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.400
this function here.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:16.080
Let me put a dashed line
underneath there.

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:21.470
Well, if we now look at this
part here, we notice that this

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:26.890
part is 0, or this trial
function here is 0 at this

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:31.540
point B. And it varies linearly
like that across,

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.660
where this part here, of
course, denotes uC.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.270
That is this one here, solid
black line, and here also,

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:42.530
solid black line.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:49.750
Now the superposition of both
these functions, the dashed

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:55.760
blue and the solid black line,
give us this function here.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:01.420
So the actual function that I'm
talking about is a linear

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.950
variation along here, and a
linear variation along here,

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:07.610
where I plot it vertically
up here--

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:12.300
uB and uC here.

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:16.070
Now, this is a specific case
that I want to draw your

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:19.330
attention on, because this
really corresponds, as we

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:22.720
shall see, to a true finite
element analysis.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.730
And the reason for it is that
we're talking about one domain

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.960
here and another domain there.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:32.890
And both of these domains are
identified as finite elements.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:39.200
Well, the first step now is
to use pi, invoke the

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.250
stationality condition as we did
earlier, and this gives us

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.910
the principle of virtual
displacement.

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:47.620
I mentioned it earlier
already.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.710
Our virtual strains are here.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.750
The stresses are here.

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:55.290
The virtual work is
on this side.

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:57.380
I discussed it earlier
already.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:01.650
We do not want to go
now via this route.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:05.300
We first of all want to now
obtain the exact solution.

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:09.860
The exact solution is obtained
by using integration by parts

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:16.150
on delta pi, being, of course,
equal to 0, and extracting the

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.850
differential equation of
equilibrium for each

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:22.450
differential element
in this structure.

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:24.560
This means that if we are
talking here about the

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.050
differential element
equilibrium of each

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:30.880
differential element dx long
anywhere along the structure,

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.170
in other words, the equilibrium
of typically an

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:36.860
element like that.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.980
That is a differential equation
of equilibrium.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.980
And we also, of course, have
the natural boundary

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:42.520
conditions.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.970
We can also derive the natural
boundary conditions.

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:47.910
The solution to this is obtained
by integration, and

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:50.380
this is the solution given.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:55.110
Well, the stresses, then, of
course are obtained by

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:58.430
differentiation of the u's to
get strains, and multiplying

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:01.100
those by E, and these are
the stresses in the bar.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:04.490
These are the exact stresses
in the bar that satisfy the

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:07.190
differential equations of
equilibrium and the natural

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.260
boundary conditions.

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:12.290
This is the exact solution of
this bar problem, the way I

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:13.750
have formulated it.

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:15.970
Now will perform our
Ritz analysis.

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:19.840
In case one, we use
pi equal to this.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.730
Notice that I have substituted
now our trial functions

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:27.350
corresponding to case one
into the functional pi.

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:32.910
That gives us this term, that
term here, and that term here.

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:36.930
Notice that I have broken up the
integration from 0 to 100,

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:44.010
and 100 to 180, because the area
changes from over this

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:47.200
length here, and only for that
reason, really, I have broken

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.520
up the integrations.

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.740
Now this is pi.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:56.260
And if we now invoke, we can
integrate this out, and then

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.600
invoke that del pi
shall be 0, we

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.870
obtain this set of equations.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:05.850
We solve for a1 and a2,
substitute back into our

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:09.700
assumption that we had earlier,
and we got this u.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:16.330
Notice that of course this u
displacement does satisfy the

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:17.800
essential boundary conditions.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.940
It does satisfy the
essential boundary

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.040
conditions at x equals 0.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.660
You can just substitute x equals
0, and you would see

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.890
that u is 0.

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:30.560
It does not satisfy, however,
the natural boundary condition

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.190
at x equal to 180.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:37.300
Sigma is given here, obtained
by calculating the strains

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.260
from here and multiplying
by E--

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:43.240
this is our approximate solution
to the problem.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:46.880
We are satisfying the
compatibility conditions,

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.280
because the bar has
remained together.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.340
No material has been
cut away from it.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:59.380
Also, we are satisfying the
constitutive relations, but we

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:03.920
do not satisfy the internal
equilibrium on a differential

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.190
local elements sense.

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:09.700
We do not satisfy the
differential equilibrium, and

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.880
we do not satisfy the natural
boundary conditions.

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.330
But we satisfy them in
an approximate sense.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:16.370
Case two.

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:21.450
Here now we're talking about
our two linear functions.

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:24.620
And here we naturally integrate
from 0 to 100 for

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:29.040
the first linear function, and
from 100 to 180 for the second

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.760
linear function.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:36.040
Notice this is, again, the area,
and notice that this is

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.435
here the strain squared.

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:42.980
It's strain squared here because
our E is out there,

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.510
which would give
us the stress.

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:51.310
And the area here, of course,
is equal to 1, which we did

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:52.280
not write down.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.040
The important point is that this
is now our pi for these

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:55.650
two functions.

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:59.690
We again invoke del
pi equal to 0.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:01.820
We obtain now this
set of equations.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.010
We are solving from this
set of equations uB

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:07.000
and uC, given here.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.320
Having got uB and uC, of
course we now have the

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.240
complete displacements along the
bar, because we only need

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:19.500
to substitute back into our
original approximations that

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:22.280
we looked at earlier.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.320
Let me just get them
once more here.

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.370
We had them here.

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:31.840
If we now substitute from
uB and uC into these two

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.360
equations, we have the complete

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.170
displacement solution.

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:36.510
Of course, this is
an approximate

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:37.720
displacement solution.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.650
And similarly, our stresses
are approximate.

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:45.800
Now on these last few graphs,
I have plotted the solution.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:50.650
And notice that this is
here the direction x.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:55.200
Here we have the point B, here
we have the point C, here we

00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:00.400
have the point A. Our exact
solution, which satisfies the

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.300
constitutive relations,
compatibility relations, and

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:07.270
the differential equations of
equilibrium, and all bounded

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:09.780
conditions, is the
solid line here.

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:13.150
Our solution one, case one, Ritz
analysis, is the dashed

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:17.790
line here, and the solution
two is this dashed dotted

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.350
line, down there.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:22.610
Notice that we are quite close
in our Ritz analysis to the

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:25.370
exact solution in the
displacement.

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:29.100
However, the strains and
stresses are obtained by the

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.530
differentiation of these
displacement solutions, and

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:36.240
here I show to you the
calculated stresses.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.620
Again, point A here, point
B here, point C there.

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:43.430
The important point
is the following.

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:49.430
In the exact solution, we have
the stress of 100 in domain

00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:52.810
AB, and then we have
this curve here, a

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:54.670
very high slope there.

00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:59.460
And in our solution one, we had
this variation in stress.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.340
Notice that it goes continuously
over the complete

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:08.620
domain, because our assumed
displacement function was

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:11.640
continuous also over this
domain, and its first

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:15.100
derivative was continuous over
this complete domain.

00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.860
So that's why our solution one
is continuous there, and in

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.220
fact, we're seeing just the
straight line there, because

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.660
our displacement approximation
was parabolic.

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:29.300
Our solution two is exact
here, 100, and very

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.350
approximate here for
the displacement.

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:35.830
But notice that at the midpoint
between B and C, we

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:39.300
get very good results.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:43.180
Now the important point really
is shown here on

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:44.820
the last view graph.

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:48.520
We note that in this last
analysis, we use trial

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.840
functions that do not satisfy
the natural boundary

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.680
condition, and I'm talking now
about the piecewise linear

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.660
functions, in other words, from
A to B and B to C each,

00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.030
just a straight line.

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:01.440
We use trial functions that
do not satisfy the natural

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.490
boundary conditions.

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:05.560
The trial functions themselves
are continuous, but the

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.720
derivatives are discontinuous
at point B. Notice our

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:15.080
stresses here are discontinuous
at point B.

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:18.700
For a cm minus 1 variational
problem, the way I've defined

00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:22.150
it, we only need continuity in
the m minus first derivatives

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:23.830
of the functions.

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:27.610
In this problem, m is 1, and
therefore we only need

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:35.300
continuity in the functions
themselves, and not in any

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:39.330
derivatives, because we only
need continuity in the m minus

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:41.050
first derivative.

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:46.390
The domains A and B and B and C
are finite elements, and in

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.850
actuality, we've performed a
finite element analysis.

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:51.990
This is all I wanted to
say in this lecture.

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:53.240
Thank you for your attention.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's get started.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Can you hear me back there?
Loud and clear.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
OK.
Let's get started.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Before I begin,
just a couple of announcements.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Brad Buren is one of our
students here and he needs a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
note-taker.
It's a paid position.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So if you are interested you
can stop by after class and see

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
him.
He's sitting right here out

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
there, OK?
Second, just a reminder that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
6.002 does have prerequisites.
And the prerequisites are 8.02

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and 18.03.
So with that let me start off

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
with the usual.
Do a quick review of what we've

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
done so far.
So we started out life looking

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
at the laws of physics and
Maxwell's equations and so on.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And those were way too hard so
we said let's make life easy for

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
ourselves.
So we chose to play in this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
playground in which we said we
shall adhere to the lumped

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
matter discipline.
OK?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The LMD.
So we are in that playground.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So this entire course,
and for that matter large parts

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
of EECS are within that
playground, within which the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
lumped matter discipline
applies.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So as soon as we jumped into
the playground,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the LMD playground,
we could take Maxwell's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
equations and abstract them out
into two very,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
very simple rules.
And the very simple rules were

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
KVL and KCL.
KVL simply said that I can sum

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the voltages in any loop in a
circuit and the result then

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
would be zero.
Similarly, I can sum the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
currents that enter or exit any
node and the sum will also be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
zero.
So what you can now do is,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
if you feel like,
you can go around and brag.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Oh, yeah, we use Maxwell's
equations in everyday life and,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
yeah, it's good stuff.
And the key is that this is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
really an encapsulation of
Maxwell's equations within this

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
playground that we are in.
So I talked about the first

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
method of circuit analysis in
the last lecture.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And that method simply took
the, wrote KVL for all the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
loops, wrote KCL for all the
nodes and wrote element vi

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
relationships.
And together gave you a big

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
bunch of equations.
And you sat down and grunged

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
through the equations and you
solved for branch voltages and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
currents.
So we reviewed a second method

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
of circuit analysis.
And I'll simply call it circuit

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
composition.
The basic idea behind this

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
method was to learn some simple
rules of how resistors add and

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
conductances add and so on and
so forth and look at a circuit

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and simplify the circuit by
making series simplifications

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
when the resistors are in series
and so on and so forth,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and compose it and play around
with it till we end up with the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
current, the voltages that we
are looking for.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
This is the intuitive method.
And so a section in Chapter 2,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I believe, of the course notes
discusses several examples using

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
this method and attempts to make
a little bit formal the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
intuitive approach that is
applied in this method.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So we then looked at the node
method.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And the node method was simply
a particular way of applying KVL

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and KCL.
Node method,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
remember?
We took a ground node.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Then we labeled the nodes of
the remaining voltages with

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
respect to that ground.
Then we wrote KCL for each of

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
the nodes.
And when we wrote KCL for each

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
of the nodes,
remember, KVL was implicit in

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
this expression that we used for
each of the currents that were

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
exiting each node.
So if Ej was a node voltage,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
then Ej minus Ei multiplied by
the conductance Gi was the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
current that was going through
one of those,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I should call it Gij.
This is a conductance that

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
connects nodes i and j.
That gave us the KVL that fed

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
into the same system.
So these are three methods.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The node method,
by the way, is sort of the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
workhorse of the 6.002 industry.
And for that matter for all of

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the circuits industry.
When in doubt,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
apply the mode method,
you'll be OK.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
That applies to linear
circuits, nonlinear circuits,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
what have you.
What I'm going to do today is

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
go through two more methods.
So notice that the first few

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
lectures of this course,
the first three lectures simply

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
comprise transitioning you from
the world of physics to the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
world of EECS.
And then two lectures on giving

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
you a bag of tricks.
So we start you off with the

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
sort of tools,
your mallets and chisels and so

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
on and so forth.
And these five methods are your

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
tools.
We'll look at two methods

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
today.
One method is called the method

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
of superposition and the second
method is called the Thevenin

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
method.
And these methods apply only to

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
linear circuits.
So we look at the subset of

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
circuits that are linear,
and these two methods apply to

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
only those circuits.
These are methods that combined

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
with intuition really enables
you to solve very interesting

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
circuits very,
very quickly.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So let me do an example using a
usual node method.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And then jump into introducing
the superposition methods and

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Thevenin methods using that same
example.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So let me draw you an example
circuit here.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So, again, I'm using this
example, I will use this example

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
to introduce the method of
superposition and the Thevenin

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
method.
So what I'm going to do is

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
start off the usual way and
analyze the circuit using a

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
method that you know now,
the node method.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And what I'll do is write down
the node equations for this by

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
applying the node method.
So if you recall the node

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
method.
I choose a ground node.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I'm going to choose this node.
It's got both the voltage

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
source connected to it,
and it's also got many other

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
edges impinging on it.
So I'm going to choose that as

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
my ground node and I'm going to
label the other nodes with their

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
voltages.
So this is an unknown.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I'll label it as e.
I guess we just have one

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
unknown e.
And I know the voltage of this

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
node, and that is simply V.
Since it's V,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
there's a voltage source
between the ground node and that

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
node.
So what I can do next is that I

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
can write down the node equation
for this node and then go from

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
there.
So let me go ahead and do that.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So let me sum up the currents
going outside,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
going outwards.
So I have e minus v divide by

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
R1, I have e minus zero divide
by R2, and I have minus i equals

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
zero.
This is a node equation.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The first thing I want you to
observe is that this equation is

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
linear in V and i.
What I mean by linear is that

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
you don't see terms like Vi or
V-squared and things like that.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It's some constant times V plus
some constant times i equals

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
some other constant.
So that's quite nice.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So I'm going to rearrange the
terms in the following manner.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I'll move the known sources to
the right-hand side and collect

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the coefficients of e on this
side, so I get one by R1 plus

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
one by R2 over here.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So stare at this for a moment
and notice again here I have e,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
my unknown node voltage,
there is some constant

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
multiplier, and that equals some
function of V summed up with

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
some function of i.
And, again, notice that this is

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
a linear combination of V and i.
No multiplication terms and so

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
on and so forth.
This is a pretty standard form

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in which we will represent
equations quite often.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And just to label it,
this is often labeled G as the

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
conductance matrix.
Of course this is e,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000
our unknown node voltages,
and this is a linear sum of

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
sources.
So this is a very standard way

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that we will represent
equations.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
We did that last week as well,
or rather on Tuesday where I

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
took a conductance matrix,
multiplied that by a column

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
vector of unknown node voltages
and equated that to some linear

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
combination of my source
voltages.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
The reason the circuit is
linear is that I have only

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
linear elements in the circuit.
I don't have any nonlinear

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
elements.
And because of that I can

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
rewrite this in the following
manner.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I'm just going to express e as
a function of V and i and bring

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
it over to this side.
So it's some function of i.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So I get R1 R2 divide by R1
plus R2.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And I bring R1 R2 to this side.
That's what I get.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So stare at this for a few
seconds, very common form.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
My unknown node voltage is
equal to this stuff on the

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
right-hand side.
The stuff on the right-hand

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
side has a term multiplying the
source voltage V and some other

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
term multiplying the current I.
And if I were to put this in

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
sort of symbol-like form my
unknown node voltage is some

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
constant times V1 plus some
constant times,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
is of the form constant times
the source current,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
constant times the source
voltage and so on.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The units of As and Vs are
different because in this case A

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
has no units because V is a
voltage.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And so is e.
In this case V has units of

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
resistance.
So that V times i gives me a

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
voltage.
So stare at this equation for a

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
few seconds and this should help
us build up some insight that

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
will allow us to write down the
answer almost by inspection.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I'm going to show you a method
now, in a few minutes,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
which will allow you to write
down the answer e just by

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
starring at the circuit without
having to go through node

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
equations and so on.
The more and more methods I

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
teach you, the more you will be
able to do a lot of this

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
completely by yourselves.
In this particular example it's

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
a relatively simple circuit but
these methods would be

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
particularly useful when you
have more complicated

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
situations.
But before I go on let me spend

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
a few minutes pontificating on
linearity.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So that's a linear circuit.
And this equation gives me the

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
unknown node voltage e as a
linear sum of source voltages

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and source currents.
Linearity implies two

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
properties, the property of
homogeneity and also gives vice

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
to the property of
superposition.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Let's do homogeneity first.
What this says is if I have a

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:52.000
circuit, some circuit and I feed
it some sort of inputs,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.000
A, then let's say my output is
S.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
If you're feeling hungry think
of these as apples and the

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
circuit converts them into
applesauce.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So what homogeneity says is
that what I can do is if I take

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
each of my apples and instead of
feeding it an entire apple what

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
if I give it three-quarters of
an apple?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Say I multiple all my inputs by
some constant alpha,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
three-quarters.
What that says is that at the

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
output instead of getting one
full bottle of applesauce I'm

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
going to get three-quarters of a
bottle of apple sauce.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
So if I proportionately reduce
all the inputs and if this is a

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
linear circuit then so shall my
output be reduced in the same

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
proportion.
So that's homogeneity.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Next, let's look at
superposition.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
The property of superposition
says the following.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000
The same kind of circuit.
If I feed it apples then I get

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
applesauce.
I take the same circuit,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and this time around if I feed
the circuit a different set of

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
inputs, say blueberries.
And let's say my output,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
oops, let me do it this way.
So as my output I get blueberry

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
sauce, if such exists.
So apples applesauce,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
blueberries give me blueberry
sauce.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Then what I'm going to get if I
mix up the two,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000
so let's say I take my circuit,
the same circuit with a set of

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
inputs and in this example one
output.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Let's say I mix up my inputs
and some of my inputs in the

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
following way,
here I feed an A1 plus B1 and

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
here A2 plus B2 and so on then
at the output I am going to get

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
a mush of apple sauce and
blueberry sauce.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
All this says is that if I
apply just apples I get

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
applesauce.
If I apply just blueberries I

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
get blueberry sauce.
Then if I were to figure out

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
how this blender would have
worked had I fed in the

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
combinations of apples and
blueberries, then for the

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
purposes of understanding that
blender all I could have done

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
was taken by two outputs and
just mixed them up together

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
myself and that's exactly what
I'd get.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
So if I sum up the inputs my
outputs would also be the sum of

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
the outputs with the inputs
applied by themselves.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So let me take this here and
munge around with hit for a few

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
seconds and get something
interesting out of it.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
So notice two inputs,
two inputs, outputs.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
In your notes I've given you
another template for the next

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
set of scribbles I'm going to
make here.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So use the next set of
templates on page three.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
What I'm going to do here is
something very simple,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
set one output to zero and feed
a voltage V1.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
So that's feed a voltage V1 and
set the other output to zero.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And let's say I get Y1 as an
output.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And in this case I set the
first voltage to zero and feed a

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
different voltage V2 on the
second input.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And let's say my output is Y2.
This is just a particular

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
application of the superposition
principle I just outlined.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Apply V1 set one output to
zero.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Apply V2 set the original
output to zero.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Then what I'm going to find is
that the answer will simply look

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
like this, just replace for As
and Bs what I just did and we

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
get V1 and zero here and we get
zero and V2 here.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:40.000
And as my output I'm going to
get exactly the sum Y1 plus Y2.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
This is simply a particular
application of superposition

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
where what I'm saying is the
following.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
If you look at this circuit
here effectively what have I

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
done?
Effectively what I've done is

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
apply the voltage V1 on one
input and a voltage V2 on the

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
other input.
V1 here.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
V2 here.
And the output is Y1 plus Y2.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
What I'm saying is look
backwards now.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
What I'm saying is that the
whole components of the output

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Y1 plus Y2 could individually be
derived in the following manner.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I could get the component Y1 by
simply applying one of the

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
voltages and setting the other
to zero.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I can get the other component
Y2 by setting yet another input

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
to zero and applying the voltage
V2 to get Y2.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And sum then up and that's my
answer.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
This will become a lot clearer
with an example.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Again, remember if I have a
bunch of inputs applied to a

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
circuit, V1, V2 and so on,
and I get some output then what

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
this is saying is that I can
alternatively find out the

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
answer by applying just one
voltage, setting all the others

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
to zero, measuring the output,
apply a second voltage,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
set all inputs to zero,
measure the output and sum of

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
applesauce and blueberry sauce
and there you get the answer.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Let's do an example.
And before we go into that I

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
talked about setting voltage
sources and current sources to

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
zero.
First of all,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000
what does it mean to set a
voltage source to zero?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:38.000
This is the same as this.
Setting a voltage source to

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:49.000
zero is simply replacing the
voltage source with a short,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:00.000
and setting a current source to
zero simply implies an open

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
circuit.
So when I say zero that source,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
if it's a voltage source short
it, if it's a current source

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
open it.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
I can take any two nodes in the
world and measure the potential

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
difference across them.
So there may be some potential

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
difference across these set by
the circuit that I haven't shown

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
you on this side.
There might be some other

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
circuit that is controlling the
voltage of these two nodes.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
The same with the short.
What's V going to be?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
But there is a V.
It's zero.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So that's method four,
method of superposition.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000
And this method says that the
output of a circuit --

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Again, remember I'm focusing on
linear circuits.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Remember, I have this
playground where LMD applies.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
And within that playground I'm
playing in the south goal area.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
In the south goal area,
in that subset of the

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
playground circuits are linear.
So in that part of the

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
playground superposition applies
because there circuits are

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000
linear.
So the output of a circuit is

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:42.000
determined by summing up the
responses to each source acting

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
alone.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Now, in this statement here
this source stands for

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
independent source.
I haven't talked about

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
independent versus dependent
sources.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
We'll talk about dependent
sources a few weeks from today.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
And just so you don't get
confused, for dependent sources

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
you will be looking at Section
3.3.3 of your course notes to

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
see how superposition works with
dependent sources.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
But remember we haven't covered
dependent sources yet.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
We will be covering them about
two weeks from now.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
So let's go back to our example
and apply the method of

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000
superposition to an example.
So the method says sum up the

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
outputs of each of the
sub-circuits where I'm applying

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
one source acting alone.
So let me just do this here.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Let me start with the circuit.
And let me start with shutting

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I off.
So I have voltage V --

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I have R2.
And I'm shutting I off.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
So I have replaced this with an
open circuit.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
So I is zero.
Let me call the node voltage eV

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000
to reflect that component of the
node voltage that arises due to

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
V acting alone.
And you should look at this

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
pattern here and very quickly be
able to write the answer for

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
patterns like this voltage,
the two resistors.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
That's called a resistive
divider.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
It will appear again and again
and again.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
And eV is simply V times R2
divided by R1 plus R2.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
That's still my ground node.
So the voltage here is simply

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
this voltage divided by the two
resistors to give you the

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
current multiplied by R2 to give
you the voltage across this R.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Remember this pattern.
You apply voltage divider

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
patterns probably more times
than any other pattern that you

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
might imagine.
So that's with the V acting

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
alone.
Now, let me do I acting alone.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
So for I acting alone --

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And what I do this time around
is replace this with a short,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
replace the voltage source to
the short.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And let me call this voltage eI
for the component of the voltage

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
due to the current I.
And eI, in this case,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
is simply given by yet another
pattern here,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
the current across a pair or
resistors is simply the

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
effective resistance multiplied
by the current so it's i and the

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
effective resistance is R1,
R2 or R1 plus R2.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
That's eI.
That's a component that node

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000
due to the current I.
Now, so the method says that.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Then take these components,
sum them up and there you have

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
the answer.
So E is simply ev plus ei.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
The components of V and I
acting alone,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000
just simply V times R2 divided
by R1 plus R2 plus R1,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
R2.
There we go.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Fortunately,
the fates have been kind to us

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
and the answer is the same as
the answer we obtained with the

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
node method.
No surprise here.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
So this is actually an
incredibly simple method.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
So you can take a very complex
circuit.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
What have you really done here?
You can take a very complex

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
circuit and you can solve a very
complex circuit by breaking it

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
down into many simple individual
sub problems.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
You will do this in EECS time
and time and time again.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Whether it's in software
systems or hardware systems or

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
what have you,
you're often times building

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
complicated systems.
Remember doom on this side?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
And the way and when you put
these things together,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
let's say a large software
system, is you don't write the

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
whole piece of software starting
main and grunge down.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
You build a lot of little
components and tie the

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
components together.
In the same manner here you

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
take a big circuit and you find
its behavior for each source

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
acting alone.
Lots of little inky dinky

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
simple little circuits.
And you will see examples in

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
your homework where you're given
a big circuit or because it set

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
all the Is to zero and the other
Vs to zero the whole circuit

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
almost vanishes and all that
you're left with is a little

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
resistor or two.
So this is the very,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
very powerful method.
I'd like to do a little

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
demonstration for you.
And what I'm going to show you

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:36.000
is the demo is a vat of water.
Actually, I'll tell you what it

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
is in a second.
But assume it is salt water for

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
now.
I'll apply two voltages.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
In this case I'm going to apply
a sinusoid.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000
That's not very good.
A sinusoid and a triangular

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
wave.
And what I'm going to do is

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
measure the response at this
site.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Now, this is a vat of salt
water.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
And I'm going to tell you it
behaves like a linear system.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
If you view each little
particle, or each little

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
cubic-centimeter or whatever of
water, it'll behave like little

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
resistor.
So this vat of salt water

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
behaves like big distributed
resistor in the following

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
manner.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
And so on.
This of this big mesh of little

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
resistors, but it's all
resistors.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
It's a linear circuit.
So I'm going to apply two

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
voltages, a triangular and a
sinusoid, and we're going to

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
observe the output.
And what do you expect to see

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
there?
You will see the superposition

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
of the two, which is you'll see
a sinusoid.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000
And then you'll see the jagged
triangular thing articulating

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000
the sinusoid pattern.
What I'm going to do right now,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
don't put any water yet.
This is the vat of nothing

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
right now.
It's all empty.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Can we show the screen on this
side?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
The oscilloscope screen?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
OK.
Oh, there you go.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
So this is the screen of the
oscilloscope now.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Notice that I have a sinusoid
and I have a triangular wave and

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
the output is zero.
And the reason is there is

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
nothing in this vat.
It's empty.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
So previously when I taught
this course I would get

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
saltwater and pour saltwater.
Then we discovered a much

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
better source of water that
conducted electricity like one

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
real mean fluid.
Cambridge water.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
It just works very pleasantly.
It just conducts electricity

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
like nothing at all.
And I've been thinking of using

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Charles River water next time
and see what happens,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
although there we'd probably
get some biological organisms

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
doing strange things at you.
But go ahead.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Our friendly demonstration
expert, Lorenzo,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
will pour some water into the
vat.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
And you should begin seeing the
output being a superposition of

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
the two.
So as he pours,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
there you go,
do you see that?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000
So you do see the sinusoidal
articulation and the jagged wave

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
form.
And just to have some more fun,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
what I can do is increase one
of the voltages.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And you'll see --

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Now you know what would have
happened if I had used Charles

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
River water.
So my output keeps increasing

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
as I increase the corresponding
wave form.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I could do this,
this is fun.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
So let me pause there and go
onto the next topic.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
So that little demonstration
showed you that even something

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
as simple as this physical
entity vat of water behaves like

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
a linear system,
and we can model that linear

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
system as a set of resistors.
Unbeknownst to you,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
right now, in the past ten
seconds I introduced a new

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
concept.
It's called subliminal

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
advertising.
So one of the things we do in

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
EE a lot is model real systems.
So often times if I wanted to

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
look at the behavior of salt,
behavior of a vat of water,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
I can model it as a set of
resistors for certain kinds of

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
activities.
Just hold that thought for some

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
time later in your careers.
All right.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
That's method four,
the superposition method.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Remember, it is methods like
this that will make your life

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
really, really,
really easy.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
If you find that you are having
to do a lot of grunging homework

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
or something,
just step back and think

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
superposition,
think Thevenin or think

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
composition rule.
There must be a simpler way

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
usually.
Let's do the next method.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
This is called the Thevenin
method.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000
To derive this method let me
start by applying superposition

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
to some circuit.
So let's say I have some

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000
arbitrary network N.
Assume it's a linear network

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
and the network has a whole
bunch of goodies in it.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000
It has a bunch of resistors,
it has a bunch of voltage

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:30.000
sources, and it has a bunch of
current sources.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Many current sources.
Many voltage sources.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Many resistors.
Some jumbled voltage sources,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
current sources and resistors.
And I look at two nodes in this

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
network.
Here are two nodes in the

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
network, two points in the
network were elements connect.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
I'm looking at those two nodes
and all I want to do is the

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
following.
I want to figure out if I take

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
a rinky-dinky little current
source and apply it there,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
all I want to figure out is
what is V and what is I.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
There is this mongo box out
here, a black box of resistors,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
voltage source and current
sources, too many to count.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
I pick two nodes,
apply a current source,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
and all I care about is what is
the voltage that I will measure

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000
by applying it here.
Notice the current here will be

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
I because the current here is I.
And I apply it here.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
I want to measure what the
voltage is.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Now, with the insight you've
obtained from superposition,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
you should be able to jump up
and state the form of the

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
answer.
So by superposition we know the

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
following.
We know that the effect of the

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
circuit will be the same as the
sum of components being added

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
up.
Sum of component,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
sum of component,
a bunch of components added up.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Each component will be the
response of one source acting

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
alone.
So if I can figure out the

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
effect of one source acting
alone and put that down here,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
and do the same thing for all
the sources, that's what I will

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
get.
So for the source Vm it's a

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
linear circuit.
So I know that my answer is

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
going to be, in the final answer
is going to be a Vm term and

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
it's going to be multiplied by
some alpha M term.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
I know that.
It's a linear circuit so I know

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
that the answer shall have a
term Vm multiplied by some

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
constant.
Simple, I know that.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Similarly, the same is true
for, oh, this is the term Vm.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
And what I can do is I can
measure just this effect by

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
setting all the other sources to
zero.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
So I can set all the other
current sources to zero and all

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
voltage sources,
except for this one,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
and I can get that answer.
So, similarly,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000
for every voltage source I am
going to get a term.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
So for every single voltage
source, M1, M2,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
M3 and so on I'm going to get
such a term and they're all

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
going to sum up.
Similarly, I'm going to get a

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
term for In.
And I know there will be an In

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
term, and I know it's going to
be some constant beta

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
multiplying In.
In this example of ours here,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
in this example,
remember alpha was this and

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000
beta was this constant here.
There's some constant beta,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
some constant alpha.
And because I have a whole

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
bunch of current sources there's
going to be such a term for each

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
one of them.
And each one of these terms,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Vm, In will be the voltage I
would see here if I set all the

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
other Vms to zero and I set all
the other current sources,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
except for that one to zero.
What am I missing?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Is that it?
The response here,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
V here.
Am I missing anything here?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Is that it?
Now, don't all yell at once.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
What am I missing?
Current source i,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
exactly.
So if I have a current source i

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
then there's an effect of this
current as well.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
And so I write down i there,
too.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
It's going to be some constant
multiplying I.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
And that constant is going to
look like a resistor,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
right, because this circuit
contains current sources,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
voltage sources and resistors.
If I've shorted all my voltage

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
sources and opened all my
current sources,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
what's left in here?
Just a whole caboodle full of

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Rs.
It's just going to look like

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
some resistance R.
And that's what I get here.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
So this is what V is going to
look like and that's a form.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
So let's take a look at these
components.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Let's focus on the easy part
first.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
What does this look like?
This component looks like an I,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
it looks like a current and has
some resistance.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
What is that resistance given
by?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Supposing I gave you this
network and this currency source

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
and I asked you tell me R.
How would you measure R?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
What you would do is open all
the current sources,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
short all the voltage sources,
put a ohmmeter in there and

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
measure the resistance R.
That's R.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
OK, so we understand this term.
What about this term here?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Can someone tell me the units
of this term here,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
this big thing here?
Voltage.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
This is a voltage.
This is a voltage.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
iR is a voltage.
So this does behave like a

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
voltage.
And it behaves like some

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
voltage V.
So notice that as far as this

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.000
current I is concerned the rest
of the universe looks like a

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:00.000
resistor and a voltage source
behaving in some manner.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
And let me just call it Vth for
now, and you'll know why in a

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
second.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
The voltage has a form,
some voltage plus Ri.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000
So, in other words,
as far as this I is concerned

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.000
this whole network here N full
of all the nice stuff is

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
indistinguishable to this I
here.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:50.000
So my I is sitting out there
injecting a current into two

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
nodes.
If I am i, I'm looking at this,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:03.000
this network looks no different
than a voltage source in series

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:11.000
with the resistor R.
Notice that the equation for

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:18.000
this simple circuit is this,
so I is given by V minus Vth

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
divided by R.
Just remember.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
It's a circuit.
In other words,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Agarwal sitting here cannot
tell the difference if I'm

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
measuring the voltage here
between a circuit that looks

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
like a Vth in series to the
resistor or this huge mess of

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
voltage sources and current
sources and so on.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Now, we will talk about Vth and
R.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
R is called the resistance of
the network as seen from the

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
port with all the sources shut
off.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
And similarly Vth,
what is Vth?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Vth is the open circuit
voltage.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
In other words,
if I apply the voltage here

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
this is the response of all the
current sources and all the

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
voltage sources acting together.
So it's as if I took this out

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
and simply measured my V here as
if I didn't exist,

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
correct?
Because this is the component

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
of i.
So if I opened i and measured

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
V, I would get that big term on
the left-hand side.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
That's my Vth.
So that inspires the next

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
method called the Thevenin
method.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
In this method what I'm going
to do is take some circuit,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
I'm on Page 9,
with a mess of stuff.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000
It's a big mess of stuff.
And if I care to look at its

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:20.000
impact on something else that I
add from the outside then as far

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
as the outside world is
concerned this is

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:32.000
indistinguishable from a circuit
that looks like this.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
So what I can do is if I want
to figure out what's happening

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
here then, for the purpose of my
analysis, this simple network

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
here with R and Vth becomes a
surrogate for this entire mess.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
So for the purpose of finding
out the behavior at this point,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
I can take this huge mess and
replace it with its Thevenin

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
surrogate or Thevenin
equivalent.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
This is called the Thevenin
equivalent of this big network.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Let me do an example that will
make the method completely

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
clear.
Again, remember in EECS,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
most of our lives are about how
can we make things so simple as

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
being able to be analyzed by
inspection?

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000
And so this is a method that
takes you further down that

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
path.
So let me use the same circuit

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
that I've been using before,
my voltage V,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
R1, R2.
This is an R.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:55.000
I'm 55 minutes fast so we have
another three or four minutes.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
So this is my circuit.
And let's say all I care about

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
is finding out i1.
That's all I care about.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to box this up and see if

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
I can replace that with its
Thevenin equivalent.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
So I'm going to box that up.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
What I'm saying is that I'm
going to box it up and replace

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
it with this Thevenin
equivalent.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
I don't know what Vth and R are
at this point.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
I'm just calling it Rth for
fun.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I don't know what these two
values are, but if I knew what

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
these two values were I can
determine I really trivially as

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
follows.
I can get i1 as simply V minus

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Vth divided by R1 plus Rth.
So if I knew Vth and Rth,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
I can write down i1 by
inspection in that manner.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
So next, finally,
how do I get Vth and Rth?

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000
You get Rth by looking at this
network and shutting off all the

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:29.000
voltage sources and measuring
the resistance there.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000
So I short my voltage source,
that's R1.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Oops, wrong way.
I need to look this way.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:51.000
So looking this way,
that's what I get.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
So what's Rth?
Rth is simply R2.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:05.000
So I have opened my current
source.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Similarly, for Vth,
remember all I want to do is

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
look at the two nodes,
step back, put a voltmeter

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
there, measure the voltage,
that's my open circuit voltage.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
So the way I do it is I take
the circuit and simply measure

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
the voltage there.
That's R2.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
That's my current capital I.
And I simply want to measure

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
the open circuit voltage here,
which is what?

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Just simply if I stand back and
I kind of gingerly measure the

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.000
voltage here without disturbing
anything, I simply get IR2.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
So Vth is IR2 and Rth is R2 and
here is the formula for the

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000
current in this branch when I
apply a voltage source and a

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
resistor R1 to this little
circuit here.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
OK, let's pause and let me
summarize this in about ten

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
seconds.
I had this circuit here.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
I wanted to find out i1.
So what I said I'd do is take

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
this complicated mess,
well, it's not a complicated

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
mess but assume it is,
and replace with it a

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
resistance Rth got by turning
off all the sources.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000
And the voltage in series,
Vth, which I get simply by

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
pulling this thing out,
taking my input,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
this part out and simply
measuring the open circuit

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
voltage out there,
Vth.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
And then I replaced the whole
network with this new network

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
that they call the Thevenin
network, and voila,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
I get the answer in a second.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:14.210
Consider a rod of
mass m, and suppose

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.900
I apply a force to this rod.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.550
Let's say a force like that.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.730
So we know that as a result of
that applied force, the center

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.430
of mass of the rod, which we can
imagine is right at the center

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.270
the rod, will translate
with some acceleration, such

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.220
that the vector f
is equal to the mass

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.470
of the rod times
the acceleration

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.450
of the center of mass.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.490
Now recall that
for a rigid body,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.880
this equation will be true
regardless of where on the rod

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.260
I apply the force.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.200
So for example, if I draw
the rod again over here,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.620
and I apply the same force,
vector f, but I apply it,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.380
let's say, on the
right hand side,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.260
I'll still have the
same f equals ma.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.820
All I specify with f is its
magnitude and direction.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.390
But for a rigid body, no
matter where on the body

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.930
I apply that force,
the acceleration

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.030
of the center of mass
will be the same.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.330
Now, we know from
experience, however,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.670
that the motion of
the rod is different

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.270
if I push it at the center at
one end or at the other end.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.430
The point is, though, that the
motion, the overall motion,

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.310
the overall translation
of the object

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.900
doesn't just involve
the translation

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.080
of the center of mass, but it
also involves some rotation,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.370
in general.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:51.360
So in fact, there is a theorem
called Chasles' theorem, which

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.680
tells us that the most general
displacement of a rigid body

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.289
can be split into
the translation

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.770
of the center of mass and
a rotation about the center

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.610
of mass.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.430
Our f equals ma
relation tells us

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.478
how an applied force affects the
first part of the translation

00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:10.020
of the center of mass.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.300
But how does that
applied force affect

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.510
the rotation of the rigid body?

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.820
We'll see that this depends
not only on the magnitude

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.030
and direction of the
force, but also on where

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.129
the force is applied, OK?

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.670
That's different
than the translation

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.740
of the center of
mass, which only

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.329
depends upon what the force is.

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.460
The rotation about
the center of mass

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.540
depends both upon the force
itself and where on the object

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.570
that it's applied.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.320
In fact, in the
next few lessons,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.220
we'll see that there's a
special equation of motion

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.750
for describing
rotational motion.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.790
It's analogous to Newton's
Second Law of Motion,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.079
analogous to f equals ma,
applying to rotational motion.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.540
And we write that relationship.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:03.470
Its rotational
equation of motion

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.160
is written as tau,
which is a vector,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.150
is equal to i times
alpha, which is a vector.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.880
So tau is a new quantity
we haven't talked

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.570
about before called the torque.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.470
It's a vector.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:35.480
i is the moment of inertia
that we've already encountered,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.980
and alpha is the
angular acceleration

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.840
of the rotational motion.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.990
Now, tau is a sort of
rotational analog to the force,

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.780
and it depends on not
just the force itself,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.900
but on where the
force is applied.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.290
Computing the torque, tau,
depends upon something

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.580
called a vector product
or a cross product.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.600
It's a way of multiplying
two vectors together

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.130
to produce a third vector.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.740
In that way, it's different
than the dot product or scalar

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.540
product that we
discussed earlier,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.329
where we multiply two
vectors together and get

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.310
a scalar or a pure number.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.589
This is a different
operation, the vector product

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:22.910
or cross-product.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.490
Torque is the first physical
quantity we've encountered,

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.330
but it won't be the last,
that involves a cross-product

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.420
in its definition.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.600
And so, before giving you a
formal definition of torque,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.100
we'll first review the
mathematics of cross-products,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.210
and we'll do that
in the next lesson.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.360
Now, the angular
acceleration, alpha,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.770
tells us about how the
rotational motion changes.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.170
Again, just like in
f equals ma, where

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.970
we could divide the two
sides of this equation

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.750
into dynamics and kinematics.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.830
Kinematics is telling us about
a geometrical description

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.750
of the motion, or the
translation of motion,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.160
and the dynamics f is
telling us about how

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.130
the applied forces cause
changes in the motion, changes

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.690
in the kinematics.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.380
Likewise, for rotational motion,
the angular acceleration,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.560
alpha, tells us
about the geometry

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.450
of the rotational
motion, and specifically

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.360
how the rotational
motion is changing,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.160
and the torque is telling us
about the application of forces

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.370
and how that causes changes
in the rotation of motion.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.580
So that leaves one
other quantity,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.680
which is the moment of inertia.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.940
And I want to talk about what
that means for just a moment.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:47.570
So the term "inertia," the
term "inertia" in physics

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.909
represents a resistance
to an applied force.

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.350
It tells us how difficult it is
to change an object's motion.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.380
So for example, suppose I
have two blocks, one of mass m

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.830
and another that's
10 times as massive.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.230
So 10m.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.170
Newton's Second
Law, f equals ma,

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.480
tells us that if I want
to accelerate the heavier

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.870
mass to the same rate that
I do with a smaller mass,

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.440
I'll need to apply a force
that's 10 times larger.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.490
So for translation
of motion, the mass m

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.630
represents the notion of
inertia, the resistance

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.560
to a force.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.150
It tells us how
much force we have

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.570
to apply to achieve a
certain change in motion.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.810
Now, for rotational
motion, that role

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.080
is played by the
moment of inertia i.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.110
That tells us how
difficult it is to change

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.100
the rotation of an object.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.020
If I increase the moment of
inertia by a factor of 10,

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.030
then I'll need a torque that
is 10 times larger in order

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.790
to achieve the same change
in rotational motion,

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.550
the same angular acceleration.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.110
But recall that our definition
of moment of inertia

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.260
for some rigid body
is, if I break up

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.780
the rigid body into a
bunch of little pieces,

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.840
and for each piece
I take the product

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.610
of the mass of that piece, delta
mj, times the perpendicular

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.340
distance of that piece
from the rotation

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.520
axis-- I call that
rj-- and if I sum

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.120
that over the entire object,
the entire body, that

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.050
gives me my moment of inertia.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.710
Well, so-- sorry,
this is r squared.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.900
So it's the mass of each
element times the distance

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.860
of the axis squared,
delta mj times rj squared.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.460
Now, I can increase the moment
of inertia by a factor of 10

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.514
by increasing the total
mass of the object,

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.930
but you can see
from this equation

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.480
that I can also do
it with the same mass

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.210
by changing the
location of the mass.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:05.420
If I increase the r's, if I
move the mass, the same mass,

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.240
but I move it to be farther
away from the rotation axis,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.510
that also achieves an increase
in the moment of inertia.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.060
So what that tells is that
for rotational motion,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.710
it's not just the amount
of mass that matters,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.766
but also how that
mass is distributed.

00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:24.170
OK, so in that sense,
rotational inertia

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.970
is different than
translational inertia.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.020
For translational motion,
all that matters is the mass.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.070
If I increase the mass
by a factor of 10,

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.530
then it will become
a factor of 10

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.210
more difficult to get
that object to accelerate.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.600
I need a factor of
10 larger force.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.080
But with rotational
motion, I can

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.679
increase the notion of inertia.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.700
I can make it more difficult to
change the rotation of motion

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.650
either by changing the
mass, by increasing it,

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.260
or by making the
distribution of mass

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.500
be further away from
the rotation axis.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.920
So as an example, imagine if you
were rolling a wheel up a hill.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.980
It's different if I have a
wheel whose mass is distributed

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.590
evenly over the whole
disk, or if I have

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.940
all of the mass in the rim.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.104
If all of the mass is in the
rim, then from this equation,

00:09:11.104 --> 00:09:13.520
we see the moment of inertia
is larger for the same amount

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.570
of total mass.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.980
And so it's much more difficult
to roll a wheel up the hill

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.410
if all of the mass
is in the rim than it

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:26.060
is if the mass is distributed
evenly over the wheel.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.080
So our rotational equivalent
to Newton's Second Law

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.410
is, tau equals i
alpha, the torque

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.520
equals the moment of inertia
times the angular acceleration.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.800
In the next few lessons, we'll
see how torque is defined,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.730
and we'll derive this expression
for the dynamics of rotation

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.190
of motion and see
how to apply it.

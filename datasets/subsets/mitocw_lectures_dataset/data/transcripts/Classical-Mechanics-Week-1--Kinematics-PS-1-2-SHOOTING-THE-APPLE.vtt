WEBVTT

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.640
PROFESSOR: So in
this example, we

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
want to hit an apple hanging
from a tree with a projectile.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.220
And the main point
of the problem

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.490
is to figure out at
what angle to the ground

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.430
should we aim our projectile
when we fire it off

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.690
in order to hit the apple.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.220
And in this example,
we're assuming

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.920
that the apple drops from
the tree at the same instant

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.660
that we fire the projectile.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.570
So in this drawing, let's just
put some dimensions in here,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.520
we'll assume that
the apple starts out

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.400
at a height, h,
above the ground.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.640
That the horizontal
distance from where

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.180
the projectile starts to
the apple is a distance, d.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.925
That the projectile starts at a
distance, s, above the ground.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.320
And that we fire the projectile
off with an initial velocity,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.690
v0, at an angle theta, sorry,
theta not, with respect

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.400
to the horizontal.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.400
And let's define our origin to
be right here on the ground,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.604
directly below where
the projectile begins.

00:01:17.604 --> 00:01:19.270
We need to define our
coordinate system,

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.550
so the i-hat direction will
be horizontally to the right,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.340
and the j-hat direction
will be vertically upwards

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.410
with an origin at this point.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.840
So the question that
we have is, what

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.450
should our angle,
theta0 b, in order

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.936
to hit the apple,
which starts falling

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:39.310
from the tree at
the same instant

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.050
that we fire our
projectile, and we

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.860
want to hit the apple
before it hits the ground.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.960
OK so to work this out,
we need to consider

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.260
the kinematics of two separate
objects, our projectile

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.610
and the apple.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.150
So let's begin with the apple.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.200
So for our apple, the apple
drops vertically straight

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.720
downwards, so its horizontal
position throughout its motion

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.850
is just unchanged.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.650
So the x-coordinate of the
apple as a function of time

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.400
is just d, it's just a constant.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.050
It's y-coordinate, it
starts out at a height, h,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.060
and then it drops due to
the acceleration of gravity,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.300
and so that's given by
minus 1/2 gt-squared.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.830
It's a minus because it's
falling in the minus j-hat

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.132
direction.

00:02:37.132 --> 00:02:39.090
Now for our projectile,
let's call it a bullet.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:49.640
For our bullet, the
x-coordinate of the bullet,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.300
it starts out at the
origin, at x equals zero.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.350
And its initial motion, it
has an initial velocity, v0,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.200
in this direction.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.120
The horizontal
component of that is

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.210
v0 times the cosine of theta0.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.880
And so it's displacement
of time t is v0 t times

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.976
the cosine of theta 0.

00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:11.600
And there's no
horizontal acceleration,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.390
so that completes
our x-coordinate

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.920
as a function of time.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.690
For our y-coordinate,
we start out

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.400
at a height, s,
above the ground.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.220
There is the change
in the y-coordinate

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.390
due to the initial velocity,
which has component v0 sine

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:38.090
theta0, so that's plus
v0 t sine theta 0.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.310
And there's also a
vertical acceleration

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.910
due to gravity, which gives
us minus 1/2 gt-squared.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.570
OK so that's the kinematics
of the apple and the bullet.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:58.659
Now for there to be a hit
at time t equals capital-t,

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.450
the coordinates of the
apple and the bullet

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.960
have to be the same at
that collision time.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:13.330
So for a hit at t
equals big T, we

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.410
require that the x-coordinate
of the bullet at time big T

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.680
is the same as the
x-coordinate of the apple.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.860
And likewise, that the
y-coordinate of the bullet

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.460
is equal to the
y-coordinate of the apple.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.920
OK so let's look at
each of these in turn.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.640
For our x-coordinate, the
x-coordinate of the bullet

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.820
is v0 capital-T times
the cosine of theta 0.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.200
And that has to be equal
to the x coordinate

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.790
of the apple, which is just d.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.970
So notice that I can solve this
for the time of the collision,

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.740
capital-t, and that's
just d minus v0 times

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.760
the cosine of theta 0.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.700
Now for our y-coordinate, the
y-coordinate of the bullet

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.840
is s plus v0 capital-T
time is the sine of theta

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.830
not minus 1/2 gt
squared and that's

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.100
equal to the y-coordinate
of the apple, which

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.290
is h minus 1/2 gt squared.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.940
All right, now I
can rearrange that.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.127
Notice that I have a minus
1/2 gt squared on both sides,

00:05:43.127 --> 00:05:43.960
so those cancel out.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.090
I can rearrange that to write
v0 times capital-T times

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:56.320
the sine of theta 0
is equal to h minus s,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:04.310
so that the sine of theta 0
is equal to h minus s over v0

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.180
capital T. But remember we
solved for capital-T here,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.000
so I can substitute that in.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.610
So that gives me h minus
s over v0 times 1 over t,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:33.700
which is v0 cosine
theta 0 over d.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:42.910
And so I can rewrite that
as h minus s over d times

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.790
to cosine of theta 0.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.080
So rewriting that, I have
on the left hand side,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.150
sine of theta 0 over
cosine of theta 0

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.860
is equal to h minus s over d.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.950
And notice on the left
hand side, sine over cosine

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:08.640
is just tangent, so this is
just the tangent of theta 0.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.970
Now think about what that means.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:20.380
If I draw a right triangle
where this is theta 0,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.510
then this is h minus
s and this is d.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.270
And so this is the same
geometry we have here,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.980
if we drew the
triangle like this.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.520
So theta 0 is just the angle
to the location of the apple

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.570
just before it drops.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.140
So what this
calculation tells us

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.640
is that the correct thing to
do if we want to hit the apple,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.014
if we know the apple is going
to drop at the same instant

00:07:44.014 --> 00:07:47.310
that we fire, then we
should aim at the location

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.100
that the apple is
at that instant.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.310
We shouldn't try and lead
the apple and fire below it

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.130
or fire above it, we should
aimed directly at the apple.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.200
And what the
kinematics shows us is

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.730
that both the
bullet and the apple

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.750
fall vertically down
at the same rate.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.820
And so that will
give us a collision.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.670
Now it's worth thinking
about two different cases,

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.960
which I'm not going
to solve for you here.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.880
The first is, what if
the apple didn't drop?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.110
Suppose the apple just stayed
in the tree and I fired.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.602
If I aimed directly at the
apple and the apple didn't drop,

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:24.810
then I would miss the apple,
because the bullet would

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.280
drop as it went across
this distance, d.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.320
Now of course if the
apple were big enough,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.470
or if the bullet were
flying fast enough,

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.340
if v 0 was fast
enough, then it might

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.325
be that the amount
of the bullet dropped

00:08:40.325 --> 00:08:42.450
wouldn't be bigger than
the thickness of the apple,

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.130
so I might still
graze the apple,

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.110
but I wouldn't hit
the apple dead center.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.122
So if I knew that the
apple wasn't going to drop

00:08:49.122 --> 00:08:50.580
and I wanted to
hit it dead center,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.694
I would have to choose some
different angle, theta 0.

00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:55.860
We can sort of see intuitively
that that angle would

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.850
have to be a little bit steeper
so that the bullet would drop

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.855
and then hit the apple.

00:09:00.855 --> 00:09:02.460
And so the way we
would solve that is

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.040
in our original
kinematic equations.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.520
For the motion of the
apple, x would still

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.190
be a constant, d, but
if the apple wasn't

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.700
dropping then y of the apple
would also be a constant.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.800
We wouldn't have the second
term, we would just have y

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.150
equals h.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.236
And then I would have to
solve for a collision.

00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:22.860
The other case to
think about, that I'd

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.590
like you to think about,
is what if the apple

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.880
begins dropping for a short
interval before we fired.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.400
So that at the time that
we fire our projectile,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.665
the apple is already dropping.

00:09:34.665 --> 00:09:36.840
Well that's equivalent
to saying that at time

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.180
equals 0, when I
fire, that the apple

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.280
has some initial
velocity, whatever

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.800
velocity it's picked
up by dropping

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.880
and whatever interval
it was dropping before.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.050
So now, my kinematics
for my apple

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.670
in the vertical
direction, I would

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.940
have an additional term
here, a minus v0 t,

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.020
where v0 is that
initial velocity.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.632
And that's a
different v0, I should

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.840
have used a different symbol.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.756
It's a different v0 than
the v0 of the bullet,

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:05.610
but there would be an initial
velocity, falling velocity,

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.780
of the apple that
I'd have to consider.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.739
So the particular details of
what's happening with the apple

00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:12.280
change the kinematics,
and it's worth

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.140
thinking about how that
would change your answer.

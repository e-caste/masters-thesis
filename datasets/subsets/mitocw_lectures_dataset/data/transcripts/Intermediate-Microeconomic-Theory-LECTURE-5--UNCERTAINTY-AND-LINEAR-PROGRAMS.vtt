00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.940 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well,
greetings everyone.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:84%
First of all, in terms
of the reading list,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:84%
today we're going to
finish the two, three

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:84%
things I deliberately didn't
do at the end of the lecture

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:84%
on firms and production sets,
which was largely Kreps,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:90%
but with plenty of stuff added.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I should say the stuff that's
added is largely anticipating

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
an application we got
to at the end, which

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:84%
is the impact of tariffs and
so on, on economic welfare.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So you'll have the tools
at the time we get there,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
although we will also
provide some reminders.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is,
although it's not starred,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.832 align:middle line:90%
there are these things about--

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
other things on the
reading list, which are not

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
starred in this case, about
the great Japanese earthquake.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- I'm going to
talk about that momentarily,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
but I know everyone's
quite busy,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and there's plenty of
required things to do.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you get a chance, I'm
sure you actually would enjoy

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:90%
taking a look at that article.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Today, the main thing I want
to draw your attention to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
is decision making under
uncertainty and also

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:90%
linear programs.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And that material
is largely coming

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:84%
from Nicholson and
Schneider, although it

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:84%
does have some material
that was moved relative

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:90%
to earlier years.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:84%
As you will see,
this Medville, which

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
is short for the medieval
village economy--

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:84%
several of the slides
today have material

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:84%
on that from that book,
which you therefore

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:90%
might find helpful.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the study guide,
we have some questions here.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And let me try
something a bit new--

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:90%
but nevertheless, let me try.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Armando, could you take
a crack at this one--

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:84%
define increasing, decreasing,
and constant returns

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.695 align:middle line:90%
to scale and production?

00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so first,
constant return to scale

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
means that if you
double the inputs,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:90%
you get double the outputs.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Increasing means that efficiency
increases as we scale it up,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:84%
so if you double
the inputs, you get

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:90%
more than double the outputs.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And decreasing is that
if you double the inputs,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:90%
you would get less than double.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, that's fair.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.885 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty good answer.

00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle line:84%
We can define these
things in various ways.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
They're all equivalent
with one another.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.415 align:middle line:90%
The way you did it is fine.

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And in some respects,
the definitions

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:84%
are the reverse of
what you would expect.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Decreasing returns to scales
means that if you pick any--

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
if you pick zero and any
other point in the production

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.480 align:middle line:84%
possibilities set, and then
pick alpha between 0 and 1,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:84%
that that point is also
in the production set.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I say it's weird,
because decreasing--

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
scaling back as opposed

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
to doubling and moving forward,
but it's the same definition

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.560 align:middle line:84%
because you do
get that curvature

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
in the production set, and
likewise for increasing

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:90%
returns.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, that's good.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.670 align:middle line:84%
All right, I marked
a few of these.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to do all of them.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
How would you prove
that maximized profits

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:84%
are homogeneous of
degree 1 in prices p?

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Caleb, if I'm saying
your name correctly--

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Aulins?

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.315 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sorry,
what was the question?

00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Prove
that maximized profits

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:84%
are homogeneous of
degree 1 and prices p.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:84%
How would you go
about proving that?

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Do you recall
what homogeneous of degree 1

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:90%
means?

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: No.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK, so
homogeneous of degree 1

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:84%
means that if you increase every
element of the price factor

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
by a constant that
maximized profits,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.033 align:middle line:90%
increased by that same constant.

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:49.575 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:04:49.575 --> 00:04:51.873 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.873 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Do
you feel comfortable

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.405 align:middle line:84%
taking a crack at
the rest of this?

00:04:57.405 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure
what the answer is.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK,
all right, that's fine.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Wang Ping-- and correct me if
I'm saying your names wrong.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure I am.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: In the future,
you can just call me Andy.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Andy, OK.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.462 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:16.462 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's the
A in your middle initial.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.295 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:19.295 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
OK, so let's see.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to try
the same question?

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.650 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Sure,
yeah, so homogeneity

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:84%
means basically, if
we double the prices,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:90%
then we also double the profit.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Right.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Right, so I believe
that profit function is

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
equal to-- is p.z, where z
is the production vector.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And so if we double
the price p, if we double the--

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:84%
if we double the
production, so if we

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
maintain the same
production vector,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
z, then we can guarantee that
we at least double the profits.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But if we were
able to do better,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:84%
then we could then
halve the prices again

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:90%
and obtain a better--

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
basically, a better production
for the original price level.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, the optimal
profits at the doubled prices

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.980 align:middle line:84%
must exactly equal twice the
value at the regular prices.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Right, I think
that's the correct answer.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
The way I like to think
about it is if we--

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
graphically, if we were doubling
the price of every component

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
of the price vector,
p, then we're

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:84%
not changing the slope
of those isoprofit lines.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the tangency with
the production possibilities

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
frontier would be
the same point.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the z,
as in p.z is not moving.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Great, thank you.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:90%
And let's try just one more.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
What is the definition
of an isoquant?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:90%
So Ke Qiu--

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I think the
definition of isoquant

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
is like, there was a
set of input boundaries

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
which, given the
productivity, they

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.725 align:middle line:84%
will output the same
level of output y--

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
all input bounders which produce
the same level of output.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yes that's correct.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Great, thank you.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I was too ambitious and
I marked off too many of these.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I sort
of choose at random.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:84%
In this case, this morning,
I just marked a few of them.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at the other ones.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
As always, these review
questions are for your benefit,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:90%
for the class.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm only calling on you
now instead of just taking

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
volunteers because I
like class participation,

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:31.769 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a reminder to try
to keep up rather than having

00:08:31.769 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
to make up lost ground
later, when you're studying

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:90%
for the midterm or something.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:84%
If you keep up with the
class, you'll be fine.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let me go to lecture
4 and talk a little bit

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:84%
about three related
examples of production

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I featured in the lecture,
the example of trade.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But here are some
others that actually

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
do relate to what we will get
to at the end of lecture 5

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
First off, I want to talk about
Leontief input-output matrices.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So Leontief's view of
the economy's production

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
possibilities was interesting,
albeit a bit simple.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Suppose there are three sectors,
for example, as in this matrix.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:84%
You have a sector representing
raw materials, which

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:84%
could be agriculture,
or mining, and so on,

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and a sector
representing services,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
which would be retailing,
advertising, transportation,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
lawyers, real estate agents,
and financial services--

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:90%
could go on and on.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And manufacturing, which I guess
is pretty self explanatory--

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
this entire page
of lecture is just

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:90%
meant to be representative.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you can have
many particular rows,

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
depending on your
willingness to disaggregate

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
further and further into
in more and more detail.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So this matrix, what it's
saying is the motivation

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:84%
for this is you have
some final demand,

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and how much would
you need to produce

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:90%
to satisfy the final demand?

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
You could have final
demand for services,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:84%
but the problem with that is
that's the final demand, not

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:90%
all the intermediate demands.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Services are in turn
used in other sectors.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
column here represents

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:84%
that to produce $1
worth of services--

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
services are used in other
sectors, as in this row.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Services show up in
producing raw materials,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.090 align:middle line:84%
services show up in
producing services

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:84%
because of that
aggregation problem,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:90%
and get used in manufacturing.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, if you
go down the column,

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
to produce $1 worth
of services, you

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:84%
need $0.04 worth
of raw materials,

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:84%
$0.03 worth of services, and
$0.01 worth of manufacturing.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can see,
its input-output--

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
these are both in some
sense direct outputs,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.280 align:middle line:84%
but also indirect inputs
into other sectors.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
This is a version, by
the way, of the question

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:90%
having to do with aggregation.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Last time, we had a slide
showing two goods, x and y,

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.170 align:middle line:90%
or was it Y1 and Y2.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And one used Y1 as
an input and used Y2,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and the other industry used
Y2 as an input to produce Y1.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:90%
That was decreasing returns.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:84%
This is linear constant
returns, because everything here

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:04.550 align:middle line:84%
is linear, but it is the same
idea of inputs and outputs.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So we take this information
in the input-output matrix

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and summarize it in a
matrix A, and here we're

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
just reproducing these row
column elements exactly.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the problem is we have
final demands, which are given,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
which is a three
dimensional column vector.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And it tells us how
much we're going

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to need to end up delivering
either to consumers

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:84%
or for exports, of
raw material services

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and manufactured
goods, in that order.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we think about
these equations here,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.240 align:middle line:90%
we want to produce x.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to
figure out how much

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
to produce if we want to meet
the final demands of 400, 200,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and 600.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to that,
some of that output

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
gets used in turn as
inputs, and is not

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:84%
available for consumer
and export demands.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So the key equation here would
be, if we need to produce x,

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:84%
but we lose a times x
because some of that output

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
gets used as
inputs, then we have

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to produce i minus a times X.
I is the identity matrix here.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:90%
So it just picks up the same--

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:84%
it is 1 on the diagonal
and 0 on the off diagonal.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:14:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So for example, ia would
just give you x back,

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:84%
as if you didn't have
to use things as inputs.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Ax, that we've been going
through here, gives you--

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to produce
x, how much of that

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
x gets used up in producing
services, raw materials,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:90%
and manufacturing?

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And what's left, I minus a times
x, should just equal demand.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is a linear equation in
the control variables, namely

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.090 align:middle line:90%
x.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:90%
And also, demands are given.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Although to
anticipate a bit, you

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:84%
might think there's some
trade off in demands,

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:84%
or maybe some linear
combination of demands is fine,

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:90%
not just specific numbers.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you could
imagine maximizing demand,

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:84%
but in any event subject
to this constraint.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Here, it's simpler.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:84%
We're just given
the demands, and we

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:84%
have to produce x in such a
way as to meet the demand.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is a linear system
of linear equations.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember a
little matrix algebra,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.860 align:middle line:84%
all we need to do is to invert
this matrix, in minus a,

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
which eliminates
it on both sides--

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
on the left hand side, and puts
it on to the right hand side.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So the x solution we want
is i minus a times dx.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So I going to say in this
case, you can go back up

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
this was 0.2, so i--

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:90%
1 minus 0.2 is 0.98, and so on.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Nothing gets subtracted
on the off diagonal,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:90%
because i is 0 there.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So as long as this is what
we would call a non singular

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:84%
matrix, that the
rows and columns are

00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:84%
independent of each other, one
is not a multiplicative factor

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
of any of the other two,
then this inverse exists

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:90%
and we can solve the problem.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can see although it
should be intuitive by now

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:84%
that they need to produce more
than the 400 of raw materials.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:90%
They need to produce 449.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, these were denoted
in billions, and likewise,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:84%
how much more of each relative
to the exogenously given demand

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:84%
actually depends in a pretty
complicated way on that matrix

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:90%
A, in the following sense.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:84%
To produce a unit
of services, one

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:84%
has to take into account
the inputs of manufacturing

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:90%
and raw materials.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:84%
But to produce manufacturing
and raw materials,

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:84%
one has to take into account
that they too utilize services,

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.883 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:17:07.883 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And actually, you
can kind of keep

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:90%
going back into the matrix.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:84%
Another way to write
the system of equations,

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:84%
actually, to get the
inverse, is to successively

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:24.190 align:middle line:84%
plug-in first approximation,
second approximation,

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:84%
third approximation as
you take into account

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:33.940 align:middle line:84%
more and more of the
layers of the interaction.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So you could have a sector
which doesn't contribute

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.680 align:middle line:84%
much to final demand, but
is crucial as an input

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:90%
into the other two sectors.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So that sector could
have a high importance,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
even though it's not
directly satisfying

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:90%
the demand of itself.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So then we come to Google, and
in particular their algorithm.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
When you type in a keyword,
it pops up in a rank order

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
the most likely things
that are related

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:90%
to what you just searched for.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:84%
This was invented by
Sergey Brin and Larry Page.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes wonder if
people's last names are not

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:84%
predictors of their
eventually careers,

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Larry Page being one of
the fathers of PageRank,

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, that algorithm is
really based on the same ideas

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that underlie Leontief's ranking
of industries, which is you

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Google up something,
and it may be

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that there's an article
that you might not

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.940 align:middle line:84%
have thought to be the
most important one,

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
because it may not seem to
answer the question directly.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it's
the key article

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that started it all, that
has been cited and used

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:84%
by other things that are more
directly linked to the Google

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:90%
item that you're searching for.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And this display is not
by sectors of industries,

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:90%
but just by a network diagram.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.020 align:middle line:84%
You can see these
things directly related

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
via pathways to things in
the center, these outliers

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:90%
or clusters.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets very
thin, but they could end up

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
being important
because they're related

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:90%
to things in the interior.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
These things are ranked
by distance, actually,

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
reordered in order
for the diagram

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:84%
to display the
degree of closeness.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And they-- Page and
those guys actually

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
cited on Leontief
and output matrix.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And then as a final
example, the Great East

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Japanese earthquake--

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:84%
to remind you, there was an
earthquake, a big one, and then

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:90%
a subsequence tidal wave.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
coastline I think

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:84%
subsided by a meter, or
some outrageous amount.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And so in came the tidal
wave, doing a lot of damage.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is highlighting
the damaged structures.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is highlighting
the headquarters

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
of firms whose headquarters'
location was destroyed

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
in the immediate aftermath of
the earthquake and tsunami.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the Fukushima
nuclear power plant

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
was right there,
adding to the mix.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:90%
So then we move over here.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:84%
This is all of the
main island of Japan.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is the area that's
highlighted, the small area

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.900 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we ask, as
an input-output sense,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
which industries had been
supplying to headquarters which

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:58.070 align:middle line:84%
is not per se just where all
the management is, but like

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.140 align:middle line:90%
the primary production facility.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.810 align:middle line:84%
You have inputs supplying to
General Motors, for example,

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:90%
in Detroit.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
You have tire manufacturers
that are linked-- this is Japan.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have input suppliers
linked to headquarters,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.650 align:middle line:90%
or intermediate.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, in principle, it's
not just inputs from upstream,

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:90%
but outputs downstream.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.220 align:middle line:84%
The disruption here means
you can't produce something

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.880 align:middle line:84%
which is in turn supplied
downstream, quote unquote,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:90%
to others.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So the first order connection,
as in the PageRank,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:90%
are these areas in red.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And now, we've
covered all of Japan,

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:84%
because there's either an
immediate input supplier

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
or output purchaser
indirectly damaged

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.005 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of the
first degree, again,

00:21:44.005 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that's the primary
area of damage.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:84%
This is second degree
damage, A linked to B,

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.960 align:middle line:90%
who was hit with C, and so on.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, as you go in this
case down to the fifth order,

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.590 align:middle line:90%
most of Japan was covered.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this
Japanese earthquake

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
caused a drop in national
level GDP of about 1.5%.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It is, though, just
another illustration

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:90%
of the same mathematics.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So now, with some
trepidation, let

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.300 align:middle line:84%
me go to lecture 5
and verify that you

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:84%
can see this on your screens
as I move through it.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can see it right?

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is decision
making under uncertainty,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll get back
to some of our techniques,

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
in particular programming,
linear programming.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's suppose
we have a lottery,

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and there are little n distinct
prizes, possibly zero, possibly

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:90%
negative if it takes money away.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So these X's are the amount
of the winnings or losings,

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
if that even turns
up in the lottery.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
There are n possible
things that can happen,

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and they happen with
these probabilities

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:04.190 align:middle line:84%
pi, pi1 being the probability
that the gains or losses is

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
in the order of x1,
pi2 for x2, and so on.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a lottery,
the probabilities

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:90%
themselves are not negative.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:90%
They're 0 or positive.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
comprehensive lottery,

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
choosing over this vector
of possible outcomes,

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.460 align:middle line:84%
so the probabilities
add up to 1.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the lottery is
a well-defined random variable,

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
with these n distinct
realizations.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And we can call the
expectation of the lottery,

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
the expected outcome
of the lottery

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.470 align:middle line:84%
of the random
variable capital X,

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
just to be the weighted
average of the outcomes

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
where the weights are
these probabilities.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So part of this--
these next few slides

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
have to do with the ideas of
lotteries over discrete items.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Part of the next few
slides are quick reviews

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:84%
of some basic ideas
and statistics.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Here's a basic idea
from statistics.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:84%
If we have a random
variable, capital X,

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:84%
when we want to talk about its
variability or its variance,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:84%
denoted is sigma squared X,
that is just the dispersion of X

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.010 align:middle line:84%
around the mean, mu X.
Mu X was defined here

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:26.140 align:middle line:84%
in the previous slide
as the mean squared.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:90%
So we square the differences.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:84%
If X were equal to its
mean, this would be 0.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The further away
it is, the higher

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:90%
the squared value would be.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Expectation again
means that we're just

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:43.080 align:middle line:84%
taking weighted averages, with
the weights being these pi I

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.290 align:middle line:90%
probabilities.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So this would be the
formal expression.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:84%
The variance is
the proxy for risk.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.710 align:middle line:84%
The square root
of the variance is

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:90%
called the standard deviation.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to normalize
it so we can interpret

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:84%
the units of it without
knowing the magnitudes

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:84%
of the underlying variable,
we divide by its mean.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So the standard deviation
divided by the mean

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
is called the
coefficient of variation.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by normalizing
isn't just that we're dividing,

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
but the reason
for dividing-- you

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:84%
could well imagine if we
have two random variables

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and one is twice the other
one, then all the values

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:84%
are doubled, and the measure of
the dispersion will go up too.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So if we wanted to
measure variability,

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of independent of
the scale of the underlying

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:90%
random variable itself.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:90%
One more slide on statistics--

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
so suppose the prize has two
dimensions, X and Y, not just

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:84%
the winning and losings
of dollars, but maybe

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:90%
two different commodities.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So a particular
realization or outcome

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
would be a specification
of both the value of X

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and the value of Y Xi,
Yi for realization i.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Realization i happens
with probability pi i,

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:10.870 align:middle line:90%
which is the same as before.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, though, we can
define the covariance

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.590 align:middle line:84%
between two random
variables, x and y,

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
to be the expectation of
the product subtracting off

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.400 align:middle line:90%
the means.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So X plus its mean uX,
times Y minus its mean uY.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't write it out,
but you could just sum it up

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:36.150 align:middle line:84%
over the same pi is instead
of writing the expectation

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:90%
operator.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:84%
It tells you whether
the variables x and y

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:84%
are moving together or moving
in opposite directions.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when
a high value of X

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:84%
corresponds with
a high value of Y,

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:84%
thinking collectively about
these realizations Xi or Yi,

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:84%
then this covariance
is positive.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, if a
high x means a low y,

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:84%
the covariance
would be negative.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:84%
You could think about
plotting the Xi, Yi variables

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
as in a cloud and
trying to figure out

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:84%
if the cloud is running
on the 45 degree line

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.490 align:middle line:84%
or running in the
reverse direction,

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.600 align:middle line:90%
from northwest to southeast.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's useful to normalize,
so we take that covariance

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and just divide it by the
product of the variance, called

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:90%
the correlation.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And correlations are
by construction going

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:90%
to be between minus 1 and 1.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So again, 0 means no
correlation, 1 means perfect

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
correlation, positive
direction, n minus 1,

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:90%
means negative correlation.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three
statistical review slides,

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to come
back to them momentarily.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:84%
They're all defined
for random variables,

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.200 align:middle line:84%
but we defined a random
variable by first thinking

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:90%
about a lottery.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's come back
to the lottery.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Here, in fact, the underlying
ingredients are x1 and x2,

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
but they can only take on
a finite number of values.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:84%
These dots represent a discrete
point, and this commodity space

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:84%
here, the values of x1 and
x2, which are feasible,

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
this is not a convex space,
because you can easily

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:84%
find lines between
any two of these dots.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And intermediate points on the
line other than the end point

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:90%
are not in this consumption set.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:90%
So this is a non-convex set.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Back to the lottery
interpretation,

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:84%
lets call, say, Cs a particular
realization or state or point

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:90%
in the commodity space--

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and capital C. S denotes the
set of all possible states.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just counting
up the number of dots

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.460 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing on this picture.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if there are
capital S dots or states,

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:84%
each state corresponds to
a particular consumption

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:20.710 align:middle line:84%
bundle in R2, and we can
call pi S the probability

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:84%
of being in state S. So we could
have a lottery over this space.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:31.690 align:middle line:84%
If we define those lotteries,
a particular lottery

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:84%
would put a non-negative
probability, perhaps 0,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:90%
on any particular state.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And the sum of the probabilities
over all the states

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.440 align:middle line:90%
would have to add up to 1.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's a particular lottery.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.070 align:middle line:84%
The set of all possible
lottery is the set

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:84%
of all probabilities pi that
satisfy these two characters

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:90%
called, call it capital Pi.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:90%
It's also called a simplex.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:84%
By definition, a
simplex is a set

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:84%
where each element
is non-negative,

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and all the elements
add up to 1.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So a lottery satisfies the
definition of a simplex.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Other things do, too.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:17.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this becomes the
new commodity space, not

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:84%
the set of underlying
points, but the set

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:21.370 align:middle line:90%
of lotteries on those points.

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, we now
can define preferences

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:84%
with this squiggly
script inequality

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
over the set of
possible lotteries.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to use
is von Neumann Morgenstern

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.960 align:middle line:84%
expected utility,
which is quite natural.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's saying, take
a particular point

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Cs in that space, take the
underlying utility of it--

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.070 align:middle line:90%
which we've been using before.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Take the probability
of that state

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and then sum it up over
all possible states

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and define this
expected utility.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So these are the underlying
real value numbers

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:90%
of deterministic utility.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.110 align:middle line:84%
This object over
here on the left

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:10.030 align:middle line:84%
is the expected utility for
a particular lottery pi.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And the idea now is that
all possible lotteries

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.590 align:middle line:84%
can be ranked by this
expected utility criterion.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's just note in passing
that this expected utility

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.660 align:middle line:84%
criterion is linear in
the choice objects, which

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.310 align:middle line:90%
are the lotteries.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
These u of Cs things become
coefficients, real numbers.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.730 align:middle line:84%
But we're not varying the
underlying commodity points.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.060 align:middle line:90%
So these become fixed numbers.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that we're
interested in varying

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.610 align:middle line:84%
would be the probabilities
that constitute the lottery.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So the objective function is
linear in the probabilities.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:84%
There are some criteria we
need to satisfy in order

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.470 align:middle line:90%
to rank using expected utility.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
What we want to get
at the end of the day

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:03.760 align:middle line:84%
is that a lottery pi is strictly
preferred to a lottery pi

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:84%
prime, if the expected
utility under pi

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:84%
is strictly greater than the
expected utility under pi

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.690 align:middle line:90%
prime.

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:17.300 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, we need
three axioms, these three.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:90%
The first combines two--

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:90%
cheating a bit.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Completeness says
that all lotteries can

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.630 align:middle line:90%
be ranked and give us a number.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And transitivity, I
think you can see,

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:84%
is going to be satisfied,
because if A is preferred to B,

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.360 align:middle line:84%
lottery pi is preferred
to lottery pi prime,

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and pi prime is preferred
to pi double prime.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Under the preference
ordering, we

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.230 align:middle line:84%
can map those
preference orderings

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:54.420 align:middle line:84%
into these expected
utility objects,

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:59.030 align:middle line:84%
which are just real numbers
that satisfy transitivity.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So those are intuitive
properties, completeness

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.990 align:middle line:90%
and transitivity.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Here's something
called independence.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Take two lotteries of focus,
denoted pi and pi prime,

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and say that pi is weakly
preferred under that expected

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.050 align:middle line:90%
utility ordering to pi prime.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Then it has to be true that
some alpha weighted lottery--

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.750 align:middle line:84%
this is a lottery,
pi is a lottery.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.300 align:middle line:90%
And pi prime is a lottery.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And pi triple prime
is also a lottery.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So now we're taking compound
probabilities, if you like,

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.660 align:middle line:84%
when we take the alpha weighted
sum of the lottery pi and pi

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.440 align:middle line:90%
prime.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.880 align:middle line:84%
If alpha were, say,
equal to 1, then we're

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.692 align:middle line:84%
already given that pi is
weakly preferred to pi prime,

00:33:59.692 --> 00:34:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and that would be an equivalent
statement on the right hand

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.020 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.230 align:middle line:84%
If alpha is less
than 1, however,

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
then we're putting some weight
on this extraneous third

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.580 align:middle line:84%
lottery, pi double prime, and
the notion of independence

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:18.199 align:middle line:84%
means that whatever this
other lottery looks like,

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:21.199 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
for fixed alpha

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to weighting
pi and pi double--

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.790 align:middle line:90%
weighting the composite lottery.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Because each one of
these, The second term

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:84%
in each one of these expressions
is 1 minus alpha times

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:84%
pi double prime, which is the
same on the left hand side

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.719 align:middle line:90%
as it is on the right hand side.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:47.423 align:middle line:84%
So the ranking is independent
of whatever that term is.

00:34:47.423 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it
ought to be true,

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:90%
but it's actually an axiom.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Continuity is similar,
although not identical.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:84%
It says if we have three
lotteries pi, pi prime,

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.780 align:middle line:84%
pi triple prime, and
they're rank ordered--

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:84%
pi, preferred to pi prime,
preferred to pi double prime,

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:14.060 align:middle line:84%
then there exist numbers
alpha and beta such

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that this weighted
sum of pi and pi

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:84%
double prime, weighted
by alpha, is strictly

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.980 align:middle line:84%
preferred to pi prime,
which is strictly

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:29.180 align:middle line:84%
preferred by the beta weighted
sum of pi and pi double prime.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Now the way to see
this is that it's not

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
required to be true
for all alpha and beta,

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.350 align:middle line:84%
it's only required to be
true for some of them.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So if we were allowed
to set alpha equal to 1,

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:47.610 align:middle line:84%
we would have alpha pi
on the left hand side,

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.690 align:middle line:90%
and pi prime would be over here.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We'd have pi
preferred to pi prime,

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.630 align:middle line:84%
but that was a given to begin
with, so no new information.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.960 align:middle line:84%
This is saying if
alpha is arbitrarily

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:84%
close to 1, then that
ought to be true,

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and hence the notion
of continuity.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, on the
right hand side,

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.650 align:middle line:84%
if beta were zero, which
it's not allowed to be,

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.620 align:middle line:84%
then we'd be just getting
pi double prime here.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're already
given that pi prime is

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.270 align:middle line:90%
preferred to pi double prime.

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:28.490 align:middle line:84%
The content of it is if beta
is not 0 but very close to 0,

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:31.850 align:middle line:84%
then we should preserve
the rank order.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.280 align:middle line:90%
These are intuitive properties.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.730 align:middle line:84%
They're here only to say
that expected utility may not

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.840 align:middle line:84%
be, quote unquote, as general
as you might think when facing

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.860 align:middle line:84%
problems of choice
under uncertainty,

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.490 align:middle line:90%
although it is very natural.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And these properties are
similar in some respects

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.880 align:middle line:84%
to what we did before with
ordinary preference orders.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And with regard to
what we did before,

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
there was already a
question from one of you

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:84%
about this, what about
choice under uncertainty?

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, our measure of utility
becomes cardinal, not

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:90%
just ordinal.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:11.750 align:middle line:84%
We are really going to care
about the degree of curvature

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:16.730 align:middle line:84%
in this orange line, which is
mapping the expected utility

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.150 align:middle line:90%
outcome as we vary the input x.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on
in this setup here?

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We have income,
say, moving around,

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and it has a mean
expected value of x,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and it has a couple of
endpoints-- the lowest value

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.530 align:middle line:90%
x0, the highest value x1.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's say for simplicity
that's all that's going on,

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that the lottery that
creates the random variable

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.990 align:middle line:84%
is nothing other than some
weighted average of x0 and x1.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And those weights are such as
to produce exactly this expected

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:90%
value.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's being
drawn with this line,

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:04.750 align:middle line:84%
namely expectation of x
is a weighted combination

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.640 align:middle line:90%
of x0 and x1.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Given the expectation
of x, we could

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:84%
ask what the utility would be
for that deterministic value,

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:90%
and it would be--

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:19.360 align:middle line:84%
we would have to go up here if
they were getting it for sure,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and over here, and
have the utility

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:90%
of the expectation of x.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.110 align:middle line:84%
That may be a funny
place to start,

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.510 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
genuine lottery here,

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and you can't get
the mean for sure.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.910 align:middle line:84%
You have to engage
in the lottery

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and suffer the randomness
around the mean.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So what is the actual
utility of the lottery?

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, that can be
achieved in this diagram

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:84%
by taking a weighted
average of the utility

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:48.830 align:middle line:90%
of the extreme points.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Here's the utility you would
get for the high value, x1.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Here's the utility you
get for the low value, x0.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.430 align:middle line:84%
If you take a weighted
average, you'll

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.810 align:middle line:90%
be moving along this line.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll actually take this
weighted average here

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:08.080 align:middle line:84%
that also determines the mean,
and go over here and plot

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.980 align:middle line:90%
the utility of the outcome.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is the expected utility
under the actual lottery,

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's just the
appropriately weighted average

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.200 align:middle line:84%
of the utilities of
the two extremes.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:90%
You're with me so far?

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see, if instead
of suffering the lottery,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:32.810 align:middle line:84%
you gave this decision
maker a deterministic value

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.870 align:middle line:84%
with the same utility
level as the utility has

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:84%
under the lottery, what
would that value be?

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.130 align:middle line:90%
That would be right here.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:43.760 align:middle line:84%
If you started with this
value of x for sure,

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and went up to the
orange line, you

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:90%
would get the utility there.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:53.330 align:middle line:84%
But that value of x is obviously
a lot lower than the mean.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.910 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
certainty equivalent

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.350 align:middle line:90%
value of the lottery.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Let me put it a bit differently.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:03.240 align:middle line:84%
If you told the
household to choose

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.690 align:middle line:84%
between the lottery and
a deterministic value

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:84%
with a mean less than
the mean of the lottery,

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.290 align:middle line:84%
they might choose the
deterministic value

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:18.930 align:middle line:84%
as long as that value is not
less than the risk premium.

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Anything here,
they would choose.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Anything over here,
they would not.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Right here, they
would be indifferent.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I think you can
imagine, if you increase

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.330 align:middle line:84%
the curvature of
this function, you're

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:84%
going to actually be
lowering the expected utility

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:84%
of the lottery, because
there's more risk associated

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.900 align:middle line:84%
with it, in the sense that you
care more about the variance

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.990 align:middle line:84%
because your utility
is more curved.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to change
the certainty equivalent

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.280 align:middle line:90%
amount as well.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, for
much of the class,

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.550 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be considering
cardinal rather than ordinal

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.320 align:middle line:90%
utility.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.140 align:middle line:84%
What are standard
measures of risk aversion?

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.970 align:middle line:84%
There's something
called absolute risk

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:09.140 align:middle line:84%
aversion and another thing
called relative risk aversion.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Absolute risk aversion
has to do with how

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.590 align:middle line:84%
your marginal utility is
changing as you change

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.500 align:middle line:90%
the reward, the consumption.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And relative risk aversion has
to do with how much utility

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:25.700 align:middle line:84%
is changing as you change
the percentage of wealth

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.230 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll spare you the
derivations of all of this,

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:34.190 align:middle line:84%
but I will show you some
example utility functions that

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.860 align:middle line:84%
display either
absolute risk aversion

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:84%
constant or relative risk
aversion on the next slide.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So absolute risk aversion
is your willingness

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:50.090 align:middle line:84%
or not to take up gambles,
like, starting with $100,

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.070 align:middle line:90%
add plus or minus 10.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:55.340 align:middle line:90%
The lottery is from 110 to 90.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.890 align:middle line:84%
The relative risk
aversion has to do

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.750 align:middle line:90%
with proportional gambles.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:04.820 align:middle line:84%
You start with, say, 100 and
then have 10% gains or losses.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.610 align:middle line:84%
That would be the same, but
you could start with 1,000

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and have 10% gains and
losses, in which case

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:17.490 align:middle line:84%
you'd be facing a lottery that
moves you from 1,100 to 900.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Under constant relative risk
aversion, all you care about

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:84%
are those percentage differences
from your initial wealth.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Under absolute risk
aversion, you actually

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.220 align:middle line:90%
don't like that new--

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.940 align:middle line:84%
if you started with
$1,000 as opposed to $100,

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.730 align:middle line:84%
your absolute risk aversion
would actually be going down.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
curved utility, you

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.520 align:middle line:84%
would be thinking about a
lottery around a point that

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.930 align:middle line:90%
has less curvature.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Attitudes toward risk do
depend on these functions.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.020 align:middle line:90%
So here are the examples.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:52.290 align:middle line:84%
This one is constant
absolute risk aversion.

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's an
exponential function--

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:84%
looks kind of weird
at first because

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of all these negative signs.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Say, well, exponential
is positive-- yes,

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.350 align:middle line:84%
so as C goes up,
utility is going down.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.450 align:middle line:90%
What the heck's going on here?

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But we put a negative sign
in front of all of this

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.500 align:middle line:90%
to correct for that.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So you could take the derivative
and the second derivative

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and verify that this function
has constant absolute risk

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:21.120 align:middle line:84%
aversion, and the order of
magnitude is actually a.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Or if you started
down here, we'd

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.140 align:middle line:84%
have constant relative
risk aversion,

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and you can verify
if you did the math--

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:84%
u prime u double prime times C
that you would get a number R.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:37.500 align:middle line:84%
So R is the constant level
of relative risk aversion

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.400 align:middle line:90%
under this function.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And we often use these
for different purposes.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.330 align:middle line:84%
They'll show up
in an application

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.930 align:middle line:84%
we'll get to in about, I
guess about four lectures.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk some more about
lotteries and uncertainty.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we'll now throw
in not just uncertainty

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:84%
as in states of the
world S, but also time.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So time is evolving from
day 1 to day 2 to day 3.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So from the perspective of your
initial starting point, i0,

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:13.290 align:middle line:84%
you could experience a low
or a high state at date one.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you're at date one,
you're still facing risk,

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.120 align:middle line:84%
so you could go low
or high from there.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.240 align:middle line:84%
If you went to medium,
then you could go and turn

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.210 align:middle line:84%
all over again from
low, medium, to high.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.300 align:middle line:84%
These branches of the
trees with the nodes

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:34.050 align:middle line:84%
reflect every possible
realization and the path

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:35.250 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:38.640 align:middle line:84%
From the standpoint
of expected utility,

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:44.130 align:middle line:84%
we would start here, ex ante,
before anything happens at all,

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and trace the
probabilities at date one.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.440 align:middle line:84%
You get this or this or this
with certain probabilities,

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.620 align:middle line:90%
pi s1, given s0.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But you'd also take
into account day two,

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:03.360 align:middle line:84%
so you take the expectation
of being here or here,

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.330 align:middle line:84%
or any of these
intermediate branches.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And finally, you'd have
to add in the day three,

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.840 align:middle line:84%
where all these events at the
thinnest branches of the tree

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.580 align:middle line:90%
could come to pass.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.140 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything
counterintuitive

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.170 align:middle line:84%
about this diagram, it is
that when some things happen,

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.710 align:middle line:90%
other things don't happen.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So when you're over
here and move left,

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.230 align:middle line:84%
you've eliminated the other
two branches of the tree.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:33.030 align:middle line:84%
If you took expected
utility from day one onward,

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.310 align:middle line:84%
you would just be
taking into account

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.610 align:middle line:84%
what's left that could
potentially happen at random.

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:42.540 align:middle line:84%
But this criterion down here
is taking expected utility

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.700 align:middle line:84%
as if nothing yet
has happened at all.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So taking into account all
the possible events at day

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.390 align:middle line:90%
1, at day 2, and day 3.

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So we can immediately
get to a building block

00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:01.110 align:middle line:84%
that's crucial to understand
finance and financial markets,

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's the notion of a
state contingent commodity.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:06.420 align:middle line:90%
We've already been doing it.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.780 align:middle line:84%
The state contingent
commodity with only one date

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.620 align:middle line:84%
would be the probability of
getting a certain wealth payoff

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.940 align:middle line:84%
or certain xy combination
of goods and so on.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:22.915 align:middle line:84%
So what you get depends on the
state, commodity bundle you get

00:46:22.915 --> 00:46:23.790 align:middle line:90%
depends on the state.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.430 align:middle line:90%
We call it state contingent.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:31.000 align:middle line:84%
You get wheat tomorrow if it
rains, but nothing otherwise.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And we imagine you can actually
buy these kinds of contingent

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:38.640 align:middle line:84%
pay off securities in
the financial markets.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.010 align:middle line:84%
However, a much
better way to put

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:44.460 align:middle line:84%
that is any
financial security is

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.640 align:middle line:84%
a weighted average,
probabilistic weighted average

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.340 align:middle line:90%
over all possible events.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, you're an
investor and you bought

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.080 align:middle line:90%
in-- someone's lending to you.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And let's imagine they are
never going to default.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Then, you're going to get
that money back for sure,

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.460 align:middle line:84%
in which case, it's
not risky anymore,

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:84%
but that's only because
the event is the same.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Or you could have something
like a stock option,

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:13.530 align:middle line:84%
so that it doesn't come in
to play unless the stock

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:16.900 align:middle line:84%
prices are particularly high
and you execute the option.

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So all possible securities
can be represented as linear

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:26.430 align:middle line:84%
combinations of these primitive
Arrow-Debreu securities--

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:29.010 align:middle line:84%
primitive in the sense
that they, building blocks,

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:84%
only pay off in the event of
one well delineated event, and 0

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:34.750 align:middle line:90%
otherwise.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So when we get to
competitive markets

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and how to handle
uncertainty, we'll

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:43.035 align:middle line:84%
come back to these state
contingent commodities.

00:47:43.035 --> 00:47:47.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's move to an
application of various

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:54.000 align:middle line:84%
of these things, one lotteries,
two, random variables, three,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.340 align:middle line:90%
diversification of portfolios.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Except in this case,
they're not going

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.420 align:middle line:84%
to be trading financial
assets, they're

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.400 align:middle line:84%
going to be holding
plots of land.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So the next map I'm
going to show you

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.580 align:middle line:84%
is a village of Elford in
Stratfordshire, England,

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:12.030 align:middle line:90%
in 1719, before enclosures.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And shaded in black are the
holdings of Mr. Darlaston.

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So here's that village,
Elford, Stratfordshire.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
look a little close,

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:26.920 align:middle line:84%
but you see these darker
areas, they are shaded in

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and represent the
holdings of Mr. Darlaston.

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Darlaston has these
long, narrow strips of land

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:37.230 align:middle line:84%
all over the village,
in all the three fields.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And you could well
think about that

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:42.600 align:middle line:84%
as a portfolio of land
holdings, and in some respects

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.790 align:middle line:84%
a portfolio of securities
where in this case,

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:50.280 align:middle line:84%
the holding of land yields a
dividend, which is the harvest.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And you may well surmise
there's some risk here,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.240 align:middle line:84%
or they're weird people,
because why else would they

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.320 align:middle line:90%
be doing something like this?

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Here's another view of
the village of Laxton.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I should at least tell
you what enclosures are.

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Given the way this
land was spread out,

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:12.000 align:middle line:84%
it was impractical
to put fences up

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.480 align:middle line:84%
that would mark the division
of the boundary of all

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.800 align:middle line:90%
these various strips.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.080 align:middle line:84%
It would have been very
costly to put up the fences

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.730 align:middle line:90%
and very difficult to plow.

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:22.620 align:middle line:90%
See the little plows here?

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, enclosures
meant they put--

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:27.720 align:middle line:90%
they divided it up.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:32.220 align:middle line:84%
They got rid of the
area and divided up

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.950 align:middle line:84%
the land in a
different way, just

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:38.640 align:middle line:84%
put fences around the
consolidated pieces of land.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't do that
for hundreds of years.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:45.780 align:middle line:84%
They kept this, the scattered
strips, for quite a long time.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's move to the data.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The data we have from
this period of time

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:53.940 align:middle line:84%
is from the Bishop
of Winchester.

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
The church was wealthy
and they kept records.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
survives, the holdings

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:05.940 align:middle line:84%
of the Bishop of Winchester,
all domains, the crops being

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.790 align:middle line:84%
wheat, barley, and oats,
various types of grains.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And these objects denote,
say, the coefficient

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.720 align:middle line:84%
of variation, which I've alerted
you is the variance divided

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:19.360 align:middle line:84%
by the mean, standard
deviation divided by the mean.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So this number, say 0.35, is in
the middle of the two others.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's a bit
on the lower end.

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Even at 0.35, the coefficient
of variation of that magnitude

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.380 align:middle line:90%
is a lot of risk.

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.950 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at the picture.

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:38.040 align:middle line:84%
If we have those
scattered plots,

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.420 align:middle line:84%
those strips, we could plot the
entire distribution of outcomes

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.220 align:middle line:90%
with their probabilities.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:48.510 align:middle line:84%
We could denote the mean,
Us, for scattered plots.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
disastrous events,

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:56.880 align:middle line:84%
so d represents minimal,
subsistence consumption.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
these scattered plots

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:03.810 align:middle line:84%
with that coefficient
of variation of 0.35,

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:06.930 align:middle line:84%
then roughly one
in every 12 years

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:10.680 align:middle line:84%
you get a very low yield,
less than 2 times--

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.160 align:middle line:84%
2 standard deviations below the
mean, and that's starvation.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were starving, we know
this, periodically, every 12

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:18.960 align:middle line:90%
years or so.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:23.103 align:middle line:84%
Not like clockwork, but
on average every 12 years.

00:51:23.103 --> 00:51:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, could they have
done something different?

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They could have
consolidated the land

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and that would have gotten rid
of certain costs and problems.

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:35.360 align:middle line:84%
That would have
moved up the mean,

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.640 align:middle line:84%
but you'd be left with more
mass in the tails, and hence

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.780 align:middle line:84%
a higher probability of having
a yield that was disastrous.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So the reason that
they're spreading out

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.730 align:middle line:84%
the land like that
despite costs has

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.150 align:middle line:84%
to do with trying to increase
their expected utility

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:56.260 align:middle line:84%
by putting less
mass in the tails.

00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Also from the Bishop
of Winchester estates,

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:middle line:90%
which you can hardly see here--

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.770 align:middle line:84%
this, believe it or not,
is Southern England.

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:08.200 align:middle line:90%
This is the water down here.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
these dots represents

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.400 align:middle line:90%
an ecclesiastical estate.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have the data of the
yields, the harvest yields.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.710 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the
covariate, the correlation--

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.070 align:middle line:84%
the statistical concept we
were chatting about earlier--

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:27.760 align:middle line:84%
is what is being plotted
here for villages

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that are relatively
near to one another,

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and villages that are
relatively far away.

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.200 align:middle line:90%
So D means near--

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.630 align:middle line:84%
sorry, it's hard
to read the legend.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And so take two
villages pairwise,

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.690 align:middle line:84%
look at the correlation
across the two villages.

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It's 0.68 on average, picking
villages that are near.

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you have villages that
are far away one another,

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:54.730 align:middle line:84%
that correlation drops
to something lower,

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:58.160 align:middle line:84%
so the yields are not
moving as much together.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So again, if you were the
Bishop of Winchester, maybe

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:04.270 align:middle line:84%
you chose the location
of your estates

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.820 align:middle line:84%
in order to try
to ensure yourself

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:10.570 align:middle line:84%
of having somewhat regular
grain for harvest, for eating,

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and to feed the
horses, and so on.

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Horses are serious, by the way.

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:16.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the cavalry.

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:20.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the main defense, so
they need it to keep them alive.

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:27.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, then we come to a technique
which we've already been using,

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:30.320 align:middle line:90%
but let's do it from scratch.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
linear programming.

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is a linear
programming problem.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.900 align:middle line:84%
X is the control
variable, a vector.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:42.250 align:middle line:90%
This-- say, column vector--

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:48.310 align:middle line:84%
these constants, coefficient
C, represent a row vector,

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:51.640 align:middle line:84%
so these are weights on
the various x values.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:56.560 align:middle line:84%
This is a set of constraints,
which is this matrix a times x,

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.030 align:middle line:90%
less than or equal to b.

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And the x's are non-negative.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is notation for a
standard linear program, namely

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:09.160 align:middle line:90%
the objective function.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And the constraint sets just
represent linear combinations

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.130 align:middle line:90%
of the control variables x.

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I had this in the
back of my head

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:20.140 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking about the
Leontief input-output matrix.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said in words, instead of
taking final demand D as given,

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.760 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's a weighted
average of demands

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to
maximize, and you actually

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:33.280 align:middle line:84%
have a choice of
various production modes

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.390 align:middle line:84%
to maximize that
weighted average.

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So we actually saw an early
version of a linear programming

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:43.450 align:middle line:84%
problem, but the objective
function was not made explicit.

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:47.500 align:middle line:84%
This would be the
consumer choice problem

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:50.080 align:middle line:84%
in a competitive
environment, so where

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.440 align:middle line:90%
there's a budget constraint.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So these discrete points,
commodity points C,

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:59.260 align:middle line:84%
denote subscript S
varying over error.

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:04.840 align:middle line:84%
S, states of the world was the
expected utility criterion,

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.060 align:middle line:84%
so that's the
objective function.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.240 align:middle line:84%
By choice of lotteries,
so the lotteries

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.280 align:middle line:84%
are non-negative
and add up to 1.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.500 align:middle line:84%
To qualify as a lottery,
any given lottery

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.590 align:middle line:84%
has to satisfy
those two criteria.

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:21.640 align:middle line:84%
The choice object, as I said--
to belabor it-- is not c of s.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Those are fixed
commodity points.

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:26.020 align:middle line:90%
The choice object are the pis.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about a
budget problem, which

00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:33.710 align:middle line:84%
is there are prices p depending
on s-- that is to say,

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.100 align:middle line:84%
depending on the underlying
discrete bundle, quite

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.930 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And you've got a
budget in dollars

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:43.600 align:middle line:84%
that you can use
to buy a lottery,

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:47.080 align:middle line:84%
but if the probability
is non-trivial,

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:51.580 align:middle line:84%
it's a number less than
1 and greater than 0,

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:54.190 align:middle line:84%
then you scale the
price of getting

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:56.800 align:middle line:90%
that bundle s back by pi.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're kind
of paying the expected price.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:04.240 align:middle line:84%
If pi s were one, then
you're buying cs for sure

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and the price would be ps,
and that would look like

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.240 align:middle line:84%
the standard price times
quantity cannot exceed

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:10.900 align:middle line:90%
the budget.

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.650 align:middle line:84%
But here, what you're
buying is a lottery,

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and the lottery can have
non degenerate elements.

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:19.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to decide how
you would be paying for,

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:22.300 align:middle line:84%
what you would be paying if
you were buying a lottery which

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.320 align:middle line:90%
were non degenerate.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And here, you pay as per the
actuarial value of the payoff.

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is another
linear program.

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:33.970 align:middle line:84%
The objective function
is linear in the pis.

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The constraint
set is in the pis,

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:39.790 align:middle line:84%
including the budget set,
which is linear in the pis.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So we can solve these things
conceptually and numerically,

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:46.180 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that
it's just a version

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.610 align:middle line:90%
of the general notation.

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And here's the third.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Suppose we have a firm--

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:53.150 align:middle line:90%
back to production again.

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:56.380 align:middle line:84%
The firm can produce
n possible goods.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.350 align:middle line:84%
The jth good here
has a price, pj.

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:02.830 align:middle line:84%
The firm has a fixed
supply of inputs, which

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:04.150 align:middle line:90%
makes the problem special.

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:07.450 align:middle line:84%
They're not buying these, they
already have them in inventory.

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And the technology tells
us how much of input

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.890 align:middle line:90%
i is needed to produce good j.

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Those are the aijs.

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Now here, the natural
objective function

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:22.240 align:middle line:84%
would be the revenue,
price times quantity,

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.850 align:middle line:90%
summing over all the j goods.

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to choose the qjs,

00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:31.250 align:middle line:84%
but you can't over
utilize your inputs.

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So if the firm is endowed with
input i, then you would say,

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:40.180 align:middle line:84%
how much of input i is
needed to produce good j

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.300 align:middle line:84%
times the proposed
quantity of good j,

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.310 align:middle line:90%
summing over all goods j.

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:47.950 align:middle line:84%
This would be the
total input requirement

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:53.380 align:middle line:84%
for input i, associated with
producing this vector of goods

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.630 align:middle line:90%
q, indexed by j.

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
linear constraint.

00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:59.350 align:middle line:90%
The qs are non-negative.

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:01.630 align:middle line:90%
This is another linear program.

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And the last one is what's
called a transportation

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:06.010 align:middle line:90%
problem--

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.440 align:middle line:90%
maybe just say it in words.

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:13.640 align:middle line:84%
There are m warehouses,
which are stocked with goods,

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and n retail outlets
where goods are sold.

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:20.450 align:middle line:90%
So here, we have geography.

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, in
order to ship the product

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:28.950 align:middle line:84%
from a warehouse to an
outlet, you use up resources.

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So this cost, cij, is the
amount of resources you used up,

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:39.620 align:middle line:84%
say, in dollars, to ship the
good from warehouse i to outlet

00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:40.700 align:middle line:90%
j.

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the decision problem
is you're given demands

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.350 align:middle line:84%
at all the outlets, and you're
given the amount, initially,

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:52.580 align:middle line:84%
in the warehouses, and you want
to then determine the shipments

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:54.350 align:middle line:84%
from all the
different warehouses

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:56.390 align:middle line:84%
to all the different
potential outlets

00:58:56.390 --> 00:59:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to solve the problem, which
minimizes the total cost--

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:04.370 align:middle line:84%
cost from i to j,
warehouses i to outlets j,

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and these are the constraints.

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:10.640 align:middle line:84%
The constraint says that
you've got so much in inventory

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:17.510 align:middle line:84%
at warehouse i, so whatever
you're shipping out of i to all

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:21.917 align:middle line:84%
these outlets j, it cannot
exceed that level of inventory,

00:59:21.917 --> 00:59:23.000 align:middle line:90%
although it could be less.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, you have to
meet the demand at outlet j--

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So the shipping that's coming
from all possible outlets i

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to that particular j cannot
be less than the demand.

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is another geographic
programming problem.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.930 align:middle line:90%
So we did ordinary production.

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:44.480 align:middle line:90%
We did choice under uncertainty.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:48.320 align:middle line:84%
We did a spatial
geographic problem.

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.950 align:middle line:84%
They're all well known
prototypes in the literature,

00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and they all use
this common tool,

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.434 align:middle line:90%
which is linear programming.

00:59:56.434 --> 01:00:00.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's all I have for today.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:08.000 align:middle line:90%

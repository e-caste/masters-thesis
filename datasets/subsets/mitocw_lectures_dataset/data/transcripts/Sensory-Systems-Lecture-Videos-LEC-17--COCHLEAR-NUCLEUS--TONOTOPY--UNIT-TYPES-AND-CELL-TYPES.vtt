00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:27.510
PROFESSOR: So last
time, we talked

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.960
about the responses of
auditory nerve fibers

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.810
and we talked about tonotopic
organization and frequency

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.400
tuning and response areas
of auditory nerve fibers.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.586
So any questions about that?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.780
OK.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.270
So this time, today's
lecture was going to go on.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.750
And the auditory
nerve, of course,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.130
leads up into the brain.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.280
So we're going to talk
about the auditory central

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.790
nervous system, starting with
the first nucleus in the CNS

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.526
for the auditory pathway,
which is the cochlear nucleus.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.010
And this nucleus gets its name
because the auditory nerve

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.110
is sometimes called
the cochlear nerve.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.610
Right?

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.818
It's coming from the cochlea.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.430
And so this is the
cochlear nucleus.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.560
So can anybody give
me a definition

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.860
of a nucleus in terms
of a central pathway?

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.290
Not a cell nucleus.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.605
This is a nucleus in the brain.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.990
Just a collection of neurons.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.000
Right?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.975
So a nucleus is a collection of
neurons in the central pathway.

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:53.390
A ganglion is a collection of
neurons out in the periphery.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.500
So you have the spiral
ganglion in the cochlea,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.065
being where the cell bodies
of the auditory nerve fibers--

00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:03.665
it's called the ganglion there
because it's in the periphery.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.570
And that nerve goes into
the central nervous system

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.570
and it ends on
neurons-- a collection

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.637
of neurons in the
cochlear nucleus.

00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:16.845
In the part of the brain
called the cochlear nucleus.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.560
We're going to talk in
the cochlear nucleus

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.810
about the various types
of cells that are there.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.690
And instead of just having one
or two types of auditory nerve

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.640
fibers, as we had
in the periphery,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.260
there's going to be a whole
bunch of types of cells.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.030
And they have really
fanciful names

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.450
like octopus cells
and pyramidal cells.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.545
So we'll talk about those.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.880
When we go into the
cochlear nucleus and record

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.285
with microelectrodes,
we get single units.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.570
And there's a way of classifying
those single units, which

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.130
was developed here
in the 1960s at MIT,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.542
and it was one of the first
applications of computers

00:03:01.542 --> 00:03:02.750
to the study of neuroscience.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.500
Looking at the action potentials
as a function of time,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.880
right after you turn
the sound stimulus on.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.690
And by looking at
those patterns,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.325
you can classify the
units into various types.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.710
And now we know a
good correspondence

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.050
between the physiology
and the anatomy,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.363
so we'll go over how we
establish that correspondence.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.040
And because these are
these various types,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.980
we really have one type of
auditory neurofiber coming in

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.387
from the periphery, and now
we have a bunch of types.

00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:36.970
We're now going to
think of the system

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.770
as having multiple
parallel pathways

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.420
for the sense of hearing in
the central nervous system.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.460
And perhaps one pathway helps
you with one aspect of hearing,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.290
and another pathway helps
you with another aspect.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.750
And maybe we'll end
up at the end of today

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.680
with a little bit
of discussion--

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.380
advanced discussion--
of implants.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.580
So we're going to talk about
cochlear implants next week.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.760
There is a kind of an implant
called the auditory brainstem

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.750
implant that's put in
the cochlear nucleus.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.820
But here, things
are so complicated.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.269
You have a variety of
cell and unit types,

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.290
each doing a different function.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.790
You can imagine
how hard it would

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.711
be to wire up a prosthesis to
stimulate each one of those

00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:27.210
correctly.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.850
So just let's keep
in mind the challenge

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.820
of putting a prosthesis
into the cochlear nucleus,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.130
which is required of people
who lack an auditory nerve.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.587
They can't get a
prosthesis in the cochlea

00:04:42.587 --> 00:04:44.670
because the message wouldn't
be sent to the brain.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.140
They need to get a prosthesis
into the cochlear nucleus.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.280
But it's very complicated here.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.490
And maybe it's as
complicated processing

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.810
as you have in the retina.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.310
Right?

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.870
In the retina, you have
the retinal ganglion cells

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.230
being very complicated.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.575
Some have center
surround fields.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.850
Right?

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.300
There's not just turning
on and turning off.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.050
There's turning on,
there's inhibiting the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.110
on, and so on and so forth.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.230
So the cochlear nucleus
I think of a little bit

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.640
as like the retina equivalent
in the visual system.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.470
OK, so let's look at the
auditory central nervous system

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.640
in terms of a block
diagram on the top

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.026
and in terms of what it looks
like when you cut sections

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:31.775
through the brain.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.540
So here's the block diagram.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.590
And we've been talking
about the cochlea here,

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.980
and the spiral ganglion
is where the cell

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.540
bodies of the auditory
nerve fibers are.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.150
This would be the arrow of
the auditory nerve coming

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.970
from the spiral ganglion into
the CN, the cochlear nucleus.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.110
And of course you have one
of those on the left side,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.960
and another on the right side.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.750
So this diagram is showing both
sides of the central pathway.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.600
From the cochlear nucleus, the
neurons of the cochlear nucleus

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.845
send axons to a
variety of places.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.590
One of them is in the region
of the brain called the pons.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.780
And in the pons
there is a complex

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.460
called the superior
olivary complex.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.140
And it's abbreviated SOC here.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.660
So what's a complex?

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.460
Now, we've had a ganglion,
a nucleus, and a complex.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.140
Well, as we'll see
in a couple of weeks

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.710
in the course, when
we talk about the SOC,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.820
it has a whole bunch of nuclei
very closely spaced within it.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.955
Maybe a dozen or so
different nuclei.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.400
Each of which is a different
collection of cells.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.846
So the whole thing is called
a superior olivary complex.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.500
And superior olive?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.080
What's that part of the name?

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.610
So has anybody heard
about the olive?

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.090
Or the inferior olive?

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.935
What's the olive?

00:07:04.935 --> 00:07:06.350
We should talk about it.

00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:10.250
Nothing?

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.760
Anybody?

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.460
Any ideas?

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.030
So it's involved in
the motor system.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.000
And if you cut a
section of the brain--

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.510
it's not illustrated
here, but if you

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.570
look at a section of the brain
in transverse sections, which

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:31.300
are the kind of sections
that we have here--

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.490
you find a structure that's
kind of gotten wrinkled edges

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.405
and sort of has a central pit,
and it looks like an olive.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.420
At least it did to the first
neuro-anatomists, maybe

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.560
who had their eye on the
clock, and were waiting

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.902
for the 5 o'clock dinner call.

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.610
They said, hey, that
looks like an olive.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.029
And they probably didn't
have very good microscopes,

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:58.070
so they were looking at
things at very low power.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.290
And what happened later
is somebody discovered

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:07.930
another complex over here that
was nearby but didn't look

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.550
anything like an olive,
but it was near the olive.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.700
And it was a little bit
rostral in the brain,

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.616
and things that are rostral
are called superior.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.340
So they called this
the superior olive,

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.210
and this has become known
as the inferior olive.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.690
And after they got even
higher power magnification,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.590
they could see this was
really a complex of nuclei,

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.213
so they called it the
superior olivary complex.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.935
OK, so this is motor.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.495
And this is auditory.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.030
And they just happen to be
located near one another

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.900
in the brainstem, in the area of
the brainstem called the pons,

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.460
down here.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.550
So these are sections
of the human brain.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.676
So why do we cut sections?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.580
Anybody?

00:09:10.963 --> 00:09:12.430
AUDIENCE: To look
at the anatomy?

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.500
PROFESSOR: To look
at the anatomy.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.000
Right.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.710
So a compound microscope
that we usually

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.020
use to look at the anatomy can't
look at a big hunk of tissue.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.150
You have to cut sections.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.240
And the thinner section you cut,
the better resolution you get.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.950
Because you can bring a
very high-powered objective

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.740
and look at very
fine cellular detail.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.830
So cutting sections is what
neuro-anatomists love to do.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.770
An example thickness
of a section

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.913
might be 10 micrometers.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.370
100 micrometers is a
very thick section.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.770
So you can imagine
how many sections

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.104
you'd have to
chunk through to go

00:09:51.104 --> 00:09:52.520
through the whole
human brainstem.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.830
That's why it's nice to work
with small animals like mice.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.390
They don't have
as many sections.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:57.890
Right?

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.770
So, but these are sections
of the human brainstem.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.220
And here, this word
says spiral ganglion,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.340
so this is the auditory
nerve coming in.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.460
And this is the
cochlear nucleus.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.870
And I've heard it
described that by the time

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.195
the sense of hearing came
along, the brain was formed.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.840
Primitive animals had the brain,
and all the other functions

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.270
like motor.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.720
So there wasn't any
room in the middle.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.780
So it was stuck on the outside.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.070
The sense of hearing--
the cochlear nucleus,

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.950
at least, was put on
the outside of the brain

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.074
because there wasn't any
room for it in the inside.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.150
Cochlear nucleus
structures tend to be

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.982
superficial in the brainstem.

00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:42.190
This is the cochlear nucleus.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.460
And these are the
axons crossing.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.770
Because some of the
cochlear nucleus axons

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.520
cross from the left
side to the right side.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:01.960
And the superior olivary complex
is deep within the brainstem.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.800
But some of the
cochlear nucleus axons

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.190
don't go to the superior olive.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.070
They bypass it
and go all the way

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.735
to the IC, the
inferior colliculus.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.220
That's at the level
of the mid-brain.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.070
So this is the
inferior colliculus.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.770
So you've studied a
collicular structure before.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.291
What was it?

00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:23.790
Right?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.280
In the first half
of this course.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.860
The superior colliculus, right?

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.470
So why is it superior?

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.370
Is it better?

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.730
No.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.460
It's just a little
rostral in the brain.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.290
So if you cut
sections from caudal--

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.330
so this is the spinal cord
down, and your microtome's

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.070
chunking through the
medulla, and the pons,

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.699
and you get to the midbrain.

00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:51.990
And then you cut through the
inferior colliculus, which

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.810
is right here, and then a
little bit more rostral,

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.510
you cut through the
superior colliculi,

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.440
which are right here.

00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:00.840
And they tend to be
a little flatter.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.970
These inferior colliculi
are more dome-like shaped.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.920
So what does colliculus mean?

00:12:10.507 --> 00:12:11.340
Anybody know French?

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.070
Who knows French?

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.122
Come on, somebody knows.

00:12:16.122 --> 00:12:16.955
OK, who knows Latin?

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.210
OK, well, that's
the expected result.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.190
Colliculus means a little hill.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.980
And this lives up to its name.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.660
These are little hills right
on the top of the brainstem.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.610
The Inferior colliculi
are here, left and right,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.200
and the superior
colliculi are here.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.100
So what is the
superior colliculus--

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.005
what does the
superior colliculi do?

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.795
What happens when you stimulate
in the superior colliculus?

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.670
Your eyeballs move, right?

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.050
So the superior
colliculus is intimately

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.011
involved in saccadic
eye movements.

00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:00.510
Right?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.052
You guys must have
talked a lot about that

00:13:03.052 --> 00:13:04.385
in the first part of the course.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.580
And the inferior
colliculus, what does it do?

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.660
Well, I've heard people who
have spent their whole research

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.600
career studying the
inferior colliculus,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.940
and they say, well, I
don't know what it does!

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.330
That's not an uncommon statement
in the sense of hearing.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.280
So the inferior
colliculus certainly

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.870
is a meeting place for
lots of axons coming up

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.770
from the cochlear nuclei, from
the superior olivary complex.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.785
It's a midbrain meeting center.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.360
It's certainly involved
with many parts

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.910
of the sense of
hearing, but we don't

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.800
know exactly what role it plays.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.000
Certainly not as simple
as it moves ears, OK?

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.570
Whereas the superior
colliculus moves eyes.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.780
All right, coming up the
pathway even further,

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.890
the next level is the
thalamus, where you have,

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.205
for the auditory system,
the medial geniculate.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.005
And what was the analog
in the visual pathway?

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.640
A lateral geniculate, right?

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.050
OK, so in the brain, medial is
toward the middle and lateral

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.500
is a little bit toward
the lateral part.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.320
You don't have the lateral
geniculate in this section,

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.860
but it would be a
little bit lateral

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.100
to the medial geniculate.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.075
And what does geniculate mean?

00:14:30.858 --> 00:14:32.230
AUDIENCE: Knee.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.950
PROFESSOR: Knee.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:33.710
Right.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.390
A genu is a knee.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.690
And the lateral geniculate--
if you use your imagination

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.300
and if you were an
early neuro-anatomists

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.810
with a low-power lens
on your microscope,

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.400
it looked like a bent knee.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.080
It's sort of bent.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.320
The medial geniculate
is not that at all.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.510
It doesn't look at
all like a knee.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.000
But it's just medial to
the lateral geniculate,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.620
so that's how it got its name.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.800
OK, very good answer.

00:15:00.475 --> 00:15:01.350
What is to genuflect?

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:03.520
AUDIENCE: To bend.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.000
AUDIENCE: Kneel.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.795
To kneel down, bend your knees.

00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:07.415
Ah, king!

00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:07.915
Ruler!

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.450
All right.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.975
And then finally we have
the auditory cortex, the AC,

00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:18.880
in those boxes at the top.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.290
And the auditory
cortical fields are

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.370
in the temporal cortex
on the sides of the head.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:29.310
So I'm pointing to my
left temporal cortex

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.582
if I could go through my skull.

00:15:31.582 --> 00:15:33.265
It's behind the temporal bone.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.510
OK, where were the visual areas?

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.770
Back here.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:43.120
This is called the
occipital cortex, right?

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.690
In a completely different
part of the cortex.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.150
And in the primate--
of course, humans

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.055
are primates-- you have a big
temporal lobe of the brain.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.820
And that's this lobe here.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.310
And the auditory cortical
fields, for the most part,

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.860
are on the dorsal
surface of that.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.490
And you have to go down
inside the temporal gyrus--

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.160
this big gyrus-- to
look and see them,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.900
because they're
not on the surface

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.620
of the brain in the primate.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.640
They're down inside
the temporal gyrus.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.610
Well, how does this look
compared to the visual pathway?

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.170
Let's say this is
the retina here.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.460
OK?

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.005
Where does the retina project?

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.525
That's a great exam question!

00:16:41.475 --> 00:16:42.725
Where does the retina project?

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.320
That's not a one
answer question, right?

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.360
In large parts of the LGM.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.092
That's right.

00:16:57.092 --> 00:16:58.216
Where else does it project?

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:00.164
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:01.332 --> 00:17:02.790
PROFESSOR: I don't
know about that.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.980
Certainly projects to the
superior colliculus, right?

00:17:07.132 --> 00:17:10.880
Aren't the x and
y cells projecting

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.004
to the superior colliculus?

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.690
A few of the retinal
ganglion cells

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.300
project to the
superior colliculus.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.819
You better ask Peter for sure.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.119
Obviously, I don't know much
about the visual pathway.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.680
But so how does that look here?

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.710
We have the cochlea, and
even the cochlear nucleus.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.710
Does it project
to the geniculate?

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.360
No, not at all.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.840
Between the periphery
and the thalamic level

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.330
for the auditory pathway, you
have the cochlear nucleus.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.890
You have the superior
olivary complex.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.390
And you have the
inferior colliculus.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:54.560
And these structures are on the
main highway up to the cortex.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.830
It's not as if the
main pathway bypasses

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.830
the inferior colliculus.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:03.010
This little side arrow
is just a few axons.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.750
The main pathway
is cochlear nucleus

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.930
to superior olivary complex.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.510
And, to a certain extent,
cochlear nucleus to IC.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.590
Superior olivary complex to IC.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.190
And then to medial geniculate.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.240
So it's a big difference

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.610
What about the
somatosensory system?

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:29.260
You have a dorsal root ganglia
in the somatosensory system,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.350
and they project
actually all the way

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.900
to the somatosensory
regions of the thalamus.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.590
So that's more like
the visual system.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.730
There's something
different going on here

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.150
in the auditory system.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:46.590
There's a whole bunch of
brainstem and midbrain nuclei

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.440
in the auditory
pathway that you don't

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.195
have represented in
these other systems.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:57.640
So we're going to learn,
in about two weeks,

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.290
about the superior
olivary complex

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.600
and the inferior colliculus.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.730
These extra brainstem
nuclei are very involved

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.066
in the process of
sound localization.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.490
And that's because for
the auditory system

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:17.650
to figure out where a sound
is coming from, in best case

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.070
we use the two ears.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.450
And we use cues like the
difference in time of arrival

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:29.150
of a sound at the two ears, and
the difference in sound level

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.460
at the two ears, to figure out
where a sound is coming from.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.420
Certainly in the
azimuthal plane.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.230
And in the visual system, and
in the somatosensory system,

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.130
the localization of where
the stimulus is coming from

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.860
is mapped right
at the periphery.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.580
So you know that
a spot of light is

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.360
coming from over to
your right because it

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.850
hits your nasal retina
in your right eye,

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.510
and your temporal
retina in your left eye.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.200
So that position
information is already

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.300
available in the periphery.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.060
In the sense of hearing,
what does the periphery map?

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.150
It maps sound frequency, right?

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.880
So obviously, sound
frequency is a very important

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.260
characteristic.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.410
It allows you to
identify the sound.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.560
But it doesn't help you to tell
where the sound is coming from.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.660
And if you're a mouse
running away from a cat,

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.140
and it's night time, and
you can't see the cat,

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.270
you need to know where the
cat sound is coming from.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.520
Is it coming from your right,
or is it coming from your left?

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.430
And it takes a lot of
brainstem processing,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.040
comparing the inputs
from the two sides,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.410
to reconstruct where the
sound was coming from.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.310
Especially if you're doing
it by intra-aural time

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.000
and intra-aural
level differences.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.760
So all of this brain stem
processing-- or much of it--

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.820
is devoted to figuring out
where the sound is coming from.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.500
It's figuring out the
location of the sound.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.200
So we'll spend a good
week or more on that,

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.850
in a couple weeks in our course.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.210
Because that's one
of the things you

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.750
can really sink your teeth
in, in the auditory system.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.810
The thing it does
is to figure out

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.190
where the location of
the sound source is.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.400
OK, now we're going to spend
the rest of the lecture

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.000
today on the cochlear nucleus.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.040
The very first nucleus
in the auditory pathway.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:40.010
And we're first going to
talk about basic things

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:44.610
like the anatomy of the cochlear
nucleus and its tonotopy.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:51.610
So this is a drawing
of the cochlear nucleus

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.470
in the so-called sagittal plane.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.270
We should all know what
the sagittal plane is.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.240
Can anybody explain it to me?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.880
Or can anybody explain?

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.380
Yeah?

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.530
Right like this.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:19.210
So I like to think of it as the
zodiac character Sagittarius.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:19.710
Right?

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.543
Who was Sagittarius?

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.365
PROFESSOR: He was the what?

00:22:23.365 --> 00:22:24.520
AUDIENCE: He was an archer.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.470
PROFESSOR: Yes,
he was an archer.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.055
Happened to have a
horse behind him.

00:22:29.055 --> 00:22:30.290
Or for his behind.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.060
So he shot the arrow, and
if he shot it effectively,

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.853
he'd hit me right in
the center of my head,

00:22:37.853 --> 00:22:41.240
and my two halves of my
brain would fall apart.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.080
And if you picked one
half up and looked at it,

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.990
you would a sagittal section.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.331
OK?

00:22:47.331 --> 00:22:48.950
Of my brain.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.600
And the cochlear nucleus,
as we saw before,

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.255
is hanging off the
side of the brain.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.165
But if that archer
shot-- instead of right

00:22:58.165 --> 00:23:01.800
at the midline, shot
a little off-center,

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.470
and the cochlear
nucleus half fell away,

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:11.730
you'd get this sagittal section
of the cochlear nucleus.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.220
And so the cochlea is down
here and the auditory nerve

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.770
is coming up into
the cochlear nucleus.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.055
So what is up on this section?

00:23:21.055 --> 00:23:25.000
Well, it's going
dorsal, going higher.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.055
So here's your compass.

00:23:27.056 --> 00:23:29.420
The cochlear nucleus is ventral.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.320
The auditory nerve
climbs up dorsally

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.680
into the cochlear nucleus.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:41.370
And that compass
gives you two clues

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:45.070
about the two big divisions
of the cochlear nucleus.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.320
This biggest part of
the cochlear nucleus

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.272
is called the ventral
cochlear nucleus,

00:23:49.272 --> 00:23:50.355
because it's down ventral.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.080
The VCN is the ventral
cochlear nucleus.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.410
And the other part is the DCN.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.964
That's the dorsal
cochlear nucleus.

00:24:00.964 --> 00:24:02.630
This is the part that
comes up dorsally.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.330
And they look different.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:13.020
If you look at the VCN, it looks
like sort of a homogeneous mass

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.115
of cells without a huge
amount of organization.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.930
But as you can see by
these dash lines here,

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.555
the DCN has layers in it.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:29.237
And people have pushed
the idea that the DCN

00:24:29.237 --> 00:24:30.320
is like a mini-cerebellum.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.300
| know, the cerebellum is
at the back of your brain.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.700
Cerebellum means it's
a part of your brain

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.340
that deals with motor functions.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.750
And has these beautiful layers.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.690
Certain kinds of cells
are in each layer.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.650
And there is an analogy between
the DCN and the cerebellum.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.420
It certainly works as
far as the layers goes.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.130
Some of the cell
types are the same.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.320
You have lots of
little granule cells

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.396
in the cerebellum and the
dorsal cochlear nucleus.

00:25:00.396 --> 00:25:03.155
You have pyramidal
cells in layer two.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.475
The ventral cochlear nucleus, by
contrast, is very homogeneous.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:14.660
Now this slide shows you,
in sagittal view, not only

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.170
the cochlear nucleus
and the subdivisions,

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.820
but it shows you some labeled
auditory nerve fibers coming

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.400
in, in the auditory nerve.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.215
So we talked about
labeling before.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.520
We talked about how you can
put a microelectrode filled

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.360
with neural tracer
in the auditory nerve

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.410
and get the tuning curve and
the characteristic frequency,

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.390
or CF, way down at the
tip of the tuning cure.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.210
And then you can
inject a neural tracer.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.430
And the last time, we talked
about labeling and tracing

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.780
the auditory nerve fibers in the
cochlea to the inner hair cell

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.180
that it contacted.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.050
But you can just as easily
go the other direction.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.710
Neural tracers fill
the entire neuron.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.840
So these fibers were
labeled, and now we're

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.130
looking at their
central trajectory

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.590
into the central part
of the auditory nerve

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:05.840
and into the cochlear nucleus.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.680
And it's pretty hard to read,
but if you could read them,

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.910
these arrows and the
numbers following them

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:18.190
indicate the
characteristic frequency

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:22.235
of each of four different
labeled auditory nerve fibers.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:30.270
This one way down here has
a CF of 0.17 kilohertz.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:35.110
This one is a CF of 2.7.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.380
This is a CF of 10.3.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:45.650
And the top one, I think,
is a CF of 36 kilohertz.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:50.000
And you can easily see
a progression from low

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.910
CF's to mid CF's to high CF's.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.940
So 36 kilohertz is way
beyond the upper limit

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.670
of human hearing, but in this
experimental animal, which

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.750
was a cat-- cats hear up to 50
kilohertz, at least an octave

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.170
above the upper
limit of our hearing.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.150
And they have auditory
trainer fibers

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.280
that respond quite
well at 36 kilohertz.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.720
So you can see that
there is a organization,

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.760
and this organization
could be called

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:35.510
a tonotopic organization--
for the projection

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.940
of the auditory nerve
onto the cochlear nucleus

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.800
and you can bet, than, that
if you were to explore around

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.735
here-- in the DCN that
we've been talking about--

00:27:47.735 --> 00:27:52.840
if you were to record here with
an electrode that's sampled not

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.900
from the auditory nerve
fibers but from the cell

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.680
bodies of the cochlear nucleus.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.540
And you can design
electrodes to record

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.940
from either fibers
and no neurons,

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.170
or neurons and no fibers.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.950
If you were to use the latter,
and sample from the neurons

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:14.176
here, you would expect them
to respond to low frequencies.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.660
Whereas if you were to
record from way up there,

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.600
you'd expect the neurons
to record and respond

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.910
to high frequencies.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.285
And in fact, that's
what happens.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.420
And these kinds of electrode
mappings of the cochlear

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.735
nucleus have been
done for many years.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:38.230
These are data from the
'50s from the University

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.690
of Wisconsin.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:44.790
So what's done here
is an electrode is

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:50.300
put through the cochlear nucleus
and each 100 micrometers or so,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:55.040
it's stopped to record from,
in this case, cochlear nucleus

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:55.670
cells.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.430
And their CF's are indicated
by the many numbers

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.715
here above the recording track.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:08.200
And the CF, it looks
like, started at 0.5

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.572
and quickly went
up to 4 and went

00:29:10.572 --> 00:29:11.780
higher and higher and higher.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.770
And then went through a
region of the cochlear nucleus

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.440
where they didn't
sample any neurons.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:26.161
And then they went through high
CF's and went back down to low

00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:26.660
CF's.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.540
OK?

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.680
Because they went into a part
of the ventral cochlear nucleus

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.225
here, where the
tonotopic mapping

00:29:34.225 --> 00:29:35.350
was a little bit different.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.260
And you can see how
an electrode might

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.630
record from a different
projection of frequencies,

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.000
if you had the angle right,
going from the dorsal cochlear

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
nucleus into the ventral
cochlear nucleus.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.140
Because, as you can see, the
branches of the auditory nerve

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.610
fibers are quite
complicated here.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:59.090
They all come up and
they do a bifurcation.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.405
One part goes into
the VCN over here.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.700
Another part goes through
the VCN over here.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.190
And then finally
up into the DCN.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.150
OK, so the tonotopy of
the cochlear nucleus

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.800
is quite complicated.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.480
There isn't just
one tonotopic axis.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.810
DCN has one, and in the PVCN
you can have at least one.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.850
But this tonotopic organization
means the cochlear nucleus

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:29.160
neurons are also
tonotopically organized.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.330
So we've transferred
tonotopy from the periphery

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.120
through the auditory nerve
and entered the brain

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.550
in the cochlear nucleus.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:41.140
And if you go back to the
block diagram we just had,

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.790
cochlear nucleus projects onto
the superior olivary complex

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.740
nuclei in an organized fashion.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.375
So you have such tonotopic
mappings in the SOC.

00:30:51.375 --> 00:30:53.810
The SOC and cochlear
nucleus project

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.170
to the inferior colliculus, and
it's tonotopically organized.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.887
Inferior colliculus
projects to the thalamus

00:31:00.887 --> 00:31:03.220
and the medial geniculate,
they have beautiful tonotopy.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:07.010
The thalamus projects
to the auditory cortex.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.100
And you have at least a
half a dozen cortical fields

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.010
that have beautiful
tonotopy organization.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.420
So this tonotopic organization
is a fundamental organizing

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:24.180
pathway for the auditory
central nervous system.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.600
And it means,
basically, that you're

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.720
going to process certain
frequencies of sound over here

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.100
and other frequencies
of sound over here.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.545
Keep the processing of
different frequencies separate.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.990
And so why would
we want to do that?

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.970
Well, it's a matter
of debate, actually.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.480
There's speculation on that.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.400
But as we'll talk about
during sound localization,

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.300
you have different
frequency ranges

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.530
for the cues that are involved
in timing between the two ears

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.420
and level differences
between the two ears.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.350
Some work best at
low frequencies,

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.500
and others work best
at high frequencies.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.970
So maybe that is
the idea, that you

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:10.170
want to process those cues
for the location of sound

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.550
in different places
in the brain.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.270
So tonotopic organization is
typical of almost all nuclei

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.280
in the auditory pathway.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.360
So you could ask
the idea, are there

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.570
other mappings in
the other directions?

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:29.330
And it's not clear, in
general, whether there are.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.030
Along the cochlear
nucleus in this dimension

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:36.140
there are different types
of cells that we'll talk to.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.130
But we should
remember that there's

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.675
a third dimension coming in
and out of the screen here.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.120
What dimension would that be?

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.920
That would be medial- lateral.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.230
So lateral might
be close to you,

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.410
and medial would be far away.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.910
So that actually
brings up the idea

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:59.025
that we're looking at
two-dimensional pictures

00:32:59.025 --> 00:33:00.870
of three-dimensional structures.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:05.540
And so I just brought in this
reconstruction, or this model,

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.000
of the cochlear nucleus
to remind us of that.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.900
This is the cochlear
nucleus on the left side.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.910
And I believe this
is from a cat.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.750
This is many years old.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:26.090
And you can see, in black,
some nice little cells here

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.585
that are lined up in the layers
of the dorsal cochlear nucleus.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.740
So right here are the layers
of the dorsal cochlear nucleus.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.260
And much of this is
up dorsally here,

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.530
so I should explain to
you what plane of section

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:39.570
we're looking at here.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.170
This is the left
cochlear nucleus,

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.860
so it would be on my left side.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.500
And now, these are
horizontal sections.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:47.540
OK?

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.520
So for the compass for
horizontal sections,

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.860
dorsal is up.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.815
Ventral is down.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.780
Rostral is this way,
forward in the model.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.950
And caudal is back.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.530
Lateral is to the left.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.230
And medial, where
the rest of the brain

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:09.050
is, on the right side, would
be over the right here.

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.550
The cochlea is ventral
to the cochlear nucleus.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.590
And this is the auditory
nerve coming up.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.870
And the colors are
meant to represent

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:25.350
the different CF's of
the auditory nerve.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:29.295
So down here ventrally, we
have the orange, low CF's.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.730
In the middle we
have green, which

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.039
is the middle CF's right here.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:42.810
And very dorsally, which
would be way up in the top

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.900
of the screen in the
DCN, you have yellow,

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.170
so that's the high CF's.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.560
And so that's the model.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.280
So that's the DCN right here.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.795
And down here would be the VCN.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.630
And so this is a
model where there's

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:04.090
20 or 25 sections or so,
but many have been skipped.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.880
In a typical cochlear
nucleus, if you

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.750
were to cut it 50
micrometers you

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.560
might have a couple
hundred sections.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.270
So I'll just pass this around.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:19.970
But there are two other
colors besides the three

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:22.220
that represented the
auditory nerve fibers.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.800
I think-- what did I talk about?

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.430
Red, green, and yellow.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.101
Right?

00:35:30.101 --> 00:35:31.350
So there are two other colors.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:35.040
There's orange, and
there's blue on there.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.045
OK, so what's that?

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:43.290
Well, the auditory nerve
is not the only thing

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.390
that's providing input
to the cochlear nucleus.

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:49.760
Now you say, oh, this
guy made a mistake,

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.410
because on the block
diagram it showed

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.270
the only arrow going
into the cochlear nucleus

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:59.100
is from the spiral ganglion,
the auditory nerve.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.740
All these other
arrows are coming out

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.820
of the cochlear nucleus.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.547
So what are the
three other colors

00:36:03.547 --> 00:36:04.880
that are not the auditory nerve?

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:09.940
Well, this is a diagram of the
so-called "ascending" auditory

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.591
system, from low to high.

00:36:12.591 --> 00:36:13.090
Right?

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:14.380
The cochlea is the lowest.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.825
The cochlear
nucleus is the next.

00:36:17.825 --> 00:36:19.950
And then we went up-- chung,
chung, chung-- all way

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.980
to the auditory cortex.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.060
Well, it turns out,
in all sensory systems

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:29.720
and all pathways there are
some direction and information

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.810
processing that goes
the opposite way.

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.230
Sometimes that's called the
descending auditory system.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.570
So there's, for
example, information

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.089
that starts in the
cortex and goes down

00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:42.130
to the medial geniculate.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.780
And those other colors
in the cochlear nucleus

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.900
represent inputs coming into
the cochlear nucleus that

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.060
are coming from higher
centers and going down

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.670
to this lowest level of
the auditory pathway.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.585
So those are so-called
"descending" inputs.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.530
And those are not
very well explored.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.900
Obviously, we know what
ascending input is doing.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.790
It's telling the brain there's a
sound and it's processing that.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.560
But why would the brain want
to send information down

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.650
to the lower levels?

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.461
Well, there are
lots of theories.

00:37:13.461 --> 00:37:15.585
We'll talk about them toward
the end of our course.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.930
But it has to do with the
brain controlling inputs coming

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:20.990
into it.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.080
And there even inputs
from the brain going out

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.620
as far as the cochlea out
to the auditory periphery.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.205
So those are what those other
colors are in the model.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.630
Now we get to the
part of the lecture

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.390
where the cochlear nucleus
becomes very, very complicated.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:47.985
The anatomical cell types.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.930
And this is where Dorothy
might say to Toto,

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:55.160
"I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore."

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:55.660
OK?

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.200
Everything was really
simple in Kansas.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.640
In the auditory nerve-- sorry
if somebody's from Kansas,

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.670
here-- but the auditory
nerve is very simple

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.305
and the cochlear nucleus
becomes infinitely more complex.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:14.265
And so here is an example
of how complex it is.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:20.720
This is the auditory
nerve coming in and making

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.640
its bifurcation to go into
the VCN and into the DCN.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.470
And those drawings we
had before were just

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.135
sort of stick figures.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:35.690
And they didn't show all
these nice little endings

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:39.710
onto this whole variety of
cochlear nucleus neurons here.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:43.130
So how many cochlear
nucleus types are there?

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:44.700
There's about 10 of them.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:48.225
So that brings me
to today's reading.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.940
I guess I'm developing
this tradition here

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.380
of bringing a different
book every lecture

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.230
and reading from it.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.900
So this won't take long.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.230
This book is called The
Primary Acoustic Nuclei.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.470
So that's another word
for the cochlear nuclei.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.300
And it's by Raphael
Lorente De No,

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.550
who was a Spanish
neuro-anatomist at first,

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.545
and did a lot of work
on the cochlear nucleus.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.210
And then during the
Spanish Civil War,

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.130
he said, well, I
better get out of here.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:26.640
So he came to United States
and did a lot of work

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.510
on axonal conduction and
physiological measures.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.710
And it says in the
introduction that he put away

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.430
his anatomical drawings
ever after maybe

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.660
publishing one or two papers.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.890
And he had a whole
big file of them

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:44.200
in a manuscript, ready to
go, and he stuck it away

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.140
in a closet for about 30 years.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.110
He dug it out, and
finally published this.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.180
So a lot of this stuff was
done in the 1920s and '30s

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.760
and later published.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:01.860
In fact, the copyright
date for this book is 1981.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.720
And the inscription in
the front of the book

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.960
says December
20-something, 1980.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.960
So this is important,
because this

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.120
is a book owned by Nelson
Yuan-Sheng Kiang, who

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.950
started this course,
904, with Dr. Schiller

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.880
back in the 1980s and '90s.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.250
Nelson was very good friends
with the author, here,

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.490
and when the author
published the book

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.170
he promised Nelson to give
him the very first copy that

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.640
came off the printing press.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.192
So this is the first
copy in the original run.

00:40:35.192 --> 00:40:36.650
It's not only a
first edition, it's

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:38.710
the first of the first edition.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:42.440
And the inscription here--
Nelson put December 1980--

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.925
is actually a year before--
a month before the copyright

00:40:45.925 --> 00:40:46.480
date.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.090
So this really,
really a special book.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.950
So these pictures
here, as you can

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.840
see-- you can judge
this book by its cover.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:00.540
These pictures are the
beautifully complex

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.680
incoming auditory
nerve fibers-- which

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.430
are drawn in orange here--
bifurcating and showing

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:10.520
the many, many types of endings
on the cochlear nucleus cells.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.810
And that's summarized
by the reading here.

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.510
This is the very first
sentence of the book.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.060
"Each neuron in the
ganglion of Corti"--

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.820
that's the spiral ganglion--
"gives rise to two nerve

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.480
fibers, which, according
to their destination,

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.260
are either called peripheral"--
those are the ones that are

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.610
contacting the hair cells
we talked about last time--

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:33.170
"or central"-- which we were
talking about right here.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.010
"The peripheral fibers,
at times called dendrites,

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.620
penetrate the organ of Corti.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.960
They form sensory
or afferent endings

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.130
in contact with the hair cells.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:48.470
The central fibers, after a
relatively long trajectory

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:53.910
in the cochlear nerve, enter
the primary cochlear nuclei,

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:58.200
where they form elaborate
sets of endings."

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.759
OK, that's the reading for
today, and we pass it around.

00:42:00.759 --> 00:42:02.175
You can enjoy the
pretty pictures.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:07.540
So these are the
elaborate sets of endings

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.740
on the elaborate variety
of cochlear nucleus cells.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.740
And one of this type
of elaborate endings

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.820
is called a large end bulb.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:21.900
That's the very top one there.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:29.280
And the other name
for an end bulb--

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:38.335
so, it's large end bulb--
it is the end ball of Held.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.260
Because Held was the early
German neuro-anatomist

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.960
who first noticed
this huge ending.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:53.990
So this ending is so
big that you can hardly

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:57.020
see the cochlear nucleus
cell that it envelops.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.860
Here's another drawing
of the large end bulb,

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.220
and there's a scale bar.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:08.035
The cochlear nucleus cell is
20 micrometers in diameter.

00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:10.900
OK?

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:17.770
So you could say that's the
largest ending in the cochlear

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:18.342
nucleus.

00:43:18.342 --> 00:43:19.800
Or you could say
that's the largest

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.080
ending in the auditory pathway.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.420
Or you could say that's the
largest ending in the brain.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.960
And you'd be right
with all those claims.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.770
So this is a huge ending
from the auditory nerve fiber

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:38.770
onto the cochlear nucleus
cell, way at the tip.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:45.580
And we can just go back
to the previous drawing.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.650
These are stick figures
where most of the endings

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:51.620
are dropped off for the
purposes of clarity.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.830
But way out of the tip of
the auditory nerve fiber

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:59.310
these end bolts of Held are so
big that you can see them even

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:01.870
with this really
low-magnification picture

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.258
of the auditory nerve fibers.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:15.790
OK And they go onto a particular
type of cochlear nucleus

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.535
cell, called a spherical cell.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.270
And in parentheses, that type
of cell is called a bushy cell.

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:26.315
Why are there two names?

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.300
Well, this is kind
of a long story,

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:35.255
but there are two main
techniques to look at--

00:44:35.255 --> 00:44:38.980
or there were, in
the 1950s and '60s--

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.710
to look at cells in the brain.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.265
And one of them was
to use a Nissl stain.

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.759
You can cut your
section of the brain,

00:44:57.759 --> 00:44:59.300
cut your section of
cochlear nucleus,

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.560
put your Nissl
stain on it, and you

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.800
can see very beautiful
staining of all the neurons

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.450
in the cochlear nucleus.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:07.670
Some of them look round.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.280
The central nucleus.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.970
And they were called spherical
cells because they're so nice

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:16.470
and round.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:29.840
And this work was done by a
pioneering neuroscientist who

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.970
everybody before-- didn't draw
this very well-- everybody

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:35.630
before thought all the
cochlear nucleus cells just

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:36.990
look like one type.

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.520
They look about the same.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:45.490
This neuroscientist, whose
name is Kirsten Osen,

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.489
was the first
person in the 1950s

00:45:47.489 --> 00:45:49.280
to look at sections of
the cochlear nucleus

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.900
and say, oh, those actually
don't look exactly the same!

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.730
Some are spherical.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.543
Some look like octopus.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:03.910
Here's a cell Kirsten called
the octopus cell, because it

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:07.770
was sort of eccentric, and
these little appendages

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:12.120
coming off of it-- which were
the dendrites-- all came off

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.611
from one side, like the
tentacles of the octopus come

00:46:14.611 --> 00:46:15.985
off from one side
of the octopus.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.550
And this big nucleus,
right in the center, to her

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.211
looked like the
eye of the octopus.

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:21.710
Right?

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:29.600
Some of the cochlear nucleus
cells were multipolar.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.430
Here's one called the giant
multipolar cell of the DCN.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:37.564
And a pole just means that
something came off the cell,

00:46:37.564 --> 00:46:38.730
and those are the dendrites.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.580
OK?

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.990
The Nissl stain doesn't stay
in the dendrites very well.

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.700
If it did, the whole
cochlear nucleus

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.210
would be black because there
are dendrites everywhere.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:52.560
But it stains the
cell body very nicely.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.420
So what does the
Nissl stain stain?

00:46:55.420 --> 00:47:02.880
It stains DNA, RNA,
and some protein.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.830
Which are, of
course, found mostly

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:11.180
in the cell body of the cell.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.330
So it gives you a good look
at the cell body of the cell.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.030
Not a good look
at the dendrites,

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:18.980
because they don't have
as much DNA and RNA.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.220
And hardly any look at the axon.

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.780
The axons are invisible.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.140
But for classifying
cells, it's really great,

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.499
because you have every
single cell stained,

00:47:28.499 --> 00:47:29.540
and you can look at them.

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:33.045
Here's a cell called
the globular cell.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.100
And that is a little bit
like a spherical cell,

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.930
but it's more oblong.

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:40.850
Here are some other
multipolar cells.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.370
Here's a cell called
the pyramidal cell.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:46.240
So I should have said
that the Nissl designation

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.060
of these cells is given
non-parenthetically.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:50.740
OK?

00:47:50.740 --> 00:48:00.320
So you have, by Nissl, spherical
cells, multipolar cells--

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.550
here's another kind of
multipolar cell-- globular

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.930
cell, octopus cell,
and pyramidal cells.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.950
So those are the cells I
would like you to know.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.930
Those of the important
types of cells.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.410
Let me write that down.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.040
The view graph is
a little bit more--

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:28.494
it makes more distinctions than
I care to make for this class.

00:48:28.494 --> 00:48:29.410
So you have spherical.

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:36.770
These are cells in
the cochlear nucleus.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:39.790
Spherical cells.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.455
You have multipolar cells.

00:48:44.795 --> 00:48:45.545
You have globular.

00:48:49.056 --> 00:48:50.123
You have octopus.

00:48:53.467 --> 00:48:54.425
And you have pyramidal.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.530
Right?

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:04.560
I mean, since scientists
are classifiers,

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.970
you have sub-types
of each of these.

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:09.780
OK, you could just
keep sub-typing

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:10.950
as much as you want to.

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:12.670
But these are the
main types that we

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.780
want to pay attention
to for our course.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.480
And these are Nissl stained.

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.540
Now along comes another
person and wants

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.750
to make his mark on
science, and says,

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.980
I'm going to use a
different type of stain

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.290
and look at the cochlear
nucleus in a different way.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:40.420
And his name was-- his
name is-- Kent Morest.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:48.477
And he worked at Harvard
for quite a while,

00:49:48.477 --> 00:49:50.435
and then went to the
University of Connecticut.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.230
And so his stain that he used
was called the Golgi stain.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.240
And many of the pictures
in the book I passed around

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.230
were Golgi stains of fibers.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:09.420
He wanted to look at Golgi
stains of cochlear nucleus

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.530
cells and compare them
to the Nissl stain.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.570
So what does the Golgi stain do?

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:15.560
Does anybody know?

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.880
Or who was Golgi?

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:20.120
Yes.

00:50:21.542 --> 00:50:23.912
AUDIENCE: Golgi
stains the whole cell,

00:50:23.912 --> 00:50:26.440
but it doesn't stain all cells.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.570
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:30.260
In fact, in the
ultimate case, you

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.470
can put your brain
in the Golgi solution

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:34.200
and come back a
couple months later

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.280
and you could just have one
neuron in the entire brain

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:37.780
stained.

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:42.900
But the good thing about
that is that the neuron cell

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:48.280
body, it's dendrites, and
a good portion of its axon

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.825
pick up the stain and
they stain it jet black.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:58.670
So the Golgi stain
takes a spherical cell

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:03.540
and transforms it into something
that's really beautiful.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:06.380
The cell body is
completely filled.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:06.910
It's black.

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:08.275
I should be using black.

00:51:09.452 --> 00:51:10.835
This is a black stain.

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.640
And you can see, coming
from the spherical cell, one

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.600
major dendrite.

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.500
It's a big one.

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.310
And it, very close
to the cell body,

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:26.550
ramifies into thousands
of little bitty dendrites.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.710
Like this.

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:34.970
Where this scale might
be 20 micrometers.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:38.570
And so the dendrite is sticking
very close to the cell body.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.770
To Kent Morest, this
looked like-- he

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:45.270
must've been planting
stuff in his yard,

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.430
because this looked like a bush.

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:50.310
You go to the nursery,
and you pick up a bush.

00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:51.690
Here's the top of the bush.

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:52.440
This is the trunk.

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:57.990
And this is the root ball
the nursery people bundle up

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.070
for you, or this is in a pot.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.630
So this looked like a bush.

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:04.390
So he called it a bushy cell.

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:11.880
And so in parentheses
on the view graph

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.940
there are the designations
that are given to these cells

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.010
in the Golgi stain, which
is all in parentheses there.

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.100
It looks completely
different, because you're

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.750
staining different
parts of the cell.

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:26.275
So let's make our little chart.

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:36.392
Spherical cells in the
Golgi stain are called bush.

00:52:36.392 --> 00:52:37.770
We'll put these in parentheses.

00:52:40.296 --> 00:52:40.795
Bushy cells.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:51.230
Multipolar cells are usually
called stellate because now,

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:55.590
instead of just the beginning
of the dendrite coming off,

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:58.080
you have long
expanses of dendrites

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.470
that go for 500
micrometers from the cell.

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:03.700
They can go across
the cochlear nucleus.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.330
And they look like
beautiful, twinkling stars.

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:07.880
At least they did
to Kent Morest.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:15.930
Globular cells look exactly like
spherical cells in the Golgi

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:18.780
stain, and they were
given the same name.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.600
Bushy cells.

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:26.920
Octopus cells are so
clear, what they are,

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.155
they're given the same name.

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:31.260
Pyramidal cells are
sometimes called fusiform.

00:53:34.902 --> 00:53:36.485
Fusiform means sort
of spindle-shaped.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.920
They just look different
in the Golgi stain.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.650
Now, this is sort of old stuff.

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:51.180
And so now, when somebody talks
about a certain type of cell

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.970
in the cochlear nucleus, they
use a hybrid terminology.

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:59.690
They'll say, "I was recording
from spherical bushy cells."

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.630
So they use both names.

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:06.250
Or, "I think I was recording
from globular bushy cells."

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:09.830
Or, "My study is on
multipolar stellate cells."

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.330
OK?

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:16.030
Or, "These cells in the DCN
are pyramidal fusiform cells."

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:19.780
So they use a hybrid
terminology and they

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:22.298
concatenate, if
you will, the two.

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:31.740
OK, so these are the
cell types, if you will.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:39.410
Now let's go into the
cochlear nucleus and record,

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.580
with recording electrodes,
a sample not from fibers

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:43.635
but from cell bodies.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.020
And see what we get.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.300
I think that's what's next here.

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:51.010
Yes.

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:51.510
OK.

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.970
Where are these data from?

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:57.320
From Pfeiffer.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.450
So Pfeiffer worked with Nelson
Kiang, who owns that book.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:05.790
And they worked at MIT during
the 19-late-50s and 1960s.

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:09.980
And these were, again, some
of the first applications

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:11.600
of computers to neuroscience.

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:15.640
They said, well, what we
want to do from these cells

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.530
to classify them--
well, maybe they

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:21.330
used a whole bunch of different
schemes and all of them

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.520
didn't work out very
well, except this one.

00:55:24.741 --> 00:55:26.500
They said, for this
one, what we're

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.760
going to look at for these
units in the cochlear nucleus,

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.960
is not the tuning curves,
not their responses to this

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.780
or that.

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:37.660
We're going to look,
very shortly after we

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:40.690
turn the tone burst
on-- the tone burst

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:42.980
is the stimulation--
we're going to look

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.490
at the timing of spikes.

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:49.020
And so these are in the order
of millisecond intervals.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.920
In fact, some of the bins have
width less than a millisecond.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.420
OK?

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.960
They want to look very precisely
at the time pattern of spikes

00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.900
after you turn a sound on.

00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:02.380
So tone burst.

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.447
What is a tone burst?

00:56:03.447 --> 00:56:04.280
I've used that term.

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:09.010
So it's just-- I think we had,
earlier in the course, a tone

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:09.580
pip.

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:18.590
So a tone burst is just
sounds that to do this.

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:19.920
So it's a burst of tone.

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:22.505
Burst of a pure tone.

00:56:22.505 --> 00:56:25.600
And it looks like the duration
here is 25 milliseconds.

00:56:32.951 --> 00:56:33.450
OK.

00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:35.840
And all these neurons
are tuned, so you

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:42.160
want to use your sound
frequency at the CF.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.636
So within the tone,
versus the CF.

00:56:45.944 --> 00:56:49.140
You want to get spikes
coming from the neurons.

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.320
So you want to be at CF.

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.950
You want to above threshold.

00:56:52.892 --> 00:56:54.600
You turn your tone
burst on, and then you

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.460
have your computer
look at the spikes

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.600
and say when they occur in time.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.420
OK, so this is pretty important.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.785
So I have a pointer here.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.070
So how did this experiment work?

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:19.340
Well, here's data from one, two,
three, four different cochlear

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:20.105
nucleus neurons.

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:26.110
And from each neuron there
are two types of displays.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:29.960
This display on the top is
called a dot raster display.

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:35.690
And each little dot
signifies the time

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:39.060
of occurrence of a
spike, an impulse,

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.510
from the recorded neuron.

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:46.200
And on the Y-- down the
X-axis is the time axis.

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.920
So starting at zero is when
the tone burst went on.

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:54.450
Tone burst goes off at, looks
like, 40 milliseconds here.

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:56.700
And then there's an off
time when there's just

00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.640
silence for the last
40 milliseconds.

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.480
And the important
thing about this

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.200
is that this column
here shows you

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.540
that there wasn't just
one tone burst presented,

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.140
but there were many.

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:15.900
And these experiments can use
600 or even 1,000 tone bursts.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.850
Each time the
stimulus is turned on,

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:20.420
you give it a stimulus number.

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.870
So the very first tone burst
is stimulus number one.

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:27.040
And that's the first
dot raster here.

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.460
And the neuron fired a dozen
or so action potentials

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.086
at those times.

00:58:32.086 --> 00:58:34.210
And then it stopped firing,
except for a little bit

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:35.290
of spontaneous activity.

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.725
Then tone burst number
two was presented.

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:42.120
And the neuron's dot
raster for number two

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.665
is the next line down.

00:58:45.925 --> 00:58:47.550
Then you go through
your silent period,

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:48.758
and go back to the beginning.

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:51.110
Tone burst number
three was presented.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.505
And you get this
pattern of spikes.

00:58:53.505 --> 00:58:54.770
It's a little bit different.

00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:57.110
Each one looks like it's
a little bit different.

00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:58.783
Down here is tone
verse number 15.

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:01.030
OK?

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:03.217
And you get that dot
raster of spikes.

00:59:03.217 --> 00:59:05.425
And then you go through your
hundreds of tone bursts.

00:59:05.425 --> 00:59:10.060
And this might be tone burst
number 999 down at the bottom,

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.300
and you get that raster.

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:15.145
And you keep track
of all those dots.

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:20.310
And you have the computer
put them into bins here.

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:25.410
And this histogram
shows you the bins

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:29.440
where the number of action
potentials is along the Y-axis

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:29.940
now.

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:34.490
And the X-axis is
still displaying time.

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:38.635
And this horizontal line shows
you when the tone burst was on.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:47.780
So this type of histogram, which
is compiled from many stimulus

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:50.550
presentations and
many dot rasters,

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.393
are sometimes called
the PST histograms.

00:59:55.290 --> 01:00:12.160
And that stands for post-
or peristimulus time.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.680
Obviously, it's
a time histogram.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.610
Obviously, there's a stimulus.

01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:18.880
Why is this a post?

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.110
Well, the terminology
started up when

01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:24.150
you, instead of having a long
tone burst, have a click.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.526
So that when the click goes
on, it goes off real quickly

01:00:26.526 --> 01:00:27.900
and everything is
post- stimulus.

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:31.870
So it's really, in
this case, a peri--

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:34.390
around the stimulus--
time histogram.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:36.560
Does everybody
explain-- Does everybody

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.040
know what I'm
talking about here?

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.580
About what this display is?

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.470
OK.

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:45.120
So you can think
of this PST, then,

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.550
as reflecting the
average firing rate

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:50.790
as a function of
time for the neuron.

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:54.230
And quickly, you're not turning
the tone on for many seconds.

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:56.170
It's within a few milliseconds.

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:59.960
Within the first 40
milliseconds of when

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.410
the tone burst is turned on.

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:04.355
And it's an average response.

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:09.550
And here's data from one unit.

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:10.990
Here's data from another unit.

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:13.280
Now, even in the
dot raster you don't

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.710
need to worry about
averaging here.

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:18.190
This type of firing
is fundamentally

01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:22.340
different from the type of
firing we just talked about.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:24.470
It looked like on
every single tone burst

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:27.520
there was a kind of a
different firing pattern.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.800
Sort of random.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.200
As if you took your
pepper shaker and just

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.270
spread out some salt
and pepper here.

01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:38.240
There wasn't a real
organization to it.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.100
Sure, there's a higher
firing during the tone burst,

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.830
after a little latency.

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:45.600
But over here, there's a
real nice pattern to it.

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:49.760
And it looks like in this unit,
which was called the Chopper

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.460
unit, even from the very
first stimulus number, it went

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:59.960
"pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
pop" if you slowed way down.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.150
Same for the second.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.150
Same for the 15th.

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.163
Same for the 999th.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.130
This Chopper unit has a
very organized and precise

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:10.680
temporal pattern of firing.

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:16.070
When you do the averaging
and get the PST,

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:20.410
you can see this very nice
so-called chopping peaks

01:02:20.410 --> 01:02:25.140
in the PST histogram
for this Chopper unit

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.560
as compared to this other unit.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.770
Here is a unit where you can
also see, from the dot raster

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:35.340
display, that this unit
fired a spike and took

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.410
a substantial pause--
which gives it

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:43.040
a name, the Pauser unit--
before it started firing again.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.620
And here is the PST histogram
from a so-called Pauser

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:49.880
unit, where the pause
is a substantial pause.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.190
It's 10 milliseconds or so.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.560
And finally, here's a unit
called an Onset unit, which

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.020
fires only one spike
at the onset of each

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.920
and every sound stimulus.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.280
Each and every tone burst.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.870
And obviously gets
its name, Onset unit.

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:08.970
Now, let's go back
to this first unit.

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:09.840
Why?

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.350
I glossed over the name.

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:13.900
Why is it called the
Primarylike unit?

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:19.640
Well, if you go and record from
primary auditory nerve fibers--

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.720
and where does that
terminology come from?

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.520
Well, in the auditory system
you have the hair cell,

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.630
you have the nerve
fiber-- so the nerve fiber

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:31.070
is the very first,
or primary neuron.

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:32.770
Then you go into
the cochlear nucleus

01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:34.490
and you have the
secondary neuron.

01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:36.830
So really, this is
a secondary neuron.

01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:38.970
But the pattern,
the PST pattern,

01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:41.840
that you get in some of these
cochlear nucleus neurons

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.880
looks just like primary
auditory nerve fibers.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.930
Except they have a little
bit longer in latency.

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:51.610
So this one is called
Primarylike unit.

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.400
It's not a primary.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.377
It's a secondary
neuron, but it's like.

01:03:56.377 --> 01:03:57.210
Primarylike pattern.

01:03:59.020 --> 01:03:59.520
OK.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.710
So in the cochlear nucleus,
you have these different types

01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:04.930
of firing patterns.

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:10.212
And let's make a list of them.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.630
Maybe I'll make
the list over here.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.520
So these are the unit types.

01:04:32.181 --> 01:04:32.680
Primarylike.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:38.875
Chopper.

01:04:43.695 --> 01:04:44.195
Pauser.

01:04:47.215 --> 01:04:48.205
And Onset.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.300
Those are the four basic types.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.910
Now, again, scientists
are classifiers,

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:59.770
so you-- if you read the
literature-- you will find

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:03.060
some units called
Primarylike with notch.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:09.690
So those are Primarylike units,
but right after the first peak

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:11.310
they have a little notch.

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:13.040
Don't worry about that.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.466
It's basically a
Primarylike unit.

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:27.730
Now, we have two interesting
classification schemes here.

01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:30.270
One is how the unit
responds to sound.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:34.755
One is how the neuron
looks in the microscope.

01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:39.010
Can we make a correspondence
between the two?

01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:42.450
Now, one possible
outcome could be,

01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:43.860
"There is no correspondence."

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:44.780
Right?

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.320
Could be that spherical
cells can produce

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.139
any of those kind of
responses to sound.

01:05:49.139 --> 01:05:51.430
Well, obviously, I wouldn't
be devoting a whole lecture

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.970
to this if that
were the outcome.

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:56.920
And in fact, the
cochlear nucleus

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.830
is a place where we can really
correlate anatomy of the cells

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:04.340
with their physiological
unit types.

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:06.510
And how is that done?

01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:08.500
Well, there are
several different ways.

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:13.720
And this graph
shows you one way.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.460
That is by going to different
parts of the cochlear nucleus.

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:22.910
Where the cell types are
not equally distributed,

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:25.565
you find that the unit types
are not equally distributed.

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.295
And this works very well for
certain areas of the cochlear

01:06:30.295 --> 01:06:30.795
nucleus.

01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:35.000
For example, this area
right here called OC.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.855
That's the area called
the octopus cell area.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.130
What's found there?

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.090
That's basically where you
have all the octopus cells.

01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:51.950
They're found in a particular
part of the ventral cochlear

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:52.710
nucleus.

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:55.055
OK, let's go record there
with our electrodes.

01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:59.520
And what kind of PST
pattern do you get there?

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.442
Well these are numbered types.

01:07:01.442 --> 01:07:02.775
Where number one is Primarylike.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:05.590
Number two is Chopper.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.990
And these are sub-types of
Onset-- three, four, and five.

01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:12.300
And number six is Pauser.

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:18.460
In the octopus cell area
you get Onset responses.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.330
OK, so let's start
drawing some lines.

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:33.110
Octopus cells then
produce Onset patterns.

01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:37.940
Now, that's true.

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.480
You can really sink
your hat on it.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.300
How about going the other way?

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:48.090
Do you always get Onset response
from just octopus cells?

01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:50.350
Or how about some of
these other types?

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:56.210
Well, going the other way, you
do have a few multipolar cells

01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:59.950
that can produce the Onset type.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.200
And how is that shown?

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.590
Well, octopus cells
are just there,

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:05.550
but you can get
some Onset responses

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:07.570
in various places in
the cochlear nucleus.

01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:10.120
And I'll tell you
how this dashed arrow

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.874
was drawn in a minute.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:17.710
So Onset units are not
only octopus cells.

01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:22.240
Octopus cells are only
producing the Onset pattern.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.626
That's the correct
way to say it.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:27.590
Right here.

01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:28.089
OK.

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:32.880
Now, elsewhere in
the cochlear nucleus,

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.550
the cells tend to be mixed up.

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:38.970
And you can't make very
good regional distinctions--

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:41.664
in spite of what's said here--
with one other exception.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.020
In the dorsal
cochlear nucleus there

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.190
is a layer called the
fusiform cell layer.

01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:53.190
And so it has the
pyramidal fusiform cells.

01:08:54.420 --> 01:09:02.109
And there you get Pausers.

01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:05.439
And that's pretty
much the only place--

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:07.529
well, not completely
the only place--

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:10.720
you get some deeper in the DCN.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.810
But that's very good evidence
that the pyramidal cells

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:18.580
produce a Pauser
type of response.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.822
You get no Pauser
responses anywhere

01:09:20.822 --> 01:09:22.155
in the ventral cochlear nucleus.

01:09:24.609 --> 01:09:28.399
Now, why am I messing around
with these messy data when,

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:31.689
to a certain extent, most of
the cochlear nucleus cells

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:33.040
are all mixed up together?

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.850
Well, you can
build up these data

01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:38.100
from thousands of
recordings, and you

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.109
can look at hundreds
of cochlear nuclei.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:43.240
You can assure yourself
this is the only place

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.530
that octopus cells are found.

01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:47.689
You can record from
thousands of units

01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:50.681
and not find too many
Onset responses elsewhere

01:09:50.681 --> 01:09:51.680
in the cochlear nucleus.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.820
So you have the strength
of numbers behind you

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:56.615
if you use this
type of approach.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.035
We talked last time about
single unit labeling.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.890
Why not apply that to the
cochlear nucleus neurons?

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:06.970
OK.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:09.520
The way you do that is
you fill your electrode

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.450
with neural tracer.

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.470
You go in.

01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:17.180
You record the CF
from the tuning curve.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.340
Then you turn a tone on
and you get the unit type.

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.000
Is it a Primarylike
or is it a Chopper?

01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:26.250
That's a very elegant way
to answer this question,

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:29.180
and it's been done, but it's
also extremely difficult.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.280
For some reason, recording
from the cochlear nucleus

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.860
neurons with the type of
pipette [? electrode ?] that's

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.390
necessary to have your
neural tracer in it,

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:42.990
it's very difficult.

01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:45.780
You get the recording and
then you go inside the cell

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:49.930
to inject it, and it tears
a big hole in the membrane.

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:51.620
And so the neuron
stops responding.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.787
Have you lost the neuron?

01:10:52.787 --> 01:10:53.620
Are you still in it?

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.250
You don't know.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:58.850
OK, so that's very
difficult to do,

01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:02.350
but it has been done on
this certain select number

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:02.870
of neurons.

01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:05.430
And here's some data from
single unit labeling.

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:11.440
So here is from a study--
this is from a study

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.830
by Bill Rhode et al at the
University of Wisconsin,

01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:18.070
in which he recorded
from cochlear

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:21.220
nucleus, Primarylike neurons.

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.870
That's clearly a
Primarylike PST.

01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:27.060
He injected and
labeled the neuron

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.580
and recovered in the
ventral cochlear nucleus.

01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:33.590
And there's what the
labeled neuron looks like.

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:37.460
There's a big cell with
one primary dendrite,

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.520
with lots of ramifications
close by the cell.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.870
It's not as clear as the bushy
cell I drew on the board,

01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:46.110
but clearly this
is a bushy cell,

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:50.080
because all the
dendrites are close by.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:56.680
Now, I'm using the nomenclature
from the Golgi stain

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.610
because, clearly, that cell
is stained in its entirety.

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:03.480
The cell body is black.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:08.220
The dendrites, every little
type of dendrite ramification

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.780
is filled black.

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.930
That big thread-like thing
going right underneath the title

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:15.850
labeled neuron is the axon.

01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:18.830
You can trace the axon
wherever you want to.

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:21.390
This is Golgi-like
labeling that you

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:25.060
get from filling these
cells with neural tracer.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.320
Clearly, that's a bushy cell.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.860
And it had a
Primarylike pattern.

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.350
Now, if you look in
all the literature,

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:36.570
maybe you get about eight
or 10 filled bushy cells.

01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:40.420
And people have spent many
years trying to do this.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:43.240
You see papers published
with just a half a dozen

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.210
labeled neurons.

01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:45.560
It's very difficult to do.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.120
But clearly, that
Primarylike pattern

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.010
came from that bushy cell.

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:54.910
This Chopper pattern-- this
is a subtype of Chopper--

01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:56.900
came from the stellate cell.

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:59.780
Clearly, rather than
one primary dendrite,

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.300
it had a half a dozen.

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.920
And the dendrites went forever.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.020
Here's a neuron that
sent its dendrites

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.370
all across the cochlear nucleus.

01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:10.101
Clearly a different type
of cell-- a stellate cell.

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:15.810
OK, so let's draw an arrow
there for those two neurons.

01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:21.485
Bushy cells.

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.650
Spherical bushy cells.

01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:33.007
We actually don't know
that it's spherical-- can

01:13:33.007 --> 01:13:33.840
produce Primarylike.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.975
Stellates can produce
Chopping patterns.

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:46.270
And these other
correlations-- octopus

01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:50.140
cells correlated with Onset,
we already established.

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:54.680
And Pauser types correlated
with pyramidal fusiform cells,

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.510
we already established.

01:13:56.510 --> 01:14:02.050
So we here have a nice
chart of correlations

01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:04.280
between the anatomy
and the physiology.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.040
And probably, this can be done
much better in cochlear nucleus

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.857
than any other
center in the brain.

01:14:08.857 --> 01:14:10.190
Auditory system or non-auditory.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.280
OK?

01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:17.250
Now, you should be a
little bit skeptical of me,

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:21.410
as scientists, when I
give you these really

01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:23.295
nice classification schemes.

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:35.070
So what is really the difference
between a globular bushy

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:38.150
cell and a spherical bushy cell?

01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:41.580
You should be thinking,
"Can that guy really

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:42.710
make that distinction?"

01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:45.480
OK, sure, some
things are spheres,

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.030
and some things are oblong.

01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:48.685
But what about
something in between?

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.890
Are there intermediates in
this classification scheme?

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:57.490
So let me give you just an
arbitrary-- we classify people

01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:58.996
by the color of
their hair, right?

01:14:58.996 --> 01:14:59.746
There are blondes.

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:02.700
There black-haired people.

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.720
There are brown-haired people.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.540
There are red-head.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.540
But then you have a lot
of intermediates, right?

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.250
You have dirty blondes.

01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:13.930
You have people who
have darkish brown hair,

01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:15.995
not quite black,
but not quite brown.

01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:18.940
What are you going to do
with all those intermediates?

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.440
What are you going
to do with people

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.560
who are losing their hair?

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.866
Problems with
classification schemes

01:15:24.866 --> 01:15:26.490
are if you have a
lot of intermediates.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.110
And then these
things break down.

01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:32.340
Instead of being a
nice, firm category

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.980
they become really
squishy, with a lot

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:37.030
of intermediates
between the two.

01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:42.390
It turns out, here, that
that's not a huge problem,

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:44.335
although it is
sometimes a problem.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:47.970
The aficionados who
do this for a living

01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:51.420
have metrics where
you can measure

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:56.670
the sphericity of a cell or
the oblateness of a cell.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.040
You can measure things in
the physiological response.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:07.830
Like if it's a pause longer
than two milliseconds,

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:09.870
it's a Pauser unit.

01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:12.230
But if the pause is less
than two milliseconds,

01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:15.080
then it's a notch,
or something else.

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:17.710
OK.

01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:22.340
So it turns out that there
aren't very many intermediates

01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:25.770
or things that are hard
to classify in these two

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:29.160
kinds of classification scheme,
which is very important.

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:35.850
Another important thing is what
do these classifications then

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:36.350
predict?

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.880
If you're recording
from a Primarylike unit,

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:45.190
and you say it's one of
these kinds of bushy cells,

01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:46.190
what does it predict?

01:16:46.190 --> 01:16:51.690
Well, one thing it predicts
is where the cells project to.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.470
Now, that's given to you a
little bit on this diagram

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:56.840
here, by this category.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:01.290
That says acoustic stria
for the efferent axon.

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:03.180
And so now we're
using terminology

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.190
that is centric to
the cochlear nucleus.

01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:07.255
Efferent means going out
of the cochlear nucleus.

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.470
And there are three
major pathways

01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:12.000
going out of the
cochlear nucleus.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.285
The ventral,
intermediate, and dorsal.

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:19.060
And different types
of cells project

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:23.650
in one or another, but not all
three of these output pathways.

01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:27.860
So knowing the type of cell,
knowing its response pattern,

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:32.060
I can predict where
the axon is going.

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:35.260
So the predictability of
the classification scheme,

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:38.160
if it predicts things
very well, means

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.930
that it's a good
classification scheme.

01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:42.600
But when somebody gives you
a classification scheme,

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.100
you should always
be thinking, "Now,

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.580
is it a good
classification scheme?

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.742
Or it is just
something cooked up?"

01:17:48.742 --> 01:17:50.450
Meaning, are there
lots of intermediates?

01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:55.925
So speaking of
projections of the axons.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.325
This is what I want
to end up with today.

01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:05.490
Especially in terms
of the parallel

01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:08.730
pathways that we talked
about at the beginning

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:09.655
of today's lecture.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.460
So here's another
even different type

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.570
of diagram of the
cochlear nucleus.

01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:18.460
This is the cochlear
nucleus on the left side.

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:21.190
This is a little
bit of the cochlear

01:18:21.190 --> 01:18:23.340
nucleus on the right side.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:27.360
And so we have a whole bunch
of the auditory pathway,

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.500
the superior olivary complex,
and the inferior colliculus

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.520
more in the center of the brain.

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.230
And now you can
get a sense of why

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:39.155
the superior olive
is really a complex.

01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:41.460
Here are parts of it.

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.025
Lateral superior olive.

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:45.505
Medial superior olive.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.010
Medial nucleus of
the trapezoid body.

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:52.350
Lateral nucleus of
the trapezoid body.

01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:55.570
And that's just part of the
superior olivary complex.

01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:58.220
It's really a whole
bunch of different nuclei

01:18:58.220 --> 01:18:59.355
all glommed together.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:04.430
The point of this slide,
though, is the projections

01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:07.030
of the cochlear nucleus
neurons, in terms

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:09.840
of where they send axons to.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:16.190
So here are the spherical
bushy cells, right here.

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.790
That's its diagram here.

01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:21.170
And this little
lending is supposed

01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:24.410
to be the giant end bulb
of Held that they receive.

01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:27.880
The spherical bushy cell on
the left cochlear nucleus

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.730
projects up here into the
left superior olivary complex.

01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:36.280
And one of its most
important places to end up

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.330
is in the medial superior olive.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.320
Part of the superior
olivary complex.

01:19:43.230 --> 01:19:47.690
And it continues on and
goes across the midline

01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:50.960
and also projects into the
right medial superior olive.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:58.930
It's not diagrammed here, but
analogous spherical bushy cells

01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:01.760
on the right side come
in and do the same thing.

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.830
The medial superior
olive is the place--

01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:11.310
that we'll study in about a
week-- that receives input

01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.345
from the two sides from
the spherical bushy cells.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.580
And it compares the timing of
the inputs from the two sides.

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:23.440
It says, oh, if I heard
the sound on the left side

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:27.380
a little bit earlier,
then that sound source

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.530
was located to the
left side of my body.

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:36.410
But if the MSO gets input
from the right side first,

01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:38.850
it's almost certainly the
case that the sound source

01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:41.490
was located on the
right side of the body.

01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:44.390
And it'd activate the right
ear and the right cochlear

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:46.700
nucleus and its axons first.

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:50.860
And by the time the sound leaked
around to the left ear-- it

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.670
a longer time to travel,
here-- and started

01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:57.320
to activate the left pathway,
it was a lagging signal

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:59.520
and came into the MSO
a little bit later.

01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:03.860
So the MSO, then,
receiving input

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:09.260
from these two spherical bushy
cells from the two cochlear

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:12.660
nuclei, does an
interesting comparison

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.775
and helps us localize the
sound using timing differences.

01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:21.440
There's probably
a pathway in here

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:24.070
that begins with the
globular bushy cells,

01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:28.160
where you use the differences
in level at the two ears

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.195
to localize sounds.

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.390
That's two out of maybe 10
different types of cells

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:36.610
that we really
know what they do.

01:21:36.610 --> 01:21:40.860
So the other eight or
so-- the pyramidal cells,

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.780
the small cells, the octopus
cells, the stellate cells--

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.230
we have no idea what they do.

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:47.730
OK?

01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:50.970
So all the rest of these
other parallel pathways,

01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:52.430
the function are unknown.

01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:55.600
We think they do something
in the sense of hearing,

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.200
but we're not sure what they do.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.910
So there's a lot of
interesting information left

01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:04.160
to be gleaned from these
parallel pathways coming out

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.160
of the cochlear nucleus.

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:07.020
OK?

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.540
So that's what I
want to end up with.

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.950
If there are any questions,
I'll take them now.

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:17.460
I also want to remind you
guys that next week, Monday

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.465
is a holiday, so there
won't be any class.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.930
So the next time we meet is a
week from today, on Wednesday.

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.150
And in that lecture,
we're going to talk

01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:29.770
about deafness and hearing
loss, and toward the end we'll

01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:33.130
have our demonstrator come in
to demonstrate her cochlear

01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:33.650
implants.

01:22:33.650 --> 01:22:35.670
So that's an important
class, not to be missed.

01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:39.120
OK, have a good mini-vacation.

MICHAEL SHORT:
Well, as promised,

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:24.830
we're gonna cover no
new material today.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.512
We've just hit the end of
part two of the course,

00:00:27.512 --> 00:00:28.970
which I think you'll
agree with me,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.890
was probably the most
technically challenging part.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.460
Who would disagree, I wonder?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.880
I didn't think so.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.060
So I wanted a bit of review and
help you guys out with problem

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.100
set seven.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.257
Since I've got a
couple of fun problems,

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:44.090
I think they're fun
because they're actually

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.330
fairly realistic, like the
last one, will it blend,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.310
the AP 1000 edition.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.120
Well, you'll actually analyze if
given the actual specification

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.280
sheet of an AP1000
reactor, which

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.830
is a modern reactor that's
being built now, can

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.300
you determine it's k-effective
using the the two energy group

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.690
approximation.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.520
And just to show you guys
that this isn't crazy,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.480
I've got the AP1000
spec sheet up here.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.580
So who got a chance to
take a look at p-set seven?

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.060
Good, that's a lot of hands.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.607
All right, I highly
recommend everyone look

00:01:20.607 --> 00:01:21.440
at it ahead of time.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.065
Because it is the
doozy, and it will be

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:24.630
the last doozy of this course.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.373
So part three of the
course is lighter.

00:01:27.373 --> 00:01:28.790
Because most of
your other courses

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.370
are going to go nuts after
Thanksgiving, as far as I know,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.450
right?

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.000
Yeah, this one's not.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.870
So I'm doing my best to
equalize your total course

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.300
load this semester by
making this course crazy now

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.000
and lighten up when
final season comes.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.467
AUDIENCE: The real MVP.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.680
MICHAEL SHORT: So I've got the
spec sheet for the AP1000 right

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.738
here.

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:55.280
That actually goes
over a description

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.113
of what the core is
like, the materials that

00:01:57.113 --> 00:01:59.210
are used, how many
fuel rods there are,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.070
how many assemblies
there are, basically

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.170
what the core is made of.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.810
And what I want to do is jump
to the end where they actually

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.570
talk about the analytical
techniques used

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.939
in the core design.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.320
And what I want to show you
is for the nuclear design

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.620
of the core to get axial
power distributions,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.350
look at that, two-group
diffusion theory.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.720
The same stuff that we
just learned right here.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.060
For axial power
distribution control rod

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.060
worth's one-dimensional
two-group diffusion theory--

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.490
these are problems that you
can solve with the stuff

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.303
that we've done over the
past week and a half.

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:32.720
They have a little
more complexity

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.360
in that they keep all the
spatial variance in there.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.600
So probably done with
computers, however they

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.280
make the same
equations that you do.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.890
So Westinghouse is making
the same assumptions

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.700
that we made in this course.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.576
They have a lot more
complexity in that they're--

00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:49.670
you know, we just
had cross sections

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.480
or a macroscopic cross sections
as a function of energy,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.960
but you may also think about
it as a function of position

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.700
and a function of
temperature, since,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.950
as we started alluding to, on--

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.700
it wasn't today-- on
Wednesday-- no, Tuesday.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.307
What day is it now?

00:03:06.307 --> 00:03:06.890
It's Thursday.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.080
Thank you, so it was
definitely on Tuesday.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.240
We started talking about
how cross sections change

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.510
with temperature.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.200
And so really if we want to go
crazy on that neutron transport

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.000
equation, these
cross sections will

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.587
be functions of energy,
temperature, and position.

00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:22.670
And so that's how this
reactor would have actually

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.420
been designed.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.640
But you're going to do
a simpler approximation

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.970
and take all of the information
about the core in an AP1000,

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.800
blend it, so homogenize
it, figure out

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.620
what the average
atomic fractions of all

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.110
the different things in
it are, and calculate

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.490
its k-effective, which I think
is a pretty cool problem to do.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.750
I haven't seen it done
in the courses here.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.490
But I want to see
how it turns out.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.990
And you might find
it's surprisingly

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.180
different from one.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.550
Because we make a lot a
lot of simplifications

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.100
that actually
matter quite a bit.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.680
But to help you parse
this spec sheet,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.786
well, actually why don't I
show you the problem first.

00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:04.110
And we'll go through a few
of the different things

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.320
that I've simplified the problem
to make it not so tedious.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.470
But I also want to make sure
you understand what to do.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.060
So the simple statement
is calculate k-effective

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.769
of the AP1000 using two-group
diffusion theory, which

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.620
means you've got a
criticality condition

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.170
from the two-group
approximation.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.260
And I'd like to go over
what that is right now.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.880
So let's write out, if
we had a two group--

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.450
so we have two energy
group equations

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.075
for gains and losses of neutrons
in the fast and thermal group.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.220
What would it look like?

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.220
What are the gain terms?

00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:43.620
AUDIENCE: Sigma
[INAUDIBLE] fast.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.410
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.220
There's going to be some
average nu times sigma

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.190
fission fast times
flux fast plus sigma

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.650
fission thermal
times flux thermal.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.990
Any other sources of
neutrons into the fast group?

00:05:07.322 --> 00:05:08.030
I don't think so.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.710
What about sinks?

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.535
How do neutrons
leave the fast group?

00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:16.410
AUDIENCE: Absorption.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.950
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yep, by absorption.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.425
How else?

00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:24.300
AUDIENCE: Scattering.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.250
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
scattering from the fast

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.300
to the thermal group.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.570
How else?

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.370
AUDIENCE: Leakage.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.470
MICHAEL SHORT: Leakage.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.270
So there'll be some
diffusion constant fast times

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.400
some fast geometric
buckling squared.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.680
And, yeah, I think that's it.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.980
No, that needs a
phi as well fast.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.900
OK, cool.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.610
What about the thermal group?

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.065
What are the sources
of thermal neutrons?

00:05:58.065 --> 00:05:58.940
AUDIENCE: Scattering.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.700
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep, scattering
from the fast group.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.230
So this same term right here.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.470
Fast to thermal times phi fast.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.906
And what are the losses?

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.398
AUDIENCE: Leakage
and absorption.

00:06:15.398 --> 00:06:17.190
MICHAEL SHORT: Leakage
and absorption, they

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.640
look pretty familiar.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:29.460
Thermal phi, thermal plus D
thermal Bg squared phi thermal.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.420
And that's a "t."

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.750
OK.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.060
The hard part in
this problem is going

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.380
to be doing these averages.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.260
This is the part that we haven't
explicitly done on the board

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.280
and I want to show you.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.780
Yeah?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.540
AUDIENCE: Are those Ts
or Fs, the first term

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.830
of the second half.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.220
MICHAEL SHORT: This one?

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.920
AUDIENCE: The top equation.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.960
MICHAEL SHORT: The top equation.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.166
AUDIENCE: Yeah, right there.

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:56.620
MICHAEL SHORT: Uh,
that should be a--

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.440
I'll make the Fs really curly.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.940
Curly.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.320
And those are straight Ts.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.670
These are curly Fs.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.410
OK, great, thank you.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.480
So the hard part is going to be
doing cross section averages.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.480
We've just kind of written
them as, hey, they're

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.410
average cross sections.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.080
And an average
cross section would

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.160
look something like the
integral from a minimum

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.440
to a maximum of the cross
section as a function of energy

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.940
times the flux over
the same integral

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.080
without the cross section.

00:07:43.618 --> 00:07:45.410
This is where I want
to point out something

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.702
that I want you to remember
for the rest of this course

00:07:47.702 --> 00:07:48.900
and the rest of your life.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.567
You don't have to do
things analytically

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:52.970
if you don't want to,
unless it's explicitly

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.445
stated that you have to.

00:07:54.445 --> 00:07:56.570
So part of this piece, that
is to drill in the idea

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.390
that it's the future,
we have computers.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.968
And you can do numerical
integration with data.

00:08:02.968 --> 00:08:04.760
Remember on one of the
second problem sets,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.160
I showed you guys the
web plot digitizer?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.950
How you can extract information
from a printed graph?

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.950
Well, a lot of times,
what you'll already have

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.840
is that data.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.220
And you'll have
to then integrate

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.190
that numerically in
something as simple as Excel

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.830
or as complicated as
Matlab or something worse--

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.025
whatever tool you choose to use.

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:26.150
I'll be using Excel because
it's kind of the lowest

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.175
common denominator.

00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:28.550
And so to show
you guys you don't

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.680
need to know any fancy
software to actually solve

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.159
these problems.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.700
So let's go through getting
some of this data right now.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.909
Let's say that the cutoff
between fast and thermal--

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.900
so if we were doing a
fast cross section--

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.700
the cutoff would be at 1 eV.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.150
And our max would be,
let's say, 10 MeV,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.160
which would be the top
of the fission birth

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.740
spectrum or the chi spectrum.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:00.430
1 eV, and that would be 10 MeV.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.730
So all that's left is
you need tabulated values

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.170
for the cross sections
and the fluxes.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.440
And then you can perform
this numerical integral.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.130
I have given you tabulated
values for the fluxes, wherever

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.630
that is.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.290
Yep.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:22.000
Use the attached AP1000
tabulated neutron flux profile,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.900
which opens, that's awesome.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.860
So I've given you the
approximate neutron flux

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.570
in neutrons per
centimeter squared

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.388
per second as a function
of neutron energy.

00:09:34.388 --> 00:09:36.180
And so you can tell
for low neutron energy,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.360
there aren't any ultra-cold
neutrons in this problem,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.790
though there are in the
problem right before.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.380
Because, remember,
the "we'll see?"

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.005
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:45.790
MICHAEL SHORT: Now
is when we'll see.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.490
But if we scale down, we get
down to the thermal regions

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.560
where it's in the eV levels.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.680
You start to see pretty
significant neutron fluxes

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.370
in the realm of 10 to the
14 neutrons per centimeter

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.570
squared per second.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.807
So that value of 10 to
the 14 for flux that we've

00:10:01.807 --> 00:10:03.390
been using in all
our previous problem

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.170
sets-- it's because that's
what we actually get.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.970
This flux spectrum and the
picture of it that we have here

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.780
was taken from the MIT reactor
because it's representative

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.730
of a pressurized water reactor.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.950
The only difference here
is this is the spectrum

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.690
from the fast flux trap.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.980
You don't usually see
that fast to thermal ratio

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.930
in a thermal reactor.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.290
But it's the closest
spectrum that I was easily

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.760
able to get my hands on.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.370
And it's not that
unrepresentative.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.020
And the reaction
rates for things

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.760
aren't going to
be that different.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.250
Because most of
the reaction rates,

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.560
the cross sections down
here are in the, like,

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.880
thousands of barns level.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.963
And the cross sections here
are in the one-barn level.

00:10:46.963 --> 00:10:49.130
It's pretty much any fast
cross section for anything

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.780
it's about a barn.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.170
That's a good rule of thumb.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.990
So it's not going to change
total reaction rates that much.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.640
And that's why I'm not worried
about taking the fast flux

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.740
spectrum from the MIT
reactor and pretending like

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.660
it's the AP1000's.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.250
It's not horribly that far off.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.390
And it's at the right order of
magnitude, which is important.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.020
So that data, I give you.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.263
Let's talk about how
to get this data--

00:11:15.263 --> 00:11:16.555
the macroscopic cross sections.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.020
So if you remember, a
macroscopic cross section

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.550
is a microscopic cross section
times a number density.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.880
And that's for one
single isotope.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.920
If you have a mix of
isotopes, then your total

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.640
averaged cross section for
all different types of atoms

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.390
is going to be a sum--

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.280
I'll make it very different--

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:55.330
over all your possible
isotopes of the atom fraction

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:05.350
of that isotope times the number
density of that isotope times

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:11.545
the microscopic cross section of
that reaction for that isotope.

00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:13.480
Or, I'm sorry, the
atom fraction is

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.930
included in the number density.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.550
Let's just simplify
this a little bit.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.540
The total number density
of that isotope--

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:27.320
that'll be in atoms
per cubic centimeter--

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.440
times the cross section for
that particular isotope,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:37.380
which is in centimeters
squared, which leads you to a 1

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.795
over centimeter
macroscopic cross section.

00:12:39.795 --> 00:12:41.670
And so let's say we were
summing up something

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.550
like stainless steel,
which happened to be iron

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.522
18 chrome 10 nickel.

00:12:48.522 --> 00:12:49.980
Not only would you
have to then get

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.740
the number densities of
iron, chrome, and nickel,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.670
but you have to look at
which isotopes there are.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.910
So if we wanted to get
the macroscopic cross

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.860
section for
stainless steel, we'd

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.180
have to split this into the
stable isotopes of iron,

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.560
the stable isotopes of chrome,
and the stable isotopes

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.920
of nickel and then
say it's this number

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.530
density times a cross
section plus this number

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.820
density times a cross section,
and so on and so on and so on.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.770
The easy way to get
those number densities,

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:23.450
if you take the number density
of your stainless steel

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.410
times the atom fraction of that
isotope, that should give you

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.975
the number density
of that isotope.

00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:33.995
Does this make
sense to everybody?

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.560
Does anyone not know how to get
a number density of a material

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.230
from its basic
chemical properties?

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.190
OK.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.520
So a number density is in
atoms per cubic centimeter.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.170
And usually we
would have something

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:53.840
like its density, which would
be grams per cubic centimeter.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:01.950
So if we take density in
grams per centimeter cubed

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:08.790
and multiply by Avogadro's
number and divide by--

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.370
I'll just put a
divide-by symbol here--

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.110
the molar mass--

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:18.990
Avogadro's number is
given in atoms per mole--

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:26.310
and divide by-- molar
mass units are given in--

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.530
what is it-- grams per mole--

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:35.290
so that's going to be
like moles per gram.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.640
The grams cancel,
the moles cancel,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.230
and you get atoms
per cubic centimeter.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.310
So to get a number density,
you can take the density

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.920
of the material-- you know,
for stainless steel it's like 8

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.930
grams per cubic centimeter--

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:54.120
times Avogadro's number-- let's
say 6 times 10 to the 23rd,

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.460
and this would be like 8 grams
per centimeter cubed or so--

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.620
divided by the molar
mass or the average molar

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.030
mass of stainless steel.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:12.320
I'm guessing that's
around 56 grams per mole.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.190
And then you'll get
a number density.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.230
And typical solid
number densities

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:23.260
tend to range from like 10
to the 26 to 10 to the 28.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.550
It'll be atoms per meter cubed.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.620
So it's going to be around,
like, 21 to 23 atoms

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.760
per centimeter cubed.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.270
So if you end up with something
way outside those bounds,

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.970
you've probably got some
sort of unit or power error.

00:15:40.772 --> 00:15:42.230
So that'll help
you check your math

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.450
to make sure you get the
number densities right.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.702
If you get the number
densities right

00:15:46.702 --> 00:15:48.410
and you know the atom
fractions, then you

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.720
have the number
density of each isotope

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.770
in the number of atoms of that
isotope per cubic centimeter.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.690
And then you multiply by your
microscopic cross section

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.160
and you get your
macroscopic cross section.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.740
Yeah?

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.115
AUDIENCE: Could
you explain again

00:16:04.115 --> 00:16:05.840
what atom fraction refers to?

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.380
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, atom fraction

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:13.300
is a fraction between
0 and 1 of what

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:18.443
proportion of the atoms in
your material are that isotope.

00:16:18.443 --> 00:16:19.860
So again, if you're
atom fractions

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.360
are outside the
bounds of 0 to 1,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.370
that's not physically
significant.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.000
If your number densities are
really far from those bounds,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.860
then they're
probably not right--

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.370
unless you're talking about
a gas or a neutron star.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.300
But solid matter tends to have
approximately those number

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.388
densities.

00:16:38.388 --> 00:16:40.830
Mm-hm?

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.272
AUDIENCE: Since we're
putting this reactor

00:16:43.272 --> 00:16:44.314
in a blender [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:44.314 --> 00:16:45.670
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hm.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.240
AUDIENCE: So when we
[INAUDIBLE] the atom

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.220
fractions to do
these calculations,

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.630
how would we determine
the fractions?

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.960
MICHAEL SHORT: Good question.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:59.260
You'll determine those fractions
from the AP1000 spec sheet.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.560
So in the AP1000 spec
sheet, it tells you

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.119
things like total weight of
the fuel as uranium dioxide.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.690
And so you can go from total
weight of the fuel to, let's

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.411
say, molar or atom
fraction of the fuel.

00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:16.369
If you know the weight
of the fuel-- it's nice,

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.960
they give you the
weight of the fuel.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.890
They give you the
weight of the clad.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.160
And let's see,
which materials did

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.840
we say you have to think about?

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.589
It said you have to talk
about four materials;

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:31.400
the coolant or the
moderator-- water; the fuel--

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.970
UO2; the clodding-- where you
can assume pure zirconium,

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.330
forget all the crazy zircaloids
because that's just busy work;

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.370
and structural materials--

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.940
assume pure iron.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.370
And so on this spec
sheet, luckily, they just

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.170
tell you the mass of the fuel.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.000
They tell you the
mass of the clad.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.580
I do not believe they give
you the mass of the water,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.870
but they do give you
the volume of the core.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.620
And so you can figure
out, if you've got a core

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.880
and you subtract off
the volume of the fuel

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.400
and the cladding and the
structural materials,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.760
all you're left with is volume
of the water in the core.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.500
And that'll give you your
total weight of the water.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.000
And once you have
all the weights,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.635
then you can go
to atom fractions.

00:18:16.635 --> 00:18:18.260
And then you've got
all the information

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.150
you need to get the
macroscopic cross sections.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.888
Is that unclear to anybody?

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.870
Cool.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.120
So we talked about
how to get the N's.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.550
Let's show you how
to get the sigmas.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.130
So there was a comment that came
in that said please teach us

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:37.983
how to use these databases.

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:39.400
We just kind of
throw them around.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.800
Well, I want to teach you
how to use this database.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.940
Let's say we're going to get
the cross sections for oxygen

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.010
in uranium dioxide.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.310
That's nice and easy because
there's only one stable isotope

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.260
of oxygen you have to consider.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.670
It's oxygen 16.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.910
I highly recommend using
the Java version of JANIS

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.650
because it is a
lot easier to use,

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.075
less clunky, and more intuitive.

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.450
So if you don't have Java on
your machine-- first of all,

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.370
it runs on everything, like
phones, tablets, Linux, Mac,

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.253
Windows whatever.

00:19:09.253 --> 00:19:11.420
And second of all, it'll
just make your life easier.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.580
So a little time investment now
will make the p-set take less.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.890
So once you have Java, it
should just open cleanly.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.593
And it may show up with nothing.

00:19:22.593 --> 00:19:24.260
It may show up with
something, depending

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.540
on what you last looked at.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.240
In this case, it's looking
at whatever last library

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:30.780
I looked at.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.800
So let's pretend
we're starting over.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.970
So sometimes you may just
see this database as NEA.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.640
That's all the databases
that come with JANIS.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.770
If we expand this,
make sure that you

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.110
go to incident neutron data.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.260
Because these are cross
sections for neutron reactions

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.100
that we want to go for.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.120
And there are a lot
of databases in here.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.540
And in the problem
set, specifically

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:04.690
say to use the most recent ENDF
or evaluated nuclear data file,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.930
just to make sure that we're
all using the same data set.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.900
You'll notice that there are
discrepancies between the data.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.760
So different groups
have measured things

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.300
with different uncertainties
and different values.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.230
And so these cross
sections aren't necessarily

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.650
fundamental constants of nature.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.910
They're measurements of
those constants with whatever

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.780
uncertainty and error, which
are two separate things, that

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.230
could be in there.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.920
So let's open up the
most recent ENDF library

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.140
and click on cross sections.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.510
And now whatever you see
here, the green squares

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.470
are the elements that have
tabulated cross sections.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:47.830
Just to make sure that we only
have to consider oxygen 16,

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.020
let's go to the
table of nuclides.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.520
You'll never stop
using this table.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.115
It's like the most useful
thing in this class.

00:20:55.115 --> 00:20:56.490
And check to make
sure that there

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.543
is no other stable
isotopes of oxygen

00:20:58.543 --> 00:20:59.710
that we have to worry about.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.648
As long as the
internet is working.

00:21:05.648 --> 00:21:06.580
Huh.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.980
Did the immigrate to
Korea website crash too?

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.940
Interesting.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.440
Well, we'll let
that load for a bit.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.690
And let's start
looking at oxygen 16.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:22.387
So if you double click on
the element of interest,

00:21:22.387 --> 00:21:24.470
it'll usually take a little
while because its Java

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.330
and it's loading cross sections.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:29.270
And then you can pick the
nuclear reaction of choice

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.070
from here.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:35.110
And unfortunately, I can't
easily make this bigger.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.860
I will take a very
quick detour and see

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.570
if I can make these things a
bit larger so you can see them.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.030
But if not, then whatever.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:46.590
No.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.090
No.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.800
Ah, oh, well.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.400
So let's say you wanted to get
the elastic scattering cross

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:00.300
section for oxygen.
The first letter

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.710
before the comma is going
to be the incident particle.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.490
Notice that sometimes it says
N and sometimes it says Z. N

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.140
specifically means neutrons.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.860
Z means whatever incident
particle you chose.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.610
So we know that here Z means
neutrons coming in and elastic.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.010
That's elastic scattering.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.820
So we can then click
on cross section.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.620
If you want to see what it looks
like, you can check P for plot.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.090
And this will give
you a logarithmic plot

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.240
of the scattering cross section
as a function of energy.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.510
You can see that it's
pretty boring for oxygen.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.010
There aren't a lot of nucleons.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.020
There aren't a lot of
different energy levels.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:44.000
There are not that many
resonances or things going on.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.060
So I wouldn't be that
upset if you just

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.270
approximated the fast scattering
cross section for argon

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.030
as that value, whatever it is.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:56.270
But let's do this completely.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.210
Let's tabulate this.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.210
So if you click on T, you
actually get a table of data.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.100
And you can choose how
much data you export.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.823
By default, you
get, like, thousands

00:23:07.823 --> 00:23:10.490
upon thousands of entries, which
is just going to make your life

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.290
horrible.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.500
So what you can do is either
pick the original values

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.440
starting at 1 eV.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.140
And we know we only
have to go up to 10 MeV.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.270
So you can pick your bounds.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.050
And all of a sudden, there
is only a few thousands

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.340
worth of data.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.320
Or you can interpolate them.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.320
You can interpolate
values either linearly

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.460
or logarithmically--

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.130
I recommend logarithmic because
this is such a large energy

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.360
range--

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.300
and get maybe 5
values per decade.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:50.030
So between 1 and 10 MeV,
you only need five numbers.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.310
That's still pretty intense.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.145
Oh, I didn't uncheck
the original values.

00:23:56.145 --> 00:23:59.190
Ah, isn't that better?

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.400
So now there's only
20 or 30 entries.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.170
It glosses over the resonances.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.490
It sure does.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.130
But are they that important?

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.980
That's up to you guys to decide.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.960
You can try doing one
of these calculations

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.750
with the original values and
with the interpolated values

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.560
and see just how different they
really are in two-group theory.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.430
And hint is, not very much.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.280
So then you can actually
export that data.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.720
So either you can
just copy-paste it.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:38.540
So I just highlighted, copied,
start Excel, and in it comes.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.040
And right there is
the data that you

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.500
can start to use to do
your numerical integration.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.940
And I don't want
to give away how

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.120
to do the numerical
integration, though I

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.090
kind of did, symbolically.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.620
I'd like you guys
to figure out how

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.050
to do this numerical integration
mathematically, given

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.300
that you can get the data now.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.880
So is there any step here
that's unclear to anyone?

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.130
Yeah?

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.500
AUDIENCE: So are we going
to have to go through, like,

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.580
every single material, like,
all their different cross

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:18.100
sections to, basically,
sum up and average them?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.510
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, you are.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.985
Sounds horrible, isn't it?

00:25:20.985 --> 00:25:21.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.160
MICHAEL SHORT: That's why I
made some simplifications.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.350
So if you notice, we are
simplifying the cladding as Zr.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.470
And we're simplifying
stainless steel as pure iron.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.120
I don't want you
guys to just do tons

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.350
and tons of repetitive stuff.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.720
But I do want you to get
roughly the right answer.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.730
AUDIENCE: For Uranium, do you
want us to [INAUDIBLE] U-238

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:42.387
versus 235?

00:25:42.387 --> 00:25:44.470
MICHAEL SHORT: I want you
to answer that question.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.220
So how would you consider
the isotopes of uranium

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.158
in this question?

00:25:49.158 --> 00:25:50.950
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't it
be enriched uranium?

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.117
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:25:52.117 --> 00:25:56.410
It's not the natural values,
it's the enriched values.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.512
So it will say in
the spec sheet--

00:26:00.512 --> 00:26:04.663
AUDIENCE: I don't want to look
up enriched uranium on Google.

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:06.580
MICHAEL SHORT: You don't
want to be on a list?

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.800
You don't have to look up
enriched uranium on Google.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.150
You can look it up on JANIS.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.580
So if you go to
JANIS, right, are you

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.425
looking for what the
enrichment level is?

00:26:16.425 --> 00:26:17.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:21.300
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, that's
on the AP1000 spec sheet.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.560
Where'd it go?

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.395
If we search for enrichment,
fuel enrichment, first cycle

00:26:27.395 --> 00:26:28.020
weight percent.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:35.670
You can either average these
or just pretend it's five.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.370
Because that's a pretty
typical enrichment level

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:43.790
is 5% atomic fraction U-235.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.170
Or if you want to
get really technical,

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.222
you can average these noting
how many fuel assemblies are

00:26:49.222 --> 00:26:50.180
in each of the regions.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.805
But I don't really
care if you do that.

00:26:51.805 --> 00:26:54.650
AUDIENCE: What would be
the other [INAUDIBLE]??

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.713
MICHAEL SHORT: U-238.

00:26:56.713 --> 00:26:58.130
Yeah, so there's
only two isotopes

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.980
of uranium, one
of oxygen, however

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.670
many of ion and zirconium--
hint there's not that many.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.650
And then there is H2O.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.870
And there's only one
hydrogen and one oxygen.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.820
So it's not really
that much busy work.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.430
It's just enough for you
to get to the right answer.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:15.930
So I wouldn't even
call it busy work

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.770
because there's a point to it.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.190
So in that way,
you can determine

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.930
all of these cross sections.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.420
We give you these fluxes.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.410
These new values you
can also get from JANIS.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.110
They're not labeled
as new, but they

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.230
are labeled as neutron
multiplication factor.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.850
And they're usually
way down here.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:40.810
And we probably need to find
a physial isotope for that.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.170
So let's ditch oxygen for
now, and go up to uranium.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.580
OK.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.800
So let's do U-235.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.960
It'll pull up the data.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:06.827
And then near the bottom, new
bar total, neutron production.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.310
Check it out.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.720
For pretty much all
energies, until you

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.080
get to the fast region, it's
the value we talked about--

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.670
2.44.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.160
And then in the fast
region, you suddenly

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.880
can get more neutrons
from fission.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.130
Why do you guys think that is?

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.770
Well, what sort of
additional things

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:40.263
happen when your incident
particle energy increases?

00:28:40.263 --> 00:28:42.430
Let's think back to binding
energy and all the stuff

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.722
at the beginning of the course.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.670
There's more different
kinds of fission products

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.378
that can be made.

00:28:50.378 --> 00:28:54.200
Because you're increasing
the Q value of this reaction

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.340
by increasing the
initial kinetic energy.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.658
So there are more fission
products that can be made.

00:28:59.658 --> 00:29:01.200
And some of them,
let's say, give off

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.220
more neutrons than others.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.510
So you'll be able to
get your new bar total

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.640
from this one near the bottom.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.350
And everything else
will be near the top.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.725
They'll either be
a fission cross

00:29:11.725 --> 00:29:15.220
section, an absorption
cross section, a scattering

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.300
cross section.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.379
How do you get your
diffusion coefficients?

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:29.212
They're not tabulated,
but they're close.

00:29:29.212 --> 00:29:31.545
AUDIENCE: Yeah, isn't it based
off the numbers based off

00:29:31.545 --> 00:29:32.790
the different cross sections
we have [INAUDIBLE]??

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.140
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.550
Exactly.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.430
So let's render this nicely.

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:41.920
The diffusion constant
is 1 over 3 times

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.140
the total cross section
minus mu 0 scattering--

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.390
average, average, average.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:59.200
And this average cosine is
about 2/3 times the atomic mass.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.060
So you can get these
diffusion coefficients

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.890
from tabulated data.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:09.370
The total cross section is found
at the top, better known as--

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.810
well, it just says total.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.037
So you can get total
cross sections here.

00:30:14.037 --> 00:30:16.120
The only one that might
be a little tricky for you

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.060
to find from notation
is absorption.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.100
You're not going to
see something labeled

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.600
absorption in this database.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:32.470
However, you will see
this gamma reaction.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.120
Or how else do you get it?

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.660
If you take the total minus
fission minus scattering,

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.980
you're left with absorption--

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.160
if you don't count N2N
reactions or really

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.540
esoteric high-energy things.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.540
So if you can't
find it, that's OK.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.100
Because you can calculate it.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.990
Because we know sigma
absorption is sigma total

00:30:54.990 --> 00:31:01.340
minus sigma scattering minus
sigma fission minus others

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.320
that we don't care about.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.760
And since you're
getting these anyway,

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.200
tabulating sigma absorptions
should be trivial.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.680
It's just an Excel subtraction.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.930
Yeah?

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.843
AUDIENCE: I guess
U-235 doesn't have it.

00:31:13.843 --> 00:31:16.330
But last night I was
looking at Pu-239.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.337
And it has N in an inelastic.

00:31:19.337 --> 00:31:20.170
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.087
AUDIENCE: Would that be
considered absorption?

00:31:22.087 --> 00:31:23.545
MICHAEL SHORT:
Inelastic scattering

00:31:23.545 --> 00:31:24.760
is not considered absorption.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.510
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.093
MICHAEL SHORT: So
inelastic scattering

00:31:27.093 --> 00:31:29.170
means one neutron
goes in, one neutron

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.680
comes out, but at a very
different energy level.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.290
So I guess we would also
say minus sigma inelastic.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:41.220
And inelastic does happen for
just about every other element.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.970
But the nice thing is,
those don't turn on

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.220
until about 1 MeV.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.350
So it's not going
to matter much.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.798
But you can quantify how much
it matters, and just check.

00:31:49.798 --> 00:31:52.090
So if you can make a justified
assumption to say here's

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.715
one of the calcs with and
without inelastic scattering,

00:31:54.715 --> 00:31:56.090
and if they don't
differ by much,

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.360
then forget it, as long
as you show me your math.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.150
So let's say we've got nus.

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:03.200
We have cross sections.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.340
I give you fluxes.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.620
We have Ds.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.620
You can calculate
buckling from the geometry

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.030
of the reactor, which is given
in the AP1000 spec sheet.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.680
The only other
trick will be what's

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.905
sigma scattering
from fast to thermal?

00:32:18.905 --> 00:32:20.280
So you'll have to
figure out what

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.400
is the cross section, not
just of scattering total,

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.740
but the cross section
or the probability

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.810
that a fast neutron
enters the thermal group.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.780
And I don't want to
give that away either,

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.960
but it's not terribly
mathematical.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.680
Yeah?

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.980
AUDIENCE: So if you only have
one isotope for whatever you're

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.810
analyzing, you don't have to go
through the whole overall cross

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:43.310
section.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.920
Can't you just do
the number density

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.234
times the number
of cross sections?

00:32:46.234 --> 00:32:46.716
Yeah, you don't have to.

00:32:46.716 --> 00:32:48.350
MICHAEL SHORT: Hm, not quite.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.370
So even if you only have one
isotope for each material,

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.540
if you have more
than one material,

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.450
you've got to average
those cross sections.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.970
Because this
criticality criterion

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.150
is for the entire reactor
and all the stuff in it.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:02.920
That's why it's
like in a blender.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.380
So even if iron has one
isotope and zirconium has

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.500
one isotope and uranium has one
isotope, which wouldn't really

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.690
be a reactor, then
you'd still have

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:14.470
to take atom fractions of those
to get the total criticality

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.700
condition.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.190
Speaking of which, I forgot
to write where the K is.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.800
And since everything else
here will be tabulated,

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.510
you can solve for k-effective.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.600
So k-effective is the
only variable unknown

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.780
in this whole equation.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:35.280
Yeah?

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.510
AUDIENCE: But I mean, like,
for one of the other questions,

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:38.770
it's, like, oh, if you had
a perfectly spherical ball

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:41.350
of plutonium-230i, I think
it is, in that situation,

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.350
could you just use the
cross sections from JANIS

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.487
where you don't have
to account for any kind

00:33:44.487 --> 00:33:46.110
of other isotope [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.790
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.390
So, yeah, let's go to the
rest of the problem set,

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.800
since you mentioned it.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.460
For one of the other questions,
North Korean nuclear weapons.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.010
Why is it that just
putting together

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.080
a super critical
mass of plutonium

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.360
does not constitute
an effective bomb?

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.150
We're lucky for that, too,
that making nuclear weapons

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.270
is a lot harder than just
getting nuclear material.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.330
And this is a lot of the reason
why theirs have been 500 ton

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.909
yields or kiloton yields--

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:13.600
duds.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.427
It's really, really,
really, really hard.

00:34:15.427 --> 00:34:17.260
And I want you to think
about what would you

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.590
need to do to turn a
super critical mass

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.889
of nuclear material into
an effective weapon.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.260
And why is it that it's
so difficult to do?

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.346
I'm actually really glad
it's so difficult to do.

00:34:29.346 --> 00:34:31.900
It's one of the reasons that a
lot of folks don't have them.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.699
But, yeah, if you
only have one isotope

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:35.500
like you do in this
problem, you don't

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.120
have to do atom fractions.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.100
You just take
number density times

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.840
microscopic cross
section from JANIS

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.977
and you get the
macro cross sections.

00:34:42.977 --> 00:34:45.310
That's why it's one of the
skill building problems where

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.860
it shouldn't be that hard.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.900
So you'll have a
criticality condition.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.870
You'll be able to get cross
sections and number densities.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:56.739
And you'll be able to tell
what that radius of the sphere

00:34:56.739 --> 00:35:00.020
is given the form of
buckling for a sphere, which

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.570
should be in your reading.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:03.307
Yeah?

00:35:03.307 --> 00:35:06.043
AUDIENCE: Where do we get our
data for power manipulation?

00:35:06.043 --> 00:35:07.960
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
being sent to you today.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.560
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.810
MICHAEL SHORT: So you guys
all did power manipulations

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:11.890
from the reactor.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:13.450
I wanted to get them for Monday.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.150
The guys were busy doing an
in-core experiment install.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.490
They've promised
me the data today.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.470
So you guys will be able
to take a look at it,

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:23.050
and using the transient stuff
that we talked about Tuesday,

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:29.620
explain why it doesn't look
linear feedback or intuitive.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:30.120
Yeah.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.580
So I'll be giving each
of you that data today.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.680
We talked about nuclear weapons.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.480
This top one I want
you to do on your own,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.900
because it's other repetitions
of the intuitive criticality

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.480
examples that we did on Tuesday.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.280
The last one we
haven't talked about

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.680
is the ultra-cold nuclear
reactor or the "we'll see"

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.240
problem.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.950
So here I want you
to actually get

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.800
a criticality condition
for the case where you

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.770
can have ultra-cold neutrons.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.760
Where your moderator is, let's
say, liquid hydrogen, really,

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.753
really cold, way below
the thermal level,

00:36:01.753 --> 00:36:03.170
and you have to
split your reactor

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:07.475
into three energy groups--
fast, thermal, and ultra cold.

00:36:07.475 --> 00:36:09.350
And the trick to this
here is somebody asked,

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:12.330
can you ever have up-scattering?

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.760
Why yes.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.380
If you have an
ultra-cold moderator

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:19.580
but you've got hot fuel, you can
actually scatter up in energy

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.990
where the surrounding
atoms could

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:23.150
be hotter than some of
the neutrons hitting it

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.010
and will impart energy
to those neutrons

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:29.890
and send it up the
energy spectrum.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:30.500
Yeah?

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
about that, it says

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.085
all fission neutrons
are born fast

00:36:33.085 --> 00:36:35.360
and all delayed neutrons
are born thermal.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.968
Can there be no up-scattering
from ultra cold?

00:36:37.968 --> 00:36:40.260
MICHAEL SHORT: Well how do
you get ultra cold neutrons?

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.677
AUDIENCE: They
would scatter down.

00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:42.552
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hm.

00:36:42.552 --> 00:36:43.969
But some of them
might scatter up.

00:36:43.969 --> 00:36:44.870
AUDIENCE: OK, got it.

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:47.187
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
they can scatter down

00:36:47.187 --> 00:36:49.520
by hitting something cold and
scatter back up by getting

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.158
knocked by a hot atom.

00:36:52.158 --> 00:36:53.062
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:53.062 --> 00:36:53.960
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.460
So it's all going to be in the
formulation of the equations.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.700
For this problem, like
80% or 85% of the credit

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.460
is, did you formulate
the three-group equations

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.020
correctly.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.360
So I want you to think about
what are the actual sources

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.850
and sinks in each case,
what are the fractions

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.610
of prompt and delayed
neutrons, where did they go,

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.440
and what terms matter where.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.220
So it's doing this, but for the
case that we've given you here.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.080
Solving it is a lot of algebra,
and therefore not a lot

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.580
of credit.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.800
So is that clear to everybody?

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.480
I figured this p-set was worth
explaining and not just saying,

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.350
have fun.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:35.156
You know, I'll see you
on Piazza Sunday night.

00:37:35.156 --> 00:37:36.460
AUDIENCE: I'm there.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.250
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, that's
why I would check it.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.850
Yeah.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:41.450
Cool.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:45.350
I've also got problem set
four for everybody here.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.900
I want to mention a
couple of quick things.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.140
Please, if you hand write
your p-sets, which is fine,

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:55.100
please make sure to scan them
legibly and to write legibly.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.800
We can't give partial credit
for things we can't read.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.930
And so this will be a
lesson to some of you guys

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.810
depending on who got what grade.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.520
There are times when
you may have written

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.110
stuff for partial credit,
but we just honestly

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.010
couldn't make it out.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:10.400
So please do make sure that
your submissions are legible.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.090
And for things like these, these
are handwritten problem sets,

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.280
but they were scanned with
either a scanner which

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.800
does the correct
contrast or writing them

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.080
on one note, which
apparently works pretty well,

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.640
or apps like CamScanner.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.140
There's an app on
your phone you can

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.800
get that scans pieces of paper
and automatically contrast

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.430
enhances them.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.960
It knows the paper
should be white

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.712
and the writing should be black.

00:38:31.712 --> 00:38:32.920
And it also does it in color.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.905
So if you do color
graphs, it recognizes

00:38:34.905 --> 00:38:36.530
that there are multiple
colors and will

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.090
take care of that for you.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.920
It only takes an
additional minute,

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.570
but it can give you double
the points on a problem set

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.290
because we can read stuff.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.110
So I'll give back
p-set four now.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.580
We're working on five and six.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.760
The big delay in grading
there was I went to Russia.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.390
And Russia doesn't have
as much internet as we do,

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.070
at least not where I was.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:57.970
And it was busy.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:59.910
So working on those
solutions now.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.410
Yeah?

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.740
AUDIENCE: For
problem one, it says

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.948
throwing quarters into the
reactor actually happened.

00:39:04.948 --> 00:39:05.740
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.420
AUDIENCE: When did that happen?

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.980
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, OK,
yeah, good question.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:18.220
So problem 1, throwing
quarters directly into the core

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.420
like a wishing well.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.400
It used to be that
back in the day,

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.440
they would take folks
on reactor tours

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.970
to look down into the core.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:27.580
Because when the lid
is off, you can see it.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.317
You can see the Cherenkov
radiation, the nice blue light.

00:39:30.317 --> 00:39:31.900
You can actually see
the fuel elements

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.660
because the water is
sufficient shielding for you.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.270
And the distance is sufficient
shielding to keep you away

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.210
from the gammas, not to mention
the reactor is usually off

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.530
when the lid is off.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.180
So it's not that hot.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.460
The problem is you
can't watch what

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.080
everyone's doing all the time.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.330
And somebody dropped a
quarter into the reactor.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.400
And they were like, oh,
it's a wishing well.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.610
Well, it took something like six
dive robots to go into the core

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.990
and fish it out.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.480
Because each of those
robots lasts 10 minutes

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.502
before the intense
radiation fries it.

00:40:00.502 --> 00:40:01.960
And if you didn't
find the quarter,

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.450
you got to take him out,
put down another one.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.460
And these are, like,
radiation-hard, you know,

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.110
narrow, whatever, diving robots.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.718
This story was relayed to me
through someone that relayed it

00:40:10.718 --> 00:40:11.760
to them through whatever.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.468
So it's been through
the telephone chain.

00:40:13.468 --> 00:40:16.093
But I do know that's one of the
big reasons you can't look down

00:40:16.093 --> 00:40:17.300
in the core anymore.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.920
It's because folks abuse
the privileges of tourists.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.832
Yeah.

00:40:21.832 --> 00:40:23.740
AUDIENCE: JANIS 4 just
doesn't work for me.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.588
Like, I have my installed Java.

00:40:25.588 --> 00:40:26.880
It's like up to date and stuff.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.465
But it just doesn't work.

00:40:28.465 --> 00:40:29.590
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.970
AUDIENCE: What do you
think I should do?

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.200
MICHAEL SHORT: Then you
could use the web version.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:32.600
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.433
MICHAEL SHORT: Which
is just for the browser

00:40:34.433 --> 00:40:36.090
and no plugins required.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:36.590
Yeah.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:38.782
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

00:40:38.782 --> 00:40:40.240
Any other questions
about the p-set

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.490
that we didn't cover together?

00:40:44.352 --> 00:40:45.810
Those looking a
little more doable?

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.960
AUDIENCE: [EXHALES]

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:26.700
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Right?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.370
So here we are.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.870
See?

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.570
Because what I want you
to do is feel your oneness

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.600
with modeling using
computational quantum

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.490
mechanics and the sun's energy.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.210
Right?

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.110
That's really what
I've been wanting

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.540
to try to bridge, the
applications of using

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.230
the sun in renewables,
and how that connects

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.070
to ways of modeling electrons.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.720
OK?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.110
So I really want to
get to this other topic

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.390
that we started which is
using the sun's energy

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.430
to make electricity.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.930
OK?

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.180
So I want to cover that today
and a little bit on Thursday.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.900
OK.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.140
Now, since I've made
PSET 6 optional,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.340
I wanted to just discuss a few
points from it to start with.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.850
OK?

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.900
Because that's like closing the
loop on our modeling of solids,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.832
and then we'll do a little
more motivation on solar PV,

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:24.540
and then we'll talk
about how computation

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.860
can play a role, as I said.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.460
OK?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.660
So actually, I'm going to
bring up the PSET here,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.670
and I just want to--

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.420
I'm not going to do
the problems with you,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.390
but I just want to ask
you how you might approach

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.400
these problems,
just to make sure

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.130
that, as we close this field
this simulation of solids

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.450
with quantum mechanics, we have
a sense of what you might do.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.080
The equilibrium
lattice constant,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.450
how would you calculate the
equilibrium lattice constant?

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.830
Somebody tell me.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.830
Yeah?

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.930
AUDIENCE: Looking for the
lattice which minimizes

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.664
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:04.872
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: And
how would you look for that?

00:02:04.872 --> 00:02:06.800
AUDIENCE: Change the
lattice [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.390
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.930
Yeah.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.270
So you could just like
change the lattice right,

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.660
and I have like
lattice and the energy.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.480
And I do like 4 and 5
and 6, or maybe that's

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.530
not a good enough grid.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.620
Maybe I need 4.5, 5.5.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.240
Right?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.657
And what would my
curve look like,

00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:30.100
if I have an energy,
energy versus lattice?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.950
What's it going to look like?

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.220
Yeah, something like that.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.970
I don't know, and the minimum,
the equilibrium is here.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.010
Now, is that converse
with respect to k-points?

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.390
Well, that's
something you can do

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.223
the curve for different
numbers of k-points.

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:43.380
Right?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.410
But now, what if I wanted to
calculate the binding energy,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.610
or in a solid, we call
it the cohesive energy?

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.450
Why?

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.550
It sounds cool.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.720
It's different.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.890
Yeah.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.210
You know what I'm saying.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.980
You were waiting for that.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.758
We got a big cohesive
energy [INAUDIBLE] or no,

00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:03.300
that didn't have
anything to do with.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.380
Yeah.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.380
10 seconds, do you call?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.650
Do you call a foul with 10
seconds left in a playoff game?

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.030
That's all I want to know.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.760
10 seconds left.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.560
You play it out.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.060
Right?

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.050
I don't care if it was like
the worst flagrant foul

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.450
of the year, you
let it play out.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.720
You don't call a foul with 10
seconds left in a playoff game.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.280
It's just not the
right way to lose.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.225
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:26.225 --> 00:03:27.600
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
What's that?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.800
You're feeling it?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.360
Yeah.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.360
Unbelievable.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.060
Unbelievable.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.840
All right.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.070
How would you calculate
that cohesive energy,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.800
the binding energy in a solid?

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.680
Yeah.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.420
AUDIENCE: So after you find the
equilibrium lattice constant,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.940
you have the [INAUDIBLE] energy.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.940
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.680
That's an energy versus
lattice constant.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.013
AUDIENCE: Then you can make
the lattice constant really,

00:03:51.013 --> 00:03:53.680
really, really large, and
then you'll get, basically,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.240
so it's like an isolated
atom, get that energy,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.905
and you've got two [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.280
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
I like that.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.320
Did everybody see that?

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.460
Yeah.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.240
Let's see.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.091
If I look over here, because
you know you love the nanoHUB,

00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:12.460
and you want to see
something on it today.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.960
Ah!

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.250
That's because I
didn't turn on my--

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.980
wait a second.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.149
OK.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.720
Turn it on.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.410
So now, if I ask
you how to converge

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.540
the k-points, Sam, for the
cohesive energy calculation,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.598
how would you do that?

00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:37.140
AUDIENCE: Do exactly
what I just did,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.850
and change the
number of k-points,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.190
and see if cohesive
energy changed.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.860
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: And is
the number of k-points that you

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.100
need going to be--

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.950
what's that going
to be for the atom?

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.020
AUDIENCE: Small, probably
really just [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.367
isolate that, just
not really periodic.

00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:55.450
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.120
If it's really
isolated, you shouldn't

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.430
need more than one
k-point for the atom,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.950
but the solid is
where you might need

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.150
to look at the convergence.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.780
Right?

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.200
So you see, here's our
tool, and here is--

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.540
it's actually already
defaulted to silicon.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.230
Right?

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.920
And so you can just press--

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.960
why isn't it-- this
is just torturous.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.570
OK, there we go, Simulate.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.290
There's two scroll bars,
and I can't handle it.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.820
Maybe it's me.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.600
I don't know.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.330
I like to blame the nanoHUB.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.510
So this is silicon.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.010
Right?

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.005
And I did silicon,
and I got a crystal.

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:40.870
And I forgot to click to
show me the structure,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.320
but it's this
beautiful structure.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.030
OK?

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:51.740
And in the output, it
gave me 214.6 eV, 214.6.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.260
So my energy here,
let's just say

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.280
that was the right
lattice is 214.6 eV,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.006
and now what did you say to do?

00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:01.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.900
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.460
AUDIENCE: The
lattice really large.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.080
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Lattice constant.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.050
AUDIENCE: Maybe say, I
don't know, 15 or 20?

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.070
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
20, let's apply it too.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.313
20 angstroms, and
then anything else?

00:06:18.313 --> 00:06:19.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.270
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.760
Except I don't really need
four k-points, but let's

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.990
just leave it in.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.160
OK?

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.640
Is there a way to tell after
looking at the simulation

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.430
one second if I actually
should have had more--

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.200
if I choose one k-point--

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.230
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
And if it's wiggly.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.960
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: I should
try to converge the k-points.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.870
Because if the band
structure is wiggly,

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.500
it means there's something
going on versus k.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.180
So there's a dependence
on k, and if that's true,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.650
then I shouldn't be settling
for just not testing

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.340
the convergence.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.840
Right?

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.730
I should at least try to
increase the number of k-points

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.230
to see if [INAUDIBLE]
so here it is.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.840
There is my crystal of silicon
with really large lattice

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.340
constants.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.790
So you see, those atoms aren't
even trying to bond together.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:06.840
Is it large enough?

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:11.370
How can you tell?

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.670
Well, you could look
at the bone structure.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.920
Yeah, and what should they be?

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.010
If these are really atoms,
these are really atoms,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.700
then the band structure--
oh, look at that.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.680
Those are beautiful
silicon states.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.370
Right?

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.530
These are S&P states of silicon.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.240
It's an atom.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.990
Because I just made
them really far apart,

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.120
so they didn't feel anything
from their neighbors.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.630
Right?

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.170
Now, I got an energy here
of-- and I'm coming back

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.000
to your question
here in a second--

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.840
but I got an energy here of 203.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.610
OK.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:49.670
So I got an atom was 203,
and let's just round it.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.920
I'm just going to truncate
214 and 203 is the solid.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.460
OK?

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.331
So Sam, what do I do next?

00:07:57.331 --> 00:08:00.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.130
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: And the
cohesive energy is 11 eV.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.790
And then I look it up, and I
actually see that it's 4.6.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.240
Because I looked it up, and it's
been measured in experiments.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.870
What did I do wrong?

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.500
The cohesive energy of
silicon, from my calculations

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.520
I did the solid minus the
atom, and I find it's 11 eV.

00:08:25.047 --> 00:08:27.630
AUDIENCE: Making sure you've got
the right lattice [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.088
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
For the solid?

00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:33.659
Maybe not, maybe I was
here, but I wasn't 6 eV off.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.547
I know that, but it's
a really good point.

00:08:35.547 --> 00:08:36.630
That's one thing to check.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.140
What else?

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:42.169
Yeah?

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.730
AUDIENCE: Did you converge
to your basis set?

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.438
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Did I conversion it?

00:08:45.438 --> 00:08:46.550
Very unlikely.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.230
Excellent other point to check.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.867
Probably could get me a half an
eV even, or more, maybe an eV,

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:54.950
but it's not getting me 6.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.480
This is actually a really
simple problem here.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.820
What is my cohesive energy?

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
divided by 2.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:03.810
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.428
Why?

00:09:04.428 --> 00:09:06.220
AUDIENCE: Because
there's two [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.040
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Don't forget that.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.560
Yeah.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.620
See, you have a
certain number of atoms

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.690
that you made your
crystal out of that

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.553
went into the simulation.

00:09:15.553 --> 00:09:16.460
Right?

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.050
That's actually, when I
give this problem, that's

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.440
a very common mistake.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.290
Well, I guess I'm
giving this problem,

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.595
since it is a problem set.

00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:29.720
So don't make that mistake.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.650
You don't need to,
because now, you know.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:39.990
When you go to the input here,
remember, this is my basis.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.300
My basis had a certain
number of atoms in it,

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.270
and so then that's
what gets repeated.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.000
So the number of atoms, or
electrons from those atoms,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.040
in the simulation is for
two silicon atoms, not one.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.130
So the cohesive energy I
calculated was per two atoms.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.860
So if I really want the
cohesive energy per atom,

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.060
you've got to divide by 2.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.390
Another way to get the
isolated atom would just

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.470
be to take-- a lot of people
did this last year, is

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.220
they just take this atom out.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.720
OK?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.880
And they change that to one,
and they give a large lattice

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.880
constant, and that's a
perfectly legitimate way.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.322
It's the same thing, actually.

00:10:18.322 --> 00:10:20.030
You're basically just
getting those atoms

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.320
to not see each other.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.790
But then, you had
a cohesive energy

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.998
with two atoms in the unit
cell and an atom energy

00:10:25.998 --> 00:10:27.290
with one atom in the unit cell.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.748
You just got to
keep track of that.

00:10:28.748 --> 00:10:29.600
Right?

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.340
So energy per what?

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.880
Per your basis.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.190
OK?

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.530
Basic stuff of
simulating solids.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.030
OK.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.730
Any other questions?

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.380
I may come back to the PV
question in a little bit,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:48.780
but I just wanted to make
sure we feel our oneness.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.270
OK.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.076
There was a question up here.

00:10:53.076 --> 00:10:56.640
AUDIENCE: What is the principle
definition of cohesive energy?

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:04.266
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: So
the cohesive energy really,

00:11:04.266 --> 00:11:08.910
the feeling is the
gluon between the atoms.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.590
That's the feeling definition.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.290
It's how strongly
they're glued together.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.930
The actual
quantitative definition

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:24.740
is it's the energy of the
solid minus the energy

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.330
of the constituent parts
which in this case are atoms.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.065
But you could be looking
at say in a molecular solid

00:11:33.065 --> 00:11:35.190
and then you might want to
know the cohesive energy

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.700
between molecules.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.200
Right?

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.670
In which case, this would be--

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.060
and then, you've got to
be right with your ends,

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.290
and that's what I'm saying.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:43.790
Right?

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.630
If you did your solid
with two, then you

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.240
need to have N times
the energy of an atom.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.480
Or you can think of it as
just energy of all the atoms

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.210
together that made
up that solid.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.710
Right?

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.250
So just make sure
the numbers work.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.080
OK?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.600
Now, that's actually
the atomization energy.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.690
There lots of fun names for it.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.150
Now, I ended the lecture before
the quiz with this motivation,

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.480
which I think is amazing that
the Earth's total resources

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.550
of oil, the 2
trillion we've used

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.970
and the other trillion
we want to use,

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.660
is energy you get from
the sun in two days.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.550
I also very quickly
said, well, I'm not

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.680
going to talk about
climate change,

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.890
but I can't help myself.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.670
I have to say a few words, just
a few words on climate change,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:40.717
because it's really important.

00:12:40.717 --> 00:12:42.550
And so I'm just going
to spend five minutes.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.467
That's all, I promise.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:46.450
OK.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.640
So how hot are
things going to get?

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.420
Here's an article.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.920
There's lots of
articles since here,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.340
but this is a nice picture.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.270
So I took this
from Time Magazine,

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.100
and there's lots of predictions.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.940
And there's a really big range,
and that's part of the problem.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.420
Part of the problem is also that
it's not about just warming.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.173
That is what's happening
on average over the Earth,

00:13:07.173 --> 00:13:08.590
but that's why we
really shouldn't

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.150
call it global warming.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.970
We should really call
it climate change,

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.520
because the changes that
happen are very local.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.020
Right?

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.312
They're very different in
different parts of the world.

00:13:19.312 --> 00:13:21.010
Some places are
going to get colder.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.270
OK?

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.360
OK, and so there's
lots of examples,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.630
and you can see things
melting the size of Rhode

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.630
Island and lots of really
great images of what

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.640
the changes in temperature do.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.160
Here's one I like,
because you don't always

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.200
think about the
warming in this sense.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.600
But the changes in
climate also change

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.900
when things get eaten, like
animals that eat trees,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.947
like this beetle.

00:13:44.947 --> 00:13:46.780
That's a really bad
thing for this tree that

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.590
can live a few weeks either
before or later than it usually

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.920
lives, and therefore, there are
no predators around to kill it.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.980
And already, in Canada, this
is just an enormous disaster.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:03.950
So 411 million cubic feet
of trees have been killed,

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.210
and that's double the take
by all loggers in Canada.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.913
So enormous problems can
arise from climate change,

00:14:10.913 --> 00:14:12.580
and you've seen these
kinds of pictures.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.810
So does anyone know
what the P stands for?

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.880
CO2 emissions, how much we're
putting out into the world.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.200
PgC per year, what's the P?

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.070
Peta, peta, that's a lot.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.710
How much is that?

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.487
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:38.487 --> 00:14:39.820
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Big number.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.950
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: 15th,
10 to the 15th, right?

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:53.410
That's a whole lot, and this
is from that fairly famous IPCC

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.540
report which is
actually a good read.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.590
It's kind of boring,
but it's like Smil.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:00.220
Right?

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.555
Has anybody read Smil's books?

00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:03.430
You should all read--

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:04.570
anybody?

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.680
Nobody's even heard of him?

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:15.470
So Vaclav Smil has written
some wonderful books on energy.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.570
OK?

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:18.530
It's a little bit dry.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.660
I'm not saying
it's a page-turner.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.310
It's not dialogue-driven.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.020
It's not a novel.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.980
It's not a romance, but
it's very interesting,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.880
very well put
together, some of them.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.290
Now, if you want something
a little lighter,

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.290
there's Without Hot Air.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.510
Has anybody read
that, Without Hot Air?

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.790
Anybody heard of that?

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.290
OK.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.840
That's free.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.660
You can just download that off
the internet, Without Hot Air,

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.160
I think.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:52.750
I'll remember the
author's name, in England.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.255
Anyway, this is how
much CO2 we put out,

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:58.630
and these are just what they
did is they just said, well,

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.910
if we turn it over quickly--

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.310
you see, because the amount
of CO2 in the atmosphere

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.330
is different.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.070
It's still going
to keep increasing,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.555
even if we change our ways.

00:16:07.555 --> 00:16:09.430
And so there's going to
be still an increase,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.510
and then it's
going to come down.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.230
This would be the CO2
in the atmosphere.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.630
And if we turn it over a little
later, then we get the green.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.672
And if we don't turn
anything over until the red,

00:16:16.672 --> 00:16:20.290
we go up to 1,000 parts per
million in the atmosphere,

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.440
and that's a lot.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.630
What does that mean?

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.310
Well, it's hard to predict.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.760
It's very unlikely,
in my opinion,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.070
we'll do anything
but the red, if that.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.738
Right?

00:16:32.738 --> 00:16:33.780
You can see these things.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.630
It's not that hard.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.930
You can look at the data,
and you can actually

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:42.940
see these are the famous
measurements from Keeling.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.630
You can see the
seasonal breathing,

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.030
but you can also see the trends.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.000
And you can even see where, for
example, oil production slowed.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.820
You can actually see
it in this curve.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.700
OK?

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.440
So it's not hard to see
anthropogenic connections

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:56.950
to CO2.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.060
That's actually obvious.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.023
I think the connection
between that and temperatures

00:17:01.023 --> 00:17:02.440
has been debated
more, but I don't

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.410
think many people disagree
anymore that there's

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:09.710
a very strong correlation.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.200
And this goes back
400,000 years,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.119
where now I think a
million years of data--

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:17.020
if you look at the ice cores,
there are bubbles in the ice.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.319
I promise, I'm almost done,
but I couldn't help myself,

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.819
because it's important.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:22.408
Right?

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.950
There are bubbles
in the ice, and you

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.390
can see in the bubble
how much CO2 there was.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.108
Right?

00:17:27.108 --> 00:17:28.150
These things get trapped.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.420
It's really cool.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:29.920
Right?

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.020
Bubbles of air get
trapped in ice,

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.420
and they're there from
a million years ago.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.030
And we can take them out
and do really, really

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.460
careful measurements.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.650
And we can also get
the temperature,

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.760
because we can look at the
ratios of different isotopes

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.010
of the water at that time.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.430
Because the ratios of the
isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.940
in the water at that part
of the ice tell you how warm

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.830
the water was on average.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.030
Right?

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.090
Fairly robust, and you can
see very strong correlations.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.320
This is where we are here.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.400
This is 373 from 10 years
ago, and 1,000 is very likely

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.750
to be where we'll be.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.960
OK?

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.680
OK.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.690
Now, so here's the thing.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.190
OK?

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.190
I'm almost done.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.660
This is the guy who
ran for governor.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.610
Anybody remember him?

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.290
A couple.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.590
I'm not taking a political side
here, but what I don't like

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.660
is when this issue
gets politicized,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.820
which is ridiculous levels.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.180
It does on both sides, by the
way, both sides of whatever you

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.150
want to call it, the debate.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.940
Do you debate hard,
scientific fact?

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.220
Anyway, I can get eight
professors from MIT

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.415
on both sides of this issue,
and no one in this room

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.790
will walk away
understanding what

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.463
they said about climate change.

00:18:46.463 --> 00:18:48.447
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:48.447 --> 00:18:49.780
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Well, yeah.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.310
So I'm not trying
to make a statement

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.090
about this particular
politician,

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.920
but I just want to
make this statement

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:06.640
to show how this gets distorted
for political purposes.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.910
This is total nonsense.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:09.410
Right?

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.050
This statement is
absolute nonsense,

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.620
and what he's talking
about is there is actually

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.610
someone at MIT who
has argued in actually

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:26.890
very strong ways that you
need to pay attention to

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:32.440
against a connection between
anthropogenic activities

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.530
and climate change.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.150
There's one person.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:42.770
Most people I think do
not fall into that camp.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:48.920
But this is the way that
we tend to then just avoid

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.020
the whole problem and
not look at it anymore.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:51.520
Right?

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.360
So I just think that's
detestable, detestable.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.860
Yeah, why not?

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.660
We'll go for it, and
this is the reason.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.160
Right?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.627
So now, this is
on the other side.

00:20:01.627 --> 00:20:02.710
This is on the other side.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.080
So one side is forget about it.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.450
Nobody at MIT even knows
what they're saying.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.950
Right?

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.140
It's total nonsense,
and then the other side

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.450
is we're all going to die.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.790
Right?

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.250
Now, there's a lot of--

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:20.750
OK.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.930
So this is from Climate Works.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.430
There's some actually really
good studies that have gone on.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.480
What happens when the
temperature does go up?

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.860
Because it will.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.787
Right?

00:20:28.787 --> 00:20:31.370
It may take a little while, may
take longer than that, shorter

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.930
than that, but it's
going to go up.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.120
Right?

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.490
And as I said, it's not going
up anywhere, everywhere.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.650
It's going to go up in
some places a lot more,

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.970
and in other places,
it will go down.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.100
OK?

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:47.270
And so species extinction,
storms, droughts, all this,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.490
but whether you
believe this side

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.980
and you look into those
studies, some of which

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.250
are actually very well done
and careful, others of which

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.810
are not.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.210
What you realize very
quickly is this is not

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.930
an experiment we want to run.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:02.890
Right?

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.540
This is not an experiment
we want to run.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.110
Right?

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:10.790
So that should be one of
the underlying messages that

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.520
comes across that makes us
at least, at the very least,

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.300
take this very seriously.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.300
OK?

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:22.070
So I could go on, and
I won't, but I just

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.510
had to say a few things.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.070
OK.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.550
Now, back to solar PV.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:34.280
Any questions about my
little climate change rant?

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.560
OK.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.680
I'd be happy to talk more
about that part of the problem

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.860
as well, which I'm passionately,
obviously, interested in.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.700
Now, OK.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.890
So I said the motivation is that
we get a whole lot of energy--

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.120
I said 140.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.640
That's 130, but anyway,
it's around there--

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.480
from the sun, and we don't use
much of it compared to that.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.190
And yet, here's how we
get our energy today.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.960
Look at that.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.890
Solar wind, wood,
and waste that's bio

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.440
is this yellow sliver.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.760
That's how we use our energy.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.720
Right?

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.880
Most of it comes
from, of course,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.390
coal, natural gas, and oil.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.210
And yet with solar, you
wouldn't need much land.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.230
It's actually a pretty
land-efficient technology.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.750
OK?

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.810
So if 2% of the US
were covered with PV,

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.870
with an efficiency of 10%, you
could supply all the US energy

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.040
needs.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.010
If 0.3% of the
land were covered,

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.840
you'd get all the electricity
needs in the US met.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.940
0.3%, that's compared
with 40% for agriculture.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.720
OK?

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.340
So it's not a land problem.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.540
It's not a land problem.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.040
OK?

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.260
Just what's in between
highways is pretty good.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.070
Solar PV has a nice advantage
over some other renewables,

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.680
in that you can scale all
the way down, all the way up.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.200
So that's nice, and
if you add it up,

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.130
you can just take a small
amount of land in Nevada.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.130
They won't mind.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.150
Right?

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.920
Who here is from Nevada?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.510
Would you mind?

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.820
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Thank you.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.815
You see what-- but come on,
there are some things there.

00:23:13.815 --> 00:23:14.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:16.730
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: There's all
kinds of-- there's arsenic life

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:17.600
there.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.130
There's all kinds of amazing--

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:27.660
so now, if you took spots,
if you had six Nevadas that

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.420
were willing to donate
just a small amount of land

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.370
around the world,
and you put them

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.350
in places that are
sunny, like Nevada,

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.080
you get 20 terawatts,
20 terawatts.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.550
That's more than half of what
we think will need in 2050.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.706
Yeah.

00:23:43.706 --> 00:23:47.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
give an estimate something

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:47.977
like this costs.

00:23:47.977 --> 00:23:49.060
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.860
There you go, $50 trillion.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.810
AUDIENCE: Is that just
[INAUDIBLE] or upkeep as well?

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.580
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: That's
just getting it on the ground.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.080
All right?

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.455
Well, you got a
20 year warranty.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.060
Yeah.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.650
So this is the PV problem.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:12.490
This is the PV
problem, and this is

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.010
why you don't see
solar installation

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.710
on the top of every
roof in town and why

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.320
we're not taking advantage
of this enormous resource.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.690
It's too expensive, and
compared to other renewables

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.970
and compared certainly
to non-renewables,

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.680
it's way too expensive.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.940
All other renewables,
all of the renewables,

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.050
except for like ocean thermal--

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.900
we're not going to do that--

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.430
are much less expensive
than solar PV.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.930
OK?

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.370
So that's the problem.

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.250
Now it's not just--

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.840
you got to look at it a
little bit more carefully.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.250
So sometimes, you see these
broadbrush statements,

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.000
but you've got to
realize that, of course,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.610
this is the issue here
is one of grid parity.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:01.550
So it's about the cost of the
electricity where you are,

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.880
and that is quite variable.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.410
The cost per watt at
peak hours is over here,

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.140
and what you can
see is that there

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.560
are some places where
there's a lot of sun

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.360
and electricity prices are high.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.930
We're basically
already at grid parity

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.658
up there, like those
places I used to live.

00:25:24.658 --> 00:25:26.200
And then there are
other places where

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.900
we think that by
within 10 years we

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.800
may reach grid parity in
a whole lot more places.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.210
So it depends, because
solar PV isn't just about--

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.167
it's not just about the
sun's average over the Earth.

00:25:40.167 --> 00:25:41.500
It's about really where you are.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.130
How much sun is there?

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:50.650
That's why you can get I think
the payback time in California

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.600
is like seven years, and here,
it's double that or something.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:57.860
OK.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.980
So that's an important
point, and so I just

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.410
want to show this, because you
see sometimes these like it

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.340
would cost $50 trillion,
so let's not do it,

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.933
or it's going to be--

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:09.600
or we can do it,
because it's all there.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.625
We should just do it.

00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:11.750
We see these big arguments.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.670
I think it's sometimes
important to come down

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.580
to more like practical ideas.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.080
Right?

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.510
And one way to look at this
is just what happened there?

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.370
I did not put that
into the graph.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:32.150
If you look at, say, the
percentage of electricity

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:36.200
sold in the US at
or below some price,

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.090
and you look at-- let's
see if this works.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:43.688
Yes-- and you look at just the
10% most expensive of that,

00:26:43.688 --> 00:26:45.230
there are all kinds
of questions that

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.130
come into this argument
concerning what would happen

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.260
to these higher priced markets.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.780
But let's just suppose
you could grab them

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.400
at their current price.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.470
Then, the top 10%
would get you down

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.100
to $0.14, $0.14 a kilowatt hour.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.910
That's the price target.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.940
So the question is,
could we replace

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.080
10% of electrical energy in the
US with PV at a cost of $0.14?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.080
That becomes the target.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:11.580
Right?

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.400
Actually, now that starts
to sound reasonable,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.400
not easy in any way,
but more reasonable

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.000
than replacing all energy
or all electricity.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.970
One important point is it
actually could be done.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.550
It could be deployed.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.580
OK?

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.080
But another really
important point

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.200
is actually, if anyone says I'm
going to replace all of the US

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.750
electricity needs with
solar, ask them how they plan

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.100
to store 90% of that energy.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.930
OK?

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.190
The grid can't take it.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.650
The grid is not a battery.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.960
It sort of is a little
bit, but it's not a lot.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.130
It can't do it.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:50.610
It can't handle the
storage that you

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:54.720
would need right now, if you
replaced everything with PV.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.820
And in fact there's
no storage technology

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.730
right now that exists
that could handle it.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:01.720
Right?

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:07.030
So keep that in mind, when your
friend says from say Harvard,

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.960
well, I have a plan.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.190
I have a business strategy.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.200
We're going to replace
everything with PV.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.120
Ask them how they're
going to store it.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.660
Right?

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.800
OK.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.800
But 10% you could
squeeze in there

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:26.620
without inventing a
completely new battery.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.120
OK?

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.107
Oh, yeah.

00:28:32.107 --> 00:28:32.940
This is a side note.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.620
We think a lot about
our developing--

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.850
I think maybe I showed this.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:39.840
I don't remember.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.740
We think a lot about the CO2
in the developed countries,

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.480
but this is really
where the problems

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.880
are going to be, is how
they choose to do things.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.110
OK?

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.470
OK.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.700
OK.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.570
Now, we're going to talk
about how a solar cell works

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.780
and how computational
quantum mechanics can

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:05.660
impact this problem, this
problem of cost really.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.060
And just to set the
stage, I want to be sure.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.690
So this is what you
already know this that--

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.280
let me get back to this.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.150
The sun, when it's
above the atmosphere--

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:21.440
because you had these spectra
in the second homework,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.170
and we talked about this.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:30.440
If you're up here, then
that's how much power

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.090
you get from the sun.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.187
And if you're now
when you're down here,

00:29:35.187 --> 00:29:37.520
then you have the atmosphere
which absorbs some of that.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.500
Remember that causes
dips in the spectrum,

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.557
because you've got
certain molecules

00:29:41.557 --> 00:29:43.640
in the atmosphere that
just take all the light out

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.630
of that frequency.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.320
Right?

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.720
And then what we
tend to do, usually

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.200
when we talk about solar
PV, is we say, well,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.570
that's actually not
what you really get.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.100
What you really
get on average is

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.120
something like the sun
coming through at an angle.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.090
Now, why is that important?

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.820
So this is the standard solar
PV spectrum that you use.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.430
It's called AM1.5, Air Mass.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.630
So you take the air
mass into account,

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:14.360
and it's 1.5, because
it's at 45 degrees.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.750
Why does that matter?

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.530
Yeah?

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:21.680
AUDIENCE: It's at
an angle [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.763
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:30:22.763 --> 00:30:25.120
Well, so definitely there's
an angular dependence.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.980
That's absolutely right.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.860
There is an angular
dependence of the power.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.430
Right?

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.720
That's the cosine.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.410
You've got a cosine function,
basically, and interdependence

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.990
of the power that the solar
cell generates with respect

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:40.553
to the position of the sun.

00:30:40.553 --> 00:30:42.970
But what else is going on,
when I put the sun at an angle?

00:30:45.958 --> 00:30:47.250
AUDIENCE: It's more [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:47.880
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.110
It's more air to go through.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.800
Right?

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.720
So that's why very
often this is the power.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.472
This is the average.

00:30:56.472 --> 00:30:57.930
So there is more
air to go through,

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.940
less air to go through,
more air to go through.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.440
Right?

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.940
And so we just have
some standards.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.280
A lot of times, you take
AM1.5 as the standard.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.750
It's what you use when you
buy like a solar simulator,

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.830
and you do the tests in the lab.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:12.730
That what we use.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:13.230
OK.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.022
So now, we'll go through
every single curve

00:31:15.022 --> 00:31:20.080
here and have a quiz on it.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.660
Yeah.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.840
No, this is actually-- so
has anybody seen this graph?

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.380
One person, two people, OK.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:33.905
This is actually, if you
meet somebody in a dark alley

00:31:33.905 --> 00:31:34.405
someday.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.370
And you've got your
panel, your solar panel,

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.560
and you pull it out, and
they pull theirs out.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.520
And you want to know who's
got a more efficient panel,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.810
who decides?

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.440
Right?

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.840
NREL, that's where you take it.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.050
You take it to NREL.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:52.550
Right?

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.890
So you say, take it outside.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.590
Take it to NREL.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.690
NREL is the National--

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.950
Does anybody know who NREL is?

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.380
National Renewable
Energy Lab, it's over

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.680
in Colorado, not a bad state.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.430
And they do this
very careful testing

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:15.670
on all kinds of
solar technologies.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.660
One of the cool things
here about this to me

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:22.980
is, first of all, look at how
many materials make electricity

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.430
from the sun.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.320
Isn't that amazing?

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.300
I get really excited about that.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.263
Now, when you buy
a solar cell today,

00:32:31.263 --> 00:32:32.680
there's a little
bit of variation,

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:36.470
but most of the time,
it's made out of what?

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.890
Silicon.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.050
Silicon, and in
fact, look at here.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:43.090
There's different kinds,
but actually, it's

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.010
really multicrystalline.

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.080
Single crystalline is
a little more efficient

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:47.980
but more expensive.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.560
So most of the cells you
buy are multicrystalline.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.650
So you can find it, and
that's these squares here.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:57.610
And you can see that silicon
has gotten better with time.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.970
The efficiency used to be there,
and it keeps on getting better.

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.810
And now, if you want to
buy silicon solar cells,

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.220
you can buy them.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.110
I can't get 20%--

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:12.610
multicrystalline silicon, you
can't get that on the market

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.537
easily, but I can
get about 18% cells.

00:33:16.537 --> 00:33:17.620
Actually, that's not true.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.370
Multicrystalline I
can get lower cells.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:26.968
So these are like the efficiency
that you could get at most,

00:33:26.968 --> 00:33:28.760
and then there's like
what you can actually

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.630
get in your product.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:31.230
Right?

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.700
And there's a big difference.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.200
Right?

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.590
So these are like
what the record has

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.460
been in research labs,
tested and verified by NREL,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.770
and then there's
like now I buy it.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.290
Who can sell me it, and
what's your efficiency?

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:46.790
And it's always lower.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.610
And for monocrystalline
silicon, which

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.220
is like the best you
can do, that's here,

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.800
you see that we're
pushing what I'll

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.130
show you is close to the
theoretical limit of how

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.160
efficient this can
even do this process.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.180
But that's 27%, but
if I buy it, 18%

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.980
is the best you can get on
the market of monocrystalline.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.480
Right?

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.520
Now, why is that?

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.489
Why is there such a difference
between the research cell

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:17.034
and what I can buy today?

00:34:17.034 --> 00:34:21.052
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
But then you also

00:34:21.052 --> 00:34:22.094
have the bidding process.

00:34:22.094 --> 00:34:25.949
You have interim [INAUDIBLE]
mass production [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:29.820
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Scale
up, scale up is hard.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.550
So I can make like a
little solar cell like this

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.780
and send it off to NREL.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.080
And they'll mark it at 28%,
and now I get $100 million

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.320
from some happy-go-lucky VC.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.469
And I build my plant,
and all of a sudden,

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:47.080
there are regions like
this in the cells I make,

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.719
but most of the
cell is like 10%.

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:50.270
Right?

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.770
Why?

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:55.239
Well, manufacturability, scale
up, huge issues with solar PV,

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:56.790
huge issues.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:57.340
OK?

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.010
There was a spin
off that I won't

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.160
name names, where it was really
exciting, because they were

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.410
literally like putting hard
drives in the toaster oven

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.210
and getting out solar cells.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:11.620
And it was such a cool
idea using old material

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.040
from other processes, and
little parts of those cells

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.000
were so efficient.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.220
It was really promising,
but with the homogeneity

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.930
was terrible.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.680
And that's because you
need processes that can

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.520
get you uniformity at scale.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.760
This does not tell
you about that.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.860
Right?

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.350
Now, I love this
area down here, where

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.790
you have all kinds of
new materials happening.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.730
So in my group, we
work on the bottom

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.300
of the barrel in efficiency,
but it's really exciting.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.370
Because these are all
different materials, where

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:48.570
I think there could be
big changes in efficiency,

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.680
like materials made out
of carbon, quantum dots.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.820
You can make solar cells
out of quantum dots.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.860
OK?

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.560
Why would I care about those
kinds of other materials?

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.460
What might they offer me?

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.263
Yeah?

00:36:03.263 --> 00:36:06.498
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:08.790
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Let's
say, I can get them up here.

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:10.457
Let's say, I can get
a quantum dot cell.

00:36:10.457 --> 00:36:13.040
Let's look at my
little legend there.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.870
Where are my quantum
dots, the triangles?

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:19.170
Oh, they've only been
around since 2010.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.120
How cool is that?

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.660
And look at that curve.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.420
They're doing well.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.030
If you have two points,
you can make a line.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.880
Right?

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.230
And if you extrapolate
this, in just six years,

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:33.840
they're going to be as
efficient as silicon.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.140
Why do I care?

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.030
Why do I want all
these materials?

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.080
Yeah?

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
less expensive

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.032
or more easy to mass produce.

00:36:44.032 --> 00:36:45.240
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Exactly.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:45.740
Yeah.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.250
It's all about cost.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:48.150
It's all about cost.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:53.290
So new materials might
give me different ways,

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:58.660
especially like low temperature
solution processing is a key.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.160
Right?

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.810
So silicon PV, you got to bake
this stuff at like 11 times.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.330
You put it in the
oven at 1,000 Celsius.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.230
Right?

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.980
I'm just making that up, but
it's not too far from that.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.490
Low temperature solution
processing is much cheaper.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:15.000
OK.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.958
Now, the other thing that
you need to remember,

00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:19.590
and I'll get to computation
in a moment, in a little bit,

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:24.542
but I want to finish this
overview of solar PV.

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.250
The other thing that
you have to remember

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:33.300
is that the cost of solar
cells is not just the material.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.050
So it is the material,
but notice that--

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.300
so here's crystalline silicon.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.030
Most of the solar cells
today are still made of this.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.480
But notice the blue here
is the cost of the module.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.080
That's like the material
and the glass stuff,

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.340
and then the green is
the installation cost.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.230
The installation
cost is actually

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.750
more than the
material module cost.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.970
So in solar cells,
actually, that

00:37:55.970 --> 00:38:02.620
has become only recently
the biggest problem is

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.410
the installation costs.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:07.350
Even just 10 years ago, the
module cost was twice as much

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.040
as installation.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.590
Today, it's half as much.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.200
OK?

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:17.450
So you can see
that, if I go nano,

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:18.720
this means a lot of things.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.640
I can make cells that have
much cheaper materials costs,

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.900
but see they're
not very efficient.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.770
So if I want to normalize
my cost per watt,

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:31.260
I got to install a
whole lot more of them.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.880
So my green curve
is really high.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.530
You see?

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:34.940
Does everybody see that?

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.960
So that's the balance.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.460
Right?

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.470
Now, the interesting
thing is that, you see,

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:43.430
one of the reasons why
silicon PV is so expensive

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.545
is, why the insulation
is expensive,

00:38:45.545 --> 00:38:49.440
is because it has to be put
on glass, and glass is heavy.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.330
Right?

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.210
There are laws in this
country about how much

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:58.080
a worker can actually carry
on a roof, and that limits,

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.870
literally, that limits how
big you can make a panel.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:01.557
OK?

00:39:01.557 --> 00:39:03.390
The weight is a real
problem, and then there

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:05.265
are other costs
as well on they're

00:39:05.265 --> 00:39:08.850
called balance of systems that
go into that installation cost.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:12.270
But what if you
could make materials

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:18.380
that could be put on
templates other than glass?

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.090
Maybe then you
could really change

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:23.420
the installation, the
paradigm on the installation.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.060
That's a big, big
reason why we're

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.150
interested in all of these.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.650
Right?

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.640
So these are all thin film.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.470
These are all thin film.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.600
This is thick film.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:42.670
Now, what can you compute
because of this class

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.160
to tell me why this is
thick, and these are thin?

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.270
Is it the band gap?

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:51.792
What about the band gap?

00:39:51.792 --> 00:39:53.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.850
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Direct or indirect?

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.490
And as a first thing, as
a first approximation,

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.850
is that band gap
direct or indirect?

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:04.730
indirect here, direct
here, therefore, you

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:07.950
can make very thin films.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.530
You can make amorphous
silicon at a micron.

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.530
You've got to make
this at 100 microns

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:14.650
to absorb all the light.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.317
If you don't make it
that thick, it just

00:40:16.317 --> 00:40:18.272
won't absorb enough light.

00:40:18.272 --> 00:40:19.480
Why isn't it absorbing light?

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.580
The band structure tells you.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.315
OK?

00:40:23.315 --> 00:40:24.940
The band structure
would also tell you,

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.700
or these electrons
states would also

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.010
tell you, that for
nanostructure PV,

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:33.730
you can make them as thin
as 50 to 100 nanometers

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.390
and absorb all the light.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.030
That's how efficient they
can be at absorbing light.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.530
OK?

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.883
So that is a really
important metric,

00:40:41.883 --> 00:40:43.300
because if you can
make them thin,

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.060
then you can put them maybe
on different templates that

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.380
are flexible.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.140
Maybe you don't need a
thick glass template.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.190
The solution processing
is, obviously,

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.852
equally or more important.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.570
Any questions?

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.470
There's another issue that
I just want to mention that

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:07.610
people, happy-go-lucky
PV people--

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:08.710
there are a lot of them--

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:11.630
talk about, which is just--

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.540
I should say, don't talk
about, which is just again

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.890
this scale, this
production scale.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:17.390
Right?

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.250
We talk about how
we're going to get

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:23.930
to 81 kilowatt hours a day per
person of solar electricity.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:28.180
That's from Without Hot Air,
an analysis done in that book.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.180
That should be a target.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:29.660
OK.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.077
So but the thing
is that, you see,

00:41:31.077 --> 00:41:33.747
if you want to meet that target,
then what you're going to need

00:41:33.747 --> 00:41:35.330
is you're going to
need to get to like

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.930
100% of the US electricity
generated by solar PV

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:39.740
or close to that.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.448
And that would require
being able to make

00:41:41.448 --> 00:41:47.295
14,000 acres per day, and
today, we make 14 acres per day.

00:41:47.295 --> 00:41:48.670
So this is the
kind of thing, you

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:52.060
got to look at these
problems as well,

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.550
when you think about
the solar PV problem.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:57.100
You can't just dream up
a material and say, aha.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:57.640
Right?

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.290
You got to really
ask how it's going

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:02.970
to fit in to the full problem.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:04.470
OK?

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:08.040
So anything, any
new technology, has

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.400
to accelerate over the
silicon production rate,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.750
has to be better than silicon.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.650
Silicon is a moving
target, and it

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.800
has to retire efficiencies
and/or lower installation

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.440
costs for different reasons,
as I just mentioned.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:22.940
OK.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.398
Now, this is one
I'm going to skip,

00:42:24.398 --> 00:42:25.852
but I put it here for you.

00:42:25.852 --> 00:42:28.060
Because this is what I don't
want to talk about which

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.990
is the device view.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:32.610
This is what you'd learn
in like a EE class.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:33.950
OK?

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.930
And it's great, and
it's a really good way

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.130
to look at solar
cells, and I've got

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.338
two slides that summarize it.

00:42:38.338 --> 00:42:44.980
Basically, a solar cell is a
diode that you shine light on.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.500
I don't want to talk
about that picture,

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:52.790
happy to do so offline,
after class, whenever.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.430
So this is the typical
kind of picture,

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.110
because this does not--

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.630
this picture does
not let me take

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.160
the viewpoint of electrons.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.860
That's where we're coming
from in this class is, well,

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.470
what does an electron do in
this material at the scale

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:11.750
of the atom, and that's the
picture I want to start with.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:15.430
So I'm going to go down
the level from these device

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:18.250
models which are
extremely useful,

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.300
and I'm going to
look at this picture.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.260
OK?

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.110
So this is the picture.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.310
This is what an electron,
our precious electrons,

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.270
our electrons.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.660
We now feel that they
are ours in this class.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.970
Do we own electrons?

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:37.590
Yeah?

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.430
OK.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.820
I saw some doubt, but it's OK.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.360
We still have Thursday.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.560
We simulate electrons, and
that's what we've been doing.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.600
This whole part of
the class how can you

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:55.350
model the behavior of electrons,
and in particular, what

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.870
are the energies of
electrons in a material?

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.280
That's really been our key goal.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.320
OK?

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.620
And this is how an
electron in that landscape

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:05.940
sees a solar cell.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.520
Light shines on the material,
and an electron's just

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.580
cruising around, and
then it's like, oh man,

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.970
I just got hit by a photon.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.630
right?

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:17.600
And then it's like, I
better take that energy in,

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.530
but we know that for an
electron, when it takes energy

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.730
in--

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:26.070
Oh, David MacKay is the guy
that wrote Without Hot Air.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:30.065
OK-- when it takes that
energy in, what happens?

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:33.940
Let's say these are filled.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.440
Right?

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.780
This is my Fermi energy.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.460
It's going to jump up.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.220
That's what electrons do,
when they take energy in.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.370
We've talked about that.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:46.160
So that's what happened, and
then, what did it leave behind?

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.300
A hole which is the
same as an electron,

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.720
but not, but it's positive.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.470
Right?

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.290
So that's a positive charge,
and there's my negative charge.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:03.386
And that's what happened when
sun shined, showned, shown,

00:45:03.386 --> 00:45:05.360
shown on it.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.554
And then what happens here?

00:45:08.554 --> 00:45:09.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.850
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:12.570
It relaxes.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.130
What does that mean?

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.605
It's not taking it easy.

00:45:15.605 --> 00:45:17.336
AUDIENCE: You go
back down a couple.

00:45:17.336 --> 00:45:18.890
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: To where?

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:19.557
AUDIENCE: There.

00:45:19.557 --> 00:45:20.640
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Here?

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.310
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Right here?

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:23.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.840
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Can it go here?

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the one below it.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.603
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Here.

00:45:26.603 --> 00:45:29.070
It can't go in
between, we know that.

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:32.390
So it goes here, and that
is the valence band--

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:38.960
no, Conduction Band Minimum,
CBM, of the material.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.720
That's where it lands.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.120
And so just like
in the solar field,

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.300
what I wanted you to see in that
third problem of the solar fuel

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:54.290
homework is that you
can excite electrons up,

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:57.500
but you're only going
to get out delta H.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.600
So you lose whatever energy.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.230
When you hold something
out in the sun,

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:06.920
photons of all energies from the
sun are hitting the something.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.940
Right?

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:14.370
And most of them are going
to just heat, wasted heat.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.790
Most of that sun's
energy is wasted heat,

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.930
and that's because
of this right here.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.870
Right?

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:25.030
So this is just heat here.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:31.150
It's just heating the
material, and then this

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:33.010
is the energy, or
the voltage if you

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.440
want, that you can
pull the electron out,

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.820
that conduction band.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.940
All the other energy that
you might have had is lost.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.330
Right?

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.760
And so why don't I just make
this really, really big,

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.300
the gap?

00:46:48.518 --> 00:46:49.577
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:49.577 --> 00:46:50.660
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.930
Because if it's too big,
if the gap is too big, then

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:57.900
anything less than the
gap doesn't get absorbed.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.460
If I make it too
small, then boy,

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.080
do I waste a lot of
the sun's energy.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:01.650
Right?

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.095
Then, I have almost no voltage.

00:47:03.095 --> 00:47:05.220
There's a sweet spot, and
that's what problem three

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.850
was about in PSET 5.

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:08.350
Right?

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.030
Now, then the electron
has to get out.

00:47:15.608 --> 00:47:17.150
If it's a certain
kind of solar cell,

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:20.090
it can actually recombine
with the hole, which we really

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:20.810
don't want.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:24.860
See, in some materials,
like in Silicon,

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:28.070
the electron and the hole really
don't like each other much.

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:31.910
They're Facebook
friends, or I don't know.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.500
What do you kids
call it these days?

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.220
They tweet.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.620
No, no, because nobody tweets.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.580
Who tweets?

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.330
Does anybody tweet?

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:42.980
I'm amazed by that.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.110
I have no clue what
I'm talking about.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:47.600
How many of you have
a Facebook page?

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.840
Right.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.500
OK.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.380
I'm just learning.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.960
It's a learning thing for me.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.160
Google Plus?

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.050
Google Plus?

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:56.920
It's gotten better?

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.540
Has it gotten better?

00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.600
Sort of.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.810
Yeah.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:01.770
OK.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:07.100
So fact of the matter
is, where was I?

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:12.533
Anyway, they don't
like each other much.

00:48:12.533 --> 00:48:13.950
They like each
other a little bit,

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:18.360
like a millielectron
volt or two of binding

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.430
between that electron
and the hole in silicon.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:25.318
So basically, as soon as that
electron and hole form, and one

00:48:25.318 --> 00:48:27.110
is in the connection
band, and the other is

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:30.110
in the valence band,
they're like, eh, whatever,

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:31.980
and they just wander off.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.780
OK?

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.330
Now, that's a
weakly bound exciton

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.720
is another way of saying
that, or really not really

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.470
much of an exciton at
all, because there's

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:40.670
exciton binding.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.500
An exciton is nothing
more than a fancy way

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.280
of saying electron hole
pair, but in some materials,

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.840
like polymer solar cells,
which I will talk about,

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.460
that's not true.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:55.450
You see, in some materials,
the electron and the hole

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.760
are very strongly
attracted to each other.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.420
They are BFF.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.230
Did I say that right?

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.630
Best friends forever,
except it's not forever,

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:06.580
because you get them
apart in a solar cell.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.370
You do get them
apart, and it's sad.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.470
But then they go, and they do
work, and then they come back.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:15.180
So it's a happy ending.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.820
So now, when it's really
weak, like in Silicon, well,

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:23.740
you don't need much
to pull them away.

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:24.240
Right?

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.670
You've got to pull them away.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:28.640
You got to transport the holes
and transport the electrons

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:29.960
over to some metals.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.300
And so actually, how
do you pull them away?

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:36.376
How do you get them out on the
right side, different sides?

00:49:36.376 --> 00:49:38.017
AUDIENCE: Electric
field [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:38.017 --> 00:49:39.100
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.400
Yes, and yes.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.620
Right?

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.590
A PN junction will do
it, and even there, there

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:47.290
can be whole regions where
there's no field really.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:50.080
But as long as they finally get
to some region where there is,

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.370
and they can get off on
the right side, we're good.

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:57.950
OK?

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:00.080
But in other solar
cells, and this

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.520
is all within this picture.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.170
This is all within
the same picture.

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:05.250
We can talk about
all these concepts.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:08.330
So in a silicon solar
cell, recombination here

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:12.690
is really not a problem,
but this part is a problem.

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:16.830
That's really hard, because
the indirect band gap.

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:19.410
And then because you've
got to make it thick,

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:21.990
because that's bad,
this part is a problem,

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:24.840
because they got to transport
for a long distance.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.090
And because they got to
transport for a long distance,

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:29.010
you got to make
the material pure.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:31.745
So that it has good
highways to get out.

00:50:31.745 --> 00:50:32.245
OK?

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:39.010
But in a plastic solar cell
or an organic solar cell,

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.890
well, these are
really strongly bound.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.720
They really want
to be best friends.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.730
There are half an
electron volt bound

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.800
instead of millielectron volts.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.020
Those are strongly
bound excitons.

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.690
So a PN junction won't do it.

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:58.080
You can't do that, because
they're going to be together,

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.800
unless you rip them apart.

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.310
Right?

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:02.810
And because they're
going to be together,

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.420
what's going to happen is, if
you don't rip them apart soon,

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.317
they're just going to collapse,
and you're going to lose that.

00:51:08.317 --> 00:51:10.400
All the photons energy,
you're just going to lose,

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.980
and the electron and
hole will recombine.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.390
That's this recombination,
and they'll emit a photon.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.890
Right?

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:18.060
That's bad.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.860
That's a bad thing.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:20.430
Right?

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:22.800
So in those kinds
of solar cells,

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.050
the challenges are different.

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:27.750
They're actually
really good at this.

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.232
Remember, I said 100
nanometers of thickness

00:51:30.232 --> 00:51:32.190
is all you need to absorb
all the light in some

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:34.430
of these materials, even less.

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:35.360
OK?

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.790
But where there is a challenge
is how do you get them--

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.200
how do you pull them apart?

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:44.300
And the way you do it is
you create interfaces,

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:48.110
where when this electron and
hole pair get to the interface,

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:50.900
one of them really
sees the grass is

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.120
really greener on the other
side of that interface.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.790
And the other one is like,
I don't like that material,

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:59.780
and then they split, and that's
called a type 2 heterojunction.

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.300
Which I'll show you a picture
in a sec, in a little bit,

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.570
or maybe Thursday morning.

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:05.360
Thursday at the
beginning of class,

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.270
I think I might have time.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:14.120
So this is the level that we can
really understand solar cells

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.280
from the fundamental
electron viewpoint,

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.430
and this is the
level where you know

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:22.020
how to compute relevant things.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.080
So tell me what you
can compute that's

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.150
relevant to this picture.

00:52:27.838 --> 00:52:28.977
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:28.977 --> 00:52:30.060
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:30.780
AUDIENCE: Fermi energy.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.740
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
OK, Fermi energy.

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:32.240
OK.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.700
So that would be for the metal.

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:34.560
Right?

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.190
That's the level that's going to
try to line up with that level,

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:41.460
and you'd like it
to be pretty close.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:42.300
OK?

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:42.930
What else?

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:44.670
Somebody said band gap.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:45.420
Very good.

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:47.740
That's this.

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.000
Right?

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.540
What else?

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.155
What about the band gap?

00:52:54.155 --> 00:52:55.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:59.420
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK, direct
or indirect, very important.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.730
What else?

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:01.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.790
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Mobility which is this part.

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:06.890
How efficiently is
it going to do this?

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:07.390
Right?

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:11.210
Well, you can calculate that
now from the band structure.

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.710
Right?

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:14.215
What gives you the mobility?

00:53:14.215 --> 00:53:15.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:17.770
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Curvature of the band.

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:18.790
OK?

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:22.100
You know how to do that.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.777
And the last thing
is that I'll just

00:53:23.777 --> 00:53:25.360
tell you because I'm
going to show you

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:29.473
in a second is that when
you need to pull electrons

00:53:29.473 --> 00:53:32.140
and holes apart from each other,
because they're really strongly

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.290
bound, you need two different
materials with a very

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:38.290
particular way of lining
their energy levels up.

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:40.930
So again, it comes back to--

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:47.680
there, it comes back to having
one material with levels.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.110
This is, let's say,
the HOMO in the LUMO,

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:55.360
like that, and another
material, or if you

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.360
want to think about this
is the conduction band

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.500
and the valence band.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.770
You need to have--

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:08.230
if you have a really
strongly bound electron hole,

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:10.682
there it is.

00:54:10.682 --> 00:54:11.640
You're with me on this.

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:11.820
Right?

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.920
You see what I mean here.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.040
This is a level.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.270
That was where it was.

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:19.350
It's thermalized down, and
this is strongly bound.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:21.300
So I got to rip them
apart, and then that

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.670
means I need another
material with levels

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:26.580
that come in at a very
particular way with very

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.020
particular alignment.

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:32.900
And that's called the
type 2 heterojunction,

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:37.860
and if it's not type 2, you're
not going to split them apart.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.640
OK?

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.320
Now, how can you calculate that?

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.800
Well, you can
calculate these levels.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.690
This is what you know how to do.

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:49.320
So you can actually, with
this same kind of methodology,

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.890
you can calculate the
levels across an interface.

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:54.690
Exactly the same
with the SIESTA tool

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:57.510
you have, you can look
at what those levels look

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:59.260
like on one side
of an interface,

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.987
and when you change
the material, what

00:55:00.987 --> 00:55:02.070
they look like on another.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.560
And you can tell me if
it's a type 2 interface

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.340
or say a type 1 or a broken
junction or other kinds that

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.960
wouldn't be good for PV.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.120
OK?

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.230
OK.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:15.177
So this is a very rich
picture, and really, you

00:55:15.177 --> 00:55:16.760
can see that there
are a lot of things

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.260
you know how to
compute now that are

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:19.640
directly relevant to solar PV.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.650
So let's take a closer look.

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:22.150
OK.

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:26.450
So that's what we want
to do is take a closer

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:27.800
look at some of these.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.428
Any questions?

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:36.087
AUDIENCE: What is
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:36.087 --> 00:55:38.420
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: That's
actually the conduction band

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:42.200
minimum and the
valence band maximum,

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:46.820
and because sometimes
the conduction band

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.830
can be thought of
as a band of states.

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.830
But often, we only care
about the very lowest

00:55:54.830 --> 00:56:00.378
one, which is where the
electron is going to wind up.

00:56:00.378 --> 00:56:01.920
It's got plenty of
time to get there.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:07.160
This thermalization process
is super fast, super fast.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:07.660
OK?

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:11.510
OK.

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:13.427
So this is again what
I've been talking about,

00:56:13.427 --> 00:56:15.960
but I'll give you a few
more specific examples.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.810
So in crystalline
silicon which is still--

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:19.040
I don't know if it's 80%.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.390
Maybe it's between 70% and 80%.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:24.700
Right?

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:28.780
The band structure, the band
gap, and the electron hole

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.900
mobilities, this is all
something we just talked about.

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:32.770
OK?

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:34.993
And it all comes from
the band structure.

00:56:34.993 --> 00:56:36.910
So you get the band
structure of the material,

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:39.100
and these properties
of the picture

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:41.090
we just showed fall out.

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:41.590
OK?

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:48.140
In amorphous silicon,
see amorphous silicon

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:55.820
is actually 3% of the market,
and actually light absorption

00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:00.200
is really pretty good, and so
you can make them very thin.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:04.310
That picture was--
where was it, there--

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:05.480
that's crystalline silicon.

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.897
That's a crystalline
silicon cell,

00:57:06.897 --> 00:57:09.080
and that's an
amorphous silicon cell.

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.470
And you can see one is curving,
because you can make it really,

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:13.700
really thin.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:14.510
OK?

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:17.090
Whereas, if we tried
to curve 100 microns,

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:18.388
it's really hard to do.

00:57:18.388 --> 00:57:19.430
You're going to crack it.

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.930
Right?

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:24.930
The problem with
amorphous silicon,

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:26.970
so electrons and
holes also separate.

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:28.500
That's not a problem.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.060
They separate easily.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:32.250
They're not strongly
bound to each other,

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:35.010
but here, you have the
transport is the problem,

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:36.750
holes in particular.

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:40.500
Positive charges move
very, very slowly

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.160
through amorphous silicon.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.320
OK?

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:47.250
So they're actually,
both electrons and holes,

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:49.710
are a lot slower in
amorphous silicon

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.560
than in crystalline silicon,
but holes are 200 times

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.170
slower than electrons,
200 times slower.

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:56.670
Right?

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:58.337
Whereas, in crystalline
silicon, they're

00:57:58.337 --> 00:57:59.920
only like two or
three times slower.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:03.690
So that's a big discrepancy,
and that causes big problems

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:07.470
and a big drop in efficiency.

00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:11.180
Now, what you can do with the
calculations you know how to do

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:13.250
is you can calculate
the hole mobility,

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:15.530
and actually, you
can also calculate

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:19.760
whether the amorphous material
wants to trap a positive charge

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.630
or not.

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:24.950
And the way you do that is
you simply, in the code,

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:28.330
you simply calculate
the structure

00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:30.230
with and without a
positive charge in it,

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:31.610
and you get an energy.

00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:32.920
Right?

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.420
And then you can compare that
from one structure to another,

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.260
and try to understand something
about why this material is

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.370
trapping holes.

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:42.800
You see, in an amorphous
material-- do I have a picture?

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.040
I think I had a picture of--

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:49.047
maybe I have a picture later.

00:58:49.047 --> 00:58:50.630
Why would we want
an amorphous silicon

00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:53.310
over a crystalline silicon?

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:53.950
It's cheaper.

00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:55.428
Why is it cheaper?

00:58:55.428 --> 00:58:56.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:57.774
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Why?

00:58:57.774 --> 00:59:00.356
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:01.877 --> 00:59:02.960
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.680
It's just a mess.

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.580
Amorphous silicon is a mess.

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:09.630
Right?

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:10.920
It's a messy material.

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.427
Now, there are still
very important ways

00:59:13.427 --> 00:59:15.510
of doing the processing
that can make a difference

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:16.570
on the performance.

00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:17.070
Right?

00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:19.440
Hydrogen concentration,
how you anneal it,

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.720
but it's a much easier
material to make,

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.100
since it's inherently messy.

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:25.380
Now, that poses
a real challenge,

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:29.280
because now you have a
problem that you want to fix,

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.430
the transport of charges
in a messy material,

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:35.730
and it's really hard to
characterize messy materials.

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:37.270
Right?

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:41.540
Beautiful problem for
computation, beautiful problem.

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:44.000
And we're talking about
holes and electrons,

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.392
so the only game in town
is quantum mechanics.

00:59:46.392 --> 00:59:47.600
That's the only game in town.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.140
Right?

00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:51.800
You got to get to
the description

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:55.010
that we know how to do now of
where electrons and holes are

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.820
in the material.

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.850
And in the computer, you
can make messy this way,

00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:03.170
messy that way, add a little
of this, put a defect in,

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:07.310
and you can calculate what
that does all the way down

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:09.920
to the scales of these
atoms and electrons.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.970
And that would be
extremely hard,

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:14.720
especially in a material
that's disordered,

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.950
to do experimentally.

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:18.740
So this is a great
problem for computation.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.700
I love this problem.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.170
Amorphous silicon has a
wonderful problem called

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:25.820
the Stabler-Wronski effect.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:30.500
Stabler-Wronski in
1977, they wrote an APL,

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.750
where they showed that you
make an amorphous silicon

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:34.130
solar cell.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.070
And let's say you make it,
and you test it, and it's 10%.

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:40.520
And now you hold it out
under the sun for two hours,

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.920
and after that, it's 7%.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.455
OK?

01:00:43.455 --> 01:00:46.080
And it doesn't come back, unless
you heat it up, in which case,

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.340
it does.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.510
What a great problem.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:49.010
Right?

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:53.810
So you get an immediate 30%
hit on your performance, when

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:56.660
you have an amorphous solar
cell, amorphous silicon

01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:03.110
solar cell, and that is a
30, 40 year problem, 30 year

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:07.217
problem that is unsolved.

01:01:07.217 --> 01:01:08.300
I love problems like that.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.273
Why?

01:01:09.273 --> 01:01:11.690
You hold it out under the sun,
and because of the sunlight

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.670
exposure, something's--

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.390
the mess is getting
messy in a bad way.

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:20.250
Not all messes
are created equal.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:20.750
Right?

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:21.590
How cool is that?

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:24.050
At the atomic
scale, the disorder

01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:27.380
is different, when
you shine light on it,

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.600
and that difference,
the different disorder,

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.050
means something really
important to positive charges.

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.030
What?

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:38.240
Unsolved, very cool
problem, computation

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.470
can play a big role.

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.980
OK.

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.840
Now, in organic PV, as I already
mentioned, I mentioned this.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.015
So let me get to that,
but look at this.

01:01:48.015 --> 01:01:50.070
This is that solar
spectrum, and often we

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:54.360
like to plot just several ones.

01:01:58.113 --> 01:02:00.530
So but these are just the sun,
whether you're on the Earth

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:04.050
or how you measure it,
but now here's the key.

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:07.550
This is the absorption
of a polymer

01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:09.350
that can make an organic cell.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:14.570
Now, you can see that one
issue with organic materials

01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:17.450
is they can have really good
absorption but in a fairly

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:19.610
narrow range.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:23.770
So I can make this
cell very thin,

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:28.750
and theoretically, I could get
a decent efficiency out of it.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:32.080
I don't by the way, but
one would think I could.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.930
But you can see that
I'm missing a whole lot

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:36.640
of the solar spectrum.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.140
Right?

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.190
I'm missing a whole lot
of the solar spectrum,

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.400
and so that's one
issue with polymers.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.650
Is they're very
good at absorbing,

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:47.080
very efficient at
absorbing light,

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.390
but usually in a fairly
narrow part of the spectrum.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:51.637
So that's one challenge,
and that's something

01:02:51.637 --> 01:02:54.220
that you now know a lot about,
because you've been integrating

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.720
this from like here back.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:58.830
That was fun.

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:00.340
Wasn't that fun?

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.070
Yeah.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.950
I felt the pain.

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:06.900
Sam, help me feel the pain.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.790
Inform me about the pain.

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:10.740
OK.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.490
Now, so that's one issue,
and you know how to do that.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.810
You can take a polymer, put
it in your nanoHUB tool,

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:21.550
and integrate the
sun from its gap.

01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:22.200
Right?

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.990
And that'll give you this
now, and you can even

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:26.940
do it more fancy than that.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.310
You can even use the
density of states

01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:32.400
to get a more realistic
estimate of how

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.620
much energy versus wavelength
that that polymer can absorb.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.960
But another really
important problem

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.960
that comes with polymers
is that, again--

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.380
and this is exactly that
picture I just showed--

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.570
you have to have two materials.

01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:54.210
Because in a polymer, when you
excite an electron and a hole,

01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:56.380
they're usually strongly bound.

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:56.880
Right?

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.060
So that exciton is a strong
bound exciton, and therefore,

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.850
you can't split them
apart, unless you

01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:06.250
have an interface that has
levels that align like this.

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:09.150
So another really important
part of polymer PV

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:13.860
is to design the two
kinds of materials

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.520
that will give you
those interfaces

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.180
and then control them in
some way to blend them.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.502
It's actually a really
pretty hard problem.

01:04:21.502 --> 01:04:23.460
There's a company, there
are several companies,

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:31.910
selling P3HT that is
poly-3-hexylthiophene solar

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.260
cells.

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.570
Konarka, has anybody
heard of Konarka?

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:38.230
You can buy them, Konarka.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.590
A brave, bold move into
polymer solar cells

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:49.790
was made with $120
million by Konarka.

01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:54.720
I would say too early, but
they're trying to push it.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.340
Now, the problem is
efficiencies are very low still.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.280
So you have these like they'll
give you one of their products.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.340
It's like this size,
and it's all packed in.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.590
And you can unfold it to
the size of this table,

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:08.630
because it's just
flexible and thin,

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:11.280
and you put it on
plastic instead of glass.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:11.780
Right?

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:13.610
P3HD is a plastic.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:17.030
It's a cheap, cheap solution
[? possible ?] plastic,

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:19.760
and the films only need to
be 100 nanometers thick.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.010
So you can put it on this
flexible thing that folds up

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:23.360
into a wallet,
and you unfold it,

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.652
and it's the size of the table.

01:05:24.652 --> 01:05:26.630
And you plug it into
your cell phone,

01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:30.590
and you wait the
whole day, and you get

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:32.600
like two minutes of talk time.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.980
They're very low efficiency.

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:35.913
OK?

01:05:35.913 --> 01:05:37.580
But they're getting
better, and actually

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:41.360
the research efficiencies
of polymer cells

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:45.330
are now at 10%,
almost 10%, 9%, 10%.

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:46.880
That's pretty exciting.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:50.640
Remember, research efficiencies,
what you buy is very different.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.843
It's still very
low, 2%, maybe 3%.

01:05:53.843 --> 01:05:56.135
That's not what they say,
but it's what people measure.

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:00.500
There's another
issue with polymers

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.625
though, with polymer cells.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:05.660
Can anybody tell me what
they think it might be?

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.170
What is that?

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.930
Degrades, why?

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:14.090
Two reasons, why do
organic things degrade?

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:15.650
AUDIENCE: You
start pulling apart

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:18.600
[INAUDIBLE] from structure
[INAUDIBLE] at certain points,

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.895
it's going to become unusable.

01:06:19.895 --> 01:06:21.895
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Well,
that's actually not--

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:25.370
you get them back, so that's
actually not the problem.

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:26.620
It's not that you're pulling--

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.140
It's not that you're
depleting them or anything.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.936
It's a different problem.

01:06:30.936 --> 01:06:33.915
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:36.215 --> 01:06:37.840
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
That is absolutely

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.340
the right answer for
3012, but in 3021-- well,

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:46.460
it's still-- yes, I can't ever
say no to the second law, ever.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:46.960
OK?

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.410
So yes, but what else?

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.330
What happens to polymer?

01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:55.300
There's two badnesses.

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.170
AUDIENCE: Oxidize?

01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:57.170
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:00.310
So oxygen is a tough one,
water, oxygen. Right?

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:02.170
Chemically they degrade.

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:03.740
Now, how can I prevent that?

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.440
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Packaging, you got it,

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.240
and what does packaging say?

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.310
What is really, really,
really good packaging

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:13.200
to really, really make
sure oxygen and water

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.790
doesn't get in?

01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:19.520
That should ring this
in your mind, dollars.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.980
That's expensive, and
that's the problem,

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.602
is now you're going back.

01:07:23.602 --> 01:07:25.310
Well, you had solution
[? processable, ?]

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:26.923
cheap materials,
flexible substrates.

01:07:26.923 --> 01:07:28.340
You're hitting it
out of the part,

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:31.270
and then you've got to spend
all your money on packaging.

01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:32.890
Right?

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:36.780
And there's another reason
why polymers degrade.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:39.342
Anybody know?

01:07:39.342 --> 01:07:40.813
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:40.813 --> 01:07:42.230
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
That could be

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:45.710
where the degradation
happens, but there's

01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:51.230
something else that happens to
polymers, when you put them out

01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:52.332
in the sun.

01:07:52.332 --> 01:07:53.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:56.100
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Why
did car paint used to fade?

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:56.990
It doesn't anymore.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:59.450
You guys are too young.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:05.660
Back when I was in
school, in the 1930s,

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:09.560
car paint used to fade.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.832
Why?

01:08:11.832 --> 01:08:13.270
AUDIENCE: UV radiation?

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.940
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It's UV.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.960
UV, right?

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.920
UV is tough on us.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.420
Right?

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.120
And UV is tough
on organic matter,

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:28.920
and so UV will over time
degrade polymers as well.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.180
Now, there's still lots of
discussion and debate, how much

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:36.810
is one, moisture, oxygen,
versus UV important here,

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:38.029
but both are degrading this.

01:08:40.758 --> 01:08:42.800
Now, when you install a
solar cell in your house,

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.830
what kind of
warranty do you get?

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:45.710
AUDIENCE: 20 years.

01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:48.640
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
20 years, you got it.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.580
Right?

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:52.939
And if it's a
Cad-Tel solar cell,

01:08:52.939 --> 01:08:55.430
they'll offer to buy it back.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.890
No, they'll offer to safely
dispose of the cadmium

01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:59.160
after 20 years.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:08:59.660
Yeah.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.590
I'll believe that when I see it.

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:05.359
That's a very expensive
business plan,

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:09.069
but that's the kind of
warranty you get, 20 years.

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:11.770
And if you got stuff that's
degrading in six months, which

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:14.399
by the way you do, it's
just very hard to compete.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.189
OK?

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:17.410
So those are some key
issues degradation.

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:23.770
Is not really as addressable
with these computational

01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:27.946
quantum mechanics approaches
we've been talking about,

01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:29.529
but I wanted to
mention it, because it

01:09:29.529 --> 01:09:30.439
is a serious problem.

01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:31.460
So if somebody comes
along and says,

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.060
I have this great polymer
that I think won't degrade.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.700
We can tell them whether it
will still separate charge

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:37.670
and absorb light.

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:38.170
Right?

01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:42.960
So we can screen some key
properties for suggestions.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.850
OK.

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:46.640
Is that band gap
too high or too low?

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:50.960
It's pretty high.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.939
It's pretty high.

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:52.990
OK?

01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:54.170
Good.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:55.420
OK.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:59.290
Now, there's one other
I'll talk about today,

01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:03.310
and then I'll finish this up.

01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:04.930
There's not much
more I want to say,

01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:09.160
but I'll finish this up on
Thursday at the beginning.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.450
But another kind of cell
that is really fun--

01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:15.860
actually in a class I taught
here to 2 1/2 years ago,

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.650
we made these in class.

01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:19.030
We made dye sensitized cells.

01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:21.040
Has anybody made a
dye sensitized cell?

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.040
It's really easy.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.850
Literally, you just
take some TiO2,

01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:31.090
and we had a contest with fruit.

01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:34.660
We had the team
pomegranate, team raspberry,

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.490
and team blackberry, and
you mash up your fruit,

01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:39.290
and that gives you the dye.

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.790
Right?

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:42.070
And that's just a light
absorber, and then

01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:46.300
you coat TiO2, you
coat your powder.

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.220
OK?

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:50.530
And you put it down
on a metal, and then

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:53.050
you put an electrolyte
in, and I'll tell you

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:54.280
what's happening in a minute.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.890
And it's such a simple, cool
fruit power, fruit power.

01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:01.090
Right?

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.500
Solve the world's
energy problems

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:07.660
with blackberries which
are like $6.99 for a pint.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.890
So that's scalable, not.

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:12.340
But anyway, there are
cheaper ways of getting dyes.

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:16.300
OK, but anyway, the
point is that it's

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.847
really simple and really elegant
and actually pretty efficient.

01:11:19.847 --> 01:11:21.430
These are also known
as Gratzel cells,

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:25.810
because Gratzel was really
one of the key founders

01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:29.460
of this idea, I think
the key founder.

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.210
And there are companies
making and selling

01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:32.468
dye sensitized cells.

01:11:32.468 --> 01:11:34.510
The reason they're appealing
is they are actually

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:37.120
even more efficient than
polymer-based cells.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.650
They're up to I
think even 14%, 15%.

01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:44.760
Again, the issue is packaging.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.260
Why?

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:50.390
Because in this case, what
happens is the dye coats

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:54.750
a particle that is really good
at pulling the electrons off.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:56.000
Oh, you love these pictures.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:56.750
You know them now.

01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:58.200
You feel them now.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:58.700
Right?

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:02.820
These are the pictures we use
to describe solar technologies.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:03.320
Right?

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.530
So you have the dye, where
sunlight shines on it,

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:08.060
and an electron gets kicked up.

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.460
Now, in this case,
you see, you're

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:14.090
not going to worry about
moving that electron around

01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:19.610
in some slow polymer
or amorphous material.

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:21.800
You're going to put it
into a TiO2 particle

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.040
matrix, where actually electrons
zip along really efficiently.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.880
So you really boost the
transport part of the problem.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.730
See, TiO2 by itself wouldn't
absorb light very well,

01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:36.740
so the dye helps you kick
the light absorption up.

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:37.850
So that really helps.

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:40.220
So the light is absorbed
here, and then the electron

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:42.770
transfers to the TiO2
and goes out here.

01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:47.000
And here's the problem is you
got to get that electron back,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.400
and the way you get
it back is you get it

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:55.445
back from the cathode, through
a dye, through an electrolyte--

01:12:55.445 --> 01:12:57.273
I'm sorry, through
an electrolyte,

01:12:57.273 --> 01:12:58.190
I just read that word.

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:08.300
Which is basically just shipping
electrons from this metal

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.820
electrode over to the dye.

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:14.210
It's just an iodine solution,
very cheap, very cheap,

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:16.100
but it's just an electrolyte.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:20.180
Has anybody heard of or
worked with electrolytes?

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.920
Well, even if not, it's OK.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.430
Right?

01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:26.775
There in lots of uses, and
basically, what they are

01:13:26.775 --> 01:13:27.650
is they're a shuttle.

01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:32.960
It's atoms, I3's, molecules that
are carrying electrons for you

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.972
in a liquid.

01:13:33.972 --> 01:13:35.180
What's the problem with that?

01:13:39.610 --> 01:13:40.750
Yeah.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:46.600
It's how are you going to
keep that liquid in there

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.620
for 20 years?

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:55.000
20 years you need a liquid
to stay perfectly liquid.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:55.700
That's hard.

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:56.200
Right?

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.700
There's a lot of
work that's been

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:01.370
done on solid-state electrolytes
for other applications.

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.870
Right?

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:04.090
Lots of work has been done.

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:08.170
It's an entire field that,
if you had a good enough one,

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:10.600
could be used here
as well, but so far,

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.100
solid-state electrolytes do
not get you the electrons

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.660
efficiently enough.

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:17.380
OK?

01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:21.040
But when you use this very
cheap liquid and very cheap dye

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.820
and very cheap nanoparticles,
you get a 14% efficient cell,

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:29.290
and you can do it in one hour
violating only a few codes,

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:31.990
safety codes, in a classroom.

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:33.070
OK?

01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:37.270
So it's actually a
really cool technology.

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:40.450
I'll pick up here and finish
the solar PV part on Thursday.

01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:44.260
Please, come to class, because
we will fill out evaluations

01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:45.360
and have pizza.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.910
OK.

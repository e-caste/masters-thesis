00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:33.560
PROFESSOR: OK, let's go
ahead and get started.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.080
We're actually not
going to be joined

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.269
by our friends in
Zaragoza today,

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.810
but we're still
going to be recorded.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.270
So still have to stay on
our best behavior, I guess.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.410
Today we're going to go
through life cycle assessment,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.880
and talk about
that and how we use

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.400
it to quantify environmental
impacts of products.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.670
The goal today is pretty simple.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.650
First is to lay
understand the steps

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.740
in the LCA, exactly what is
the methodology, how it's used,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.620
the specific steps in
it and what they mean,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.157
what goes into each of them.

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:10.240
But really, what we're
also going to spend time on

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.698
is understanding
the decisions that

00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:16.980
go into that, using the hand
dryer study as an example

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.240
to go through and
understand how you link all

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.520
these different steps together,
what it means in understanding

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.320
the decisions that you have
to make as a person doing this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.700
or as a company, in terms
of setting the boundary,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.020
understanding what your goal
is, and all the uncertainty that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.770
goes along with
all the decisions

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.985
and assumptions that you
have to make along the way.

00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:41.360
Last time when we were talking
about carbon footprinting,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.070
we were talking really
about things that

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.630
go on at the corporate level.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.170
Within the boundary is
essentially drawn around

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.120
your organization.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.750
We talked about how you
could use those internally,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.790
doing things like trying to
evaluate different departments

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.400
in your organization,
tracking your performance,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.800
setting up some kind
of internal metrics.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.450
All the standard
sort of things you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.540
would do for financial cost,
quality, sustainability, really

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.259
just one extension of that.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.900
But also talking about
its relation to external,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.640
you're publishing a
corporate CSR report,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.770
participating in programs like
the Carbon Disclosure Project,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.164
reporting to regulators,
investors, et cetera.

00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:21.830
And one of the things
we've talked about

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.220
was the difficulty in
comparing between organizations

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.100
that might be doing
different activities.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.380
Even though they operate
in the same business space,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.430
they might produce some
of the same products,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.470
it's very difficult to
compare two organizations

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.714
based on their organizational
level reporting,

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:39.130
because they might control
different aspects of the supply

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.629
chain.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.720
They may do different
things, even if they're

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.120
producing the same products.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.600
Today we're going to talk
about the lower section here,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.030
which is how we do a product
or a supply chain level

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.260
comparison.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.890
And some of the same
ideas still apply,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.500
that there might be
reasons to do this

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.760
both internally and externally.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.385
Internally, right,
trying to understand

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:59.310
where in the supply chain
your environmental impact is.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.526
What are the things you
might have control over

00:03:01.526 --> 00:03:03.150
that you might be
willing to-- that you

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.960
might be looking to change.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.110
Exploring, especially
differences

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.790
in the design or
changes that you might

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.800
make to reduce those impacts.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.256
But also it has an external
components as well,

00:03:13.256 --> 00:03:14.630
namely around
things like product

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.840
labeling or making environmental
claims about your product.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.080
Trying to convince
consumers or your customers

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.622
that your product is better than
ones that are on the market.

00:03:23.622 --> 00:03:26.079
And again, there's going to be
some slight differences that

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.810
go on between what
you're trying to do

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.490
and how you might go about it.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.290
So with that, we'll start off
talking about this hand dryer

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.440
study, and then go through
the bits and pieces of it

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.320
individually.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.765
This really is
getting into-- it's

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.390
a pretty good example
of something that

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.270
gets at the fundamental
questions of how

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.970
you compare different
products and different things.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.590
In this case, we
don't really care

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.710
much about who owns which piece
of each of these products.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.970
We're looking at the product as
a whole from beginning to end

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.560
and trying to come up with
a way of comparing them.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.810
This is the result from
some of the material that

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.860
came out of the
publication of this study.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.240
But it requires a different
type of analysis and sort

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.700
of a different level of work.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.899
Has anybody in here done a
life cycle assessment before?

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.310
What kind of product,
or what did you look at?

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.060
AUDIENCE: I used to
work at a company that

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.878
made seafood products, and we
looked at three of our SKUs

00:04:26.878 --> 00:04:28.640
that we made for Walmart.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.040
They asked us to specifically
do a life cycle assessment

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.720
on three different
products of theirs.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.390
PROFESSOR: Just to
understand what the--

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.147
AUDIENCE: Yeah, not
of a larger, they

00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:39.230
were working with us and
numerous other companies,

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.800
but they were trying to get
a sense of what the larger

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.305
impact of individual
items that they carried

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:48.721
was in different departments
over the course of the weeks.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.095
PROFESSOR: Did you actually
do the-- were you responsible

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:51.640
for sort of--

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.889
AUDIENCE: I did a large
portion of the data collection

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.600
for the stuff we were most
directly responsible for.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.120
It was kind of
broken into chunks,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.404
so a major part
was packaging, then

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:02.320
there was the food that
went in the packaging.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.730
And so I was working with
all the different groups who

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.230
knew the most about
those respective portions

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.380
to then draw the data from them
and put it together cohesively.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.870
PROFESSOR: How
about anybody else?

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.590
Anybody read previous
studies like this before,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.510
or seen anything
like this before?

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.310
AUDIENCE: I actually read this
one for when we were working

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.600
on the [? S-Lab ?] project.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.540
And I really wanted
some guidance

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.200
on the choice of materials.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.170
So they said LCA, but
when we got down to it,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.652
it was actually
just the materials,

00:05:39.652 --> 00:05:42.035
so it was not the
whole assessment.

00:05:42.035 --> 00:05:43.910
PROFESSOR: What were
some of your impressions

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.252
about it after
reading through this?

00:05:49.556 --> 00:05:52.647
AUDIENCE: I thought
it was strange of them

00:05:52.647 --> 00:05:54.480
in the beginning to say
that they were going

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.580
to do a full life cycle
assessment including

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.010
transportation costs, and
then two sentences later they

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.850
said they were going to
ignore the entire supply chain

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.690
and just focus on doing
an apples to apples

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.610
comparison of the performance.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.540
And they sort of black
box all of the dryers

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.880
into the same sort
of process in China.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.160
And I thought we weren't
necessarily getting

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.740
who, maybe, was the real
champion between Dyson

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.400
and Excel.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.430
Because if perhaps
one of them happens

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.090
to have manufacturing
in the United States,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.280
then they're getting
a large transportation

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.590
cost lumped into the cycle
that maybe doesn't exist.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.540
So I don't really know why
they decided to go that route.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.210
It seems like they went
through all the machinations

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.720
for the paper towels, so
it wouldn't have been maybe

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.610
that difficult to get it
for the other companies

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.029
as well, so that they actually
did the real full life cycle.

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:49.570
Because otherwise,
it seems like they

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.990
should have collapsed
the scope if they only

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.110
wanted to do performance,
and leave the upstream part

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.822
of the supply chain out of it.

00:06:56.822 --> 00:07:00.100
PROFESSOR: So right, they didn't
really ignore the supply chain,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.137
they more just standardized
it, in a sense.

00:07:03.137 --> 00:07:05.470
Because they did include all
of those things that go on,

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.830
but they didn't model
the exact supply chain

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.790
that each specific
product might have taken.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.550
So what was the reason for that?

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.560
They mentioned why
they did it in there.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.351
AUDIENCE: They said
they wanted to put them

00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:19.540
all on equal footing as
part of the supply chain,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.580
but it seems like
not putting them

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.080
on equal footing is sort of
the purpose of the life cycle,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.436
to see who actually
has the better process.

00:07:29.436 --> 00:07:31.220
AUDIENCE: It actually
didn't matter.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.210
They had a figure that explained
if all these different devices

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.620
were manufactured in
Malaysia, US, or China,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.790
there's very little
difference across them.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.520
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.853
We'll talk about that, because
as we read through there,

00:07:43.853 --> 00:07:46.580
there's a lot of assumptions
that they had to make going on.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.670
So what might have
been one of the reasons

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.630
they had to make that assumption
about the supply chain,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.450
about taking this.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.190
AUDIENCE: They just might not
have had the data available

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.790
and they determined that they
could spend a year trying

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.680
to find the data,
but in the end,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.100
it wouldn't have
made a difference

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.733
and they wanted to
go through the study

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:03.722
and finish it anyways.

00:08:03.722 --> 00:08:04.430
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.690
In essence, that if you didn't
have all the information

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.500
for all of the products,
then you really

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.170
had two choices which
was to perhaps go

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.572
spend the time trying
to identify everything,

00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:17.280
the exact path that
all of those products

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.560
took in their supply chain.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.290
The other would be to
try to ignore that piece

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.920
and put them on a sort
of standardized setting

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.080
to do the comparison with,
and then come back later

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.538
and test some of
those assumptions.

00:08:27.538 --> 00:08:30.300
And that was sort
of the approach

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.980
that they took with this one.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.324
What were some of the
other areas that stood out?

00:08:35.324 --> 00:08:37.449
AUDIENCE: The
sensitivity analyses

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:40.289
were the majority of the paper.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:43.179
PROFESSOR: The paper
itself was like 25 pages,

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.805
and then there was like 80
pages of sensitivity analysis

00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:46.280
and whatnot at the end.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.779
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and
there were a lot

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:50.780
of assumptions in understanding
which of the assumptions

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.685
had more risk.

00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:55.980
What I was really struck
by, too, was the fact

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.610
that so much of
the data was coming

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.700
from either the
companies themselves

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.500
or from other studies.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.570
And there was a point at
the end of the paper that

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.610
said they didn't have
access to the writers,

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.140
authors, or practitioners
who prepared those studies.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.759
So I think that the gap,
they made assumptions

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:18.717
made on gaps of information,
but even the information

00:09:18.717 --> 00:09:21.182
that they do have I
called into question.

00:09:21.182 --> 00:09:24.140
I [? didn't believe ?]
the accuracy of it.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.480
PROFESSOR: So access
to data was something

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.814
that came up a number of times.

00:09:27.814 --> 00:09:29.730
You saw there are a
number of previous studies

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.190
that have been
done, and you kept

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.523
probably noticing the references
throughout the document

00:09:33.523 --> 00:09:36.380
of every time that there's some
assumption or some play made.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.110
And most of them were
being traced back

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.017
to previous studies that
had been done before.

00:09:41.017 --> 00:09:44.000
AUDIENCE: Even if you
had access to data,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.950
the thing also is that data
changes and you get updates,

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.730
and you get more data.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.100
So I thought that the LSA
was true at some point,

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.435
but it's also made very quickly.

00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:02.080
PROFESSOR: I'm going
to say it's static.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.860
It's a snapshot
of a point in time

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.650
of a specific configuration
of the supply chain analysis.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.070
AUDIENCE: My frustration with
it was the single most important

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.774
variable when it's how long
people take to dry their hands

00:10:13.774 --> 00:10:15.190
or how many paper
towels they use,

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.830
and they had no
real data on that.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.164
It was just completely made
up, because you can't really

00:10:20.164 --> 00:10:22.329
get that kind of data,
because you can't put cameras

00:10:22.329 --> 00:10:24.410
in a bathroom, and you
can't put someone in there

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.420
without affecting
their behaviors.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.894
PROFESSOR: The joke
that they had--

00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:30.310
the study authors were here
at MIT in the material systems

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.790
labs-- is that they
thought about going out

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.456
to the airport and
just sort of standing

00:10:33.456 --> 00:10:36.182
in the bathroom with a
notepad tracking people,

00:10:36.182 --> 00:10:38.723
but figured that might get them
thrown out by security pretty

00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:39.223
quickly.

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:45.250
In some sense, this comes back
to the idea of access to data.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.160
You're making these assumptions
because you lack the data

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.662
that, if you had gone through
and done some of the studies

00:10:53.662 --> 00:10:56.120
and things like that-- actually
observed people-- you might

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.885
understand how exactly it is,
what is the average hand drying

00:10:59.885 --> 00:11:01.060
time, things like that.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.750
AUDIENCE: They talked about the
lifetime of the dryer, which

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.410
they had as five
years, and thought

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.555
that seemed kind of low.

00:11:08.555 --> 00:11:09.930
It seems like five
years would be

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.390
pretty frequent for a building
manager to change out dryers.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.460
Is that time until
it breaks or is

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.820
that the time until they
recommended [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.569
PROFESSOR: Anybody know
why they chose five years?

00:11:21.569 --> 00:11:22.360
AUDIENCE: Warranty.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.945
PROFESSOR: That's
what the warranty is.

00:11:23.945 --> 00:11:24.890
AUDIENCE: But how many people--

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.765
PROFESSOR: Throw it out
if it's working fine.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.030
I'm going to Juan,
this goes back

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:41.440
to your first point
about what they chose.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.780
The configuration of the supply
chain was important, right.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.780
And this goes back to, if
we're taking a static snapshot

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.340
of something that all the
different permutations and all

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.690
the different combinations
might be difficult to do,

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.160
so you have to start
making some judgments

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.930
about the configuration
of the supply chain.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.096
And so they did that, in
this case, by assuming they

00:11:59.096 --> 00:12:00.000
all came from China.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.720
Except for the towels,
which came from the US,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.120
because that's sort of
the industry standard.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.730
That's the second one, these
are related to each other.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.400
As you start
digging into it, you

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.090
start running into
all these areas

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.250
that you could do
things differently,

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.640
and there's sort of all these
different variables that

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.190
go into it.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.470
At some point, you
have to start making

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.770
some assumptions
and some limitations

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.210
to try to do better on it.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.190
Did any of you think
any of these-- I mean,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.740
they did some
sensitivity analysis,

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.250
but which ones do you
think would significantly

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.580
have affected the outcome?

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.669
Or were there any?

00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:41.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that usage data, too,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.950
was just a huge factor, because
if you looked at the outputs.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.390
The overall ranking
of the product

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.000
was so largely driven
by what was said,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.660
was estimated to be your usage.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:13:00.950
That was one of the least
effectively tracked, or easily

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.160
quantifiable metrics.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.938
So to me, that was just
sort of [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:04.938 --> 00:13:06.790
AUDIENCE: Going
along those lines,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.830
I think that it was
the number of papers,

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:15.382
or the mass of the papers
that is used for one usage.

00:13:15.382 --> 00:13:21.146
So that had a significant
impact on how big

00:13:21.146 --> 00:13:26.635
of a GWP for the
paper towels have

00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:29.140
compared to all the others.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.610
So that was a big
assumption, too.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:35.012
They made some big assumptions
on the hand dryers,

00:13:35.012 --> 00:13:36.503
but also on the paper towels.

00:13:36.503 --> 00:13:38.070
PROFESSOR: And in
some sense, this

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.290
gets back to--
Different bathrooms

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.940
have different types
of paper towels,

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.895
and so identifying
one paper towel

00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:49.020
that you're going to choose
to be representative of

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.775
can be quite difficult to do.

00:13:51.775 --> 00:13:53.777
AUDIENCE: I [? think also ?]
throwing out

00:13:53.777 --> 00:13:57.940
the electric grid assumptions
[INAUDIBLE] in use,

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.906
and they had some pretty big
impacts on the manufacturing

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:01.879
for the paper towels.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:04.170
So the paper towels, if they
weren't made in the United

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.470
States and they weren't
made on the average,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.870
that could have a huge impact.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.330
Likewise the usage, depending
on where it was being used,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.066
[INAUDIBLE] would have a big
impact on the electric dryers.

00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:19.160
PROFESSOR: So if
you were Xlerator

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.410
which came in probably
as the most similar,

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.070
in terms of products that
it would be competing with.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.180
I don't know if you've used the
Xlerator dryer before, but just

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.742
really powerful
heated air coming out.

00:14:29.742 --> 00:14:30.950
A little bit different setup.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.300
But it generally,
and the results

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.100
showed us the second best after
the Dyson one, but probably

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.720
their direct competitor.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.010
So what would your response
be if you were Xlerator

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.262
and you saw Dyson sort
of promoting this study?

00:14:44.262 --> 00:14:46.720
AUDIENCE: [? I think I'd say ?]
Xlerator was made in the US

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.483
and Dyson was made in Malaysia,
so you could point out that

00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:53.864
Dyson doesn't have to be--
Dyson using the [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:53.864 --> 00:14:58.211
[INAUDIBLE] the US electric grid
for [? manual ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:58.211 --> 00:15:03.041
and also have to ship the
products across the ocean.

00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:05.040
PROFESSOR: That's a big
part of the marketing,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.470
they need to have
a made in the US

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.830
certified, whatever that
means, on their webpage.

00:15:12.134 --> 00:15:14.930
AUDIENCE: Also for Xlerator,
the measured versus

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.310
reported drying times
were really different.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.980
For Dyson they were
exactly the same,

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.085
it was almost
double for Xlerator.

00:15:21.085 --> 00:15:24.174
So they may want to get control
of how much time they think

00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:26.925
people are spending and
maybe make their machines

00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:28.091
a little bit more efficient.

00:15:28.091 --> 00:15:30.840
Because if they were to go to
12 seconds, which is lower,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.670
the difference between Dyson
and Xlerator wasn't that big.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.695
But when you went
with the 20-- I

00:15:35.695 --> 00:15:37.420
think it was 20
seconds-- that's where

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.711
the difference was more severe.

00:15:38.711 --> 00:15:41.546
PROFESSOR: So where did that
measured drying time come from?

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.150
AUDIENCE: Because they
looked for the measure,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:52.130
they were following the NSF
standards of 0.1 gram of water

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.810
on the hands when you
dry it on a towel.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.090
But in [INAUDIBLE] I mean,
it's really perceptions.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.130
The user doesn't actually
measure 0.1 grams of water

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.440
on my hand, you'd better
stop using the dryer.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.170
It's really a perception issue.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.420
PROFESSOR: We had that
NSF protocol, all right.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.325
This is not National
Science Foundation,

00:16:11.325 --> 00:16:14.559
it's National Standards
or International Standards

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:15.850
Institute, something like that.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.270
They have standards for a lot
of things, and in this case,

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.620
it's how do you
define dry hands.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.950
So it's whatever it was, 0.01
grams of moisture per whatever

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:28.280
is how they defined it.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.774
So the idea would be that if you
were trying to objectively make

00:16:31.774 --> 00:16:33.940
some claim about how long
it takes to dry the hands,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.231
that might be one way to do it.

00:16:35.231 --> 00:16:37.596
Who actually did the
testing for that, though?

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:40.387
AUDIENCE: It was some study
at University of Florida.

00:16:40.387 --> 00:16:42.720
I don't really know how they
came up with those numbers.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.870
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.720
I think, actually,
Dyson reported it.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.080
So it was coming from
a document that Dyson

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.590
had claiming that somebody
had done this test

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.440
and come up with it.

00:16:57.867 --> 00:16:59.700
So you see, we're
starting to get this paper

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.300
trail going back and figuring
out that so much of the study

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:08.470
was dependent on this value,
and that the person reporting

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.950
these values is
essentially Dyson,

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.089
who's making the claim
that it came from.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:17.384
Even though we have sort of
a standard that makes sense

00:17:17.384 --> 00:17:19.550
in terms of, OK, we're going
to try to find some way

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.040
to do this objectively.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.230
It still would definitely leave
some room open for Xlerator

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.174
to probably take
some issues with it.

00:17:28.174 --> 00:17:30.720
AUDIENCE: If Xlerator was really
concerned about the results

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.129
of the study, too-- and
something I've never noticed

00:17:33.129 --> 00:17:34.670
using one of the
Airblades, they said

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.970
that it has a digital motor,
so it has no spin down time,

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:43.480
so they didn't credit the Dyson
with any 1.5 seconds spin down.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.670
Whereas the Xlerator was
doing it out 3 over 750 watts,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:54.970
and assume 750 watts, which
adds up over the 350,000 uses.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.820
So I guess if they wanted
to borrow that idea

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.060
and get rid of some
energy consumption,

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.024
they could do that.

00:18:03.024 --> 00:18:04.940
PROFESSOR: So if you
were Xlerator you'd seen,

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.900
you read this study, and
wanted to respond to that,

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.540
what might you go
do differently?

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.800
AUDIENCE: One, you might
commission your own study.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.970
Since this was
commissioned by Dyson.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.180
That's a pretty
big starting point.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.220
Dyson commissioned-- not to
say that the researchers at MIT

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.850
weren't as objective as
possible-- but as we noted,

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.565
there was a good deal of
data that the study was

00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:29.940
dependent on that
came from Dyson

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.112
and Dyson then commissioned
the study with it.

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.570
So if I'm Xlerator, I'd probably
like to have a say in that

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:34.910
as well.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.470
PROFESSOR: Right, so that
was one of the other issues

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.400
with the data access, right.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.926
Because Dyson was
behind this, they

00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:40.550
supplied the bill of
materials and they

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.785
supplied all of the data
about the factory and things

00:18:43.785 --> 00:18:45.535
like that, whereas all
the other products,

00:18:45.535 --> 00:18:47.826
they had to make use of
publicly available information.

00:18:47.826 --> 00:18:50.300
So they didn't have access
to that inside information.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.250
So if you were Xlerator and saw
this, and disagreed with it,

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.604
you could commission
your own study.

00:18:56.604 --> 00:18:58.020
You could now make
use of the fact

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.350
that you know about
your supply chain,

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.347
and you could start actually
going and doing the details.

00:19:03.347 --> 00:19:05.430
You could go through the
fact that you're actually

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.846
made in the US,
and you might want

00:19:06.846 --> 00:19:08.950
to redo the study
under that assumption.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.574
That you're going look at
it with your specific supply

00:19:12.574 --> 00:19:13.990
chain, no longer
considering, say,

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:17.160
a generic's supply
chain from China.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.290
So what would you do
to get around this?

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.740
Because that is still
sort of the crux of it,

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.260
was that you both claim
similar drying times,

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.471
but they're saying
that in practice, yours

00:19:30.471 --> 00:19:31.220
is actually worse.

00:19:34.636 --> 00:19:37.570
AUDIENCE: I don't know, it
just depends on [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.960
here's what they did.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.210
Putting cameras or
individuals in bathrooms,

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.030
but potentially building
in some sort of chip that

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.330
enables you to see what
actual times are for drying,

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.366
and then that could
work in your favor.

00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:58.230
PROFESSOR: I might go out
and actually redo this study

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.190
that Dyson was reporting.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.490
If I use this NSF study, to
go in and at least verify

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.380
that it really does
take my machine

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.890
30 seconds versus their 12
seconds or something like that.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.090
So at MIT, if you wanted
to do study of figuring out

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.510
how long people
actually dried it,

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.430
you'd have to go through
the human subject ethics

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.410
board and all of that.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.826
So you might have
trouble actually

00:20:23.826 --> 00:20:26.580
getting a study through where
you actually went out and tried

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.430
to observe it.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.140
But you could at
least try to reduce

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.050
some of that uncertainty that
comes in the measurement,

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:37.119
since it's unfavorable to
you and not really much hard

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:38.410
information out there about it.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.800
So you might want to commission,
say, an outside source

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.580
to come in and
repeat that testing,

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.830
and see if they really got it.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.840
In terms of what they're
actually doing-- so

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.970
they actually have commissioned
a study to respond,

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.740
to follow up on this.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.410
Because nobody's
ever going to be

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.930
happy with all the
assumptions that

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.790
go on in one of these,
especially when they turn out

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.400
to be-- if you look at
two of these big ones

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.060
that are certainly unfavorable
to Xlerator, probably.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.850
When you look at
them it makes sense

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.254
that maybe you would want to
come back in and revisit this

00:21:11.254 --> 00:21:12.920
to try to make sure
that the assumptions

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.600
that your competitor is
making that are unfavorable

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.160
to you actually are
grounded in reality,

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.070
or don't necessarily
make a difference

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.440
in the final outcome.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.695
But you probably don't
want them releasing

00:21:23.695 --> 00:21:26.450
a study that says
this is your product

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.910
and it's worse for
the environment,

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.500
it takes longer
to dry, et cetera,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.390
without at least being prepared
with some sort of follow up

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:36.470
to dispute that, other
than to just ignore it

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.394
or claim that there's
problems with it.

00:21:38.394 --> 00:21:39.810
You'd like to be
able to come back

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.657
with some sort of response
that's grounded in some data

00:21:43.657 --> 00:21:44.740
or have some facts for it.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.670
We're going to walk through
this a little bit more in depth

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.680
in terms of looking at it within
the scope of the methodology

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.830
of life cycle assessment.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:22:00.724
But to start off with, just
what is life cycle assessment.

00:22:00.724 --> 00:22:02.140
And that's a good
question to ask,

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.050
because it took some
time for the industry

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.890
itself to figure out
what exactly it was.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.330
But there are a set
of ISO standards

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.810
that I think were produced in
the 1997, the first version.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:12.860
Essentially it says this.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.410
LCA is a technique for
assessing environmental aspects

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.490
and potential impacts
with a product by first,

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.940
compiling an inventory of
the inputs and outputs.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.770
So tracking, what's coming in
and out of the environment.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.204
Second, evaluating the
potential impacts associated

00:22:27.204 --> 00:22:28.370
with the inputs and outputs.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.280
So figuring out,
now I know what I'm

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.410
emitting to the air, what I'm
taking out of the environment,

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.490
actually figuring out
what those impacts are.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.180
And one of the
key points here is

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.230
that it specifically mentions
the potential environmental

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.730
impacts.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.060
Because some of
these studies are

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.110
going to be forward looking.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.484
Trying to figure
out what happens

00:22:44.484 --> 00:22:47.120
when we make a change as opposed
to some of these studies that

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.036
are looking backwards
and trying to figure out

00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:50.740
what the actual impact is.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.837
So that's a big one, is
that a lot of times, we

00:22:52.837 --> 00:22:55.420
don't necessarily know what the
exact environmental impact is.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.169
We're trying to forecast ahead
of time what it's going to be.

00:22:58.169 --> 00:22:59.710
And finally,
interpreting the results

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.229
in the inventory analysis and
impact assessment in relation

00:23:03.229 --> 00:23:04.520
to the objectives of the study.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.630
So the big thing about this
is that it's sort of fluid,

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.824
in terms of what an LCA is.

00:23:10.824 --> 00:23:13.240
Because you start off with
creating some kind of objective

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.781
of what you want to do with the
study, and all of the results

00:23:15.781 --> 00:23:17.930
that you generate are going
to be interpreted back

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.604
in terms of that scope and that
goal that you started with.

00:23:20.604 --> 00:23:22.270
Some of the important
things to remember

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.277
is that it takes
a life cycle view

00:23:24.277 --> 00:23:26.110
of the product, so raw
materials all the way

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.200
through to end of life.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.180
So to cradle to grave
is typically the way

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.140
that would be talked about.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.770
And while it specifically
mentions products,

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.460
it can be mentioned
for services as well.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.180
So we can think of the
hand drying example.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.950
It's not necessarily
comparing products,

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.725
it's more comparing a
service, that of drying hands.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.250
LCA generally
credited to Coca Cola

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.760
as being the first person to
develop this back in 1969, when

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.310
they commissioned
a study that would

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.250
look at the environmental impact
of using cans or glass bottles.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.960
So this is when they were first
thinking about going to cans,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.918
and they were trying to
understand not just all

00:24:05.918 --> 00:24:07.510
the economic and
supply chain impact,

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.300
but they wanted to consider the
environmental impacts as well.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.327
They commissioned a study and
actually hired some researchers

00:24:13.327 --> 00:24:14.910
to do it, and
essentially they came up

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.770
with what would eventually
become life cycle assessment,

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.210
in terms of quantifying
that environmental impact

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.750
in some manner by looking
at the inputs and outputs.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.622
So that was in 1969.

00:24:26.622 --> 00:24:28.330
It started to gain
attention in the '70s.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.300
There were other efforts
going on in this area,

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.830
especially in Europe
with the energy crisis.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.040
There was a lot more
concern about things

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.500
like how much energy
products were using,

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.240
services, about what
it was going to mean.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.660
As that started to
fade away-- the energy

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.150
crisis-- in the '80s, it
became a little bit more

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.350
known for companies making
environmental claims

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.840
about their products, so
trying to use it in advertising

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.150
and things like that.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.751
It gave rise to what they
referred to as hired gun

00:24:56.751 --> 00:24:57.250
studies.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.220
Which is basically, as we saw,
there's a lot of assumptions

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.930
and a lot of
questionable assumptions,

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.044
at times, that go into
doing one of these studies.

00:25:07.044 --> 00:25:08.710
And what they were
finding is that there

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.710
are companies out there
that you would hire them

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.940
and they would construct
a study in such a way

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.510
that it said basically
whatever you wanted, reaching

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.620
the point that 11 state attorney
generals issued guidelines

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.310
saying that you couldn't use
life cycle assessment to make

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:24.470
a claim or a comparative claim
about the environmental impact

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.440
of your product in
an advertisement,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.510
until LCA became standardized.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.270
Until a uniform
methodology was developed.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.020
So that sort of
kicked it into gear

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.260
of getting different companies,
different organizations

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.580
together to try to iron out
what exactly a life cycle

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.100
assessment was going to be.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.210
SETAC was probably
the leading group,

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.770
and then it's something
like the something

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.220
environmental toxicity
and chemistry,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.057
society for environmental
toxicity in chemistry, I think.

00:25:53.057 --> 00:25:53.890
Something like that.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.310
So it's generally
chemists, people

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.740
that study ecotoxicology,
things like that,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.600
getting together and creating
working groups, generally

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.820
of academics and practitioners,
trying to come up

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.150
with a uniform methodology
that can be used for life cycle

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.140
assessment.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.710
And eventually this developed
into some standards from ISO.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.830
14040 is the main
one, but there are

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.490
about four or five
different offshoots

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.010
from that that cover
different aspects of it,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:26.530
from the guidelines for how you
do it, to how you would use it,

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.990
to making claims, or
how you would use it

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.260
for putting labels on products.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.530
So it's sort of grown quite
a bit from those beginnings.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.770
So essentially, the
methodology that they developed

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.600
is going to consist
of four stages.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.650
The first of which is the
goal and scope definition.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.640
Which is comprised of
a couple of things,

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.130
namely deciding what
it is you're analyzing,

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:53.980
looking at what the scope of the
system is under consideration,

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.150
identifying what falls
within your system boundary.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.960
The second step is referred
to as the inventory analysis.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.550
This is where you're
identifying and quantifying

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.734
all the things that
come in, raw materials

00:27:05.734 --> 00:27:07.400
that are coming in
from the environment,

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.691
all the emissions that are
going back out, whether it's

00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:12.610
to air or water or land.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:16.700
Other products that you might
be using, all of the inputs.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.920
And essentially creating
an inventory of those,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.380
identifying how much there are.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.450
The third step is
the impact analysis.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.110
This is where we go
from the inventory,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.440
from identifying
everything that's going in,

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.060
to figuring out what exactly the
environmental impact from that

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.200
is going to be, and what
methodology is used to do that.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.490
And then finally,
as we talked about,

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.040
interpretation is
the fourth step.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.490
So we want to go
back and, after we've

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.160
set the goal of the study--
identified the scope

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.180
and gone through and quantified
the environmental impact-- how

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.100
do we take these results
and relate them back

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.150
all the things we set out
from the beginning that

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:52.900
were our goals.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.840
So if we start off with the
goal and scope definition,

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.669
right, the first thing
is to decide the product

00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:06.210
you're going to be studying and
what the purpose of the study

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:06.760
is.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.740
And that includes three points.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.990
What is the intended application
of the study, so what

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.290
are you trying to do with it.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.520
What's your reason
for carrying it out.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.410
And third, for whom are the
results going to be used.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:23.586
So if we look at the study
that we looked at today,

00:28:23.586 --> 00:28:25.960
you'll notice when the study
is laid out, as you read it,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.293
it was actually laid out in
sections that followed along

00:28:28.293 --> 00:28:31.290
from our four step.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.060
Let's talk about the
product to be studied

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.268
and the purpose of the study.

00:28:34.268 --> 00:28:37.319
What did they claim were
the reasons for doing this?

00:28:37.319 --> 00:28:39.610
First off, what was the
product that was being studied?

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.785
AUDIENCE: A dry set of hands.

00:28:44.785 --> 00:28:47.890
PROFESSOR: So it's
a Dyson Airblade

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.480
and it's not a paper towel.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:58.580
What they set up was a
per pair of dried hands.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.400
So this is what we would refer
to as the functional unit.

00:29:11.899 --> 00:29:13.690
This is actually what
we're going to study,

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.670
and everything that's
done throughout the study

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:16.780
is in terms of this.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.910
So this is going to be
our unit of analysis,

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.740
it's going to be how
we're going to compare

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.031
all of these different options.

00:29:24.884 --> 00:29:26.800
And what did they say
the intended application

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.750
of the study was?

00:29:30.612 --> 00:29:33.487
What were they trying to do?

00:29:33.487 --> 00:29:38.756
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
dry hands [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:41.472 --> 00:29:43.180
PROFESSOR: So they
actually had two uses.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.628
What was the target
audience for this?

00:29:49.628 --> 00:29:50.836
AUDIENCE: [? The engineer. ?]

00:29:50.836 --> 00:29:51.590
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.730
So if we look at
in terms of this,

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.235
one group of people that
the results were for

00:30:03.235 --> 00:30:04.460
were the Dyson engineers.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.827
They wanted to go
through and understand

00:30:06.827 --> 00:30:08.660
where were the impact--
what was the reason,

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.230
it was to identify the impacts
associated with the Airblade

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.550
so that the engineers
could take a look at that

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.000
and start figuring
out ways to reduce it.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.064
What was the other purpose?

00:30:19.064 --> 00:30:24.848
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
environmental impacts.

00:30:24.848 --> 00:30:26.240
PROFESSOR: Related to that.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.040
So if all I wanted to do was
identify for my engineers

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.560
where the impacts
of the Airblade is,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.430
would I need to consider
paper towels and the Xlerator

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.971
and things like that?

00:30:37.971 --> 00:30:38.470
No.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:46.650
So that's our second
reason, was comparative.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.910
They wanted to go
through and say

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:52.320
here's the environmental
impact associated

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.910
with a dry pair of hands
when you use the Airblade,

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.510
and here it is when
you associated it

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.290
with one of the other
products under consideration.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:03.650
So they actually
had the Airblade.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.040
What else did they study?

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.884
The Xlerator.

00:31:10.884 --> 00:31:12.848
AUDIENCE: Recycled paper towels.

00:31:12.848 --> 00:31:16.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so they had
two versions of the paper towel.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:20.060
And they had two versions
of the Airblade, too.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.628
The aluminum and the plastic.

00:31:21.628 --> 00:31:22.711
AUDIENCE: Standard, right?

00:31:22.711 --> 00:31:23.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah, standard.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.125
Cotton Roll towels.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.290
So this gets back to our
choice of a functional

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.360
unit was the dry pair of
hands, so this gives us

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.020
the basis that we're going
to do these comparisons on.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.970
But in terms of the goal
and scope, that's important,

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:51.327
because if I just wanted to
use something internally, then

00:31:51.327 --> 00:31:52.660
I would never go to the trouble.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.900
There's no need to go to all of
the trouble to do all of this.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.720
The big thing that
drove a lot of this

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.636
is the idea that it's
going to be comparative.

00:31:59.636 --> 00:32:02.150
That they actually want to
make a comparison between what

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:04.400
happens when you use the
Airblade between when you use

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.340
some of these other systems.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.040
And it's going to come back
because once they did this,

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.540
then they had to start making
a lot of assumptions about how

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.831
these other systems work,
since they didn't necessarily

00:32:15.831 --> 00:32:16.940
have the data to that.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.120
And then because you're
doing that comparison,

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.240
you sort of-- part
of it is they're

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.170
going to make this
available externally.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.830
They've said that
part of it might be

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:26.310
to use this for making claims.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.893
And so once you've
decided that you're

00:32:27.893 --> 00:32:31.430
going to start using
it for public claims,

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.780
you definitely want to be
a little bit more rigorous

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.430
in your application
and your approach.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.500
Because as soon as you publish
this and start making claims

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.280
that X and all of
the other companies

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.030
are going to look at
this and think, well,

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.660
why didn't you do
this, why this.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.120
So this sort of
drives a lot of what

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.610
goes on in the next few steps.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.890
That by doing this, now we've
expanded the scope of our study

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.010
from just looking at
my supply chain, which

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.785
I have pretty good
visibility to,

00:32:54.785 --> 00:32:57.160
to starting to look at a lot
of different other products.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.490
And this brings a lot of
extra complexity to it,

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.420
because I have a number
of different studies.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.820
And if each of these has
different configurations

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.130
or different
assumptions that I make,

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.980
the complexity starts
really blowing up.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.336
System boundary.

00:33:14.336 --> 00:33:16.210
What did they choose
for the system boundary?

00:33:19.102 --> 00:33:22.970
AUDIENCE: They chose not to
include things like maintenance

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:27.178
or transportation
[INAUDIBLE] So they

00:33:27.178 --> 00:33:32.030
had to make a lot of assumptions
[? around ?] the [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.220
PROFESSOR: So they start off
by saying this is a life cycle

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:35.800
assessment.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.830
So we're going to
do cradle to grave.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:45.020
And you can think about
that, that idea that you're

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.020
doing cradle to grave
creates a lot of problems,

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:51.680
because they mentioned there's
how many different screws

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.164
in the Airblade?

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:54.830
And you think that
now you need to trace

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.610
each of these little parts all
the way up through their supply

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.310
chain.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.690
So they started making
some definitions

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:04.450
about where they were going to
sort of consider things outside

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:06.020
of the system boundary.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.909
So there are a couple of
issues that go into that.

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:12.380
So one was cut off rules.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.308
So what did they use
as a cut off rule?

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.116
AUDIENCE: 1%, if it's
less than 1% in effect

00:34:22.116 --> 00:34:23.590
then they didn't include it.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.174
PROFESSOR: Right,
and so this creates--

00:34:26.174 --> 00:34:27.090
what's the issue here.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.639
If it had less than 1%
of the total impact,

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:32.850
they would exclude it.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.962
What's the issue with
using this as a rule?

00:34:35.962 --> 00:34:37.924
AUDIENCE: Number of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:37.924 --> 00:34:41.232
PROFESSOR: That's part of it.

00:34:41.232 --> 00:34:43.190
How do you know when
something only contributes

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.590
1% of the total impact?

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.639
It's like a chicken
and the egg problem.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:52.280
If you've quantified to
identify that it's less than 1%

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.760
of the impact, why
wouldn't you include it.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:00.650
What they have actually done
is for all those little things,

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:03.310
they've done some basically
back of the envelope

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.842
or some other type of
high level estimate

00:35:05.842 --> 00:35:07.300
to try to figure
out what they are,

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.925
without going to the
trouble of digging

00:35:08.925 --> 00:35:12.524
down deep into the level of it
to try to identify what it was.

00:35:12.524 --> 00:35:14.190
They mentioned some
of the other, right?

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.916
They were using a
lot of information

00:35:15.916 --> 00:35:17.290
from other previous
studies, they

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.665
mentioned some of
the other rules

00:35:18.665 --> 00:35:20.760
that some of the other
studies had used.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.925
Remember what some
of those were?

00:35:22.925 --> 00:35:24.705
AUDIENCE: Also on
that, didn't they

00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:30.630
limit it to no more than
like 5% of the total product

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.156
on this 1% assumption
so they couldn't

00:35:33.156 --> 00:35:35.032
say every screw didn't matter.

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:35.740
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:42.530
So we do any individual
process that was less than 1%,

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:46.049
and in total, everything that I
excluded had to be less than 5%

00:35:46.049 --> 00:35:46.590
of the total.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:51.630
These are pretty common rules.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.960
So you can think about this is
if you had a bunch of things

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.970
that were less than 1%, but then
you estimated the total impact,

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.800
they were only covering 90%.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.270
So you would just start
adding more and more of those

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.930
back into the system boundary
until you hit that 95% percent

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.030
point.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.620
Some of the other studies
used a slightly different rule

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.130
than the impact.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:19.090
So some of them did this
based on physical quantities.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.620
So anything that was
less than 1% of the mass,

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.720
I think one of the
studies, was excluded.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.510
This tends to be easier,
because you don't actually

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.030
have to go to the trouble of
estimating what the impact is.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.530
You can start saying,
well, I'm just

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:36.660
going to exclude all of the
tiny little things that go.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.494
But you're making an
assumption that those

00:36:38.494 --> 00:36:39.660
don't contribute big, right.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.410
So if it's got-- I don't
know, some uranium in it

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.240
or something else
that's radioactive,

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:49.460
that may have a very high impact
in terms of certain categories

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.770
even if they don't contribute
much the overall weight.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:54.290
So generally, this
would be preferred.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.730
We would like to make a ballpark
estimate of what the impact is

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:01.730
and then go through and
exclude based on that

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.420
rather than basically
just using one

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.900
of these physical quantities.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.130
There were some other
things that they cut out

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:13.210
from the system boundary.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.260
AUDIENCE: Something about
excluding raw materials

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.310
PROFESSOR: So I think
they included that,

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.212
or they should have, at least.

00:37:23.212 --> 00:37:25.930
I think it was
mentioned earlier.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.141
We had capital goods,
were not included.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.130
This is also a fairly
common exclusion.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:45.450
Things that have a multiple year
lifetime, not to include those.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.890
You could include
in the same way

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.070
that, when they
made the decision

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.350
to do a dry pair of hands, they
had to start making assumptions

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.400
about the lifetime of the
product, how many uses

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.700
it was going to get made.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.080
And then they allocated
a portion of that

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:56.965
to the life cycle.

00:37:56.965 --> 00:38:00.240
They included things like
the bins and the liners

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.900
they were using for paper
towels and things like that.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.440
You could include capital goods.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.023
You'd have to start
making assumptions

00:38:06.023 --> 00:38:11.125
about how many years it existed,
how many products it read.

00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:13.250
If you were to include the
trucks or the ships that

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.422
move the goods, how
many trips a year

00:38:15.422 --> 00:38:17.380
does it make, how many
containers does it move.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.020
You could start doing that.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.030
They tend to be pretty low.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:25.316
If you're including
the transportation

00:38:25.316 --> 00:38:26.940
piece of the ocean,
so you're capturing

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.880
all of the fuel
that's being burned,

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.440
but you're just
not capturing what

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.610
goes into building the ship.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.500
So that's another one
that's a pretty common one.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.030
So they mentioned in
the study that some

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.450
of the studies they used had
excluded the capital goods,

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.720
and so they chose to exclude
capital goods in this as

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.250
well in order to maintain
that consistency.

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.580
So in this case, they
might have otherwise

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.860
chosen to include those.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.760
But because they were
relying on past data,

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.336
they went ahead and
included them anyway.

00:38:53.336 --> 00:38:54.710
What about with
the paper towels?

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.960
This was specifically one
of the issues that they had.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.785
AUDIENCE: Whether
or not to include

00:39:02.785 --> 00:39:05.160
the environmental impact
of previous recycling.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.108
PROFESSOR: Right, so
this is another big one.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.720
Specifically, what was it
about this type of recycling

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.350
that was difficult?

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:17.454
Remember what the term
they used for it was?

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.030
Open loop.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:26.110
So this is the problem
with things like paper,

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.335
is that something that is
a paper towel, if you were

00:39:29.335 --> 00:39:31.900
to collect it and
recycle it, usually

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.170
the strength of the paper you
get from the recycled fiber

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.610
is not as strong as it
was when it started.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.460
So if it started off as a paper
towel when you recycled it,

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.120
it's usually no longer strong
enough to be a paper towel.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.510
So it might get made into
toilet paper, or newsprint,

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.040
or whatever else is
on down the line.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.680
You get into this situation
where you have the product,

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.760
and you recycle
it, and then it's

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.930
going to go get turned into
some other product that

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.540
has its own life cycle,
and it's going through.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.146
As opposed to a
closed loop recycling,

00:40:04.146 --> 00:40:06.020
that product would just
get turned right back

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.410
into an input.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:10.920
And if I were to do that, then
I can draw my system boundary

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.640
around this, and I don't
have to worry about it,

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.890
because it will get included
in this system boundary.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.330
But when I'm doing
this, I start getting

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.200
into multiple different
types of products.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.950
This is a problem
because the input--

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:29.080
when it mentioned they had
the two types of paper towels.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.650
Some were made
from virgin fibers

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.920
and some were made
from recycled fibers.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.580
If it's made from
a recycled fiber,

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.620
it had its whole life cycle
before it became a paper towel.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.510
When it was maybe copy paper,
or something similar to that.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.436
That usually means
you're going to have

00:40:48.436 --> 00:40:50.560
to make some decision about
where to draw the line,

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.114
in terms of how
far we go chasing

00:40:52.114 --> 00:40:54.780
all of these other products that
it might have been turned into.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:07.100
So, again, the goal--
this comes directly

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.110
from what they
wrote in the report.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:12.410
Compare the environmental
impact of hand drying systems.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:16.190
Evaluate how the impact under
different manufacturing and use

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.700
scenarios.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.270
So this is part of it, is that
they, rather than consider it

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.490
within the context
of just one scenario,

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.920
they want to try a couple
of those scenarios.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.420
This related back
to the assumptions

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.450
that they had to make.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.430
Two, identify impact
drivers and ways

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.580
to target those with the idea
to inform product decisions.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:37.860
We mentioned this
comparative assertion,

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.210
so this is sort of
the important one,

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:40.834
because that lets us
know this is going

00:41:40.834 --> 00:41:42.170
to go to an external audience.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.540
This brings its own
set of requirements.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.510
So if you're going
to use something

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:48.440
for comparative assertions,
the ISO standards

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.170
generally require you to have
a third party evaluation of it.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.830
So if you look through
in one of the appendices,

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:58.760
they mentioned the results
of their third party,

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.450
essentially, review of it.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:03.720
And so they had a
panel of three experts

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.110
go through and review the
initial draft of the life cycle

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.770
assessment study, and
then they had to go back,

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.350
and usually you
get critical-- it's

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.780
like submitting
something for peer

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.950
review at an academic
journal or something similar,

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:15.360
where you would
get back comments

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.620
about what you
might want to change

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.870
and what you might want to do.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:21.030
So once you start making some
of these selections upfront

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:23.070
about the goal of
your study, that's

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:24.650
going to drive
extra requirements

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.120
and make some
complications for what

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.040
you need to do down the road.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.330
Finally, they mentioned
internal and external audiences.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.520
With the goal, the big
thing to keep track of

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.400
is, there's really two types of
life cycle assessment studies

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.930
and they go by different names.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:45.610
Attributional, first
consequential is one of them.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.680
One I've heard is
accounting based,

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.180
that would be the attributional.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.770
And this would be
change oriented.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:55.170
Really, these are little
diagrams that somebody created

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.900
that are useful to think of it.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.150
The attributional one,
which is what they've

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:03.200
done in this paper, is
essentially taking a system

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.910
and trying to figure out
what portion of that system's

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:09.510
environmental impact is related
to whatever you're looking at.

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.760
So it's taking a static
snapshot of something

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.070
and trying to attribute the
various environmental impact

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.010
to your product.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.900
The consequential,
the change oriented,

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.427
is going to take
a system and it's

00:43:20.427 --> 00:43:22.760
going to try to model what
happens when you make changes

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.390
to it.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.770
So the big thing of that
is that it's not static.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:27.130
The picture's going to change.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:29.510
You might reduce impact
in certain areas,

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:31.450
but it might increase
it in other areas.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:36.220
And so this attributional
style is generally

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.840
things that are
backwards looking,

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.442
whether it be estimating the
environmental impact of one

00:43:41.442 --> 00:43:42.150
of your products.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:45.290
If you wanted to, say,
do a carbon label,

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.600
or to meet some certain
standard to get an eco label.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.130
To estimate the environmental
impacts of different systems

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.320
as they are now,
is the big thing.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.070
The consequential is
going to look at what

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:57.440
happens when we make a change.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.410
So usually what this means
is that could involve

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:03.310
very big changes in the system.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.340
That if you make
certain decisions,

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.560
they're going to impact.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.440
That things might
look this way now,

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.614
if I look at just the system
as it is, but say my demand is

00:44:11.614 --> 00:44:13.280
starting to increase
and I start to have

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.907
to start making different
changes, that could

00:44:15.907 --> 00:44:16.990
shift the way it would be.

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.340
So one good example of
this would be looking

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.080
at, say, the impact of ethanol.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.740
If you look at US
policy on ethanol.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.770
If you just look at
a static snapshot

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:31.670
of where we're at right now,
or the way it exists right now.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:35.180
You'd look at the life cycle
for, say, corn ethanol,

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.940
and you measure its
environmental impact.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.770
And then you compare
that to, say,

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:41.156
what it takes to produce
gasoline or diesel fuel,

00:44:41.156 --> 00:44:43.030
and you come up with an
environmental impact.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.960
And so that generally
would tell you

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.650
the ethanol is slightly better
on, say, a greenhouse gas

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.560
perspective.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.570
But when you start
looking at what

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.300
happens when you start
making big shifts,

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.480
as we start converting
crop land from other uses

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.680
in order to turn it into
corn, in order to turn that

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.180
into ethanol, you start
getting a cascade of change

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.560
as they go on.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.160
So in the case of the US, we've
switched a lot of farmland

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.080
over to corn, and
so that has left

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.600
a gap in wheat and soybeans
and other crops that used

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.380
to grow on land that were corn.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.970
So now we don't have as much
to export to other countries.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.370
So those countries have to
convert some of their land

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:23.180
to uses to grow, to make
up for our wheat shortage.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.430
And so then they may end
up clearing rain forest

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.190
or some other sort
of bad impact,

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.500
in order to turn that into
land to grow these crops on.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.710
So once you start looking at
this cascade of system effects,

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.540
people think that ethanol
is no longer preferable.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.089
That once you include the
indirect effects, it's better.

00:45:42.089 --> 00:45:43.630
So in that case,
that's what happened

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:44.921
when you start looking forward.

00:45:44.921 --> 00:45:47.752
Looking at what happens when I
start to make a change to this.

00:45:47.752 --> 00:45:49.460
And so if you look at
the characteristics

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.265
of these different
types of systems,

00:45:51.265 --> 00:45:52.640
they're going to
have differences

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.380
in what you're going to do.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.440
Part of that is the
choice of data, right.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.690
These we tend to
based on average data,

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.940
because we look at the average
electricity grid in the US.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.430
You're usually not making,
and we're not looking at,

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.010
something that creates
enough change in the system

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:08.410
to really worry about
whether it's impacting things

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:09.330
at the margins.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.520
But once you start looking
at energy policy or some

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.120
of these big areas, if
you start looking at,

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:18.410
what if we were to shift a
significant portion of steel

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:20.730
production to aluminum
production, which might be much

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:23.050
more electricity intensive.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:25.260
Then we start needing
more power plants.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.370
Maybe those new power
plants come online,

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:30.490
are gas powered as
opposed to coal fired,

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:33.450
and so the actual electricity
and the actual emissions impact

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.940
is less than if you looked
at the average of the grid.

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.829
So these are the ideas
between what type of study

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:39.620
are you looking at.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.328
It's going to drive
some of these choices

00:46:41.328 --> 00:46:44.984
and where you get the data,
what the system boundary is.

00:46:44.984 --> 00:46:47.150
One of the nice things about
doing a change oriented

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.350
LCA is that if I have
things that didn't change--

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.930
I'm comparing two systems,
a before and after,

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.320
and I have pieces of it
that didn't change at all,

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.480
I can ignore those pieces.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.980
Because they're not
going to affect.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.896
I'm just looking at the
changes that happened,

00:46:58.896 --> 00:47:02.440
so I can sort of exclude all of
those from the system boundary.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.310
Whereas with this
type of assessment,

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:07.070
where I have to trace everything
all the way up and back,

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.490
I have to make sure that it's
fully complete to make sure

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:12.900
that I'm really getting
that share of the emissions.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.900
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the power grids.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.550
Is there, to your
knowledge, any effort

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.390
to track specifically
which type of power

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:21.830
is being used at the
point in question?

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:23.830
For example, if something's
made in Pennsylvania

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:26.080
it's probably coal, but
if it's made in Idaho,

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.442
it's almost
exclusively hydraulic.

00:47:28.442 --> 00:47:29.650
Anyone ever account for that?

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:30.316
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:30.316 --> 00:47:32.660
So you can definitely
get at that level.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.050
Even in things like the
greenhouse gas protocol

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.982
when we were talking about
corporate level ones.

00:47:37.982 --> 00:47:39.690
If you go and look at
the tools that they

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.850
have for measuring the
impact of electricity,

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:44.110
you can get regional
specific factors.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:47.490
One thing to remember with
electricity, it's on the grid.

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:50.770
So even though you may
locally be supplied

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.950
by a nuclear or
coal plant, you're

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:54.490
part of, usually,
a regional grid.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:56.740
So they tend to break it out
into inter-regional ones.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.330
But you can get further
down emissions factors

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.060
and start looking.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.340
We did a study with
Chiquita looking at bananas.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.480
And so for that, we
went-- part of that

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.120
is that they're grown in
Central and South America.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.230
So you can go out and look
at the different electricity

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:13.900
factors at a
country level there,

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.720
and they can make quite
a bit of difference.

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.030
There are, definitely.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:21.510
One, a lot of people of
people already do that.

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:24.820
Two is that you tend to
be able to model that

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.660
by looking at the
percentage mix of coal

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.160
versus nuclear
versus gas that might

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.200
be used in any specific area.

00:48:36.949 --> 00:48:38.365
It's a really
tricky question when

00:48:38.365 --> 00:48:39.810
you start thinking
about what happens

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:41.685
as I start to change
things, because then you

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:45.240
get into where's
the power going to,

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.465
which plants come online
as demand starts to surge,

00:48:48.465 --> 00:48:49.340
and things like that.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.850
But that's definitely an
area that people look at.

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:56.700
Usually the big question is
whether-- if you looked at,

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.100
what if I did some
small change where,

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.560
say, I moved my corporate
offices from one location

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.940
to another.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.767
You probably wouldn't want
to use the marginal data

00:49:05.767 --> 00:49:08.100
on electricity if you move
from one region to the other,

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.683
because you're not
really large enough

00:49:09.683 --> 00:49:11.824
to have an effect on what's
going on with the grid

00:49:11.824 --> 00:49:12.740
at that sort of level.

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.610
So maybe it's better off to
stick with averages and things

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:16.720
like that.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.050
So there's some grey area
in there in determining when

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.000
it's right to use which factor.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.580
We've covered this,
the functional unit

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.650
is a pair of dried hands.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:37.540
Once you've made that, it
makes sense because as we saw,

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.980
it's in the use where
the impact comes from.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.560
So the question becomes,
you don't really

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.680
want to compare an Airblade
versus an Xlerator.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.824
You want to compare what
happens over the use.

00:49:47.824 --> 00:49:49.490
And definitely, when
you start including

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:51.740
things that are not a one
to one correspondence--

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.930
comparing paper towels
versus an Airblade,

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:59.650
you want to put them on a unit
of analysis that makes sense.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:01.300
But once you start
doing that, you

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.740
start getting other-- right.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:07.040
So that's one of the things you
decide up front, and then that

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.240
creates a cascade of
decisions about what you're

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.230
going to have to do later on.

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:14.440
Amongst that, making
assumptions about the length.

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.810
How many hands get dried,
the lifespan of it.

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:21.520
All the ancillary and secondary
products to go along with it.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.650
So it's the kind of thing
you want to decide upfront,

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:29.185
because it creates consequences
for what you do down the line.

00:50:29.185 --> 00:50:31.310
And that's why it's usually
one of the first things

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:34.260
that you'll do in the study.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.460
Scope, we had seven
different systems.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.590
Cradle to grave.

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.680
They mention this
within there, that they

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.040
are including packaging.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.530
So the cardboard that they
come in, or the plastic

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:48.320
wrap when it's there, and the
bins and liners and dispensers.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.780
So you want to be
clear when you're

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.120
setting the scope about
what things you're including

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:53.866
and what not.

00:50:53.866 --> 00:50:55.490
So they include the
packaging, but they

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:58.070
don't include the pallets
that they get shipped on,

00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:59.150
things like that.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.967
Capital goods, et cetera.

00:51:01.967 --> 00:51:03.175
And with the system boundary.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.920
We covered some of the
allocation, what it means.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:11.660
So you had the end of
life we talked about.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.660
Co-products, if you have
a manufacturing plant

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.285
or some other facility
that's producing

00:51:15.285 --> 00:51:17.890
a number of different
goods, you usually

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:20.390
are going to run into that
same allocation problem

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:22.720
where you're going
to have to figure out

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.840
some way of apportioning the
impacts of the production

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.190
process to the different
products that come out.

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:32.490
And again, there's
various rules for that.

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:42.440
Usually they're going to
be simple things like mass,

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.480
energy, or economic impact.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.160
One example in the
textbook I have

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.490
is a chicken processing plant.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:00.990
You're taking in
chickens and you're

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:03.990
producing breasts,
thighs, wings,

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:05.590
all of these different products.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.940
You can divide up
the impact of what

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.370
it takes to produce a
chicken, to raise it,

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:13.072
to give it feed, all of that.

00:52:13.072 --> 00:52:15.280
But at the end, you have
all of these different types

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.636
of products that all come
from that same input,

00:52:17.636 --> 00:52:19.010
and then figure
out how to divide

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.450
those impacts amongst the
different products that

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:22.340
are coming out.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.700
So mass or energy would
be one way to do it.

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.440
I just weigh the
different products

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.880
and I'll assign them
each share of that burden

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.700
based on their weight.

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.180
But again, this may work
well for some things,

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:34.972
but not for others.

00:52:34.972 --> 00:52:37.388
Especially when you have some
products that are coming out

00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:38.460
that are very high value.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:42.000
Since those tend to drive
the decisions that you make.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.640
So maybe you want to do it on
the economic basis instead,

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:48.880
which is to say, I'm going
to portion my impacts based

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.020
on the share of the value that
each of these items generate.

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:54.190
And these tend to come
back down to accounting.

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:58.310
So in the same way that our
corporate carbon footprint

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:01.160
last week followed our
financial accounting rules.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.620
This is much more in the vein
of managerial accounting,

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.300
where I'm trying to make certain
decisions that reflect what's

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.820
actually going on as opposed
to just necessarily following

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.950
some rules.

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.780
Cut off rules we covered.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.570
One thing with the
end of life-- so this

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:19.600
was back in the appendix
of the document.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.120
But this is essentially
illustrating

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.990
the four different cut
off rules that they

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:28.560
could apply for the waste
management of the paper towels.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.750
So the base scenario used,
essentially, this cut off rule.

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:35.790
So what they're saying is that
you have the first product that

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:41.390
takes the virgin material in,
you produce it, you use it,

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:43.370
then it goes back to re-pulping.

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:46.630
So it's essentially recycled and
turned into a second product.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:48.560
Again, has its own life cycle.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.520
You might repulp
it a third time,

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.200
and again, it has
its own life cycle.

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.050
And then maybe it's reached
the end of its useful life

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:57.260
and it's going to go
to waste management.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.600
So all of these are essentially
the same supply chain,

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.610
but we can divide up the
impacts between the three

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:06.830
different product
life cycles based

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:10.450
on how we divide up who
gets credit for which

00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:11.550
of these burdens.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.730
I think they used
the cut off rule

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:18.990
in this one, which is the first
product took credit or took

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.770
the impact for all
of the production

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:24.080
of the virgin material
and all of the use.

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.090
But then once it moved off
into the recycling system,

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:30.290
all of that impact was
associated with the products

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:31.660
that went on down the line.

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:34.970
The second product took
care of all that repulping,

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:36.580
the burden that went on there.

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.790
And the third product
took that second set

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:42.070
of repulping and the final
waste management disposal.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:45.670
So if you think of this as
comes from the original forestry

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:47.560
and paper production,
and this is

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.690
the final when it gets
thrown away in the landfill.

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:54.720
It's deciding who got
those various impacts.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.900
And you can see that
they've drawn, depending

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.030
on where you want
to draw the impact,

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:01.850
there's a lot of different
rules you can apply.

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:04.874
And it's mainly a
judgment call on which one

00:55:04.874 --> 00:55:05.790
you think makes sense.

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.580
Since it's not
entirely clear that one

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:10.140
is better than the other, these
decisions are, in essence,

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.348
always going to be arbitrary.

00:55:13.736 --> 00:55:16.630
OK.

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.270
So that was the first
step, the goal and scope.

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:23.500
The second step is the
inventory analysis.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.730
So this is when you have to go
out and identify and quantify

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:30.970
all of those impacts from
the production system.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:36.790
So in this case, it's a pretty
straightforward process,

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:38.580
but not easy.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.180
So simple, but not easy.

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:43.740
So the first is you build
a model of the system.

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.820
This is sort of their
stylized version of what

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.190
the model of the system is.

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:52.050
If you look at a more
detailed life cycle assessment

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:55.480
study that's really getting down
into the production process,

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:58.980
you might see a list of, say,
hundreds of different processes

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.010
drawn out in a flow diagram.

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:03.000
A lot of the reason
for this is that it's

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.980
coming from people from
a science background that

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:06.770
have done this.

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.630
So it tends to follow
a mass or energy flow,

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.250
where every time
something comes in,

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:15.060
you have to trace it and figure
out where it exits the system

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.900
or where it's going
into, with the idea

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:19.233
being that nothing should be
getting lost along the way.

00:56:19.233 --> 00:56:22.320
If I have 100 kilograms of
material coming in as input

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.320
and 86 kilograms of it go
into the production system,

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.960
then that other 14
kilograms better

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.410
get traced where it's going.

00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:30.840
Whether it's getting turned
off into waste or burned

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.610
or whatever happens to it.

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:34.550
So that's generally
the first part.

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:37.240
And this building a
model of the system

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.620
is something that
goes on by looking

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:42.440
at who are my suppliers,
what are my inputs,

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.340
where do I get different
things from, where's

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:49.360
energy coming into the system,
electricity, all of that.

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.070
Where are things
being transported

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:55.960
between, where are my different
facilities located, interviews,

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.100
studying the bill of materials,
looking at your procurement,

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:00.680
analyzing where
your customers are.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:03.940
This tends to be going
through the records of trying

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.780
to figure out and map
out the supply chain.

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:10.680
So from that standpoint, it's
pretty simple understanding

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.580
what's going on, not
necessarily always

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:14.650
easy to do since this
tends to be very data-

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:18.120
and labor-intensive to go
through and figure this out.

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.830
The even worse part
is that once you've

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:22.870
identified all these processes,
is identifying the inputs

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:23.460
and outputs.

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.560
So in the inputs we have
raw materials, energy,

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.440
and other products that are
coming in, and on the output,

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.220
it's our emissions, to air,
to water, and to waste.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.720
So everything that comes into
the system and everything that

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.220
goes out.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:40.540
I'm essentially
drawing a boundary

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:43.030
around my system
which, inside it, may

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.280
have a number of different
processes going on.

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:54.650
What I'm looking for is, once
I've mapped out that process,

00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:57.130
I need to go through
and identify where

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:58.510
are all my inputs and outputs.

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:00.390
If this is my system
boundary, these

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:04.030
should all be raw materials
coming in, energy coming in,

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:07.000
and all of the
emissions going out.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.010
And so one way to do that is
to go through step by step.

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:13.470
This is a production
facility, start tracking.

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:16.710
What energy are they
using, how many units did

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:18.080
they produce, things like that.

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.120
So this tends to be the
time consuming part of it,

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.600
but pretty straightforward in
terms of what you need to do.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:30.000
So in terms of the
study that we looked at,

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.990
how did they go
about doing this?

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.710
They talk a little bit about it.

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.270
It's kind of vague
in some areas,

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:38.120
but they talk about the
main process that they use.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:47.184
What do they start with
for the Dyson system.

00:58:47.184 --> 00:58:48.350
AUDIENCE: Bill of materials?

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the bill of materials.

00:58:52.712 --> 00:58:54.545
Are you familiar with
the bill of materials?

00:59:01.274 --> 00:59:04.780
Or the B-O-M, the BOM.

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.170
This is basically just a
listing of all the parts

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:10.330
that are going into it.

00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:13.490
If you were to look
at a higher level,

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:19.601
you might look at it as the
fan, the motor, the housing,

00:59:19.601 --> 00:59:20.100
et cetera.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.120
These are the different
parts that go into it.

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.060
And these in themselves
may have a number

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.070
of other different
materials that go into them.

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:31.150
So if you look at it, it's
sort of a diagram that

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:35.340
sort of spreads out, where
you have one piece here,

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.420
and it might have
a couple of inputs.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.560
And those might, in turn,
have their own inputs.

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.310
And essentially, it's
going to expand out.

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:43.476
I'm going to have a big
list of all of the materials

00:59:43.476 --> 00:59:44.060
that I have.

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.890
So in this case, they went
through and took the data

00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:48.880
that Dyson gave
them and said, we

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.140
have the bill of
materials for all of this.

00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:57.840
And the trick was to turn that
into the life cycle inventory.

00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.410
And so what they did is they
took the bill of materials

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:01.940
data-- and they call it
the bill of activities

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:04.148
because they also have data
about the activities that

01:00:04.148 --> 01:00:06.590
are going on, the energy
use that's going on

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:09.690
in the production phase--
and they matched it up

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:11.680
with inventory data.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.300
In this case, you
can think of the work

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.060
that would go on to actually
go and do one of these.

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:20.070
Especially because
you think of-- they

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:25.500
mention in there something
like the optic housing that

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.430
was on one of them that
detects when the hand goes in

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:30.420
and when it comes out.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.880
You think, that has a lens,
it has a microprocessor,

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.590
it has whatever
else goes into it.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.410
And all of those products
have their own complex supply

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:38.910
chains.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:41.694
So the minute that we
mention one of these,

01:00:41.694 --> 01:00:43.610
if we're taking this
cradle to grave approach,

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.010
then we need to
start tracking each

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:47.385
of those products up all the
way through their suppliers.

01:00:47.385 --> 01:00:49.430
And so they're
buying that assembly

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:52.960
from some supplier
who in turn is buying

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.710
a processor from this
company, and they're

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:56.560
buying a lens from this
company, and they're

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.130
buying a plastic housing
from this company.

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:01.650
And that company does some
kind of injection molding,

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:03.404
and they buy raw
plastic from here.

01:01:03.404 --> 01:01:05.070
So you can imagine
they're going to have

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:08.550
to start tracing all of that
up, what a labor that would be

01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:10.920
to try to do that for
a complex product,

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.840
or even a relatively
simple product.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.120
So what they've done is
they've gone out and found

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.020
this inventory data,
which generally

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.650
comes from third party sources.

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:22.910
So if you look at how you would
do one of these life cycle

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:27.270
inventories, usually there's a
couple of big software vendors

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.800
that make tools that
help you do this.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.140
SimaPro, GaBi, are
some of the big ones.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:37.080
They, in turn, license
databases from other companies.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.380
ecoinvent was the one that
was used in this study,

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.860
and they mention that in here.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.450
So ecoinvent is a company
that goes out and actually

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:45.750
tries to do that work.

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:48.260
They try to go out and
look for common products

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.420
and go out and examine what
types of inputs do they have,

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.030
what goes on at the factory,
how much energy does

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:56.690
it take to make it,
what are all the inputs

01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:58.710
and outputs to the
environment, and they sort of

01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:59.740
start building up these.

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:02.130
So then they have a database
that tells you things

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:05.219
like this type of steel has
this sort of impact, here

01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:07.010
are its inputs and
outputs, different types

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:08.410
of plastic, et cetera.

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:10.260
And you go through and
you match those up.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:14.350
So now it says, I don't
necessarily need to go through

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:16.980
and do all of this tracing
of everything for me.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.920
The software, the
database that I'm using,

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.220
is going to have some
of that in there.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.585
It's enough for me to say that
this particular pieces is,

01:02:24.585 --> 01:02:29.560
say, 2.3 pounds of
this type of material.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.000
I'm going to go out and match
that up with the database

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.950
to do all of that
upstream tracking

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:36.754
and tracing of what's going on.

01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:38.170
They talk about
this in the study,

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:41.420
though, because this is going
to run into some problems.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.618
What are some of the issues
that they had with this?

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.139
So there's a lot of different
products that go into it.

01:02:53.139 --> 01:02:55.180
What do you do when you
run into a product that's

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:58.328
not in the database.

01:02:58.328 --> 01:03:01.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
they didn't

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:05.275
have specific data on
the different material

01:03:05.275 --> 01:03:10.140
covers for the hand dryers,
so they just averaged them.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:10.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:14.037 --> 01:03:16.120
In that case, that was a
slightly different issue,

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.080
but related.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.810
Because that one,
they were relying

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:25.990
on-- they were taking the
information from a third party

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:28.810
that had done the study already,
and had just already averaged

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:32.520
the impact of the
housing together.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.350
Rather than not
being able to find--

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:36.830
I suppose it probably
fits in there.

01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:39.510
Nobody had done
this study and said,

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:43.230
here is the impact for
a Xlerator housing made

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:45.630
of plastic or made of aluminum.

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:48.290
So it is probably the same.

01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:53.670
Some of the stuff, like there
was no galvanized steel.

01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:55.590
They said there
was none of this.

01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:59.740
There was no-- I
forget which type.

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:03.120
There was some type of bleached
paper that they didn't have.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.320
And this was related to the
recycled paper towels and some

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.180
of these issues.

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.960
So essentially, they had a list
of maybe 20 different materials

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.620
or so that were listed in
these bill of materials

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.140
or that were included
in the system

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.677
that they didn't have data for.

01:04:18.677 --> 01:04:20.510
So they had to go through
and sort of create

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:22.330
their own version
of some of these.

01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:25.930
So they said well, one thing
you can do is use proxy data.

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:28.500
So they said, we don't
have this specific type

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.400
of bleached paper, so we'll
just use as a substitute

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.320
this type of bleached paper.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.060
Or they said, we don't
have galvanized steel,

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:39.345
but we have regular,
this type of steel,

01:04:39.345 --> 01:04:41.470
and then we're going to
add to that the impact that

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:46.330
would go with this process of
applying the coating to it.

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:48.060
Even with this
inventory data, you're

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.380
going to run into trouble
finding all the products

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.230
that you need to do to do this.

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:55.927
And so it's generally
not something--

01:04:55.927 --> 01:04:58.260
you're going to have to make
some compromises as you go,

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.572
in terms of figuring
out what you can include

01:05:00.572 --> 01:05:02.530
and how to get around
some of these limitations

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:05.690
that you might have.

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:11.410
Now, once they did
that, they went through.

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:14.830
They had this chart in
here which was showing,

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:16.104
essentially, what they had.

01:05:16.104 --> 01:05:18.770
This is the assumption that they
used to generate the inventory,

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:20.950
because part of it
was that they had

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:23.690
to go through the
manufacturing and identify

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:26.052
how much energy per unit.

01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:27.760
And then they had to
go through, and then

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.420
based on this, the life cycle,
how many times would it draw.

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.830
They had to go through and
capture how much material

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:37.816
was going into each of these.

01:05:37.816 --> 01:05:39.440
One of the assumptions
they had to make

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.160
was data about the
scrappage rates.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.970
Because part of this
is that the goal is

01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:45.910
to understand all
of those inputs

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:49.110
that come into the
system and the emissions,

01:05:49.110 --> 01:05:50.770
and then what is
my useful output.

01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:54.200
So if I take in 100
kilograms of plastic,

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.360
but only 85 kilograms of plastic
end up in the final unit,

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.110
because the other
15 goes to waste,

01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:01.540
you have to make sure to
allocate the emissions related

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.460
to that 15 kilograms of waste
to those final products.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.115
So it's not enough just to look
at the end bill of materials.

01:06:07.115 --> 01:06:08.490
They had to make
some assumptions

01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:10.980
about what goes on the
manufacturing process

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.314
and how that relates to it.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.480
And so at the end, once
they've gone through this,

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.880
they have enough to move
on to the next stage.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.210
I'm going to skip this
piece here and talk

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:26.230
about our next stage, which
is the impact analysis.

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:28.890
So this is where they go through
and finally, now that they

01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:31.090
have, for each of those
different products systems,

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:32.290
they've made all of
these assumptions,

01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:33.876
they've put together the impact.

01:06:33.876 --> 01:06:35.500
They're ready to go
ahead and determine

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:40.180
what the environmental impact
of each of those products was.

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.240
So there's essentially
two steps that

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.420
go on in the impact assessment,
referred to as classification

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.900
and characterization.

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.590
So classification,
the first one,

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:53.630
essentially that inventory
analysis you have

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:56.622
is going to list things
like all of the outputs, all

01:06:56.622 --> 01:06:57.580
of my emissions to air.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.250
How much carbon dioxide, how
much carbon monoxide, all

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.940
of these different
types of gases.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.580
But if I'm interested in the
global warming potential,

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.450
I really only need to
know which of these

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:08.700
are the greenhouse gases.

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.560
So I'm going to go through
in the classification step,

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.400
and I'm going to look at all
of these different outputs

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.289
that I have to the
atmosphere, and I'm

01:07:14.289 --> 01:07:16.580
going to gather together the
ones that are contributing

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.870
to global warming.

01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:19.530
That would be the first step.

01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:21.182
That would be the
classification step.

01:07:21.182 --> 01:07:22.640
And you're going
to need to do that

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.710
for each of the different
environmental impact categories

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:25.543
that you might have.

01:07:25.543 --> 01:07:27.759
So they'll go
through and do that.

01:07:27.759 --> 01:07:29.550
And the second one is
the characterization.

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:34.750
So if we look at it in terms of
the global warming potential,

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.180
after I've classified and
gotten together my listing of,

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.550
OK, how much carbon dioxide,
how much methane, how much

01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:41.795
nitrous oxide,
characterization is

01:07:41.795 --> 01:07:43.670
when we apply those
global warming potentials

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:46.440
and actually turn that
into a unit of output.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.110
Carbon dioxide equivalence.

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:51.750
And this applies to a wide
range of different environmental

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:55.220
impacts that you might study.

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:57.470
What were some of
the impacts that they

01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:58.604
chose to study in this one?

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:06.141
They had a couple of basic
ones and then some more complex

01:08:06.141 --> 01:08:06.641
ones.

01:08:09.623 --> 01:08:13.599
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
CO2 emissions.

01:08:13.599 --> 01:08:16.290
And they didn't really
understand how to get water.

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:18.366
But they said they
included water,

01:08:18.366 --> 01:08:20.626
and then they said they
didn't, so I don't really

01:08:20.626 --> 01:08:23.050
understand what went on there.

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:25.779
PROFESSOR: So they mentioned
a couple things in there.

01:08:31.762 --> 01:08:33.460
They had the global
warming potential,

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.569
they have the carbon
footprint, essentially.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:40.220
They had water use.

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:42.620
AUDIENCE: Land occupation?

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.750
PROFESSOR: So we'll get
to that in a second.

01:08:47.939 --> 01:08:52.370
So they had, they called it CED.

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.420
Cumulative Energy-- yeah.

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.000
Then they had--
remember what the name

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.242
of the more complex one was?

01:09:01.242 --> 01:09:02.950
AUDIENCE:
[? Along the lines of ?] IMPACT

01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:04.902
2002+.

01:09:04.902 --> 01:09:08.399
PROFESSOR: They had something
called IMPACT 2002+,

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:09.970
I think it was called.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:11.977
So what they did, when
they went through this,

01:09:11.977 --> 01:09:13.810
they made a distinction
about some of these.

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:17.290
So the global warming
potential isn't environmental,

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:20.246
it's an impact category,
because it basically

01:09:20.246 --> 01:09:21.120
does these two steps.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.160
I gather my greenhouse
gases and then

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.550
I characterize the impact
using their global warming

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:26.800
potentials.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.979
The water use and
cumulative energy demand

01:09:28.979 --> 01:09:31.510
aren't really impact categories.

01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:33.319
They're treated as such
by a lot of people,

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:34.860
but they made the
point in the study,

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:37.229
they're not technically
impact areas.

01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:39.020
And the reason for
that is that there's

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.140
no actual characterization
that goes on.

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.810
So for water use and
cumulative energy demand,

01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:46.600
they just went back
through the inventory

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.950
and said during all these
steps in the process,

01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:53.240
I'll just sum up how much
water was used at each stage.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.610
At the end, I get a total
amount of water use.

01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:58.390
But there's no attempt to
turn that into something

01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:59.830
more complicated.

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:02.350
There's no attempt to rate.

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:07.540
You can think of if I'm using
good, clean drinking water

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.809
or if I'm using salt
water from the ocean.

01:10:09.809 --> 01:10:11.350
You might think that
those would have

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:14.170
different environmental impacts,
because most people don't care

01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:17.774
if I'm using up the
salt water as opposed

01:10:17.774 --> 01:10:18.940
to using up the clean water.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.920
So you could think they're not
actually really investigating

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.350
the impact of those, they're
just calculating them

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:26.960
so you can see how much water
and how much energy they use.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.320
And specifically for the
cumulative energy demand,

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.740
they mention that it's a proxy
for a lot of other things.

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.950
The more energy intensive
the production process

01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:37.570
is, that's tied to a lot of
other environmental impact

01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:38.070
categories.

01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:41.581
So they're sort of used as a
proxy, but not really an impact

01:10:41.581 --> 01:10:42.080
category.

01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:47.230
So we had the single
use indicators.

01:10:49.857 --> 01:10:52.190
Cumulative energy demand on
the side, and global warming

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:52.898
potential, right.

01:10:52.898 --> 01:10:55.650
And we can go through, and
they've calculated the carbon

01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:58.650
footprint for each of these
different products based

01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:00.630
on that inventory
analysis and broken it up

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:02.389
into the different
stages of life.

01:11:02.389 --> 01:11:04.680
And you can do the same thing
for the cumulative energy

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.138
demand where, in
this case, they're

01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:09.710
measuring it in how many
kilojoules of energy they use.

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:10.720
Those are pretty simple.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:16.880
But the more complicated ones
are this one like IMPACT 2002.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.050
In this case, that's
because it has

01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:21.760
number of different
factors going in,

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.120
and it's sort of divided up
into a two stage approach.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.890
Which is the first
thing you have,

01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:28.920
just like with global
warming potential,

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.730
they started with the
inventory results.

01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:33.170
Then they went
through and created

01:11:33.170 --> 01:11:35.300
what they called a number
of midpoint categories.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:38.260
So if you look at
what IMPACT 2002 is,

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.610
it's divided up into all of
these different things that

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:44.270
are counting everything from
carcinogens to ozone depletion

01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:48.580
to how much mineral
extraction you're doing,

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:49.880
aquatic acidification.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.940
So a number of different
environmental impacts.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.120
This is getting at a
lot more broader scope

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.240
than what we would get if
we just looked at energy

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.070
or global warming potential.

01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:00.870
It goes through sort
of the same process

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:03.299
that you had before
which is, now I'm

01:12:03.299 --> 01:12:04.840
going to look at my
inventory and I'm

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.400
going to classify all of my
emissions that are carcinogens,

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.691
and I'm going to group together
and figure out how much

01:12:09.691 --> 01:12:10.950
I have of each different type.

01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:12.658
They're going to go
through this for each

01:12:12.658 --> 01:12:15.960
of these different
midpoint categories.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.870
Then what they've done is that
they've combined these, then,

01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:20.320
into a second set.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.960
So they figured out how
many of the different types

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.814
of carcinogens,
how many of these.

01:12:24.814 --> 01:12:26.230
And then they
relating these again

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:28.980
to overall indicators
that capture a broad set.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.610
All of these are things
that impact human health.

01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:33.210
So they're grouping
these together

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:34.837
and one they're
calling human health,

01:12:34.837 --> 01:12:36.420
they're grouping all
of these together

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.500
into ecosystem quality,
climate change has its own,

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.850
and then they have resources.

01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:45.350
So that in itself is a
pretty complicated process,

01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:49.370
because if you read
about it or looked

01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:51.990
into some of these
charts, this is

01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:57.250
what happened is that
they-- and I'm not

01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:58.520
even sure how you do this.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.520
So the carcinogens
are being measured

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.722
in-- I don't know what that is.

01:13:02.722 --> 01:13:04.180
I need to brush up
on my chemistry.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:07.640
But it's some kind of grams
of some chemical equivalent.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.910
So they've taken all of
the different outputs

01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:12.220
that they have that
are carcinogens,

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.690
and they've found a way
to measure them in terms

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:17.445
of some equivalent units.

01:13:17.445 --> 01:13:19.820
I assume this is producing
the same amount of carcinogens

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:24.250
as 0.277 grams of
whatever that compound is.

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.250
That's how they've gone
through, and for each

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:28.427
of these categories,
they've created

01:13:28.427 --> 01:13:30.760
some measure that they're
going to use, some equivalent.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.870
So respiratory
inorganics, we can

01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:38.440
assume that these have the
same impact as it would

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.310
if you produced this many
grams of particulate matter.

01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:43.730
2.5 millimeter
particulate matter, right.

01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:45.340
Or whatever that is.

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:48.890
They've gone through and,
for each of these categories,

01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:50.550
they've come up with
a way to do this.

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:55.220
And so this is pretty complex
and probably nobody on earth

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.930
is enough of an
expert to be an expert

01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:58.209
on each of these categories.

01:13:58.209 --> 01:14:00.250
So what they've done is
they've gathered together

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:02.050
experts from all of
these different areas

01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:05.210
to figure out how you
would go through and judge

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:06.667
each of these.

01:14:06.667 --> 01:14:09.000
And they actually go a step
further from this, actually,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.380
two steps further from this.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.470
So you can see for
each of these products,

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:15.152
we're going to get all of
these different ratings.

01:14:15.152 --> 01:14:17.110
And the question is, how
do we put all of these

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:20.760
together in terms
of an indicator.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.330
Because I can look at what
the value is for an Airblade

01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:27.420
aluminum, and I compare that to
Cotton Roll towels, and I see,

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.250
well, Cotton Roll towels
have less carcinogens.

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:35.060
Does that make them better
than the Dyson Airblade.

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.670
And the question
is, that depends.

01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:39.086
Because if you start looking
at some of these other impact

01:14:39.086 --> 01:14:42.325
categories, you find ones where,
well, that actually contributes

01:14:42.325 --> 01:14:45.290
a higher value,
290 to 118 in terms

01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:47.470
of terrestrial ecotoxicity.

01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:49.800
So then you have to come
back through and figure out

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.730
a way to balance all of these
different impacts together.

01:14:52.730 --> 01:14:55.320
And that's what that
impact system does.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.420
It essentially
produces two things.

01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.430
So first, they group
all of those together.

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:04.020
They took all those human
health impacts together

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.510
and created a single indicator.

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:08.750
So they're bringing
together the carcinogens,

01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:14.090
the inorganic respiration,
all of these different types

01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:17.510
of impacts that they said
impacts human health,

01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:20.300
and they put them all on
a single unit of measure.

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:23.710
Which I believe is disability
adjusted life years.

01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:26.020
So if any of you are
following health care,

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.850
that's how you
measure when should we

01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:31.500
pay for this type of
health care or not.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.100
This is one of the
things that you do.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.300
You try to judge what the
consequences of it will be,

01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.310
and then you have to make
some trade offs about,

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:40.390
would it be better to
be blind in one eye

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:42.270
or walk with a limp and
all of these things.

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:44.510
So it's very
complicated and requires

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:49.100
a lot of value judgments to
get into some of these levels.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:52.627
The nice thing about these
categories like IMPACT 2002

01:15:52.627 --> 01:15:54.210
is that they have
what would hopefully

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:57.160
be a panel of experts going
through and doing this in sort

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.960
of a peer reviewed fashion.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.590
And they're coming
up, and so now this

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:03.114
is giving me a human
health comparison

01:16:03.114 --> 01:16:04.280
of these different products.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.640
So it's bringing together all of
those different seven or eight

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.330
different indicators that
impacted human health

01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:13.250
and put them together
on one scale.

01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:15.990
And they do the same thing
for ecosystem quality.

01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:18.060
And in fact, you can
take it a stage farther,

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.430
which is that you can put
these all together in terms

01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:22.060
of eco points.

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:25.490
So then that makes the balance
between how much human health

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:28.880
would you be willing to trade
off against how much ecosystem

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.600
quality.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.070
So the important thing
to remember about this

01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:36.080
is that as you start-- so that's
very nice when I have something

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.360
like IMPACT 2002 because,
theoretically, I can compare

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.930
these systems and
I can get a picture

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.500
of the overall
environmental quality.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.000
Not just looking
at one single issue

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.910
like global warming
potential, and not

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:49.200
having to look simultaneously
at 27 different indicators

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.840
and decide how I
want to trade it off.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.550
I've hopefully got
some experts out there

01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:55.490
that have done that already,
and I can sum everything up

01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:58.912
in terms of, say, one
unit of eco points.

01:16:58.912 --> 01:17:00.370
But the important
thing to remember

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:02.780
is that when you do that,
you're making value judgments.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.150
That's built into the
system that scores that.

01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:07.730
It's deciding how much
you're willing to trade off

01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:08.855
these different categories.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.610
So finally, the last step we
do is the interpretation phase.

01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:22.070
So this was actually
the long one,

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:24.220
when we looked at
the study overall,

01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:26.860
because they went
through and trying

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:30.332
to interpret all those earlier
results in terms of what

01:17:30.332 --> 01:17:31.415
the goal in the study was.

01:17:31.415 --> 01:17:35.380
And essentially to do that, they
had to go through and do all

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:37.142
sorts of uncertainty
analysis on that

01:17:37.142 --> 01:17:39.100
to make sure all of those
assumptions they made

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.144
along the way were still
valid when they tried

01:17:42.144 --> 01:17:43.310
to go back and interpret it.

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:46.250
If you wanted to come back and
make a claim that the Dyson

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.170
Airblade was better
than the others,

01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:50.740
you better make sure that all
of the limitations in the study

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:52.110
aren't going to impact that.

01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:55.050
So they essentially
did three types.

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:58.360
They did a sensitivity analysis,
they did uncertainty analysis--

01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.990
which was really
two different types,

01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:01.970
one was a scenario
uncertainty and the other

01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:04.800
was a bill of
activities analysis.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.855
So in terms of what they
did, the sensitivity analysis

01:18:07.855 --> 01:18:08.980
was pretty straightforward.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:11.690
They basically went through all
of those assumptions they made,

01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.140
and they had a lot of them.

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.200
There were probably 12 or 15
different major assumptions

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.180
that they made.

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.420
And they did a one
factor at a time change

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.010
to test the impact of that.

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:30.719
So they went through and
some of them, they tested.

01:18:30.719 --> 01:18:32.510
When it goes to waste,
there's a percentage

01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:33.880
of that that gets incinerated.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.940
So they tested how that changed,
and different countries that

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:40.275
have different waste systems
and different ways of taking

01:18:40.275 --> 01:18:42.156
care of the waste will
do that differently.

01:18:42.156 --> 01:18:43.780
So they went back
and tested the impact

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:46.300
of changing that percentage
on the scenarios.

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.744
If we look at the
scenarios, none of these

01:18:48.744 --> 01:18:51.160
really get changed because
they're not really sending much

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.730
to waste that's getting burned.

01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:54.230
And these change a little bit.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.780
But overall, looking at
these different scenarios,

01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:59.380
you get a very similar
picture than you did before.

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:01.970
So it's not particularly
sensitive to the assumption

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.780
that we have here.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.760
The other one has to do with
the intensity of the drying time

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.620
on the system.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:14.280
And so in this case, you start
to get a very different picture

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.060
between different
scenarios, where

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:19.100
you have some of these
that are getting definitely

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.090
higher impact and
changing as we go through.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:24.310
So the sensitivity analysis
was pretty straightforward.

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:27.599
Go through one at a time,
changing those factors

01:19:27.599 --> 01:19:29.640
between some different
values, seeing what impact

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.590
it has in the system.

01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:34.570
The two things we
said it identified

01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:38.350
were the electricity
and the drying time,

01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:40.960
which drying time
scenario you used.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.540
So it identifies those two as
sort of the major ones that

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:45.240
can affect the system.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.706
But one of things it
doesn't really capture

01:19:47.706 --> 01:19:49.330
is that it does all
this one at a time.

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:51.070
And especially those
two are related,

01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:54.290
so if I'm off on how
long I dry, then I'm

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:57.120
also off on my assumption
about the intensity

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.200
of the electricity.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.130
Those two factors
might compound together

01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.020
to make my results even worse.

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.080
So this only
captures what happens

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.830
when they did it one at a time.

01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:08.420
So they went through and did a
scenario uncertainty analysis.

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.900
And essentially, they had
20 different parameters,

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.450
and they had a range
for each of them.

01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:16.920
And they assumed the
distribution, uniform

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.696
or some other type,
and they went through

01:20:18.696 --> 01:20:20.320
and did a Monte Carlo
simulation, where

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:24.520
they did 20,000 different
simulation runs where they

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.180
randomly picked a value
from that distribution,

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:30.850
and calculated the impact on
each of the different product

01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:31.350
systems.

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:33.170
So this is global
warming potential,

01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:34.920
and you get some
sort of distribution

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.750
about what the impact of the
different products looked like.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:41.485
You can see how it
changes based on all

01:20:41.485 --> 01:20:45.410
the different assumptions of
what the possible range was.

01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:50.560
One of the important things
they did with this is you

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.910
get some overlap.

01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:54.030
But if we look at
that, the Airblade

01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:57.632
is definitely the lowest in
terms of where it's shifted.

01:20:57.632 --> 01:20:59.090
But there's definitely
some overlap

01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:00.690
between some of
these other systems,

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:02.065
and one of the
things they did is

01:21:02.065 --> 01:21:05.280
they went back and checked that
just because there's overlap

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.147
doesn't mean that Xlerator
was lower than this.

01:21:09.147 --> 01:21:10.605
It just means in
certain scenarios,

01:21:10.605 --> 01:21:13.840
the Xlerator was lower
than what the Airblade had

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.740
in certain scenarios.

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:17.670
So what they did is
they did a check.

01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:20.300
Because you can think that
some of the assumptions

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.700
might affect only one
product or the other.

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:26.540
But I may have underestimated
the drying time on the Xlerator

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:29.390
and overestimated the
drying time on my product,

01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:31.450
and that may cause the
products to shift in terms

01:21:31.450 --> 01:21:32.990
of which was preferred.

01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:36.260
Some of the others, like if the
average electricity makes up

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:38.037
the grid, I wouldn't
expect those

01:21:38.037 --> 01:21:40.120
to be different between
one product and the other.

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.140
They're both using the
same electrical supply,

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:45.120
so my assumptions about
the impact of the grid

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.610
should be the same between them.

01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:48.210
So they made sure
they did that check

01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:51.110
by each time they ran one of
these scenarios, they compared.

01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:55.029
Did the Airblade have a
better performance than, say,

01:21:55.029 --> 01:21:56.320
the Xlerator, and went through.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.380
And even though you get
this overlapping like this,

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.920
they still found something
like 98% of the scenarios,

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.820
the Airblade was better.

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.667
Finally, the last thing
they did was looking

01:22:07.667 --> 01:22:08.750
at the bill of activities.

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:12.666
So for every emissions
factor, essentially,

01:22:12.666 --> 01:22:14.540
and for every input to
each of those systems,

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:16.710
they assigned an
uncertainty level to it,

01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:19.391
and assumed a distribution,
and did another simulation

01:22:19.391 --> 01:22:21.640
so they'd get a range of
different products like this.

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.290
So these are just three
different types of analysis

01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:26.210
they went through
to try to figure out

01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:28.200
how much those assumptions
and that uncertainty

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.150
impacted what the results were.

01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:33.280
So the big thing, though,
is that even after they

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.290
went through with that,
the Dyson Airblade still

01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:39.840
showed the lowest
impact in general.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.720
Under certain scenarios, it may
be that the Xlerator performs

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.540
better, but under
most scenarios,

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:47.110
they were pretty confident that
the Dyson showed up better.

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.390
They broke it out by
different types of scenarios

01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:55.290
and said when one was going
to be better than the other.

01:22:55.290 --> 01:22:58.050
So in the conclusion
they identified

01:22:58.050 --> 01:23:00.790
what are the most
sensitive parameters, what

01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:04.360
was the key driver, the
environmental impact, and what

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.950
was the general overall
environmental performance

01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:08.850
comparing the two,
taking into account

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.820
all of that sensitivity.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.370
OK.

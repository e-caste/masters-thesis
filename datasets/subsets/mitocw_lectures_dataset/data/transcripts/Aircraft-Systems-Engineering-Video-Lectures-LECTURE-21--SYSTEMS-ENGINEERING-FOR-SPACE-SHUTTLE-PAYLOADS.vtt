WEBVTT

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.690
Today we have an old colleague and friend
of mine.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.690
Tony Lavoie actually got his engineering degree
in the Aero-Astro Department here at MIT,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.500
so this is coming back home for him.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.390
And he actually grew up in Massachusetts.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.390
But, for the last 23 years, he has been in
Huntsville, Alabama at the Marshall Space

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.680
Flight Center and actually has been an engineer
on quite a few of the projects that I have

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.829
flown with, including the Astro Observatory
and the Tethered Satellite.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.829
And Tony has continued to rise up in the ranks
of the NASA engineering community.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.510
He is now, I guess, the Project Manager for
the Robotic Lunar Exploration Program.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:16.149
If you have been following the space news,
Marshall Space Flight Center is going to be

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.270
developing the first robotic lunar lander
that we have ever sent to the Moon since Surveyor.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.459
It will be like 40 years, I guess, we haven't
done that.

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:27.910
And we are going to have to figure out how
to do it.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.910
Tony was also the Chief Engineer on the Chandra
X-Ray Observatory which was launched on the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.780
Shuttle.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.630
And so, I thought it would be interesting
to hear, since we've been looking at many

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.630
other aspects of Space Shuttle operations,
to hear something about what it was like getting

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.520
a payload ready to fly on the Shuttle.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.520
But also we were discussing, before class
began, that he may have some comments on the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.450
Robotic Lunar Exploration Program, which is
now in the pre-phase A studies.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.729
And it will sort of be interesting.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.200
We talked a lot about what it was like in
the pre-phase A and the early days of coming

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.530
up with the requirements for the Shuttle.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.530
And clearly, in the systems engineering, getting
the requirements right is one of the key goals

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.500
for success.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.320
Tony may have some comments on that.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.700
I have talked enough.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.280
Tony, you've got it.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.620
Hi there.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.250
We are going to start talking about Chandra.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.400
And, as Jeff pointed out, I am also going
to talk about my new challenge, my new assignment

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.670
as Project Manager and in pre-phase A what
that means.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.040
And I think it is a lot different, being a
student, where you have a single closed form

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.079
solution and you go and you work a problem
and it is done.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.960
In the real world you seldom, if ever, work
a problem one time and have it finish.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.790
And we will get into that as we go along.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.370
I am going to talk about Chandra X-Ray Observatory.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.930
And these are just a few images that Chandra
has produced.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.930
It is an outstanding x-ray imager, and it
has been flying since July of '99.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.440
And you are going to get all the gory details
and all the lessons learned that we had in

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.010
working that project.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.010
I will do an overview Chandra history and
then the challenges we faced and lessons learned

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.370
associated with that, and we will cover those
topics.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.870
In terms of how we operate, feel free to ask
questions as we go along.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.569
It is kind of lose and easy.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:05.569
Chandra, or back then it was AXAF, Advanced
X-Ray Astrophysics Facility.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.709
NASA, by the way, loves acronyms.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.709
I mean, if you are interested in working with
NASA or associated with NASA, they are just

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.839
acronym crazy.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:25.590
AXAF was one of the four great observatories.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.590
The four great observatories were meant to
cover as close to the entire spectrum as NASA

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.130
could.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.520
And so, the visible great observatory is Hubble.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.430
And Ultraviolet, that's true, little Ultraviolet.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.960
The X-Ray Observatory is AXAF, which was later
named Chandra.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.960
The Gamma Ray Observatory is the Compton Gamma
Ray Observatory.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.430
And the last one was Infrared.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.470
And that originally started off as SIRTF.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.490
And now it is Spitzer.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.250
And that was launched a few years ago.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.250
In each of the four great observatories, they
were higher class than most of the other science

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.310
missions, even the science telescopes.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.100
And NASA did invest quite a bit of money on
each of those.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.250
And so, you will see that the performance
from the four great observatories are, in

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.560
terms of quality, probably the best in the
world and the best NASA has ever done.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.560
For the x-ray region, Chandra or AXAF was
built.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.449
And its objective, you start with program
objectives and you work down with science

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:55.699
objectives.

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:02.660
The science objectives were really to understand
the nature of the universe and determine the

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.889
nature of celestial objects, in particular
those that are hot.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.560
And hot objects will produce x-rays.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.260
And, of course, Jeff knows all about that.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.240
If you have any questions related to that
you can ask Jeff.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:24.240
But, from an engineer perspective, what happens
is you are given a set of objects and maybe

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.120
a program objective, and now you have to craft
the mission and craft the project from those.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.120
And one of the problems that you face is that
sometimes they are not crisp and sometimes

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.620
they are flexible based on cost.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.540
And also sometimes they are not very specific.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.500
Like determine the nature of celestial objects
from stars to quasars.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.820
Now what?

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.520
But this is the kind of thing that typically
you start with.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.650
And you have to iterate with, in this case,
the science community.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.169
If you are building part of the Shuttle, you
have to iterate with, for instance, the users,

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:16.169
the astronauts, the payload developers that
would use the Shuttle, the operators, et cetera.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.490
But the process is the same.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.180
You start with the top level objectives and
you work your way down.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.259
Now, again, because of the nature of what
we are talking about, it is usually a very

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.479
iterative process that can last for several
months.

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:37.479
And even several years if there is a technical
challenge that causes you to stretch out.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:46.300
And I will mention when it started.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:53.300
In terms of AXAF, kind of the key parameters
are the percent in circled energy, i.e., how

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:58.340
sharp is the image?

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.590
Registration meaning where is the target in
the sky?

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:06.110
And you have got to remember that x-ray astronomy
is a relatively new branch of astronomy.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.110
Because of the atmosphere it absorbs x-rays.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:15.110
So we, humans, only discovered x-ray astronomy
in the last 40 years.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:22.580
We need to go outside the atmosphere to get
information on x-ray astronomy.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:28.860
One of the things that we did know is if there
are some x-ray sources there they may or may

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.139
not be the same sources that also emit invisible
light.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:39.459
And, if they are not, then you have a question
of you kind of know there is a source out

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:42.838
there, but you don't know where in the sky
it is.

00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:49.569
And so, one of the challenges that AXAF had
was even if I have no stars around this x-ray

00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:54.059
source, I have got to be able to pinpoint
where that x-ray source is.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:58.999
That was a particular challenge that we had,
trying to figure out how to do that.

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:01.949
And that is what registration means.

00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:07.879
And then effective area is related to how
many photons you can collect to make a good

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.199
image.

00:09:09.199 --> 00:09:13.929
And recognize that if you are looking at the
sun, the sun is very close so you can get

00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:17.920
a lot of photons, but if you are looking at
something that is ten billion light-years

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.889
away you are not collecting very many photons
so you have to wait a long time to get those

00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:28.339
photons, unless you have a big collecting
area.

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:33.439
Those are kind of the key performance requirements
that you have to address when you are building

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:37.490
an x-ray telescope.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:44.490
From those there are key derived requirements
that have to be derived basically to be able

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:52.209
to maximize the scientific performance requirements.

00:09:52.209 --> 00:09:59.209
And so, from these pieces of information,
you derive mirror size and design, you derive

00:09:59.429 --> 00:10:01.360
focal length.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.459
Pointing and control requirements, how accurately
do you need to point?

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:12.459
Thermal stability because that plays a role
in orbit, a very big role.

00:10:12.499 --> 00:10:17.660
Instrument sensitivity and the fiducial transfer
system, which I will talk about later, which

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:24.660
is the thing that allows you to do the registration,
even the absence of local visible stars around

00:10:25.119 --> 00:10:26.649
it.

00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:32.579
Once you have the bulk of the science performance
requirements and the derived requirements

00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:38.290
from these performance requirements then you
fill in kind of the rest of the pie, if you

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.499
will.

00:10:40.499 --> 00:10:47.499
And those can be safety requirements in the
case of a manned program.

00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:50.499
In fact, that is pretty significant.

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:55.429
And it is a pretty significant cost driver
for things that fly in space.

00:10:55.429 --> 00:11:01.920
Unfortunately, they also cost a lot to make
sure they are not a hazard to the crew that

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.569
flies.

00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:10.569
There are also design and construction standards,
which also turns out to be a big deal.

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:19.730
For instance, if you are building a satellite
and you have circuit cards, you are going

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:25.239
to have requirements on soldering, you are
going to have requirements on integrated circuits,

00:11:25.239 --> 00:11:30.139
you are going to have requirements on glazing,
you are going to have requirements on bonding.

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:35.360
You are going to have requirements on how
to do things across the whole gamut of the

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.610
spacecraft.
Not just the spacecraft but also the Shuttle
and anything that flies up there.

00:11:40.689 --> 00:11:47.689
For a given mission, there are probably on
the order of 100, 150 separate documents that

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:57.589
describe various things, design and construction
standards that you have to go through for

00:11:57.589 --> 00:12:02.519
a particular piece of building the vehicle.

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:08.089
And so, those things are always a challenge
for a project manager because the engineers

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:14.249
want to get the latest standard that applies,
and in excruciating detail as engineers love

00:12:14.249 --> 00:12:15.089
to do.

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:20.559
And yet, from the project manger's standpoint,
we are trying to maintain cost.

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:26.559
There is always a tradeoff between how good
is good enough?

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:31.839
From a program manager's perspective better
is the enemy of good.

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:38.839
Yet, from an engineer, good is always better,
or better is always better.

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:45.819
There is always a healthy tension between
the project manager and the engineers.

00:12:45.819 --> 00:12:51.499
And I would say that a successful project
knows how to tradeoff.

00:12:51.499 --> 00:12:57.369
The project manager and the engineers know
how to balance that tension to be able to

00:12:57.369 --> 00:13:00.290
get the best product.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:05.549
And we have done that before, and we have
also imbalanced it and had some spectacular

00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:08.579
failures.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:15.579
Once requirements are set then you can start
kind of designing and starting to put the

00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:22.589
drawings on developing the system, if you
will.

00:13:22.589 --> 00:13:29.589
But that is kind of the general flow of information
for a science payload or a science mission.

00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:35.730
You start with the top level requirements
for performance, the scientific performance

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.299
that you are looking for.

00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:45.299
From those you derive the direct performance
requirements, like what you see here, and

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:48.609
then everything else cascades below that.

00:13:48.609 --> 00:13:55.609
And, once you have the requirements set, then
you can start developing concepts.

00:13:56.339 --> 00:14:00.459
Now, this was a preliminary design of AXAF.

00:14:00.459 --> 00:14:07.459
I am not going to talk about it, but I am
just going to show the next slide as to what

00:14:08.109 --> 00:14:10.559
it looks like now.

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:17.559
And so, you can see that there is a major
difference between what it started out as

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:20.829
and what it ended up as.

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:21.670
And this is typical.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.559
It is not atypical.

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:25.730
And the reason is cost.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:32.259
A lot of times when you are first starting
out with requirements, you kind of don't know

00:14:32.259 --> 00:14:34.809
what the cost of the mission is going to be.

00:14:34.809 --> 00:14:39.329
And so, you come up with an idea that has
a lot of capability.

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:46.329
This was orbit serviceable, it was in low
earth orbit, and it had four focal plane instruments

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:49.279
that you could select.

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:53.230
And it would actually move, much like Hubble.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:15:00.230
And it was a 15 year mission with reservicing
with the shuttle astronauts.

00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:07.339
But, when you start putting that on paper
and you start crafting the requirements, one

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:12.999
of the things you do, in the early phase of
a program, is you also cost, or you try and

00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:18.579
cost what those requirements result in, in
terms of design.

00:15:18.579 --> 00:15:22.529
Even though you don't do the final design
or you don't start working on the design in

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:29.119
detail until after you've got the requirements
set, in practical terms you have to still

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:33.009
put together a concept design so that you
can cost it.

00:15:33.009 --> 00:15:35.649
And that is exactly what happened on AXAF.

00:15:35.649 --> 00:15:42.649
We put together a design in parallel with
working the requirements and we costed the

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:45.149
design.

00:15:45.149 --> 00:15:48.619
And it turned out that that was more money
than NASA could afford.

00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:55.619
And so, as is typical, the iteration process
begins with headquarters to change the parameters

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:58.899
of the mission.

00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:05.899
To, in a sense, compromise the scientific
objectives a little bit in terms of implementing

00:16:07.429 --> 00:16:09.509
a requirement set.

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:16.359
And the result is finally you get something
that you can pay for and that still meets

00:16:16.359 --> 00:16:21.449
the intent of the scientific objectives.

00:16:21.449 --> 00:16:24.079
That is a key lesson to learn.

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:29.089
When you are first starting out, when you
are first crafting what you want to do, except

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:31.239
it to change.

00:16:31.239 --> 00:16:38.239
And the key there is it is usually cost driven
as to what you can afford.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:44.519
Not only that, NASA, just by the nature of
what it is doing, since it has never built

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:50.669
an AXAF before, it is really hard to get a
good, accurate cost of what it costs.

00:16:50.669 --> 00:16:57.669
So, a lot of times, the cost is derived from
a parametric usually weight-based system such

00:17:01.209 --> 00:17:08.209
that, for instance, if the mirrors or if the
solar rays, you want them this big to provide

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.199
this much power.

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:14.280
That big means they have to weigh or they
mass so many kilograms.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:20.670
And so that is about X amount of dollars based
on weight.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:27.670
Now, there are a lot of additional factors
that you put in like complexity, interfaces,

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:33.300
et cetera, technology readiness, whether you
are looking for state-of-the-art or something

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.350
that has already flown.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.530
But generally it is what is called a parametric
cost model.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:47.880
And it is not based on taking a look at all
the design drawings and saying this cost this

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.010
much from the vendor, this cost this much,
and you put it all together.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.310
That is called a bottoms-up assessment.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:59.750
And it is more accurate, but it also relies
on having an accurate design picture which

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.050
obviously you don't have early on in a program.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:09.050
I mean it is almost like a black art to try
and take a requirement set and craft a design

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.760
early on or at least bound the design and
bound the cost.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.160
Because, again, early on what you are trying
to do is get into the cost envelope and still

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.880
meet the scientific objectives or the objectives
that you are trying to do.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.320
Yes.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.770
In this final design, how are its capabilities
versus the original?

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.240
I mean because you didn't put as much money
into it.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.070
Correct.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:46.070
To make it on-orbit replaceable means that
all of the boxes that you see in the spacecraft

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:53.830
bus, or a lot of them would have had to have
been, on this picture, replaceable.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.500
They were all replaceable.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.740
You have to spend some money making sure that
the drawers slide in, slide out, there are

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.490
no sharp edges and it is accessible, et cetera.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.030
So, packaging is important.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.930
That is one area where you can reduce cost
and not really have an effect on performance,

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.890
per se.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:15.720
However, one of the big areas that we did
take a little bit of a hit on performances

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.420
is on the mirrors.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:23.450
Now, x-rays, you cannot just have a regular
shaped lens.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.880
What we use is grazing incidence mirrors.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.120
And I will explain this later.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.470
Because the x-rays are so highly energetic,
you have to graze them gradually to a focus.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.190
And the original concept had six mirrors nested.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:41.300
They were basically hyperbola parabola shaped.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.360
The final concept had four.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:50.360
We had to remove, not the inside or the outside,
but two of the middle mirrors.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.000
So, the mirror set is four.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.400
This orbit that this flies in is a highly
elliptical orbit.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.470
It is about 140,000 kilometers by 10,000 kilometers.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:10.220
The original orbit was in low earth orbit
which is about 350 kilometers.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.060
And so that affects the viewing time.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:22.050
But, in all of the other registration and
encircled energy, I think that we still were

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:26.980
able to meet the original objectives of the
scientific mission.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:33.370
There are ways to compromise that don't really
affect directly what the scientists want to

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.490
do, but it is a tradeoff.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:40.240
It is usually not their first desire but they
signed up to it, they are comfortable with

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.610
the final answer.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.030
Explaining a little bit of how it is put together.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.380
This is a rather simplified version.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.210
Here are the solar rays.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.630
That is where we get our power.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.250
This is the spacecraft bus.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.690
This is the HRMA which is the mirrors, the
nested cylinders that I was talking about

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.290
earlier.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.540
This is a low energy grading and a high energy
grading.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:13.410
For spectroscopy, what you want to do is you
want to bend all of the photons in a particular

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.250
energy much like a prism does for visible
light.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.820
And the way you do that is with these facets.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.220
There are probably a thousand facets on this.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.530
And I have a picture of that later.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.540
And you flip it into the beam when you want
to get some spectroscopy data.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:37.540
And you remove the grading when you want to
get an x-ray image of what you are looking

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:38.600
at.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.600
And that is a function of what the scientists
want to do at a particular target.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.970
Some scientists want to get an image because
that conveys more information for them than

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.760
spectroscopy.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:56.890
Others want to see a spectrogram of the image
because that tells them what the photons are

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.980
and what the energy of the photons are.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:05.370
And that can tell you, for instance, what
elements are present and what temperatures

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:10.610
for a given gas cloud or neutron star or what
have you.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.200
And then we have an optical bench.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.400
And all that means is it is a piece of structure
that is very stiff.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:22.020
Because obviously you can tell if you flex
a lot that sure doesn't help your camera imaging

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.720
the performance.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.910
It has got to be very stiff, and that is why
they call it an optical bench.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.660
And the ISM is the Integrated Science Module.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:38.310
That is where the instruments sit in Chandra.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:44.770
And here is a picture, as I mentioned before,
of how the x-rays graze off of the cylinders

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.450
in the HRMA down to a focal point about ten
meters away.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:55.450
Jeff had mentioned that sometimes it takes
quite a while for science to come to fruition

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.800
in a mission.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.820
And this is probably a good case.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.340
It started in 1978 with some concepts.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:14.340
We did get approval for new start in 1988,
so you can tell there was ten years time where

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.120
this was just an idea in a scientist's mind.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:26.120
And typically the course of events is that
the scientist lobbies and submits papers,

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:34.070
submits proposals to NASA, lobbies Congress,
lobbies the National Science Foundation to

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:38.260
say this is a good idea, we should do this
and here is the concept.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:45.260
And, of course, that concept changes over
time as you get new technology, et cetera.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.350
And so, that is exactly what happened here.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:53.650
We did get approval ten years from when the
original concept started.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:24:00.650
Authority to proceed for the prime contract
was in January 1989.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:07.400
What this means is that is when we hired a
contractor to build the spacecraft.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.570
And the start of that process is called ATP.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.770
We had two separate ATPs.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:20.400
Sometimes you can say I can let out one contract
to a company and let that company buy the

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.010
science instruments or I can compete the science
instruments separately.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:32.010
And there are various pros and cons, but in
this case NASA decided to compete the instruments

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.430
separately.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:41.160
From an engineer's point of view, one of the
things that should peak your interest or note

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.730
that when you have separate contracts you
always have a question of integration.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.990
If you are going to compete separately, you
are going to have two separate pieces.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.590
Who is going to integrate them?

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.720
The integration job will be harder when you
compete them separately.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.560
Now, your performance is probably better when
you have direct insight into the instruments

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.790
and direct insight into the spacecraft contractor.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:09.620
But the penalty is now, when you integrate
the two, you have to make sure that works.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:14.600
And so, as a project manager, as a systems
engineer you have to make sure you apply enough

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.930
resources to make sure they work together
and continue to work together as they are

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:26.930
defining the interfaces, for instance, between
the two elements.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:35.680
This was interesting in that in order to get
it funded, Congress said we will let you build

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:42.590
an AXAF but, along the way, you have to do
some testing to show that you can meet the

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.450
performance that you say you can meet.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:52.450
And so, we were required by law to have a
test of the mirrors in June of '91.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:26:00.240
And we also had another test later on, the
same thing, to verify that we could get the

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:07.310
performance that we showed on paper with actual
hardware before we committed to fly and before

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:13.600
NASA committed to spend the rest of the money
to fly.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:19.220
And so, sometimes that happens, sometimes
if you have a smaller program it doesn't go

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.660
to Congress so you don't get into those things.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.490
But, when you have a great observatory and
NASA is spending a lot of money, a lot of

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:34.360
times Congress will get in and say yes, you're
constrained, but you have to show me along

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.420
the way that you can do this.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:45.420
I wouldn't be surprised if Congress does that
for the CEV, the new vehicle coming up, or

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.250
the CLV.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:53.300
In fact, for the CLV, the launch vehicle,
there is a push to have a demonstration test

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.710
early just to verify that we can do it.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.830
Now, during this time, of course, we are still
formulating requirements.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.730
And we rack up the cost.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:09.730
And, low and behold, NASA cannot afford it.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:14.750
We went through a program restructure at that
time where we dropped a couple of the mirrors,

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:19.780
we changed its orbit, we removed crew servicing.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.240
And you could tell that the whole shape of
the spacecraft changed.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.860
Again, that is unfortunately not atypical.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.980
It happens quite often.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.930
Yes.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:36.930
What was the reason for the orbit change?

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.780
Good question.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.570
In orbit there are Van Allen Radiation Belts.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:51.360
And we really cannot observe too well within
those belts.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.730
Now, in the first mission, the low earth orbit
mission we were below the belts so we could

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:56.220
operate.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:03.000
But the problem with low earth orbit is you
have this big earth, you are close to earth,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.130
and so you need power from the sun.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.130
And, guess what, the sun goes behind the earth.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:14.570
And so, you are eclipsed for a good percentage
of the orbit time.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:21.570
When we had a 15 year mission in low earth
orbit we said since we don't have servicing,

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.700
the lifetime cuts down to five years.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:28.309
Now, if I am five years in low earth orbit,
I have just lost two-thirds of my mission

00:28:28.309 --> 00:28:29.340
time.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.330
So let's see if we can crank up the orbit,
get as far outside the radiation belts as

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:34.870
we can.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:40.550
And then we have basically 100% visibility,
the whole orbit, if we can get completely

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.170
outside.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:48.170
The problem with that is that costs propellant
because the radiation belts end, they breathe,

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:53.240
but roughly around 60,000 kilometers.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:59.990
We could raise apogee to 140,000, but we didn't
have enough money to raise perigee.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.580
It gets down to money again.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.580
So, perigee stayed at about 10,000 kilometers.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:10.760
The resulting orbit time, if you looked at
the integral of time outside the radiation

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.350
belts, was probably about 70%.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.180
It was a compromise.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:23.180
We did end up losing some overall time, but
about 70% of the orbit is usable for viewing.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:32.830
That is the strategy and that is why we went
to a different orbit.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.650
As you can tell, there are a lot of things
that are traded off during that time to fit

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.000
within the constraints that you have got.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.190
Again, that is typical.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:48.350
The three reviews that are kind of standard
reviews for all programs and projects are

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.950
you start with a requirements review.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.070
And that is pretty basic.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:57.360
It is held early on.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.320
Requirements have started before that review.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.070
For science missions, you start with science
objectives.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.450
And you are percolating science requirements.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:13.140
And the system requirements review is really
a review that baselines, if you will, and

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:18.480
sets the requirements as firm as you can.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:25.480
And it is usually after you have gone through
the cost gyrations, but it is done prior to

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.460
doing any of the design reviews.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:34.550
Once you have a requirements review done,
it was in December of '92, almost two years

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:40.059
later we had what is called a preliminary
design review in November of '94.

00:30:40.059 --> 00:30:46.630
The third review is called a critical design
review in February of '96.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:51.760
What makes a preliminary design review and
critical design review has to do with the

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.740
maturity level of the design.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:31:00.430
For critical design review, supposedly you
have on the order of 90% of your drawings

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:05.280
complete and on the order of 10% of your hardware
built.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:12.280
And I think for PDR it is about 10% of your
drawings built, the final drawings.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.850
That kind of gages what you are talking about
there.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:23.760
And it is a typical milestone that NASA uses
for all of its programs.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:30.760
Usually these are set early on in the mission,
in the program milestones.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:37.550
And, for political and for programmatic reasons,
you tend not to deviate.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.210
You try and meet those milestones.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:45.190
Even if the project is not as mature as you
would like, usually that is one that you try

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.309
and keep hold of.

00:31:46.309 --> 00:31:52.840
Maybe you don't have 10%, maybe you have 5%
or maybe you don't have 90% you have 70%.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:58.320
Sometimes you do go and you hold the milestone,
you hold the review, but when you are not

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:04.520
mature enough sometimes you have to hold a
delta review to catch up.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:10.100
And that is, again, something that NASA does
for various reasons.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:16.610
If the situation is right, sometimes you can
slip and allow a single review at the right

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:17.540
time.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:24.540
Most often it is driven by nontechnical things
that require you, either by your customer

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:33.830
headquarters, they don't want you to slip
so you tend to hold it where he said he wanted

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.880
it.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.929
And then we had the mirror delivery to the
calibration facility in November.

00:32:41.929 --> 00:32:48.809
It shipped the whole thing to the Cape for
launch in February and we launched in July.

00:32:48.809 --> 00:32:55.059
You can see we spent about five or six months
down at the Cape integrating into the Shuttle

00:32:55.059 --> 00:33:00.809
testing, and then we flew in July of '99.

00:33:00.809 --> 00:33:02.660
Those are the orbit parameters.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.380
We achieved the final orbit August 7th, so
you can see about two weeks.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:12.450
And the way we did that is the Shuttle only
puts stuff to low earth orbit, so you need

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.550
some additional propulsion.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:21.040
We had an upper-stage that got us part of
the way there, used most of the energy.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.880
However, it wasn't at the final orbit.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.880
So, integral to the spacecraft, we had a propulsion
system that had to do five additional burns

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.890
to get us to the final altitude and the final
orbit parameters.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.700
That is why it took us about two weeks.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.640
And, again, that is not atypical.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:46.640
When you are not operating in low earth orbit,
it takes you while to get your final orbit.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.770
And these are a couple of interesting parameters.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.990
Safe mode, we will talk a little bit about
that.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:59.670
Spacecraft are designed such that if -- Yeah.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:06.670
I am just wondering if the inclination affects
the requirements at all or does it not really

00:34:12.339 --> 00:34:12.589
matter so it just stays [NOISE OBSCURES]?

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:17.719
The 28.5 is driven largely by the launch site
at Kennedy Space Center.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:18.279
Right.

00:34:18.279 --> 00:34:25.279
I am just wondering if the science requirements
could drive the inclination [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:27.918
For some missions, yes.

00:34:27.918 --> 00:34:34.440
We were fairly incentive to that, as long
as we took advantage of launching at KSC at

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.889
the optimum inclination.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:38.369
But there are missions like Space Station.

00:34:38.369 --> 00:34:45.369
Because you have a launch from KSC and a launch
from Russia, to optimize the performance of

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:52.889
both launch centers then the orbit is 58.5.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:56.748
Now, what that means to KSC launch is that
you pay a significant penalty.

00:34:56.748 --> 00:35:03.749
You pay about a 30% weight penalty for launch
at KSC to the Space Station.

00:35:05.799 --> 00:35:12.799
Sometimes the answer is yes, you can optimize
inclination, and sometimes, when you have

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.839
a large program and multiple launch sites
it is a compromise.

00:35:17.839 --> 00:35:21.380
So, it is not efficient for each site.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:28.380
I was mentioning spacecraft typically have
their avionics systems.

00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:34.039
And typically they do not contract the ground.

00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:37.519
They are not in communication with the ground
all the time.

00:35:37.519 --> 00:35:39.210
And so, for Chandra, that is the case.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:46.210
We may have "contact" with Chandra probably
about 5% to 10% of the time per day.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:54.640
In the meantime, figure that 90% of the time
it is out of communication range.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.220
Now, this is something, by the way, that is
somewhat different from a manned mission.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:05.960
The manned missions tend to optimize and maximize
communication coverage.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:12.960
When Jeff is flying in the Shuttle we probably
have 90%, 95% coverage over an orbit and over

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.019
a day for communication.

00:36:16.019 --> 00:36:19.119
But, in science missions, rarely is that the
case.

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:25.900
And so what that means is the whole philosophy
of operating a science mission is based on

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.069
stored commands.

00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:30.460
And so, we send up a stored command load.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.960
And that load is good for a day.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:37.390
And basically it steps through and automatically
executes based on time.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:43.980
What that also means is you have to design
a spacecraft to recognize when it has a problem.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:50.799
If a hardware box has a failure, it has got
to be able to recognize that and go into a

00:36:50.799 --> 00:36:57.799
safe mode so that the ground can then recover
and configure the systems to continue to operate.

00:36:58.509 --> 00:37:05.509
That is one part of flying a spacecraft, is
building a robust safe mode to be able to

00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:07.289
do that.

00:37:07.289 --> 00:37:12.769
And our first problem occurred August 17,
1999.

00:37:12.769 --> 00:37:14.710
Now, note it was a ground error.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:21.710
As usually the case, spacecraft are pretty
complicated.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:29.460
And we probably had 400 or 500 separate procedures
and commands on the ground for doing certain

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.170
things.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:40.170
And, even though we try and test them out
individually, the combination of those procedures

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:45.809
and in the execution, sometimes you put the
spacecraft in the wrong configuration with

00:37:45.809 --> 00:37:50.680
one sequence, and then you follow with another
sequence.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:57.230
Low and behold, the software that you designed
for safe mode says I am in the wrong configuration.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.960
Sorry, I am going to safe mode.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.759
And so, that happens.

00:38:02.759 --> 00:38:08.210
We have had only probably three safe mode
events for six years, so that is not too bad

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:09.109
at all.

00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:13.660
Hubble, for instance, has had probably an
order of magnitude more than that.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:20.319
I think we have gotten smarter based on our
design of Hubble to design this.

00:38:20.319 --> 00:38:27.319
But, again, typically spacecraft do have safe
mode designs in them.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:33.039
Given our orbit, we still have a small eclipse
season.

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:38.690
Twice a year in the fall and in the spring
we have eclipses.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:45.690
And so our first eclipse season was then.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:51.910
This is the translation mechanics for the
science instruments.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.980
This is where the telescope is.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.999
I won't go through that.

00:38:54.999 --> 00:39:01.999
This is kind of where we purchases or we contracted
for the various instruments.

00:39:03.819 --> 00:39:09.259
This is a CCD imaging spectrometer.

00:39:09.259 --> 00:39:16.259
In fact, it was both Penn State and MIT that
produced this one.

00:39:16.259 --> 00:39:22.029
And that is one of the focal plate instruments
and the other one was a high resolution camera

00:39:22.029 --> 00:39:26.170
using micro-channel plate technology instead
of a CCD.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:30.369
And that one was from SAO just down the street
in Cambridge.

00:39:30.369 --> 00:39:35.710
The high energy transmission grating, as I
had mentioned, was also from MIT.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:40.440
And the low energy grating was from the Netherlands.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:45.450
And this is a good point to make also, is
that a lot of times for science instruments

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:51.210
or for science missions, NASA tries to lower
the cost of the mission.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:57.809
And the way you can do that is you can reduce
requirements or you can get a partner and

00:39:57.809 --> 00:40:03.319
have the partner pay for an instrument that
you want to fly.

00:40:03.319 --> 00:40:09.589
And so, in this case, as is typically the
case for science missions, NASA tries to go

00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:15.979
and get international partners that will bring
to the table an element or a piece of hardware

00:40:15.979 --> 00:40:21.910
or some software that reduces the overall
cost of the mission but, at the same time,

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.349
maintains its capability.

00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:29.549
That is what we did with the low energy transmission
grating.

00:40:29.549 --> 00:40:35.140
We got the Netherlands to basically design
and build that and fly that in exchange for

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:38.400
that kind of arrangement.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:45.400
They get a percentage of viewing time that
they can say for 5% of the viewing time we

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.049
get to point the telescope to wherever we
want.

00:40:49.049 --> 00:40:56.049
And so, typically that is kind of the handoff
between our international partners and NASA

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:02.619
in trying to reduce the overall cost to NASA
for a given mission.

00:41:02.619 --> 00:41:07.180
And these are the gratings, as I had mentioned.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.390
And there are a bunch of facets along these.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:16.180
Now, notice these are the four mirror shells
where they co-align with the four mirror shells,

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:22.119
the inner most and the outer most.

00:41:22.119 --> 00:41:23.849
And this is kind of how it works.

00:41:23.849 --> 00:41:26.660
The gratings get flipped in.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.900
And this is the array of CCDs.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.470
Each one of these is a CCD.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:39.470
And the pattern of light or the pattern of
x-rays follows along these lines when the

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.690
x-rays actually come in.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:46.390
That is what actually you see.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:48.809
Now, Chandra does have a ground system architecture.

00:41:48.809 --> 00:41:52.069
We communicate with the deep space network.

00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:59.069
That is how we communicate because it is not
in low earth orbit so we cannot use the satellites

00:42:00.249 --> 00:42:03.489
that are around the earth.

00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:08.839
We get that signal from that satellite and
it is beamed to the control center, here in

00:42:08.839 --> 00:42:10.579
Cambridge, in fact.

00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:13.089
And we do various things on the data.

00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:16.599
We process it out and send it to the general
observers.

00:42:16.599 --> 00:42:23.599
Now, the way this operates is that every year
this control center or the science folks operating

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.809
the control center solicit objectives.

00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:36.670
OK, science community come and request time
and give me a proposal for viewing time for

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:40.299
what you want to do, what target you want
to look at, what is the configuration of the

00:42:40.299 --> 00:42:42.559
instrument, which instrument, et cetera.

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:47.759
And so, the Chandra folks go through, and
they probably collect about 800 proposals

00:42:47.759 --> 00:42:51.829
a year from all around the world.

00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:55.960
They will select roughly about 200.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.099
And it is not based on numbers, it is based
on time.

00:42:59.099 --> 00:43:04.960
You have a certain amount of seconds in a
year that is available.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.319
And so, some of these proposals have large
times, some have small times, but roughly

00:43:09.319 --> 00:43:11.190
it is about a four to one.

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:16.700
About 200 are selected, 800 are proposed,
so that's good, you're oversubscribed, you

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.650
have a lot of interest.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:21.259
NASA does fund those that are selected.

00:43:21.259 --> 00:43:26.430
So if you are a PI and you say I want to go
look at Crab Nebula or I want to go look at

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:32.589
a Quasar somewhere, and here are the reasons,
here is what that will tell me.

00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:33.579
And it gets selected.

00:43:33.579 --> 00:43:39.059
NASA will fund you some money to be able to
do that observation and process the data and

00:43:39.059 --> 00:43:40.390
publish.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:44.839
Now, NASA won't fund any that were selected
from foreign countries.

00:43:44.839 --> 00:43:51.839
So the foreign countries, they have to get
their funding, but we will allow them viewing

00:43:52.279 --> 00:43:53.249
time.

00:43:53.249 --> 00:43:54.960
And that is also typically the case.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:01.960
And, by the way, all of these scientists across
the world never have to come to Cambridge.

00:44:04.789 --> 00:44:07.859
It is all done electronically.

00:44:07.859 --> 00:44:09.460
They don't get their data real-time.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.729
They get it probably a few weeks after the
observation.

00:44:13.729 --> 00:44:16.269
And the reason for that is there is a lot
of processing.

00:44:16.269 --> 00:44:21.680
You don't actually send, or you can, but usually
you don't send the raw data out to the user.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:27.650
It is heavily processed, and the products
of that processing are what is actually sent

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:28.779
out.

00:44:28.779 --> 00:44:34.390
Now, there are tools that the Control Center
also provides, but generally it is the process

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:37.950
data that is sent.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.390
Yes?

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:45.390
What sort of data is this?

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:46.940
Images or numerical data?

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:50.950
It is data that can be used for images.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:57.950
It can be used for registering each photon,
what energy it is.

00:44:58.049 --> 00:45:01.359
There are a lot of different choices of data.

00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:08.359
And some of the data is overlapping, but it
does give you information on energy, location,

00:45:09.859 --> 00:45:16.859
number count, where in the field.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:25.710
It can be used to then process an image or
process a spectrogram.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.859
And you do that by using the tools that are
also provided.

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:35.329
It is like a viewer or it is like a piece
of software that allows you to view what is

00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:36.109
in that data.

00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:37.529
But the data is just the raw data.

00:45:37.529 --> 00:45:43.009
It is just a series of tables.

00:45:43.009 --> 00:45:45.819
And, as we said, it began in 1978.

00:45:45.819 --> 00:45:48.579
I picked the prime and was given a new start.

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:51.829
I am not going to go through these.

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:54.229
It was restructured.

00:45:54.229 --> 00:45:55.729
We went to four mirror pairs.

00:45:55.729 --> 00:45:59.819
We dropped two focal plane instruments, dropped
the servicing requirements.

00:45:59.819 --> 00:46:00.519
I mentioned that.

00:46:00.519 --> 00:46:07.519
Interestingly enough, one of the instruments
we wanted to create a separate spacecraft

00:46:09.619 --> 00:46:12.160
just for that instrument.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:19.029
And, believe it or not, the addition of this
spacecraft and this one for the spectroscopy

00:46:19.029 --> 00:46:21.759
mission was going to be cheaper than the original
concept.

00:46:21.759 --> 00:46:28.759
But again, due to cost, we continued this
spectroscopy spacecraft for about a year to

00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:32.430
two years.

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:36.269
And then that was cut due to cost.

00:46:36.269 --> 00:46:40.170
So we ended up flying just this one spacecraft.

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:47.170
And the result is the Chandra Observatory
that we have now.

00:46:47.619 --> 00:46:51.839
Note that sometimes it is not within your
control as to whether your program is cancelled

00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:52.749
or not.

00:46:52.749 --> 00:46:55.470
We were doing quite well.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:59.559
It was within our cost envelope that they
had given us.

00:46:59.559 --> 00:47:04.880
But, at the time, there were other priorities
at NASA and there were other overruns at NASA.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.989
And they have to weigh.

00:47:06.989 --> 00:47:11.410
Sometimes they say, well, you can have this
much money for these many years.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.970
And every year they re-evaluate.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:19.710
And that is because you don't know how much
things are going to cost because NASA typically

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:26.269
builds one of a kind things, and you don't
know really how much it costs until it is

00:47:26.269 --> 00:47:27.609
already done.

00:47:27.609 --> 00:47:31.079
So that re-evaluation process continues now.

00:47:31.079 --> 00:47:34.339
And it will probably continue for as long
as NASA flies.

00:47:34.339 --> 00:47:40.549
So imaging and spectroscopy is what we do.

00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:42.190
Why is imaging so important?

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:49.190
Well, clearly this image was a Rosat image
with the highest technology at the time.

00:47:50.249 --> 00:47:52.680
And here is the Chandra image.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.719
And you can see the neutron star right there.

00:47:55.719 --> 00:48:00.390
And there is no way you can see a neutron
star in there.

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:06.809
And they can learn a lot more from this image
than they can from this, so that is why scientists

00:48:06.809 --> 00:48:10.969
push to get good imaging resolution as well
as good spectroscopy.

00:48:10.969 --> 00:48:17.969
The biggest challenge for us on Chandra was
the mirrors.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:27.430
Now, recognize that due to the analysis that
we performed early on, yes, this was all theoretically

00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:37.059
possible, but we had to be able to polish
the surfaces of those mirrors, those grazing

00:48:37.059 --> 00:48:42.249
incidence mirrors to an accuracy of on the
order of angstroms.

00:48:42.249 --> 00:48:46.009
And that is pretty small.

00:48:46.009 --> 00:48:47.140
Can we measure that?

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.559
The answer is no.

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:54.269
At the time, we couldn't even measure how
accurately we needed to polish the mirrors.

00:48:54.269 --> 00:48:59.349
So that tells you that, boy, we've got our
work cut out.

00:48:59.349 --> 00:49:06.349
We had to work with the National Institute
for Standards to figure out how to first measure

00:49:08.269 --> 00:49:13.160
how accurately we can polish it and then ended
up polishing the mirrors.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:20.160
And polishing, as a process, getting down
to that smoothness clearly is a huge challenge

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:23.539
and takes a long time.

00:49:23.539 --> 00:49:28.999
And so, that was probably our biggest challenge,
is to polish the mirrors.

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:35.999
Metrology is the science of working mirror
technology and getting the surface figure

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:41.680
of the mirrors correct.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:48.680
So, really, the key to success is developing
three different types of metrology measurements

00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:52.979
that are independent, that allow you to cross-check.

00:49:52.979 --> 00:49:58.150
Because you are talking about things you have
never built before and you are pushing the

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:02.269
state of the art and you don't know how to
measure it.

00:50:02.269 --> 00:50:09.269
The key there for an engineer should say,
OK, I need not just one way of checking my

00:50:10.059 --> 00:50:17.059
work, but I need at least two ways, and preferably
three independent ways of making sure that

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.380
I am doing the right thing.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:25.869
So when you're pushing the state of the art,
a good lesson is try and get into a position

00:50:25.869 --> 00:50:32.259
where you have got more than one independent
check of your analysis to make sure it is

00:50:32.259 --> 00:50:33.599
correct.

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:35.640
So that was a very big challenge for us.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:40.749
And, again, that is kind of how it goes down.

00:50:40.749 --> 00:50:47.749
This is the general shape of the mirrors.

00:50:48.559 --> 00:50:52.589
And here are the mirror pairs being assembled.

00:50:52.589 --> 00:50:57.229
And, of course, one thing about the mirrors
is when you are talking about that surface

00:50:57.229 --> 00:51:03.239
finish, you cannot just assemble it in your
garage with dust around.

00:51:03.239 --> 00:51:06.410
You have to be extremely clean.

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:12.489
And, believe it or not, one of the dirtiest
things in a laboratory is a human.

00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:19.489
And so, a human has to be almost completely
covered to prevent any kind of accumulation

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.339
on the mirrors themselves.

00:51:21.339 --> 00:51:28.190
In fact, we had to limit the exposure time
of humans to the unpolished and polished mirrors

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:35.190
during this timeframe because contamination
is an incredible problem when you are talking

00:51:35.529 --> 00:51:42.529
about the atomic scales of polishing the mirrors.

00:51:43.979 --> 00:51:49.670
Again, I mention that the important thing
is to make sure that you are doing cross-checks

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.969
in the metrology as you are going along.

00:51:51.969 --> 00:51:54.650
Because, again, you don't know exactly what
you are doing.

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:59.469
I mean on paper, yes, you've got an analytical
solution that tells you the right answer,

00:51:59.469 --> 00:52:00.660
but you have never done it before.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.769
You have never built it before.

00:52:01.769 --> 00:52:03.489
You don't know how to measure it.

00:52:03.489 --> 00:52:09.170
So you have got to work on building confidence
that your analysis is correct.

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:11.920
How do I know that analysis is correct?

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:18.479
And so, you have got to think about a sanity
check, if you will, to make sure that those

00:52:18.479 --> 00:52:20.130
are correct.

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:25.719
And, of course, the best way for proving that
it is correct is test them.

00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:27.849
And that is what we did.

00:52:27.849 --> 00:52:30.819
Mandated by Congress, we tested the mirrors.

00:52:30.819 --> 00:52:33.890
Now, the thing about that is so I test the
mirrors.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:40.890
I am testing the mirrors in a 1G environment
so, even after the test, how do I know that

00:52:41.239 --> 00:52:44.079
those results are correct?

00:52:44.079 --> 00:52:48.979
Because the 1G deflection, even though you
think it is small, it does affect the mirror

00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:51.609
performance on the ground versus in orbit.

00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:54.380
And another thing is the finite source distance.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:01.380
You cannot get a source that is infinitely
far away on the ground just because of the

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.700
nature of putting a source out there.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:10.700
Our source was about, I think, a quarter mile
away.

00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:17.670
And we had to make analytical corrections
to compensate for how we expected the spot

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:21.069
size to change because of that finite source
distance.

00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:28.069
We had to analytically correct the image on
the ground to compensate for the 1G affects

00:53:28.769 --> 00:53:30.269
of the mirrors.

00:53:30.269 --> 00:53:32.650
And so, even a test you would think, OK, go
test it.

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:37.489
Well, it is not straightforward because, even
in that test, that is not a true representation

00:53:37.489 --> 00:53:39.910
of how it would work on orbit.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:44.089
So it is a lot more complicated than one would
think.

00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:48.380
What do you use your x-rays for?

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.390
Various things.

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:56.509
We had some monochromatic x-rays at various
wavelengths.

00:53:56.509 --> 00:53:58.219
We had registration x-rays.

00:53:58.219 --> 00:53:59.390
Iron.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:02.599
A certain wavelength of iron is a big one
to use.

00:54:02.599 --> 00:54:05.779
You don't have a picture of the big tunnel,
do you?

00:54:05.779 --> 00:54:06.599
I think I do in here.

00:54:06.599 --> 00:54:08.319
I have got a picture of it and I can talk
about.

00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:15.200
But that is another thing, is when you are
testing, how well do I know my source?

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.079
And that is all factored into verifying that
you have got the performance correct, because

00:54:19.079 --> 00:54:23.829
if your source is all over the place and you
haven't characterized your source well enough

00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:30.829
then how in the world can you say that the
mirrors are that good?

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:34.049
So we did end-to-end testing.

00:54:34.049 --> 00:54:39.499
And, again, you don't just look at the raw
data and say, yeah, I am there.

00:54:39.499 --> 00:54:45.559
Even in the ground test, a lot of times you
have to massage the data and compensate analytically

00:54:45.559 --> 00:54:49.779
for factors that you cannot control.

00:54:49.779 --> 00:54:54.859
And the key to success there is good systems
engineering.

00:54:54.859 --> 00:54:59.349
And a lot of that is because of multiple separate
parties, academia, nonprofits and foreign

00:54:59.349 --> 00:55:02.940
groups all involved in the workings of AXAF.

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.209
You have got to make sure that you have got
a team that works together.

00:55:06.209 --> 00:55:12.549
Lesson learned, as I had mentioned, perform
multiple cross-checks either via test or analysis

00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:15.059
with a different tool as possible.

00:55:15.059 --> 00:55:19.130
Another lesson learned is let more than one
group perform the review.

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:26.130
A lot of times, for Chandra, we had the Marshall
engineers, but we also contracted SAO down

00:55:26.239 --> 00:55:33.239
the street to kind of independently assess,
using their own software tools, where we were.

00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:38.209
And that was a good idea because sometimes
we had good ideas that we could incorporate

00:55:38.209 --> 00:55:43.180
and sometimes they had good ideas, but it
gave us a sanity check when we both matches

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.319
and we both felt good.

00:55:44.319 --> 00:55:49.809
There is also no substitute for direct test
or measurement.

00:55:49.809 --> 00:55:56.809
Analytically, we have wonderful tools nowadays,
but they will never take the place of testing.

00:55:57.559 --> 00:56:03.039
Another thing that was very important for
us because of the iteration cycle with headquarters

00:56:03.039 --> 00:56:09.039
on funding is make sure that you keep the
science or the scientists that are part of

00:56:09.039 --> 00:56:14.269
the mission informed and part of the decision-making
process.

00:56:14.269 --> 00:56:18.880
One would think, and one would like to think
that this is a technical project, all things

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.309
are technical.

00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:25.009
No, there are personalities involved and there
are human responses involved.

00:56:25.009 --> 00:56:30.910
And so, to keep the team together you need
make sure that the science is informed and

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:33.059
supporting your decision-making process.

00:56:33.059 --> 00:56:40.059
A lot of times that is overlooked, but it
is, nonetheless, very important as you are

00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:41.859
building a project.

00:56:41.859 --> 00:56:48.859
And the final lesson learned is, as we are
going through and making those mirrors, you

00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:53.789
construct what is called an error budget.

00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:57.709
You assume perfect performance and then you
kind of step back and say I am going to allow

00:56:57.709 --> 00:57:01.749
imperfect performance in this region.

00:57:01.749 --> 00:57:05.309
And I am going to allocate that imperfect
performance to thermal design.

00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:12.309
I am going to allocate imperfect performance
to the inaccurate knowledge of knowing the

00:57:12.579 --> 00:57:14.579
source positions in the sky.

00:57:14.579 --> 00:57:21.440
I am going to allocate some error budget to
flexing of the optical bench.

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:28.440
I am going to allocate some error sources
to the difference between how long the focal

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:32.190
length is and how long I think it is.

00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:33.930
And so, you take each of the error terms.

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:37.869
And for Chandra we probably had a hundred
or more.

00:57:37.869 --> 00:57:44.160
And you go through and you verify that your
assumption in that error budget term was correct.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:48.989
And usually, for the critical ones, you did
it in more than one way, more than one method

00:57:48.989 --> 00:57:54.309
so that you were sure that you had those error
terms defined.

00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:58.469
And the end result was we had mirrors that
performed better than expected.

00:57:58.469 --> 00:58:05.469
And, as a result, the payoff is just wonderful.

00:58:09.329 --> 00:58:12.789
This is a time-lapse series of images.

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:19.789
And, supposedly, this wave front was moving
out from the source pulsar at significant

00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:28.579
fractions of the speed of light on the order
of 20% to 30% of the speed of light.

00:58:28.579 --> 00:58:29.599
That was pretty cool.

00:58:29.599 --> 00:58:31.809
And if you need more information just talk
to Jeff.

00:58:31.809 --> 00:58:38.809
But that was a pretty big payoff.

00:58:42.079 --> 00:58:46.619
The next challenge that we had was the programmatic
challenge.

00:58:46.619 --> 00:58:53.489
Again, as I had mentioned, the normal process
of going through a program in a project is

00:58:53.489 --> 00:58:56.400
you are first trying to size the mission.

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.380
And, really, you are sizing it for cost.

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:02.880
And that is very hard to do when you are building
something new.

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:07.459
And that was a very big challenge.

00:59:07.459 --> 00:59:10.880
And so, we changed a lot of things.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:17.739
But, eventually, the key or the critical thing
that you are trying to do is I compromise

00:59:17.739 --> 00:59:21.359
on this but I want to still try and maintain
performance.

00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:27.890
We maintained our imaging resolution performance
and our registration performance.

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:32.119
And we compromised on a few other things but
we maintained that performance.

00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:39.119
Finish this slide and then we will take a
quick break.

00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:48.309
Note down here that we also needed to reduce
the weight by a factor of two from our original

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.989
designs.

00:59:51.989 --> 00:59:56.089
Our original designs were pretty simple aluminum
structures.

00:59:56.089 --> 01:00:02.019
Our final designs were the best composites
that we knew how to make at lowest weight.

01:00:02.019 --> 01:00:07.430
And so, that optical bench, that tube was
all composite.

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:13.789
And so, that is the kind of weight reduction
scheme we had to go through.

01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:18.749
Now, also all of the fittings, that means
all of the brackets that we use were also

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:20.059
composite.

01:00:20.059 --> 01:00:27.059
And another challenge that we had is analyzing
the stresses in a complicated composite fitting.

01:00:29.999 --> 01:00:30.479
Very hard to do.

01:00:30.479 --> 01:00:35.829
Didn't have techniques to do it when we started.

01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:41.299
As part of the process of building this telescope,
we had to go through and learn that and develop

01:00:41.299 --> 01:00:42.029
those techniques.

01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:49.029
Before the break, I just want to point out
I hope you all are catching the incredible

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:58.309
parallels between this project, a complex
technological process and the sorts of things

01:00:58.309 --> 01:01:01.180
that we've heard about the systems engineering
of the Shuttle.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:08.180
Right from the weight problems and composites,
new materials, new ways of analysis right

01:01:10.719 --> 01:01:16.609
into the intervention of Congress into the
engineering process, I mean it is all there.

01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:22.969
And I think whenever you get involved in a
big space project you can expect that those

01:01:22.969 --> 01:01:29.019
things are going to happen, and they are probably
going to happen in the Exploration Program

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:29.369
as well.

01:01:29.369 --> 01:01:33.940
Two minute break and then we will start up
again.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:38.380
Start up again.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.339
Let's see.

01:01:41.339 --> 01:01:48.339
We were talking about for us the next biggest
challenge was programmatic in that it you

01:01:53.059 --> 01:01:55.180
have to work that early on.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:02:00.589
And typically, especially the more expensive
missions do go through this as a typical part

01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:02.410
of the lifecycle of a project.

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:07.150
I have a question on that last slide.

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:09.670
[NOISE OBSCURES]

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:15.579
The budget for systems engineering was cut
which translates directly to the number of

01:02:15.579 --> 01:02:18.109
folks at the contractor site.

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:22.130
Working systems engineering was cut so we
were challenged.

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:29.130
And what we did at Marshall was we offset
with NASA's civil servants doing functions

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:35.160
and tasks that the contractor would normally
do to compensate for that.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.359
So that is what that meant.

01:02:38.359 --> 01:02:45.359
Typically, systems engineering, a very important
thing if you talk to folks in the trade, almost

01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:50.059
everyone has a different idea of what all
is encompassed in systems engineering.

01:02:50.059 --> 01:02:55.180
But the point is there probably are a number
of things that almost everybody would agree

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:56.709
are part of systems engineering.

01:02:56.709 --> 01:03:00.349
And they are very key to executing the program
and the project.

01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:02.869
They are really the glue that holds all the
subsystems together.

01:03:02.869 --> 01:03:09.869
And I will probably talk more about it, but
for good systems engineers you have to be

01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:17.799
able to communicate well with all the other
subsystems and all the other stakeholders,

01:03:17.799 --> 01:03:22.479
including the science when you have a science
mission, including the users when you have

01:03:22.479 --> 01:03:28.729
a manned mission, including safety and everybody
to make sure they are all connected.

01:03:28.729 --> 01:03:35.729
And be smart enough to be able to challenge
the subsystems when they really have their

01:03:36.369 --> 01:03:43.369
own ideas on where this needs to go and it
is not really in concert with everybody else.

01:03:49.869 --> 01:03:56.609
Weight reduction did have some impacts, as
I mentioned, using light-weight composites.

01:03:56.609 --> 01:03:59.640
And that was a challenge in and of itself.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:05.089
We also dropped two of the SIs.

01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:09.359
Another challenge was the science instrument
module which was all composite.

01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:16.359
And it had the capability of adjusting focus
and translating, so it had two degrees of

01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:17.619
freedom.

01:04:17.619 --> 01:04:24.619
But it needed to be reproducible in terms
of motion on the micron scale over the whole

01:04:28.469 --> 01:04:30.339
orbit environment.

01:04:30.339 --> 01:04:34.420
That was quite a challenge in and of itself
to be able to do that.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:41.420
I mean just kind of a flavor for the things
that you have to deal with is not everybody

01:04:43.469 --> 01:04:50.469
had the same analysis tools so universities
like MIT and like SAO had different structural

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:56.440
analysis tools for their hardware than the
contractors did.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:03.440
Now you do a couple loads analysis, which
is you pull together all of your stress, all

01:05:04.759 --> 01:05:11.759
of your structure analysis models together
in one place and you go through a loads assessment

01:05:13.319 --> 01:05:14.489
all through the whole element.

01:05:14.489 --> 01:05:21.009
Well, to do that I need a model from you,
I need a model from you, I need a model from

01:05:21.009 --> 01:05:21.259
you.
But you are in California, you are a university,
you are another company and you have to make

01:05:30.199 --> 01:05:32.219
sure they all play together.

01:05:32.219 --> 01:05:36.459
And a lot of times there is parochialness
with company A, I am not going to use anything

01:05:36.459 --> 01:05:37.369
but my model.

01:05:37.369 --> 01:05:42.529
And the university says, well, I cannot do
anything but what we have been doing.

01:05:42.529 --> 01:05:46.910
And university C says, well, this is the only
thing that will work and you guys are crazy.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:51.829
It is not that bad but that is the kind of
thing that you have to deal with as a systems

01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:52.249
engineer.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:54.359
You have to make sure everybody plays together.

01:05:54.359 --> 01:06:01.359
And sometimes you have to go through and work
the best solution that may not be the optimum

01:06:01.469 --> 01:06:02.910
solution for each piece.

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:09.910
But it is the optimum solution for the overall
answer.

01:06:13.809 --> 01:06:20.809
Again, getting the programmatic challenge
behind us, a key thing is also setting allocations.

01:06:24.559 --> 01:06:26.130
I talk about the error budgets.

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:33.130
Another good thing that the systems engineer
does is allocates various important resources.

01:06:34.049 --> 01:06:37.469
And one that every spacecraft does is weight.

01:06:37.469 --> 01:06:44.469
Weight, power and data are usually three of
the important resources that are allocated.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:52.369
For scientific telescope missions another
one is error budgets for scientific performance,

01:06:53.940 --> 01:07:00.940
but the key to that is good weight allocation
and good iteration, which with each of the

01:07:02.529 --> 01:07:08.229
elements that you allocated the weight to,
to keep up with them to make sure they can

01:07:08.229 --> 01:07:11.180
meet that or it looks like they are going
to exceed.

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:16.739
So I have got to go borrow some of that allocation
from somebody else.

01:07:16.739 --> 01:07:21.719
And I have got to take away from Peter, if
you will, to pay Paul.

01:07:21.719 --> 01:07:27.890
So systems engineering and going through that
making the initial allocations and keeping

01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:33.890
up with that is a pretty critical factor to
making sure you get to the final answer.

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:40.890
And, if you do that well, then usually you
have less of a problem getting to the final

01:07:42.499 --> 01:07:45.279
solution.

01:07:45.279 --> 01:07:52.279
To compensate for the loss of systems engineering,
we established technical oversight panels

01:07:53.229 --> 01:07:58.430
which were NASA employees at our center.

01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:04.538
We controlled, at a project level, the internal
ICDs.

01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:05.400
Now, what is an ICD?

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.180
It is an interface control drawing.

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:15.180
Because when you have company A developing
an element and university A, where they come

01:08:17.589 --> 01:08:18.859
together is an interface.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:24.339
And you have to document that interface, not
just mechanically but thermally.

01:08:24.339 --> 01:08:28.510
What is the heat flow across the interface,
the data across the interface, the power,

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:32.120
the signal characteristics across the interface?

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.190
The data flow.

01:08:33.190 --> 01:08:37.080
What data is going across the interface?

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:42.779
And, as you can realize, as both of those
things change, you have to change the interface.

01:08:42.779 --> 01:08:45.970
So you have to keep up with that.

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:52.970
And a lot of times good systems engineers
will recognize the further away in location

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:58.950
it is the harder it is to interface with the
two parties.

01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:05.430
When you are in California it is one thing
when they are in the same town, it is another

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:09.690
thing when they are in the same country and
it is another thing where they are across

01:09:09.690 --> 01:09:14.220
the water when you are integrating an international
partner.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:19.700
So, as systems engineers, the factor is the
closer you are the better it is because I

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:26.700
can just go in a car and go across town to
get out the drawings and talk about the drawings

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:33.068
versus in California that is a plane ride.

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:40.068
But, in Europe, the time difference allows
you to only be able to talk to them for a

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:44.370
few hours a day because that is when your
work shifts overlap.

01:09:44.370 --> 01:09:48.710
So it is a lot more complicated interacting
with folks in Europe, interacting with folks

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:55.710
in Japan, in India because of the time difference
and because it is very far away when you have

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:57.770
to sit down.

01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:04.770
Those are kind of the challenges as systems
engineers that you should think about.

01:10:06.309 --> 01:10:07.460
Lessons learned.

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:13.070
Set your resource allocations early and continue
to monitor them and work with each of the

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:20.070
owners of the elements of those allocations
to make sure that they are meeting their allocation.

01:10:21.059 --> 01:10:25.900
As you recognize, it is a zero sum gain.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:31.550
So when somebody goes over their allocation
somebody has got to be reduced.

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:38.550
And it is very difficult sometimes to negotiate
that reduction because engineers typically

01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:42.690
want to hold their margin, they don't want
to release it.

01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:47.880
They want it because they are not yet confident
in their final solution.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:52.280
But to make everything play sometimes you
have to take away from them and reduce their

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:57.250
margin to be able to let somebody else survive
if you will.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:04.250
It is not an easy thing, but attention to
that detail is important.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.270
Maintaining strong systems engineering group
is important for that reason.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:19.820
If I have a lot of pretty dominant subsystem
managers that say I am building a power system

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:26.370
and I need this much weight and I need this
much thermal capability that's good, and they

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:31.390
may be very good, but what they are doing
is if you have a lot of dominant subsystems

01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:36.800
and no central systems engineering, as traffic
cop there is no check and balance.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:43.370
And so that dominant thing may work very well
at the expense of the integrated performance

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:44.170
of everybody else.

01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:51.170
That is why systems engineering is so important,
that dominance and to balance weakness where

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:57.230
you have weakness.

01:11:57.230 --> 01:12:04.230
And for Chandra hard work pays off when you
get it right.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.860
Technology.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:16.860
A lot of times NASA will build a science spacecraft.

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:22.110
And the spacecraft itself usually isn't pushing
a state of the art.

01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:23.730
For Chandra it was a little different.

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:28.010
We pushed the mirrors, and there are a few
other things we pushed.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:33.350
But typically it is the case where NASA pushes
the state of the art on the instruments.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:37.140
Better sensors, better CCDs, better processing
electronics.

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:40.390
And Chandra was no different.

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:45.910
Usually it is an embellishment from something
that has flown before on a different spacecraft,

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:47.050
only now it is better.

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:48.230
We are getting it bigger.

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:51.830
We are getting more resolution.

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:55.340
It takes less power.

01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:58.230
There is usually a steppingstone.

01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:05.230
And for ASIS, the one that was built at MIT,
it charged a couple of devices in an array

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:08.830
size that they have never been built before.

01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:10.960
And so that was a challenge.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:17.809
Also a challenge was in order for the CCDs
to operate they needed to be cooled to minus

01:13:17.809 --> 01:13:24.210
100 degrees Celsius, 120.

01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:31.210
And, in addition, they developed a new way
of clocking out the data from the rest of

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:35.780
the CCDs that have been built.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:41.750
That had better spectroscopy performance and
a very low noise signal chain.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:48.160
There are always going and they are always
looking at, well, on spacecraft X this CCD

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:48.750
was flown.

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:51.140
It may have been a 512 x 512.

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.580
Well, you know, it is pretty easy.

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:57.600
I can stretch it a little bit and work the
substrate in 24 x 24.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.920
Well, usually it is the case where it is not
as simple as you think.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:06.290
And there are always problems.

01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:11.170
In particular, technology should be a warning
flag to systems engineers to say typically

01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:18.170
it is not as simple as you think so make sure
you are paying attention to these new developments

01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:24.400
or these stretching of new applications of
existing technology.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:31.400
Because, for instance, one of the things that
you get bit by, and we got bit by is radiation

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.059
susceptibility.

01:14:35.059 --> 01:14:41.140
Thermal extremes for multilayer circuit cards
that have to operate at minus 120 C on one

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:45.690
end and room temperature on another end.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:48.120
Low yields for those new types of CCDs.

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:55.120
I can just stretch it and make it 1024 x 1024,
but where I was using 90% of the batch, now

01:14:55.710 --> 01:15:02.450
I am only using 10% just because I cannot
get one that big to work out and to be smooth

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:05.740
and homogenous.

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:09.020
ESD sensitivity.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:14.510
Because they are getting bigger and bigger
and thinner and thinner it is much more susceptible

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.750
to electrostatic discharge.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:23.750
And simple things like my yield in the wintertime,
because the humidity in the air is lower,

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:30.890
I have less of a yield in winter than I do
in summer.

01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:34.450
And so that is what we found out.

01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:40.040
And there are also mitigating effects that
you can come and put humidifiers in and compensate

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.460
for that.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:45.970
But those are the types of things that you
have to worry about that can come and bite

01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:52.970
you with new technology because you are doing
something new.

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:59.410
Because of going down to 120 to optimize the
performance and to get the very low noise,

01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:02.650
we said we need a radiator or a sunshade.

01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:09.650
And, low and behold, flying on the Shuttle
in certain attitudes that you have to verify,

01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:18.050
because in some off nominal events you can,
instead of being deployed on day one of a

01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:26.790
mission you get deployed on day three, but
you have to go across the sun terminator frequently

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:32.520
and you get a little glint of direct sunlight
on these sunshades.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:37.040
And, therefore, you have to analyze what the
temperature extreme and what the effect is

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:37.480
going to be.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.780
And, low and behold, we see that we have delamination
on that case.

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:48.040
But here is a case where it is an off nominal
event in the Shuttle that we have to design

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:52.290
for and we have to compensate for, even though
chances are we will never see that design

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:55.150
case.

01:16:55.150 --> 01:17:02.150
But a lot of times the programmer or project
manager has to say I am going to suck it up

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.580
and I am going to make the change for that
small eventuality.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:14.580
Or I am going to risk it based on cost and
we are going to try and preclude that eventuality

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.920
from happening.

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.480
A lot of times it is not cut and dry.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.340
It is a guessing game.

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:25.230
It is a balance that is based on judgment,
past performance and a lot of other factors

01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:32.230
to say, boy, that is so low probability of
occurrence that I am not going to worry about

01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:36.559
it.

01:17:36.559 --> 01:17:39.550
And that threshold is never defined.

01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:46.550
You have to define it as a project manager.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.150
Just kind of a picture of what the instruments
look like.

01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:52.690
There are the CCDs.

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:54.900
This is the long stretched away.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:18:01.900
And, for the spectroscopy measurements, that
is where the lower energies -- Actually, the

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.980
higher energies in the middle and the lower
energies go along this wing and along this

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.020
wing because you get the energy spread.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:19.020
And there are the imaging devices that are
used when you just want a good image.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.710
On HRC, there is the detector right there
in this diamond-shaped thing.

01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:31.370
And it is operating off a completely new and
older technology than the CCDs.

01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:38.370
The instrument of choice has been this for
probably 70%, 75% of the observations just

01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:46.900
because of the capability that this allows
you not just an image, but the CCDs also give

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:51.020
you some rudimentary information on energy.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:58.020
And so, that is why this is preferable over
this one.

01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:05.559
On HRC, we talked about ASIS.

01:19:05.559 --> 01:19:09.760
We had, again, a low noise signal chain.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:14.440
On HRC, we never had three micro channel plates
tied together and linked together.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.370
And we had that challenge.

01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:18.930
We also had very accurate event timing.

01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:25.930
So, when we have a pulsar, I know exactly
in registered time when those pulses are occurring.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:37.180
We had spacecraft charging protection for
new technology problems and spurious noise

01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:38.809
susceptibility.

01:19:38.809 --> 01:19:41.190
Spacecraft charging.

01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:48.190
To keep the mirrors nice and warm at plus
or minus half a degree C across the entire

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:54.710
mirror surface all around it required thermal
blankets on the outside.

01:19:54.710 --> 01:20:01.090
Well, the thermal blankets were susceptible
to charging up and discharge with popping.

01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:08.090
And so, the question is, is that going to
affect my instrument performance by incorrectly

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:14.350
registering a photon event every time these
blankets discharged?

01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:21.210
So we had to go through a test campaign to
verify that, no, this discharging of those

01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:28.210
blanket electrostatically would not affect
the imaging performance at the detector level.

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:31.330
That is something we didn't even think about
before.

01:20:31.330 --> 01:20:35.240
But, low and behold, we came up with it.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.790
Yes, these things are going to discharge,
they are going to pop so is it going to affect

01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:41.650
our measurements.

01:20:41.650 --> 01:20:48.650
Those are the kinds of things that you will
run into.

01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:56.020
Again, good systems engineering and sound
communications are the key to getting through

01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:57.790
those.

01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:59.830
Insuring participating.

01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:02.080
Keeping parties informed.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:09.080
Encouraging teamwork to be part of the team
and to help contribute to its success.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:16.230
Lesson learned is establish standing interface
working groups with mandatory participation

01:21:16.230 --> 01:21:17.040
from the SIs.

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.150
The SIs kind of have a different paradigm.

01:21:19.150 --> 01:21:25.080
Science instruments are usually built by universities,
and the universities are typically staffed

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:32.080
by grad students and some full time engineers.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:38.809
But usually the paradigm and the thinking
process is a university atmosphere.

01:21:38.809 --> 01:21:45.580
When you have companies it is a completely
different interface, very regimented, very

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:49.100
by the book, we have done it before and this
is how you do it.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:54.270
And so different cultures, you have to make
sure they blend together to produce the final

01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:55.420
product.

01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:57.059
And a lot of times that is not technical.

01:21:57.059 --> 01:22:04.059
That is human interaction and making sure
they all work together.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:13.100
When problems occur recognize that you need
to go outside of the project office to get

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.520
help.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.980
And this is typically done at NASA.

01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:23.980
If Marshall is managing a project and we have
got a problem with CCDs, the key to success

01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:32.790
is recognize, well, Ames Research Center in
California has an expert in CCDs.

01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:38.020
Call him up on the phone or bring him down
and let's talk to him to get his expertise

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:39.580
in on this project.

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.150
NASA does good on that.

01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:44.809
It does go to where the expertise is.

01:22:44.809 --> 01:22:49.600
Not just at another NASA center, but it may
call experts across the industry or across

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:52.350
academia to come help with a problem.

01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:59.340
The foam problem on the Shuttle is a pretty
big problem, and we have called experts from

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.840
around the country and around the world to
try and help understand what was going on

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.050
with the foam.

01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:09.280
That is something that NASA does well, is
it brings in experts and it doesn't think

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.130
that it knows everything locally.

01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:14.150
And that is something to keep in mind.

01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:17.070
If you don't know an answer, don't just try
and think of it yourself.

01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:22.600
Go get the answers from somebody who might
have experienced that before.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.430
And encourage teamwork.

01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:30.790
A lot of times programs suffer from the culture
clash between different paradigms and different

01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:31.040
cultures.
And that is especially the case between academia
and industry.

01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:43.690
It is also evident between international partners
and industry.

01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:54.170
And, of course, the payoff is this is a spectrogram,
the counts per bin, number of photons per

01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:55.809
energy level.

01:23:55.809 --> 01:24:02.809
And, as you can tell, very sharp and very
well-defined peaks for where those lines are.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.920
Next challenge was integrated testing.

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:24.920
Integration is always a challenge.

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.460
How in the world are we going to integrate
this whole thing?

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:32.670
The logistics of who does what when, we must
choreograph it.

01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:34.960
Here we have instrument A coming in.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.190
We have instrument B.

01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:38.520
We have the gratings coming in.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.059
We have the ISIM built at Ball Brothers.

01:24:42.059 --> 01:24:45.600
We have California building the optical bench.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:51.440
Where are we all going to put this all together
and test it out?

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:56.100
That is always a challenge because, again,
you have different players involved in different

01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:57.190
pieces.

01:24:57.190 --> 01:24:59.370
And you have got to make sure it all plays
together.

01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:06.300
And the key there is to create a working group
to make sure you address every aspect of integration.

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.080
You plan very much ahead of time.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:15.080
You choreograph everybody coming in to make
sure you have got everything covered.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:23.050
And in integration always, always it takes
longer than you think.

01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:26.650
You always plan assuming nothing is going
to go wrong.

01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:31.990
This test takes this long and this test takes
this long and this test takes this long.

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:37.309
When, in fact, as is always the case, you
always have problems in testing.

01:25:37.309 --> 01:25:44.309
Any time you are matching two boxes together,
especially electronically, a lot of times

01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:46.530
you have problems.

01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:52.980
So testing is always something that you should
make sure you have enough time to do troubleshooting.

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:59.980
And plan for failures and not plan a success-oriented
schedule.

01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:12.330
Even the best laid plans, TRW planned the
integrated testing in a vacuum chamber.

01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:19.330
And during observatory integration TRW couldn't
hold the schedule because, guess what, the

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:26.390
first thing that goes when you are in a money
crunch is testing at the end.

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:28.040
And you say why do that?

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:35.040
Because they say we had six months of margin
in the schedule and you have eroded that margin.

01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:40.480
But that margin you haven't really defined
anything to go into that margin.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.150
So, hypothetically speaking, if everything
goes OK, I don't need that.

01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:50.760
Well, so you take it off the table and it
gets eaten away.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:51.809
And that is what happened.

01:26:51.809 --> 01:26:58.460
It got eaten away and couldn't hold schedule
caused, in this case, by antiquated EGSE and

01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.059
software.

01:26:59.059 --> 01:27:03.820
But it is typical of a paradigm that says
I create schedule, you have got to try and

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:08.670
preserve this schedule and fight tooth and
nail to keep that reserve in every step of

01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:14.530
the way because in integration test is where
usually you get behind.

01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:20.059
When we got behind the recovery is daily focus
on schedule.

01:27:20.059 --> 01:27:25.130
Every day we were on the phone going over
what was to occur that day.

01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:32.130
24 hour operations one year before launch
continuing all the way around the clock.

01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:37.380
We changed the I&T integration and test lead
out at TRW.

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:43.140
We brought Marshall NASA engineers into help
TRW do it.

01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:49.840
And we had a technical presence help out at
the test site.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.650
We have a contractor, we hire a contractor
and the contractor is supposed to do the job.

01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:56.340
And, low and behold, the contractor is not
doing the job.

01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:01.720
So we could take a step back and say whack
them on the head, you are not doing the job.

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:05.780
Or, you can go in and say we have got to get
this job done.

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:09.280
We are going to go and we are going to send
folks over there that are technical folks

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:15.280
that will help your guys work these problems
and work the issues and work the integration

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:15.940
and get this thing done.

01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:20.630
And so, that is what we did.

01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:22.290
That is kind of a typical schedule.

01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:26.210
We have a Comprehensive Acceptance Test.

01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:29.110
That is just a functional test going through
all of the paces.

01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:36.110
EMI is your kind of electrical susceptibility
to noise.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:44.320
When you have a palm pilot or a cell phone
and it is near a computer or near some device

01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:46.610
you hear this chattering.

01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:52.890
That is what that test is all about to look
at interference patterns and look at whether

01:28:52.890 --> 01:28:56.380
you are susceptible to noise.

01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.620
We have an end-to-end test.

01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:59.490
That is where we get a compatibility van.

01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:06.220
And we make sure that we can communicate with
the deep space network dishes in Goldstone

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.270
and Madrid and Canberra.

01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:14.900
That is our pointing at control systems polarity
test.

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:19.840
Did we mount the gyro correctly or is it upside
down?

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:22.570
Did we mount the reaction wheel correctly?

01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:26.220
Do I have the spin vector pointed this way
or pointed that way?

01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:31.740
You think that is pretty simple but, in fact,
on the box it doesn't say arrow pointing up.

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.270
You have to actually test it out.

01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:38.860
And NASA has screwed it up before.

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:41.880
We do an acoustic test and then a pyroshock
test.

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:48.880
Acoustic is you blast it with acoustic noise
and the noise couples and creates vibrations,

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:54.170
especially you are worried about thin films
and large surface areas that are exposed to

01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:56.820
the noise pattern, the wave front.

01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:00.840
So we painted the whole spacecraft with a
huge woofer.

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.240
I mean it was enormous.

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:10.350
Just to see the vibration and what would happen
to make sure that it was OK.

01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:14.870
And we have the solar ray full motion test
and the low gain antenna release test.

01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:20.880
We have mechanisms which are typically things
that fail a lot or don't operate the way you

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.550
thought.

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:27.370
We want to test those hopefully in the environment
that they would see in orbit.

01:30:27.370 --> 01:30:33.730
That means if it is cold, if it is exposed
to a plasma we want to try and duplicate that

01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:35.590
on the ground.

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:37.460
Typically, that is what we do with mechanisms.

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:37.710
Yeah.

01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:44.550
I was wondering if you had like a separate
satellite that was forecasting and they kind

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:50.910
of knew that [NOISE OBSCURES].

01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:53.070
Good question.

01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:57.809
Typically, in the old days, when we had a
lot of money, we would build what is called

01:30:57.809 --> 01:31:03.990
a qualification article which is basically
a test article for the whole thing.

01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:08.450
And the qualification article would match
one for one the flight unit.

01:31:08.450 --> 01:31:12.300
And we would test the heck out of that qualification
article.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.860
Nowadays, with money problems, typically we
don't do that.

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:21.690
For selected components where we are worried
about the design, we will develop a qualification

01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:23.890
article at the element level.

01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:30.360
But typically we don't do it with whole spacecraft,
not anymore.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:35.190
Although, the one exception to that is the
structural test article.

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:42.190
Usually spacecraft do build a structural test
article that does look like the final flight

01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:44.260
design from the overall structure.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:50.610
And you get your mode shapes and your frequencies
when you ring it and see how it performs.

01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:53.780
And you fold that back into your analysis.

01:31:53.780 --> 01:32:00.780
But that is probably the only case where you
build a full test article for structural purposes.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:03.140
It would be nice if we could do that.

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:08.820
The DOD does that when they have a production
of a thousand units, but NASA nowadays cannot

01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:13.450
afford to build a whole complex ground test
article.

01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:17.050
It would be nice but sometimes we just cannot
do it.

01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:24.050
We will do it on a selected element level.

01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:27.630
Hardly ever testing to failure.

01:32:27.630 --> 01:32:34.210
We talked about that with the Shuttle because
JR Thompson was pointing out, like with the

01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:38.670
main engines, testing to failure was really
critical for success.

01:32:38.670 --> 01:32:44.650
But, remember, that is a very different operating
situation than a satellite where normally

01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:50.690
if the satellite can survive launch and the
vibration, and the vibration is tested, the

01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:57.690
structural, you know, if that survives then
the operating environment is a lot more benign.

01:32:58.170 --> 01:33:04.980
Now, what do, though, is we compensate for
not testing to failure by testing with two

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:09.900
our expected flight environment plus margin.

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:15.400
Analytically, or based on previous data, we
determine what the environment is going to

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:15.720
be.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:19.550
And we will add margin to that and we will
test to those margins.

01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:23.330
Most times we do pretty well.

01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:28.820
Sometimes we don't, but that is probably few
and far between.

01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:34.220
And we have learned, after 40 years, of how
to apply margin to our best analysis or our

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:40.360
best tools that define what the environment
is going to be.

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:47.360
So that kind of shows you starting in October
'87, ending April '98, that was the plan.

01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:55.770
We actually took about nine months more than
what you see there because of all the problems

01:33:55.770 --> 01:34:00.650
that we had.

01:34:00.650 --> 01:34:06.870
A key point is when you are pressed for time
do not cut corners.

01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:10.870
We did review all the testing and we did not
delete any testing that we considered was

01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:12.340
mandatory.

01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:17.840
And, in fact, we added systems testing to
verify that we had total system performance

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.150
that we knew what this thing was going to
do.

01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:27.150
We also added some end-to-end testing in thermal
vac and added much more end-to-end testing

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.460
with the control center that will eventually
operate.

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:36.880
A lot of times you have, in the integration
and test time, a different set of engineers

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:41.050
testing this than will actually operate it
in flight.

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:42.420
Probably not a good idea.

01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:48.990
What you really want is to get your operators
in flight operating and testing early enough

01:34:48.990 --> 01:34:55.460
that they can go through all of the gyrations
of the testing environment and all of the

01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:00.500
idiosyncrasies of the hardware before flight
so that they are trained on the hardware and

01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.920
they know how the hardware performs.

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:10.740
And so, if you can, you want to try and get
the operators to do the testing prior to launch.

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:16.969
And a lot of times that isn't the case, unfortunately.

01:35:16.969 --> 01:35:17.320
Lesson learned.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:23.670
Try to keep one integrated database along
that theme of the Control Center for testing

01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:29.110
and operations because what you don't want
to do is to have a database for testing that

01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:33.900
then you discard and you create a separate
database for operations.

01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:39.900
It is much better to have one database so
that you know what the parameters are.

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.590
And, once you have verified them in test,
they are the same parameters that you are

01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:46.910
using in flight.

01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:53.910
Also, to define an explicit test and integration
lead, review the approach, encourage end-to-end

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:59.900
testing participations of the operations group
early and often and, if you can, get the operations

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:06.780
group at the Control Center to run the tests.

01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:11.610
And give adequate time for box level testing
and data system integrated testing.

01:36:11.610 --> 01:36:16.510
A lot of times what will happen is you're
running late on schedule and at the box level

01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:18.300
I have a multiplexer.

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:23.690
And I had scheduled, at the box level, probably
300 hours worth of testing.

01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:25.070
Well, you know what, I am running late.

01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:28.120
They are wanting me at the spacecraft level.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:29.540
Well, let me jip it up now.

01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:33.030
It has only had 50 hours but now I am going
to the spacecraft.

01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:39.500
Low and behold, now what you have just done
is you have moved the problem further on downstream

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:42.840
when it is much more expensive and it costs
you a lot more money.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.100
When I have a problem in integrated testing,
guess what?

01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:52.240
The whole spacecraft stops until I fix this
box.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:57.309
If you can, try and do it so that you have
got enough margin that you can test at the

01:36:57.309 --> 01:37:04.309
small box level in parallel with all of the
other boxes before you get to integrated testing.

01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:12.190
Management.

01:37:12.130 --> 01:37:14.630
There were plenty of challenges in the management.

01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:18.770
And a term used is unknown unknowns.

01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:23.980
We didn't know at the time that money was
going to be a problem with program restructuring.

01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.800
You don't know that you are going to have
an integration delay.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.840
There are a lot of things that you really
don't know.

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:34.040
But, nonetheless, you have to expect for and
you have to plan for.

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.830
That is why, at the beginning of a project,
you create what is called reserve resources.

01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:45.830
In terms of cost, depending on the nature
of the complexity, the technology push, you

01:37:46.210 --> 01:37:51.420
may have 20% to 30% of cost held in reserve.

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:55.280
Not applied anywhere because you don't know
where the problems are going to occur.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:01.990
And you try, as a project manager, to hold
onto that by tooth and nail and not release

01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:08.990
it if you can at all and only grudgingly allow
reserves to be used.

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:18.610
Approach to success in that kind of environment
is experience, getting top management that

01:38:18.610 --> 01:38:23.260
has background and experience, working closely
with the science community.

01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:25.010
Again, focusing on teamwork.

01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:28.780
You will see that as a recurring theme.

01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:33.570
Hold enough reserves so that when you are
scoping out and you've got a lot of unknowns

01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:40.570
that you have enough money and time to do
that.

01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:48.040
Set it as high priority for the company or
the organization that you are working for

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:53.740
and set the schedule early and balance the
need for maintaining schedule with the need

01:38:53.740 --> 01:39:00.740
to slow down and understand what your problems
are rather than racing to the finish line.

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:08.250
Again, these are some of the good lessons
learned.

01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:14.219
In fact, I just covered that one.

01:39:14.219 --> 01:39:21.219
This is what it ended up being, the AXAF Schedule
starting around calendar year '92 with our

01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:22.860
SRR.

01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:27.840
There is our PDR and there is our CDR.

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:31.940
And the launch is even off the chart.

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:37.430
But that is typically the kind of things that
we go through, including in parallel your

01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:44.430
Control Center development back down here.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.490
There is a mirror.

01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:54.830
All of this will be posted.

01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:59.000
I mean these are really valuable lessons.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:06.000
In fact, any of you who eventually go into
systems engineering and project management

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.070
take some of these lessons learned with you.

01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.990
Print them out and review them periodically.

01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:13.440
And remember them.

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.740
They are lessons of hard knocks.

01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:21.740
What I am doing is now is I am now the project
manager for a project or a mission called

01:40:21.809 --> 01:40:28.440
RLEP 2, which is Robotic Lunar Exploration
Program.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:33.980
And that mission will be the first mission
that NASA has, in a long time, to land on

01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:34.340
the Moon.

01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:37.360
We are going to land the Lander.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:44.360
And we are going to have some type of mobility
device that will either drive into a crater

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:52.940
or hop into a crater or crawl into a crater
or walk into a crater and look for lunar ice

01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:57.910
that we think might be there at the South
Pole.

01:40:57.910 --> 01:41:04.910
Now, this is a great example of how things
are done.

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:11.920
We are given a couple of requirements to say
we want to verify our precision landing capability

01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:18.969
in an unmanned sense, and we are going to
use that technique and those algorithms for

01:41:18.969 --> 01:41:22.559
the future human lander.

01:41:22.559 --> 01:41:26.460
And we are also going to need you to go look
at the ice.

01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:31.460
Characterize it and see whether or not ice
is there.

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:33.130
Now, why is ice so important?

01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:37.500
Ice is important because of the oxygen that
you can get from the ice.

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:44.500
And the oxygen is not so much to breathe but
it is for fuel or for oxidizer for propulsion

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.740
systems.

01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:52.090
Instead of getting it at the earth's gravity,
well, you get it at the gravity well of the

01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:53.030
Moon.

01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:55.880
That is our challenge.

01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:02.880
Now, when they asked that, NASA didn't exactly
know what it would cost or what the cost profile

01:42:06.170 --> 01:42:07.170
would be.

01:42:07.170 --> 01:42:11.090
They originally designed it for a $400 million
mission.

01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:18.090
They said, well, why don't you look at a $750
million solution?

01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:24.940
They don't know how many objectives we can
meet.

01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:31.559
This RLEP is supposed to be robotic lunar
exploration.

01:42:31.559 --> 01:42:38.490
It is really a precursor to the human missions,
so they are not even sure how to use this

01:42:38.490 --> 01:42:42.160
program to help bring humans there.

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.710
And so, this is typical.

01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:50.780
NASA doesn't exactly know what it wants to
do, but it kind of puts out feelers to say

01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:51.340
try this.

01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:58.340
It says go start with this, go touch the lunar
surface, characterize precision landing and

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:01.590
go see if there is ice there.

01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:05.320
Well, go see if there is ice there.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:12.320
I can do that with one hop into the crater,
one sample and hopefully, if the ice is there

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:14.469
I can find it.

01:43:14.469 --> 01:43:21.469
Or, on the other extreme, I can go with a
Rover, spend a year in the crater, take a

01:43:22.219 --> 01:43:25.059
thousand measurements and characterize the
ice.

01:43:25.059 --> 01:43:30.500
Obviously, one cost a lot more than the other.

01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:33.460
So how in the world do you answer that question?

01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:37.580
Which one should you do and whether it should
be a mix?

01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:42.260
Those are the very things facing the project
that I am working on now.

01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:49.260
Not only that, one of the things is we are
trying to get prepared for a human mission

01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:55.170
and we want to reduce the overall cost and
reduce the risk.

01:43:55.170 --> 01:44:02.170
We would like to bring risk forward from the
manned lunar mission into the RLEP program

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:06.610
and retire it in the robotics program.

01:44:06.610 --> 01:44:12.490
What that means is if I have a technology
challenge for a cryogenic engine, that means

01:44:12.490 --> 01:44:19.490
a liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen engine for
the lunar descent, I want to use that same

01:44:19.969 --> 01:44:25.010
engine, if I can, on this mission to work
out the kinks.

01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:29.820
But how much is that worth to NASA?

01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:36.820
If that cost an extra $100 million for RLEP
is it worth it?

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:41.530
There is no set answer.

01:44:41.530 --> 01:44:44.600
And so, what we are doing right now is what
is called a pre-phase A.

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:49.700
Much like I showed you on Chandra where you
had that initial design and a final design,

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:53.290
we propose to headquarters with one design.

01:44:53.290 --> 01:44:54.809
It happened to have a Rover.

01:44:54.809 --> 01:44:56.010
It was nuclear powered.

01:44:56.010 --> 01:44:59.330
We went into the crater.

01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:00.850
And we stayed there for quite a while.

01:45:00.850 --> 01:45:05.570
And we definitely characterized what was there.

01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:07.920
But it was expensive.

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:08.700
Is that the right answer?

01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:11.070
We don't know.

01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:17.070
We are right now going through a pre-phase
A that we are looking at other options.

01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:20.610
We are looking at kind of three classes of
sizes.

01:45:20.610 --> 01:45:23.420
Different solutions to get into the crater.

01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:26.320
Different solutions on the size of the lander.

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:29.510
Its extensibility to the human mission.

01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:36.510
Like, for instance, right now we use Russian
progress vehicles to resupply Space Station.

01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:43.780
We hope to design a robotic lander that would
do the same thing during human missions.

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:50.920
It is not man rated, it won't fly men but
it can fly supplies to the Moon with one design.

01:45:52.570 --> 01:45:59.090
But that cost money because now I am not optimizing
design for a point solution mission.

01:45:59.090 --> 01:46:03.610
So during this timeframe there are a lot of
unknown questions.

01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:06.550
And the answers are not straightforward.

01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:12.740
So what we are doing is we are giving a series
of options and rationale and capabilities

01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:14.780
for those options to headquarters.

01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:20.230
And we will make a recommendation as to what
we think is the best answer for NASA to go

01:46:20.230 --> 01:46:23.580
forward with this design and here are the
reasons.

01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:29.710
But it could very well be that they choose
something different because there is no definitive

01:46:29.710 --> 01:46:35.420
solution to this problem or this challenge,
if you will.

01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:36.809
So it is very challenging.

01:46:36.809 --> 01:46:41.620
It is going to look probably a lot different
now than it will when we actually launch it

01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:47.240
in 2010 or 2011, but it is something that
we face now.

01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:54.240
And it is more defined by how much money you
can use versus what the requirements are.

01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:06.340
Sometimes the requirements do set pretty much
the basic tenets of the mission, but other

01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:09.260
times it is driven by cost.

01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:15.809
And so, right now we are in the middle of
working that interesting and challenge problem

01:47:15.809 --> 01:47:22.370
for headquarters to develop what we think
that mission should look like.

01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:25.590
And, as you can envision, you don't really
have requirements.

01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:27.719
You have a few requirements.

01:47:27.719 --> 01:47:33.700
You have a desirability to reduce the overall
cost and reduce the overall risk of a human

01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:35.860
mission.

01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:38.680
But that desirability comes with a cost.

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:44.670
The more extensible you get to the human mission,
yes, you can make a big lander that gives

01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:48.840
you 2,000 kilograms of payload, but it is
going to cost you more.

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:55.840
I can make 1,000 kilograms of payload or 500
kilograms of payload and get the definition

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.660
of what is in the ice.

01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:04.080
But then later on I will have to design a
new lander for getting other things accomplished

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.980
that I want to get to on the Moon.

01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:09.510
And is that the right answer?

01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:15.070
You can tell that there are a lot of challenges
with that?

01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.660
Any questions?

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:20.760
We talked about the cost, performance and
schedule triangle.

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:27.760
Do you have a sense, inside NASA, of how much
they are pushing schedule at this point/ Where

01:48:29.690 --> 01:48:33.740
is your flexibility?

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:39.740
In their solicitation to the centers, they
allowed schedule flexibility.

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.330
They allowed cost flexibility.

01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:48.330
Other programs I will say are generally more
bounded than this one.

01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:56.070
This one is a matter of NASA not knowing exactly
what the reason and what the purpose of the

01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:58.570
program is for.

01:48:58.570 --> 01:49:05.160
You've got this general idea of going back
to the Moon, using robots first to prepare

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:10.750
for humans, but exactly what does that mean
and exactly how do you prepare for humans

01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:14.420
and how much is it going to cost and when
is it going to launch and how many missions

01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:16.190
are you going to have?

01:49:16.190 --> 01:49:17.610
They are all undefined.

01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:23.920
Now, what we would do is we have already gone
to the program that will fund the human missions

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:29.030
to say what do you guys plan to do and what
do you want to do when you get there?

01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:33.070
So we can take their mission design and say
how can we help?

01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:34.190
We can help here.

01:49:34.190 --> 01:49:35.550
We can help here.

01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:38.559
We can pull this technology forward and fly
it.

01:49:38.559 --> 01:49:42.110
The problem there is that they haven't thought
that far ahead.

01:49:42.110 --> 01:49:45.820
They don't know exactly what they are going
to do.

01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:51.410
And a lot of that is, is there ice there or
not?

01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:54.050
If there is ice there, we will want to process
it.

01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:58.690
We will want to extract oxygen from it.

01:49:58.690 --> 01:50:02.780
As part of our solution, we do know that we
have to answer that question.

01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:07.809
We also do know that we do have to demonstrate
precision landing.

01:50:07.809 --> 01:50:13.990
But, above that, they have given us a target
date of 2010 to 2011.

01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:17.690
But they said schedule is not fixed.

01:50:17.690 --> 01:50:22.880
They have given us a cost generally between
$400 and $750 million.

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:28.730
And, by the way, if you can leverage areas
of the budget to help your mission, do that,

01:50:28.730 --> 01:50:30.190
in particular technology.

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:32.990
There is a separate technology budget.

01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:39.170
If I can get technology to pay for a new technology
development at no cost to the program then

01:50:39.170 --> 01:50:42.790
I will do that.

01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:49.790
And, again, if we come in and say we have
$1 billion but it buys you $3 billion when

01:50:52.110 --> 01:50:56.980
the crew is ready to come, we think that is
worth the investment.

01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:02.760
And then headquarters has to scratch their
head and figure out whether it is really worth

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:09.650
minimizing the long-term cost versus the yearly
constraint that they are given by Congress

01:51:09.650 --> 01:51:14.960
and the pressures of Shuttle and the pressures
of Stations on the overall cost of the program

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.469
to NASA.

01:51:16.469 --> 01:51:20.070
It is real challenging.

01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:21.770
It is a lot of fun.

01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:23.430
We are going to have a blast.

01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:29.090
The next one is going back to the Moon, and
you will probably hear more about it in the

01:51:29.090 --> 01:51:29.880
next couple of years.

01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.969
OK.

01:51:31.969 --> 01:51:36.150
Thank you.

01:51:36.150 --> 01:51:38.250
[APPLAUSE]

01:51:38.250 --> 01:51:42.230
This was really the last of the lectures on
systems engineering per se.

01:51:42.230 --> 01:51:45.830
Thursday is the last external lecture.

01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:50.990
Gordon Fullerton will be talking about test
flying the Shuttle.

01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:57.990
And hopefully by then I will have the schedule
for the presentations next Tuesday.

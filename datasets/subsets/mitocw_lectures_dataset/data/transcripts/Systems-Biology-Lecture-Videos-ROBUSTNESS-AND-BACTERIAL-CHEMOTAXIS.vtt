00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.200
JEFF GORE: Today, what we want
to do is focus more explicitly

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.890
on bacterial chemotaxis.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.560
Of course, a
discussion that we had

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.330
on Thursday about "Life
at Low Reynolds Numbers"

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.290
is certainly very
relevant to this question

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.390
of how bacteria are
maybe able to find food

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.380
or what constraints
they're faced in trying

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.530
to solve this problem.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.900
Today, we're going to
discuss in more depth

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.570
this idea of the biased random
walk that runs and tumbles

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.240
that we talked about on
Thursday, that allow bacteria

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.680
to swim towards attractants
and away from repellents.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.530
But in particular,
there's something

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.330
that is rather subtle about the
particular biased random walk

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.310
that bacteria implement.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.170
Now, the way that you
might kind of naively

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170
imagine that this
thing would work

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.100
is that you would just have
this tumbling frequency be

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.850
a function of the concentration
of the attractant, for example.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.210
And that indeed would allow
you to swim or to execute

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.650
a biased random walk
towards, say, food sources,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.910
towards attractants,
but it would not

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.760
be effective over a very
wide range of concentrations.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.697
However, if you experimentally
ask, how well can bacteria

00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:27.280
swim towards
attractants, it turns out

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.690
they can respond over
five orders of magnitude

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.700
of concentration of these
attractants, which is really

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.760
quite incredible, if you think
about the engineering challenge

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.950
that these little one-micron
cells are able to overcome.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.690
And the basic way that
they do this is they

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.840
implement what's essentially
equivalent to integral feedback

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.630
in the context of engineering,
where it turns out

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.081
that the steady-state tumbling
frequency, so the frequency

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.580
of which they'd
execute one of these

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.414
tumbles that randomizes their
motion, that displays what's

00:02:00.414 --> 00:02:01.580
known as perfect adaptation.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.770
It's not a function of the
concentration of-- if you have

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.746
a constant concentration
of an attractant,

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:12.120
then it's not a
function of that.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.720
Of course, changes in
concentrations it responds to,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.790
but somehow, E. coli and
many other microorganisms

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.900
are able to implement this
very clever thing where

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.540
the steady-state frequency
of tumbling, of changing

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.040
direction, is somehow
not a function

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.290
of the overall
attractant concentration.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.010
Now, that's already an
interesting, I think,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.470
phenomenon.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.040
And in some ways,
you can think of it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.550
as some kind of
robustness, because there

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.990
is some way in which this
tumbling frequency is

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.372
robust against constant changes
in the level of attractants.

00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:48.830
And it's that
aspect, I think, that

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.160
makes this example both
rather subtle but also

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.610
quite confusing, because
it's the phenomenon

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.430
of perfect adaptation
that already

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.630
has some aspects of
robustness, but it's

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.480
this phenomenon of
perfect adaptation

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.679
that is robust against changes
in concentrations of proteins,

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:05.970
for example, the concentration
of the protein [? key ?]

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.650
R that we're going
to talk about.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.960
So I think that this
is in some ways maybe

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.120
the prettiest
example that we have

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.100
of this principle
of robustness, but I

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.180
think it's also in
some ways the most

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.840
tricky to wrap your head around,
because it's sort of robustness

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.340
of a robustness in some ways.

00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:30.170
All right.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.640
So our goal for today is
going to be to make sure

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.120
that we understand the challenge
that E. coli are facing

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.340
and then to try to understand
the genetic circuit

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.370
that they use in order to
overcome this challenge.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.450
So what I'm going to do for
the next hour and 15 minutes

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.460
is we're going to leave
this network up on the board

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.910
so that any time that
you're confused about what

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.990
is R, B, Z, Y, so
forth, you can kind of

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.480
look up here and remind
yourself what this thing is.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.910
But hopefully, the
reading from last night

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.290
will help you in
following what's going on.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.855
There are a fair number of
letters, I will admit it.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.930
So first, I just
want to make sure

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.410
that we're all
kind of remembering

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.200
the basic phenomenon
that we're trying

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.300
to study, which is this idea of
consecutive runs and tumbles.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.170
So this random walk is really
composed of what you might call

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.630
or what we do call runs,
where the bacteria goes sort

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.430
of straight and
then tumbles, which

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.240
they randomize their motion.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:52.020
So this is runs and tumbles,
where bacteria, they

00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:02.970
go semi-straight for of order
a second-- order one second--

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.420
and this is the run.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.620
Then, they have
this tumbling that

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.460
might last about one second,
so a 0.1 second tumble,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.890
over which the motion is
sort of random in this axis

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.750
of the orientation.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.360
And then, they kind of
go in a new direction

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.870
and then tumble again and then
new direction and so forth.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.920
So it's runs
followed by tumbles.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.470
Now, the thing that
changes depending

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.450
on whether the cells
are sensing that they're

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.730
moving up or down, say,
an attractant gradient

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.730
is the frequency of
those tumbles, i.e.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.870
how long are the runs?

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.090
I said that they're
around one second,

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.020
but this will vary depending
upon whether bacteria

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.540
sense that things
are getting better

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.706
or things are getting worse.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.440
Can somebody remind us how
the bacteria actually execute

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.525
one of these tumble motions?

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:21.228
Yes?

00:06:21.228 --> 00:06:24.180
AUDIENCE: They have this other
motors-- they have mini-motors

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.902
in their flagella
and they usually

00:06:25.902 --> 00:06:28.680
all spin one way, which I
think is counterclockwise.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.680
JEFF GORE: That's right.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.040
I always have trouble--
so the runs are indeed

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.414
when these things are
rotating counterclockwise.

00:06:34.414 --> 00:06:35.038
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:35.038 --> 00:06:37.585
And one of them can
decide to switch

00:06:37.585 --> 00:06:39.910
and start turning clockwise.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.015
And what it does, it just
sort of-- I don't know.

00:06:42.015 --> 00:06:43.890
I just imagine it throws
the whole motor off.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.860
JEFF GORE: Exactly.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.920
And the flagella in the context
of-- so we have our E. coli.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.530
The velocity is of order,
say, 30 microns per second.

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:01.960
Now, they have these
flagella that are actually

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.650
distributed-- the motors
are actually distributed

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.010
across the entire cell.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.580
So it's not just on the back.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.690
But then, these individual
filaments kind of

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.450
come together towards
the back and then

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.400
they have this corkscrew shape.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.150
When these things
are all rotating

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.050
in the counterclockwise
direction,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.870
that corresponds to a run,
when there's directed motion.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.230
But then if one of
them goes clockwise,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.207
the bundle falls apart.

00:07:30.207 --> 00:07:32.290
And indeed, there are some
very nice movies online

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.930
where you can see that when
they're going clockwise,

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.030
you see that the flagella are
kind of doing crazy things

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.650
and that causes this
thing to kind of tumble

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.650
in a random orientation.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.350
So it randomizes its direction.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.070
Now, one thing that
we did not talk

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.920
about in the context of this
low Reynolds number motion

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.690
was the question of
how hard you would

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.660
have to pull in
order to get a cell

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.300
to go 30 microns per second.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.440
Now, remember, we're in the
low Reynolds number regime,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.767
where the force
you have to apply

00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:25.600
is in general proportional
to this velocity.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.740
And this thing is very
much not a sphere,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:39.200
but if it were a sphere, for
a sphere, the proportionality

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.240
constant is this 6 pi eta
av, where a here is again

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.850
the radius.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.710
Now, regardless of
the precise shape,

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:57.080
you'll always get for the low
Reynolds regime something that

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.620
looks vaguely like this, where
this is going to the longest

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.560
linear dimension and this here
depends on the precise geometry

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.250
of the object.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.210
And so just-- it's
useful to try to get

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.760
a sense of order of magnitude.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.030
How large are these forces
that we're talking about?

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.040
In particular,
how hard would you

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.079
have to pull a cell
in order to get

00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:26.370
it to go 30 microns per second?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.370
Now, of course then,
there's a question.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.770
What's roughly the scale that
we should be thinking about?

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.730
Right now, a newton is the scale
that's for macroscopic objects.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.870
So you'd say, OK, probably
not going to be up that large.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.110
Then, on the other
scale, we can think

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.240
about the forces that
can be applied or exerted

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.330
by individual molecular motors.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.644
Has anybody studied this at all?

00:09:58.644 --> 00:10:00.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.380
JEFF GORE: Right,
order of picanewtons.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:09.630
So force for a
molecular motor is going

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.108
to be of order picanewtons.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.780
Now, there's a
simple way to kind of

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:22.870
get at why this might actually
be, because what is it

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.110
that powers many of
these molecular motors?

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.706
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:28.706 --> 00:10:30.330
JEFF GORE: Yeah, so
it's often-- you're

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.470
thinking of maybe the motors
that operate in a membrane.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.200
And then, there might
be some difference

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.660
in a gradient, so a
difference in concentration

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.410
across that membrane
and that can actually

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.609
power, for example, rotation.

00:10:41.609 --> 00:10:43.150
We're going to talk
a little bit more

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.650
about this in the context
of the flagella motor,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:51.370
because this is one of only
a few known rotary motors.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.900
I'm just going to write this
down so that I don't forget

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.133
to say something about it.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.610
But in this case--

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.294
AUDIENCE: ATP?

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:01.210
JEFF GORE: ATP, right?

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.190
So in many cases, what
happens is that you have,

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.280
for example, kinesin or myosin.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.040
These are motors that walk along
some track and in many cases,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.390
each step corresponds to a
single ATP being hydrolyzed.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.880
And so given that,
there's some maximal force

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.540
that you can imagine
such a motor applying.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.550
So for example-- and what
might it depend upon?

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.589
AUDIENCE: The energy of
ATP hydrolysis [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:35.589 --> 00:11:36.630
JEFF GORE: Ah, very good.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.474
So we have delta G for say, ATP.

00:11:40.474 --> 00:11:42.390
And there's going to be
a length scale, right?

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.139
And what's going to
be the relevant length

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:46.878
scale in the case of, for
example, a motor like kinesin?

00:11:46.878 --> 00:11:49.392
AUDIENCE: The flagella, I guess?

00:11:49.392 --> 00:11:51.850
JEFF GORE: Well, kinesin is
not walking along the flagella,

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:56.060
but in this case, kinesin is
walking along microtubules,

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.040
for example.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.230
So you're right that
we need a length scale,

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.560
because this is going to have
some units of say, picanewton

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:08.770
nanometers-- oops,
that's an Nm--

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.070
and we want to get a picanewton
so we're going to need a length

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.495
scale to divide by, right?

00:12:14.495 --> 00:12:16.480
AUDIENCE: So how long
you move each time?

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.480
JEFF GORE: That's right.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.896
It's kind of the distance that
this thing's moving, right?

00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:22.590
So indeed, what happens
in the case of kinesin

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.480
is that they take steps
with what are called "heads"

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.700
but we can think of them
as "feet" if we want.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.660
So each step is in this
case eight nanometers.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:37.760
For example, delta L for kinesin
is equal to eight nanometers.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.510
You don't need to know
this, but just it's

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.025
useful to have some
sense of scale.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.320
Now, of course,
delta G of ATP, this

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.210
depends upon the concentrations
of the reactants,

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.420
of the products, and so forth.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.320
But this thing might be of
order 100 picanewton nanometers.

00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:05.900
Now, depending on
conditions, maybe it's

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.330
70, but of order here.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.980
And indeed, what
this tells us is

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.280
that just based on what
we've said right now, even

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.140
without building any fancy
microscopes to measure

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.200
how much force these
things can apply,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.957
you can see that the maximum
force it could possibly apply

00:13:21.957 --> 00:13:24.040
would be something on the
order of delta G divided

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.203
by the length that it's pulling.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.590
Otherwise, you could make
a perpetual motion machine.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.430
So this-- well,
maybe what we'll do

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.149
if we want to make
our math simpler,

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:39.440
we could say this is around 80.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440
It's of order there.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.700
But the point is that this
is of order 10 picanewtons,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.100
so it's kind of
picanewton scale.

00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:50.004
All right.

00:13:50.004 --> 00:13:52.420
So given this, it's interesting
to ask, how hard would you

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.540
have to pull?

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.540
So how big is a kinesin model
going to be, this protein?

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.090
AUDIENCE: About
eight nanometers.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.350
JEFF GORE: Yeah, right,
about eight nanometers.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.183
Of course, it's kind
of long, spindly things

00:14:05.183 --> 00:14:07.330
like my skinny legs,
right, but let's

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.710
indeed going to be
around that scale,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:16.970
whereas the cell is one micron
wide, multiple microns long, so

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.210
much, much larger.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.655
We'll draw a little--
here's a kinesin in there.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.350
It's even smaller than that.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.704
Kinesin's small.

00:14:27.704 --> 00:14:29.620
Now, the question is,
how much force would you

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.420
have to apply in order to
pull an E. coli at 30 microns

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.970
a second?

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:39.530
Force to pull E.
coli at the speed

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.470
that it's actually
observed to go-- now,

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.260
you're unlikely to be able to
do the calculation right here.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.450
It's actually a
simple calculation.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.340
We could do it in
a moment, but it's

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.270
useful to just kind of imagine
what scale might it be.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.970
All right, this is a way of--
we can go up as high as we want.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.215
You can continue it on and this
is all in units of picanewtons.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.040
Once again, it's
useful to make guesses

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.540
about your intuition
on these things

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.591
just so you have some
notion of where we might be.

00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:37.090
And of course, in this case,
nobody wants to guess anything,

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:42.600
because they feel--
all right, I'll

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.867
give you 10 seconds just
to make your best guess.

00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:47.200
Somebody's forcing you to do it.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.435
In this case, it's me.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.820
No reason that you actually
should necessarily get this.

00:15:57.244 --> 00:15:58.160
Pulling through water.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.160
AUDIENCE: At 30 microns.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.660
JEFF GORE: At 30
microns per second.

00:16:11.978 --> 00:16:15.380
AUDIENCE: Could you
give us the viscosity

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.850
of water in picanewtons?

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.340
JEFF GORE: Yeah, it's
10 to the minus nine

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.742
in the units of picanewton
nanometer second something.

00:16:22.742 --> 00:16:24.252
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:16:24.252 --> 00:16:24.960
JEFF GORE: Right.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.740
Now, I've given you enough time.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.600
You should have just
been able-- now,

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.380
I'm going to be disappointed
if you don't get it right.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:28.879
No.

00:16:33.494 --> 00:16:34.660
Let's just see where we are.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.290
Ready?

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.780
Three, two, one.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.960
OK, so I'd say that we
have a bunch of-- I'd say

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.730
the mean is kind of a C-D-ish.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.570
We got some A-B's.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.340
All right, so I'd say it's
somewhere in the sense of,

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.700
yeah, maybe it's 100,000.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:58.220
So maybe if you had 100 of these
kinesins pulling you along,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.676
then you'd be able to go 30
microns a second, although you

00:17:00.676 --> 00:17:02.430
have to be careful because
kinesin can't actually

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.020
go that fast.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.900
But these are details, right?

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.260
No, there's a
reasonable question.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.740
How hard would you have to pull.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.473
Of course, if we want,
we could actually just

00:17:13.473 --> 00:17:16.740
do the equations here, right?

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.891
The force, it's around 20.

00:17:19.891 --> 00:17:21.599
In units of picanewton
nanometer seconds,

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:25.339
I told you that the eta is
around 10 to the minus 9.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:25.839
All right.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.130
And the radius, what
radius do you want to use?

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.950
AUDIENCE: A micron.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:30.940
JEFF GORE: A micron.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.580
So do we write a 1 here?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.570
Do we write what?

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.550
10 to the 3 because
I already told you

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.890
that this was in units where
everything is picanewtons

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.180
nanometers seconds.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.580
And velocity, this
is again per second.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.740
So this is three times 10 to
the 4, because that's how many

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.770
nanometers per second.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.489
And this gets us to around--
that's 10 to the seven.

00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:57.030
We're going to have
to divide by 100,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:05.627
so this is 60 divided by 100--
so less than a picanewton.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.430
So this is really
pretty surprising.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:17.090
And again, this is a reflection
of the wonders of low Reynolds

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.300
numbers kind of behavior.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.278
So it's somewhere here.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.580
Yes?

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.540
AUDIENCE: So since
there are many flagella,

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.970
is it telling us--
[INAUDIBLE] is it telling us

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.910
that they're very inefficient
compared to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.785
JEFF GORE: Yeah, it's
a good question, right?

00:18:34.785 --> 00:18:36.650
So I think there
are several ways.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:41.690
And this is one
aspect maybe of what

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.610
we read about in the "Life
at Low Reynolds Numbers."

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:49.240
The comparison was to a
Datsun in Saudi Arabia.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.250
Of course, I think that this
was written in the '70s where

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.280
that meant something.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.850
But I think that a Datsun, I
guess, is a fuel efficient car?

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.570
Well, that was my
inference from that.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.830
And Saudi Arabia has a
lot of oil, still true.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.060
And the saying was that it might
only be 1% efficient or so,

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:12.560
right?

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.760
But if you don't have to
apply very much force there,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.120
then maybe that's
not a disaster.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.859
The swimming speed
is not actually

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:22.900
a super strong function
of the number of flagella

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.691
that are there, as far
as my understanding.

00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:30.200
So I'm actually a little
bit-- there are cases

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.060
where you do get somewhat
higher speed with more flagella,

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.050
although I have to confess,
just from the geometry

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.280
of the multiple flagella I find
totally mystifying, because I

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.290
would've thought they
would get tangled up,

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.519
because each of them goes in
and they form a corkscrew.

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:46.060
I don't know.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.768
It just doesn't seem
that it should work.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.161
But it does, so I'm not going
to argue that it doesn't.

00:19:54.161 --> 00:19:57.047
AUDIENCE: Probably it has to do
with the low Reynolds number.

00:19:57.047 --> 00:19:59.940
So you imagine swimming,
sort of flying around.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.949
JEFF GORE: Yeah, no,
my concern is not even

00:20:01.949 --> 00:20:03.740
a matter of the low
Reynolds number or not.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.940
It's just a matter of
they're each spinning

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:12.810
and then-- this is something
really I've never understood,

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.240
so I typically avoid
talking about it.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.332
I don't know.

00:20:20.332 --> 00:20:22.040
I just feel like
there's something wrong.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:27.490
But in any case, you don't
need to pull very hard in order

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:32.590
to get even a micron-size
object to go rather fast.

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:35.400
Yes?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.275
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.210
JEFF GORE: Oh, I'm
not aware of it.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.410
This thing can actually
go-- it's 10 microns long,

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.020
so this thing is huge, actually.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:48.580
But I--

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.163
AUDIENCE: It's
probably just a repeat.

00:20:52.927 --> 00:20:54.859
Or even if it is
a repeat, you can

00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:56.308
[INAUDIBLE] I'd
just be surprised

00:20:56.308 --> 00:20:58.740
if it wasn't, since
it seems like that.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.120
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
so I don't know,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.072
but I'm not even sure if
that would necessarily

00:21:03.072 --> 00:21:05.030
address my concern, which
is it seems like they

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.480
have to go through each other.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.530
But it's not true, so I don't
want to make the argument too

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.350
strongly.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.030
Did you have a question?

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.973
AUDIENCE: So I was just
thinking about this [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:15.973 --> 00:21:20.410
Might it be possible that
they, if they are all sync up

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.360
their rotations, then it doesn't
matter how tangled they are?

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.390
JEFF GORE: Yeah, no,
even-- even if they're all

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.030
spinning at the exact
same rate, I still

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.690
feel that they
should get tangled,

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.960
but it's a feeling that
is apparently not true.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.514
So I don't want to--

00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:41.570
AUDIENCE: But if they're always
tumbling, maybe the time to--

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.370
JEFF GORE: No, no, no,
wait-- so it's not-- no,

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:49.076
the tumble is not due to
my supposed mechanism.

00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:50.950
They're spinning at
something like 100 hertz.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.120
The motors are spinning at
something like 100 hertz,

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:53.290
right?

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.290
So in principle, if they
were going to get tangled,

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.498
they would've gotten tangled.

00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:57.700
AUDIENCE: Seems [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.283
JEFF GORE: That's
right, that's right.

00:22:04.042 --> 00:22:05.500
I do want to just
come back and say

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.120
one thing about this
question of a rotary motor,

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.108
because it's a fascinating
question-- oh yes, go ahead.

00:22:11.108 --> 00:22:12.983
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I just
had a quick question.

00:22:12.983 --> 00:22:15.290
What was the units of eta again?

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:20.267
JEFF GORE: Oh,
this is the thing.

00:22:20.267 --> 00:22:22.100
The units of eta, I
always just go back here

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.558
and I say, OK,
well, it's the units

00:22:23.558 --> 00:22:28.890
of a force divided by unit of
an area-- or sorry, of a radius,

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:34.890
unit of a velocity, and then
I have to plug everything in.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.780
And then, I have to find an
equation with a force other

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.670
than this equation, because if
you put this equation back in,

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.836
then you don't get anywhere.

00:22:43.332 --> 00:22:44.040
These are useful.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.760
So I always have to actually
figure it out fresh each time.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.710
So it turns out that these
are indeed rotary motors.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:04.380
And I think that this was
actually the first-- as far

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.760
as I'm aware, it's the first
example of a rotary motor

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.320
in biology that had
been demonstrated,

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.520
which is a fascinating idea
because in human engineering,

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.535
rotary motors are everywhere.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.630
Yet somehow, if you
look at living things,

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.120
they don't seem to
have rotary motors.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:37.840
Now, anybody want to suggest
why rotary motors might be rare

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.210
in biology, in life?

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.210
AUDIENCE: Rotary is just
that it rotates, right,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.575
not in terms of a mechanism
[INAUDIBLE] because there's

00:23:46.575 --> 00:23:49.129
also [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:49.129 --> 00:23:51.420
JEFF GORE: Well, I guess I'm
thinking of something that

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.580
can continuously rotate, right?

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:59.140
It's true that if you look
at-- we have ball socket joints

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.240
and I can rotate them a
little bit, but certainly,

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.294
I can't go-- there
are limits, right?

00:24:05.294 --> 00:24:06.960
And this is a pretty
striking difference

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.730
between human engineering
and biological engineering.

00:24:14.094 --> 00:24:14.594
Yeah?

00:24:14.594 --> 00:24:17.975
AUDIENCE: If you tried to
connect anything across this,

00:24:17.975 --> 00:24:19.270
it would be more [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.270
JEFF GORE: That's right.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:21.560
JEFF GORE: That's right.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.750
The problem is you
just can't have

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:23.958
anything connected across it.

00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:27.420
Otherwise, you really
do get tangled, right?

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.430
Now, the question
then is, well, why

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.020
is it that it's possible
to do that here then?

00:24:36.145 --> 00:24:38.020
AUDIENCE: Because we're
at such a small scale

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.583
that we're not thinking of
connecting anything else.

00:24:40.583 --> 00:24:43.421
We're individual
molecules, anyway.

00:24:43.421 --> 00:24:45.214
There's nothing that
can go through that.

00:24:45.214 --> 00:24:46.630
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.470
And this is how I think
about it that well,

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.940
at the molecular scale, you
just have some rotary something

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.520
and it doesn't
have to be attached

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.590
via, say, covalent
bonds or whatnot.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.960
And you can then force
something to rotate.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.540
Of course, it's a little
bit funny because this issue

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.090
about connecting across
this rotation, that

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.780
should be a problem for
human engineering, as well,

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.330
but somehow, we
do get around it.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.100
I guess what I would
say is I don't have

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:20.140
any comments, except for this
was then quite a surprise when

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.010
it was discovered that this was
a rotor motor, just because we

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:28.130
had not seen any in other
macroscopic living things.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.270
So then, it was quite
exciting to see it

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.470
in the case of the
flagellar motor.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.490
And in your book,
you'll see that there's

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.000
a very nice kind of EM
reconstruction of this motor

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.610
and you can see how
it's hinged and it's

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.520
powered by proton gradients
that kind of cause this thing

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.030
to rotate.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.933
It's really a beautiful,
amazing thing.

00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:51.930
Does anybody know any other
examples of rotary motors?

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.310
That's right.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:00.650
The other really famous one
is the F0F1 ATP synthase,

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:04.240
which is, again, something
that's across a membrane

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.130
and has, once again, a really
beautiful structure where

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.482
it has this circular thing
in the membrane that rotates,

00:26:11.482 --> 00:26:13.065
responds to, again,
a proton gradient,

00:26:13.065 --> 00:26:16.040
and then that drives
rotation of this other part

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.320
of the protein, F1.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.730
And then, that makes ATP.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.840
And that motor is amazing
also because it's reversible,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:30.550
in that the cell can also
burn ATP and drive a proton

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.490
gradient.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.085
And indeed, in some
single-molecule experiments,

00:26:34.085 --> 00:26:35.460
they've even done
something where

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:42.040
they attached a little
magnetic particle onto this F1

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.050
and then rotated themselves.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.530
And they showed that they
could actually make ATP.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.720
The efficiency was maybe not
great, something like that,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.700
because they're rotating
a macroscopic magnet

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.670
and then they're
making ATPs there.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.390
But it's a pretty
remarkable aspect

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.620
of these molecular motors.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.820
Now in this class,
we're not going

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.870
to say anything more
about molecular motors,

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.520
but I just wanted to mention
a few things about them

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.590
because they're really
fun, beautiful things

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.494
and there are other
classes that are

00:27:16.494 --> 00:27:18.952
at MIT that may give you an
opportunity to think about them

00:27:18.952 --> 00:27:19.680
some more.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.675
Any question about
where we are now?

00:27:25.675 --> 00:27:26.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.158
JEFF GORE: The common motor?

00:27:32.158 --> 00:27:34.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.320
JEFF GORE: Oh.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.030
Well, I'd say that the
other class of motors

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.930
that are seen a
lot in the context

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.850
of these molecular
motors are motors that

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.140
travel along linear tracks.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.400
So there's kinesin that
walks along microtubules.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.780
There are various myosins
that walk on actin.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.040
And then, of course,
DNA and RNA polymerase,

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.748
we don't normally
think of them as motors

00:27:56.748 --> 00:27:58.820
but indeed, they
take an energy fuel

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.780
and then they have to
walk along the template

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.600
as they make either
the DNA or the RNA.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.540
So I'd say there are many, many
examples of molecular motors

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.260
that convert chemical
energy into mechanical force

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.200
and motion, particularly
along one-dimensional tracks.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.780
So those, I think, are the
most well-studied examples.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.630
Now, one way to study
this run and tumble motion

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.560
is, of course, to
actually apply a gradient

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.620
and then watch the
cells as they swim it.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.966
And that has been done.

00:28:44.966 --> 00:28:46.840
A lot's been learned
from that kind of assay,

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.020
but it turns out that there
are two other assays that maybe

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:55.610
allowed for more
controlled analysis

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.580
of this chemotaxis
kind of response.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.860
So let's just say-- so
studying chemotaxis.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:13.930
The most obvious thing
is to apply a gradient

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:14.660
and then watch.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.310
And indeed, the
classic assays where

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:25.550
you add a little pipette with
an attractant or a repellent

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.840
and watch the bacteria
swim toward or away,

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.379
that demonstrates there
is indeed chemotaxis.

00:29:30.379 --> 00:29:32.170
But it's a little bit
difficult to quantify

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.540
that process in many cases.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:39.095
What are the assays that maybe
you've read about recently?

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.200
In [? Yuri's ?] book, how is
it that they actually analyzed

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.600
this perfect adaptation?

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.210
Yes?

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:05.530
AUDIENCE: So you can bind the
flagella on the slide and then

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.470
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:11.570
JEFF GORE: So one thing
that you can do is you can--

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:12.410
I may put it here.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:12.910
All right.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:18.695
So you can kind of attach
the cell to a slide.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.275
And typically attach it
to the slide by what?

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.350
This isn't it.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.465
And does it matter where you
attach the cell to the slide?

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:35.830
AUDIENCE: By the flagella.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:36.530
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
so you typically

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.488
have attach it via this
hook that's at the end,

00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:41.050
so by some part of the
flagella-- to the slide

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:45.190
by the flagella, we'll say.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.010
Flagellum?

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:49.600
Flagella-- whatever.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.430
And the nice thing there is that
as the cell is doing its thing

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.010
and it's spinning either
clockwise or counterclockwise,

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.760
you can directly visualize
that because the whole cell is

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.510
moving.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:07.710
And the cell is both the
thing that is doing the work

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.560
and processing the
signals and everything,

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.270
but it's also your
marker for what the state

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.910
of this little hook is, right?

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.400
This is a wonderfully
quantitative assay where you

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.480
can get high time resolution.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.560
It's easy to do
the image analysis.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:28.267
And then, how do you typically
get this cell to change its,

00:31:28.267 --> 00:31:29.600
for example, tumbling frequency?

00:31:35.034 --> 00:31:36.516
AUDIENCE: Put an attractant.

00:31:36.516 --> 00:31:38.637
JEFF GORE: Right, so you
can add an attractant.

00:31:38.637 --> 00:31:40.970
And indeed, I just wanted to
separate this a little bit,

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.997
because you can-- even
without doing this--

00:31:42.997 --> 00:31:45.080
this is kind of the next
order step-- you can just

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:53.390
add an attractant and
mix, because you don't

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.440
want the spatial patterns.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.425
But a nice thing here,
this is a gradient in space

00:31:59.425 --> 00:32:01.900
and then you can watch
the bacteria swim.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.920
But you can also have
the gradient in time.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.665
And the cells can't
tell the difference.

00:32:05.665 --> 00:32:07.540
The nice thing here is
that you can then just

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.810
add the attractant,
mix, and then

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.730
you just watch all the
cells as they're going.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.665
You don't need to try to
follow them or whatnot,

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:16.290
but you can just look to see how
the tumbling frequency changes

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:16.790
over time.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.340
And of course, you would
typically use this trick

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.192
together with this in order to
study perfect adaptation and so

00:32:26.192 --> 00:32:28.330
forth.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.890
If you collect this sort of
data and you plot the tumbling

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:43.560
frequency as a function of
time, what you might see

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:48.410
is that it starts out
at one per second.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:33:02.845
Now, if at this time,
I add an attractant,

00:33:02.845 --> 00:33:06.350
does the tumbling
frequency go up or down?

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.940
And we're going to
do a verbal answer.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:08.439
Ready?

00:33:08.439 --> 00:33:10.286
Three, two, one.

00:33:10.286 --> 00:33:10.910
AUDIENCE: Down.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:11.860
JEFF GORE: Down.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.900
And that makes sense
because the cells

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.750
think that they're moving
up an attractant gradient.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:23.550
So over a very short time scale,
tumbling frequency goes down.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:31.320
But then, over a time
scale of minutes--

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:36.090
it might be 5, 10 minutes--
that tumbling frequency

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.900
goes back to where it started.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.360
I just want to--
this varies, but this

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.670
could be order of 10 minutes.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.198
AUDIENCE: Why is it so long?

00:33:46.198 --> 00:33:47.590
JEFF GORE: Yeah.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.690
AUDIENCE: 10 minutes
is a very long time.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.380
JEFF GORE: Yeah, it's
a long time scale.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.880
And here's a question.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.530
Is it because this
is the time that it

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.500
takes to make new protein?

00:34:06.606 --> 00:34:07.980
New protein
synthesis, we'll say.

00:34:20.277 --> 00:34:22.026
AUDIENCE: You're asking
if that's the time

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:24.150
or if that's the
reason why is it long?

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.760
JEFF GORE: I'm saying is this
the explanation for why this

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.020
is 10 minutes,
because the cell has

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.550
to go make new protein
in order to do this?

00:34:40.695 --> 00:34:43.320
So the cell is presumably going
to be making some new proteins,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.489
but is this what
you would really

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.800
describe as being the causative
agent of this thing taking 10,

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.540
20 minutes?

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.130
Ready?

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.790
Three, two, one.

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:01.130
All right.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.260
So I'd say most people are
agreeing that actually,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.750
yes, it is.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:05.700
The answer is no.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.929
This is not.

00:35:06.929 --> 00:35:09.220
It may be the case that the
cell is making new protein,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.000
but this is not what's
setting the time scale there.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.000
Is--

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.824
AUDIENCE: More [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:19.824 --> 00:35:22.010
JEFF GORE: Right.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.320
You agreed that that was the
answer, but you didn't-- well,

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.760
so I would say there are several
ways you can think about this,

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.400
but we're going to go through
the model that is supported

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.566
by, I think, a fair amount
of experimental evidence.

00:35:33.566 --> 00:35:36.440
But the key feature there
is that in this model,

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:41.210
it works even if all the
protein concentrations are

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:43.780
constant over time.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.790
So everything that's
happening in this network

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.150
is happening as a
result of changes

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.370
of the states of the protein.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.350
So proteins are either getting
methylated or phosphorylated

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:56.620
and these-- right.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.100
But then, of course,
it's the question of,

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:06.980
why is it 10 minutes instead
of 10 seconds or a minute?

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.960
AUDIENCE: You need a
[INAUDIBLE] in there

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.167
that's on the order of minutes,
like 100 minutes, which

00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:14.900
is very slow.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.760
Is there--

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:23.300
JEFF GORE: Yeah, well,
their one question is, this

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.850
is what is called
the adaptation time.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.890
Now, is this a robust
feature in this model

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.496
or in the cells,
for that matter?

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.910
We'll just add
verbal, yes or no.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:40.520
Ready?

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.939
Three, two, one,

00:36:42.939 --> 00:36:43.480
AUDIENCE: No.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.063
JEFF GORE: No.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.570
Now, and what that
means is that indeed,

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:52.860
different kind of
versions of this network

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.450
will have different times.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.930
And there is data looking
at variation in this

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.890
between different cells.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:04.960
And I guess I don't have
a clear feeling for what

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.880
would be optimal, in the sense
of allowing optimal climbing up

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.620
of an attractant gradient.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.920
This thing has to be much
longer than the typical times

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.660
for a tumble.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.980
Otherwise, it's
not even-- well, we

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.440
wouldn't have been able
to measure it, I guess.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.279
But I agree that it could
have been one minute

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:29.695
and I wouldn't
have batted an eye,

00:37:29.695 --> 00:37:31.778
in the sense that I don't
have any feeling for why

00:37:31.778 --> 00:37:34.720
it had to have been
this or something else.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.312
But somebody who
actually studies this

00:37:36.312 --> 00:37:37.895
might be able to
give a better answer.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.231
All right.

00:37:45.231 --> 00:37:47.636
AUDIENCE: But I guess--
sorry, just one last thing.

00:37:47.636 --> 00:37:49.580
My question is not
why it's 10 minutes.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.500
It's not an
evolutionary question,

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.900
like why is it useful, right?

00:37:53.900 --> 00:38:00.020
It's just somehow, [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.959
JEFF GORE: Yeah I
think that there

00:38:01.959 --> 00:38:03.500
are different ways
of looking at this

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.208
and then depending on
how you look at it,

00:38:05.208 --> 00:38:07.050
you either feel
surprised or not.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:15.520
So it's a little--
now on the other hand,

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.980
if you had added
a repellent, then

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.135
the tumbling frequency
would actually go up

00:38:19.135 --> 00:38:21.340
and then come back down.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:26.087
But the key, key
thing in this system

00:38:26.087 --> 00:38:27.670
that we want to focus
our attention on

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:32.810
is the fact that it comes
back to where it started.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.980
So it's the fact that I can
draw this dashed line that

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.245
is this perfect adaptation.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:54.349
And so what we want
to do is understand

00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:56.140
where this phenomenon
of perfect adaptation

00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:01.829
comes from and maybe why
it is robust to changes

00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:03.620
in, for example, the
concentrations of some

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.369
of these proteins.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:12.320
Now, let's just
make sure that we're

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.920
all on the same page in
terms of what was known

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.280
about this chemotaxis network.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.150
And I think it's worth
mentioning, perhaps, here

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:29.070
that the whole series of
studies of bacterial chemotaxis

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:31.010
going back to Howard
Berg and company

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:34.130
and then later, the
studies that in robustness

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:37.370
that Uri Alon and Stan
Leibler and Naama Barkai did.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:41.730
I think they represent really
just a wonderfully beautiful

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.740
exploration at the interface
between physics and biology.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.790
I think you could teach
an entire course just

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.400
on bacterial chemotaxis and
you could hit pretty much

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.530
all the major themes in
biophysics over the last 40

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:55.300
years.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.876
It's really amazing to me.

00:39:57.876 --> 00:39:59.750
I myself have not done
any work in the field,

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:03.090
but from afar, I've really
just admired the beauty

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.860
of all these studies.

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.225
And because you go back
to Howard Berg and Purcell

00:40:09.225 --> 00:40:12.910
and they're thinking about
how simple physics can inform

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.340
the challenges that
bacteria are facing

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.790
and how cells are actually
able to do a biased random walk

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:23.300
and get anywhere, limits on
sensing both concentrations

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.250
and gradients-- and
then later, the studies

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.360
that they're this
topic of robustness,

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.990
it's really a
wonderful example where

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.770
Naama Barkai, when she was
a postdoc at Stan Leibler,

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:39.097
they had published a Nature
paper in maybe '97 basically

00:40:39.097 --> 00:40:41.680
saying, this idea of robustness
is really important in biology

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:47.260
and in order to have a robust
response of perfect adaptation,

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.130
a model has to have
these features.

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.170
So there's no experiments
there, but their model

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.810
was guided by
previous observations

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.320
that people had made.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.990
And then, two years
later, Uri, when

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.290
he was a postdoc in
Stan's lab again,

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.510
did kind of the
experimental confirmation

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.431
of the model, where
he went in and he

00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:07.972
controlled the
concentration of chi R

00:41:07.972 --> 00:41:11.080
and showed that thee key
predictions of the model, i.e.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.140
the perfect adaptation, would
be robust to the concentration

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.390
but that the tumbling frequency
and the adaptation time, they

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.224
would not be robust to
chi R concentrations.

00:41:19.224 --> 00:41:20.640
They would move
in a way predicted

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.879
by the model and all that.

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:24.170
It's really amazing that it
all kind of holds together,

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:29.860
because in many cases, we do
the modeling kind of post facto,

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.360
right?

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.280
And then, it's kind of
explaining our results.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.216
But the case where a
model is really useful

00:41:36.216 --> 00:41:38.090
is when it makes new
predictions that get you

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.940
to go make new measurements.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.385
And this is a
situation where there

00:41:43.385 --> 00:41:46.010
are an infinite number of
experiments that you could do,

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.770
but only some of them
will actually provide you

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.610
a deep insight into
the mechanisms that

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.000
are going on in the system.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.650
And I think this was a real
case where the models made

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.550
some really clear predictions
and that allowed, in this case,

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:01.742
Uri to go and make the strains
that allowed him to test

00:42:01.742 --> 00:42:02.950
the predictions of the model.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:07.330
And I think it's really amazing
that it all kind of works.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:07.830
All right.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:11.670
Now, all of the letters
that you see up there,

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:14.190
they're not actually-- well,
first of all, the letters

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.840
are somehow real.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.280
This is the real names
of the protein components

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.160
in the chemotaxis
network in E. coli

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.350
and largely in other organisms.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:29.190
But in each case, there's a
chi that comes in front, right?

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:33.690
So R corresponds to
chi R, for example.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.940
And then, there's
chi B, chi W, chi A.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:40.640
And these were all identified
by genetics, so then

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.890
by researchers looking
for mutants that

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:47.620
were defective in chemotaxis.

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.586
I don't know what
happened to C, D, E, F, G,

00:42:51.586 --> 00:42:54.210
because it does seem like we got
the first part of the alphabet

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.626
and the last part
of the alphabet.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:00.024
I don't know.

00:43:00.024 --> 00:43:01.010
All right.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.820
Now, the basic
idea in the system

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:11.810
is that you have chi W/A that
we often here will refer to as X

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:13.290
just for simplicity.

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:17.800
Now, these are proteins
in the membrane,

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.700
so they have a binding
kind of pocket outside

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.640
that will allow binding of
attractants or repellents.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.390
There might be say,
five different kinds

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:31.530
of these receptor
complexes that can sense,

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:34.160
that bind at different rates,
different kinds of attractants,

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.410
repellents, and then the
signal is somehow integrated.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:44.950
Now, this could be either an
attractant or a repellant.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.900
The distinction
between these two

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.440
is that we get different
levels of methylation

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.008
onto chi W. Now in
this lecture, we're

00:43:57.008 --> 00:43:59.250
only going to be talking
about the methylated state

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.070
versus the unmethylated.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.860
But in reality, depending on
the receptor complex they have,

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.460
they might have four or five
different methylation sites.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.290
And this ability to switch
between different methylation

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:13.920
states is really at the
heart of the phenomenon

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.390
of robust perfect adaptation.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:24.415
The base feature in it, though,
is that chi A can phosphorylate

00:44:24.415 --> 00:44:30.840
chi Y and chi Y will then
go and yield the output,

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:36.084
which is in this case,
increased tumbling frequency.

00:44:36.084 --> 00:44:38.000
But there are lots of
other bells and whistles

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.490
that you can see on here, right?

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.520
So of course, it's not just
that this phosphorylated

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.510
chi Y just kind of
comes off on its own,

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:49.080
but rather it's
actually done by chi Z.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.971
So there's a
constant cycling here

00:44:50.971 --> 00:44:52.720
and again, there's a
constant cycling here

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:57.300
where the methyl groups are
taken off and then put back on.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.950
So if you look at
this, you really

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.720
do feel that it's
rather wasteful,

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.910
because there's a huge number
of these futile cycles going on.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.820
Chi Y is always kind of
being phosphorylated and then

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:12.670
dephosphorylated and this is all
going to be costly to the cell.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.437
So you can imagine
then the only reason

00:45:14.437 --> 00:45:16.520
it's there is because it's
doing something useful.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:24.690
Now, there was a
comment in the chapter

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:29.520
about what is the rate
limiting step in all this.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.300
And can somebody
remember what it was?

00:45:50.849 --> 00:45:51.349
Yeah?

00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:52.515
AUDIENCE: Is it methylation?

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.470
JEFF GORE: So methylation,
there is a sense

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:00.100
that that is actually
the longest time scale,

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.610
but I guess because
the methylation

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.300
is what results in
this thing coming

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.620
in the perfect adaptation
over this 10 minutes.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.610
I guess what I meant-- so yeah,
that is the longest time scale.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.860
But I guess what I was
thinking about in rate limiting

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.870
is the sense of when
the cell finds itself

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:18.140
in a new environment,
it changes its state

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.790
over a much shorter time scale.

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.720
So this thing I drew is
almost vertical, right?

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.640
So this question is, if
the cell finds itself

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.670
in a new environment suddenly
and then it just really

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:33.900
wants to tumble-- so you find
yourself in a crappy bar,

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.980
how long does it take
for you to get out?

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.693
Now, what's going to
be rate limiting there?

00:46:38.693 --> 00:46:39.193
Yeah?

00:46:39.193 --> 00:46:41.840
AUDIENCE: Phospho--
phosphorylation.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.000
JEFF GORE:
Phosphorylation, yeah,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.530
although it turns out that's
not the rate limiting step.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.780
And this actually comes back
a little bit to something

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.170
that we talked about in
the first part of the class

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.590
that in these
transcription networks,

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:58.907
the characteristic
timescale is what?

00:46:58.907 --> 00:46:59.406
AUDIENCE: G.

00:46:59.406 --> 00:47:01.350
JEFF GORE: Right.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.224
So the characteristic timescale
in the case of transcription

00:47:04.224 --> 00:47:05.765
networks is the time
it takes for you

00:47:05.765 --> 00:47:08.330
to change concentrations of
proteins, which is kind of cell

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.910
generation time or if you
have active degradation,

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:14.120
you might be able to make it
faster, whereas all of this

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.930
is happening rather
quickly, say,

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:18.540
maybe 1/10 tenth of a second.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.434
And a lot of these kinds of
processes, binding, unbinding,

00:47:22.434 --> 00:47:23.850
and actually even
the interactions

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.350
between the proteins
can take place

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.000
even maybe faster than that.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.230
So the actual rate limiting step
for when the cell finds itself

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.357
in a bad environment
for it to start tumbling

00:47:34.357 --> 00:47:35.565
is actually due to diffusion.

00:47:35.565 --> 00:47:36.820
And that's diffusion of what?

00:47:40.047 --> 00:47:41.891
AUDIENCE: Y protein.

00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.790
JEFF GORE: Yeah, diffusion of
the phosphorylated Y, right?

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:52.097
And that's because we
have the cells here.

00:47:52.097 --> 00:47:53.930
They find themselves
in the bad environment.

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:58.670
They rapidly bind the
repellent or they quickly

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:02.350
phosphorylate chi
Y. But then, Y is

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.020
going to be formed
at one of the poles,

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.894
because actually, there's
actually clustering

00:48:05.894 --> 00:48:08.260
of these receptors at
the poles of a cell

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.370
and incidentally, we're not
going to talk about that here,

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:15.880
but I think there's strong
experimental and theoretical

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.810
evidence that this actually
increases the sensitivity.

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:22.260
And indeed, people have used
simple Ising type models

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.710
to try to understand how the
coupling between the binding

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:28.530
of repellents on what's
essentially almost

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:31.410
like a crystalline
array of receptors

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:33.592
can allow the array
to better than you

00:48:33.592 --> 00:48:34.800
build it to as an individual.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.580
We're not going to get into
that here, but in any case,

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.210
there's receptors
at the poles-- I

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.000
don't know if it's
both poles or one pole,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.630
but one of the
poles of the other--

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:48.120
and that's where chi
Y is phosphorylated.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.500
But then, you can see that
these flagella are distributed

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.400
all around the cell.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.040
So you have to diffuse
from say, the pole

00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:00.090
to the site of
the flagella motor

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:04.870
in order to cause it to go
clockwise and then cause

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.066
a tumble.

00:49:06.066 --> 00:49:06.565
Yeah?

00:49:06.565 --> 00:49:08.350
AUDIENCE: So do you
need only one motor?

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:09.891
JEFF GORE: Yeah, so
you actually only

00:49:09.891 --> 00:49:13.298
need one motor to
get the tumbling.

00:49:13.298 --> 00:49:15.464
And so then, you may not
have to diffuse all the way

00:49:15.464 --> 00:49:19.600
to the other end, but-- and of
course, diffusion is random.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:24.350
And we all know that 0.1
seconds is around the time

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.240
that it takes for a
protein-sized object

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.580
to diffuse across the
volume of a bacterial cell.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.670
We did that calculation
a couple weeks ago.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:36.640
So 0.1 seconds is indeed--
so the rate limiting step

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.620
is indeed this step
right here, which

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:48.839
is diffusion of chi Y, the
phosphorylated version of it.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.180
All right.

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:59.290
Now, we may not get too
much into the models

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:01.430
here, because you
did read about them.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:05.460
But I will just
kind of sketch out

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.510
sort of what you might call
the fine-tuned model and then

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:12.890
the key assumption that
goes into this robust model.

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:22.100
Now, what both models
assume and indeed

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.260
what was known
from previous work

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:31.420
was that chi R is
present at small number.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:36.800
So chi R, there might be around
100 proteins in the cell.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:47.170
And what does this mean
about the activity of chi R?

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.226
What is the other word for it?

00:50:51.226 --> 00:50:52.975
It doesn't actually
have to quite mean it,

00:50:52.975 --> 00:50:56.285
but what is it that-- how--

00:50:56.285 --> 00:50:57.332
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:57.332 --> 00:50:58.290
JEFF GORE: What's that?

00:50:58.290 --> 00:50:59.797
AUDIENCE: [? High ?] saturation.

00:50:59.797 --> 00:51:01.380
JEFF GORE: So yeah,
something is high.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:08.020
And what is typically assumed is
that chi R acts at saturation,

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:17.940
chi R. But what do we mean by
"saturation" in these models?

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.112
AUDIENCE: Maximum.

00:51:23.112 --> 00:51:23.820
JEFF GORE: Right.

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.980
Does it mean that
if we add more chi

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:29.620
R than the rate of methylation,
it doesn't increase?

00:51:33.269 --> 00:51:35.310
And I should have put a
little methyl group here.

00:51:46.022 --> 00:51:47.480
There are multiple
things you might

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:52.000
mean by "acts at saturation."

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.800
And in the models that
you read about last night,

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.300
is what it means that if we
increase the number of chi R

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.090
that it doesn't change
the rate of methylation?

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:01.630
Yes or no?

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:02.130
Ready?

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:04.329
Three, two, one.

00:52:04.329 --> 00:52:04.870
AUDIENCE: No.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:06.259
JEFF GORE: No.

00:52:06.259 --> 00:52:08.550
And what they mean is something
rather different, which

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:12.235
is that if we plot or if
we calculate the change

00:52:12.235 --> 00:52:14.540
in the concentration
of the methylated X--

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:19.980
now, we're calling this
whole thing Xm, methylated X,

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:25.760
and this is just X.
The assumption is

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:32.950
that we have X is
being methylated

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:38.830
at a rate that is-- there's
no Michaelis-Menten term.

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:43.215
If we were to write this
as it not being saturated,

00:52:43.215 --> 00:52:44.090
what is it acting on?

00:52:49.348 --> 00:52:51.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:55.370
JEFF GORE: Yeah, it's
not the methylated x.

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:58.430
So indeed, if we
were to write this,

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:03.220
we're assuming that this is
at saturation, as they say.

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:06.105
But any time that you
see something like this,

00:53:06.105 --> 00:53:07.560
you have to ask,
well, what would

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.166
be the alternative, right?

00:53:09.166 --> 00:53:10.790
And the alternative
would be to include

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:16.030
a term that looks kind of like
just X over some K plus X,

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:21.940
because R is acting
on the unmethylated X.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.200
We're not including that.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.490
What that means is that we're
assuming that this thing is

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:32.520
saturated, that the
concentration of X to be acted

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:38.077
on is significantly larger than
the Michaelis constant there.

00:53:38.077 --> 00:53:40.160
And of course, this is
related to the amount of R,

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.620
because as we get
more and more R,

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:48.220
then eventually, we'll
remove some of this X

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:51.160
and then we'll get into
the non-saturated regime.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.850
So these two statements
are related, but not

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:54.620
the same thing.

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:07.420
Now, there's also some rate that
the phosphorylated version of B

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:13.456
removes the methyl groups
and that's indeed just going

00:54:13.456 --> 00:54:14.705
to be this Michaelis constant.

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:24.410
And this is going to be
for the fine-tuned model.

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:29.730
The robust model
looks very similar,

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:37.220
but this is the simplest kind
of manifestation of this model.

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.380
Now, once we're
writing this down,

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.890
it's useful to make
sure that we can

00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:42.420
keep track of what's
actually happening

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.003
over the course of
perfect adaptation.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:52.170
So now, let's imagine first
that an attractant arrives.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:00.490
That's going to change
the activity of X.

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:02.380
And when we say
"activity," what we mean

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:07.124
is the rate that's it's going
to phosphorylate both B and Y.

00:55:07.124 --> 00:55:09.290
So let's just make sure
that we know this direction.

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:10.950
So we add an attractant.

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:19.111
We'll say "add."

00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:19.860
What does this do?

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.575
Does it make activity
go up or down?

00:55:29.759 --> 00:55:31.300
I'll give you 15
seconds to make sure

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.635
that you kind of understand
the workings of this network.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:56.230
This is activity of X,
this complex X. All right.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:59.075
Do you need more time?

00:55:59.075 --> 00:55:59.574
All right.

00:55:59.574 --> 00:56:00.510
Let's see where we are.

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:01.010
Ready?

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:05.251
Three, two, one.

00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:05.750
All right.

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:06.830
So we got a majority
of the group

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.445
is saying that it
should go down.

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:14.420
Well, let's just
follow the logic.

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.210
So we imagine an
attractant binding.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.740
If the activity goes
down, that means

00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.870
that we get less of
the phosphorylated chi

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:28.450
Y. That means we get less
propensity to tumbling,

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:31.536
which means that we
keep on going further.

00:56:31.536 --> 00:56:35.140
All right, that
sounds reasonable.

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:37.466
Any questions about that logic?

00:56:37.466 --> 00:56:39.006
Yes?

00:56:39.006 --> 00:56:39.881
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:43.962 --> 00:56:44.670
JEFF GORE: Right.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:47.010
So we haven't said
anything yet about BM.

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:48.920
That's what going
to happen next.

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.725
And that's actually
the slow time scale.

00:56:51.725 --> 00:56:53.100
So what we had in
here is that we

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.900
were kind of at this
steady-state tumbling

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:57.100
frequency of one per second.

00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.190
We add an attractant.

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:02.015
The tumbling frequency goes down
because of what we just said.

00:57:02.015 --> 00:57:04.140
But now, there's going to
be this longer time scale

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.780
process whereby we
get recovery, where

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.580
we come back to this
steady-state tumbling

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:10.250
frequency.

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:17.350
And that's going to
involve action on chi B.

00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:17.850
All right.

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:24.510
So what happens is that
the attractant causes less

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:26.680
of the phosphorylated
chi Y. But it's also

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:36.990
going to cause less of the
phosphorylated chi B. Now, that

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:40.294
means that we're going
to-- and remember,

00:57:40.294 --> 00:57:41.710
the phosphorylated
chi B is what's

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:43.010
removing the methyl groups.

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:50.000
So if we have less
flux going to the left,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.427
but we have the
same-- at that moment,

00:57:52.427 --> 00:57:54.760
we don't have any change in
the flux going to the right.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:59.780
So chi R is still acting on the
same unmethylated X's that it

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.670
was operating on before.

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:05.700
So it's the same flux to the
right, less flux to the left.

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:12.275
So there's a net accumulation of
the methylated receptor, which

00:58:12.275 --> 00:58:17.020
we are calling X. So the
key thing here is that--

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:20.650
and it's this
methylated receptor that

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:23.610
has more activity.

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:25.697
In this model, this
unmethylated version actually

00:58:25.697 --> 00:58:26.780
doesn't have any activity.

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.000
So then, if we get more of the
methylated X, then over time,

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.050
we get a buildup
of the methylated X

00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:38.267
and that causes the
activity to come back up.

00:58:41.224 --> 00:58:42.640
Now, of course,
there's a question

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.737
of-- I just said that
it comes back up,

00:58:44.737 --> 00:58:46.320
but I didn't say
that it comes back up

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:50.430
exactly to its original
tumbling frequency.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:54.040
I didn't say that it necessarily
displays perfect adaptation.

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.810
And that's because
in this model,

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:57.870
the perfect adaptation
arises as a result of what

00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:59.500
we call fine-tuning,
because it only

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:04.200
happens if all of the
parameters are just so.

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:07.740
In Uri's book, he describes
a typical condition

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.050
where that would be the case.

00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:10.690
And the problem is
that you can always

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:14.260
fine-tune for some
concentrations of everything,

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.720
chi R or chi this, chi that.

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.430
But then if the
concentrations change,

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:20.440
then you're no longer
fine-tuned correctly.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.200
You were fine-tuned
for a different world

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.780
and now you're not-- and
that's the definition of being

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:26.280
fine-tuned is that
if things change,

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.446
you're no longer fine-tuned.

00:59:27.446 --> 00:59:31.380
You're just finely
off-tune, right?

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:34.950
So this is the problem
with the fine-tuned model

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:37.030
is that you can get
it right for a given--

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:38.655
for given concentrations
of everything,

00:59:38.655 --> 00:59:41.030
you can always
find what numbers.

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:44.010
This is VB and
then there's going

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:49.960
to be-- you can talk about
the activities of XM given

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:52.210
the previous attractant
concentration and so on and so

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:54.030
forth, but it's not
going to be fine-tuned

00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:55.440
if you change
anything else, like

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.356
if you change concentration
of R, for example.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.520
And I'm happy to
go through the math

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.770
and so forth maybe after
class if anybody's curious,

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:09.170
but it's really
precisely what Uri did,

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:11.120
so maybe I won't
get into it now.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.090
But the question
then is, well, how

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:18.980
is it that you might
change this model in order

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.475
to make it robust?

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:29.850
And the change is somehow
surprisingly simple,

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:33.510
which is that what you want
is chi B, instead of just

01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:38.260
acting on any old
methylated X, you

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:43.982
want it to act only on
the methylated X that

01:00:43.982 --> 01:00:47.620
is in sort of in what we
would call this active state,

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:54.610
where it's actually
able to catalyze

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:57.000
either of those reactions.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.860
So the notion is that if you
have this methylated X, then

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.682
it's kind of over a
very fast time scale.

01:01:02.682 --> 01:01:04.890
It's switching between what
we call an "active" state

01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:05.820
and some inactive one.

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:08.720
And it's really only
in the active versions

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:15.640
that chi B is able to act on
and remove the methyl group.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.730
And this is on the one
hand a clever thing

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:23.650
that allows you to implement
this integral feedback.

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:26.406
On the other hand, it's a little
bit of like pulling a bunny out

01:01:26.406 --> 01:01:30.970
of a hat, because you feel
like, well, these things may

01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:32.820
be happening over
microsecond time scales.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:38.230
It's hard to know exactly--
how would you actually

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:41.160
experimentally confirm this
is precisely what's going on?

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.960
And I think that here, it's a
little bit subtle because you

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.900
could maybe show that indeed
the rate of this demethylation

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:55.730
is proportional to
the activity here,

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:57.591
but you don't
necessarily have access

01:01:57.591 --> 01:01:59.840
to all of the molecular
dynamics that are taking place

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.920
over microsecond time scales.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:08.174
So I think that you can do
measurements that give you

01:02:08.174 --> 01:02:10.090
confidence that this is
maybe what's going on,

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:14.550
but you can't quite
100% nail it because

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:16.875
of the nature of these
molecular fluctuations.

01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:33.765
So the idea there
is that if we say

01:02:33.765 --> 01:02:35.140
that there's this
rapid shuttling

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.510
between the so-called
"active" and "inactive"

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:40.250
methylated guys-- so this
is indicating that it's

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:47.230
what we call "active," able
to catalyze this and this--

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.150
then this ends up
being equivalent

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:53.619
to integral feedback,
where you'll always

01:02:53.619 --> 01:02:54.577
get perfect adaptation.

01:03:00.538 --> 01:03:01.038
Yeah?

01:03:01.038 --> 01:03:05.020
AUDIENCE: When you
put [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:08.340
JEFF GORE: So the idea is that
we imagine that we're this

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:12.640
receptor X. It's chi W, chi A.
Now whether it's-- let's say

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.280
it's bound to something.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.000
It still bound to an
attractant, right?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.697
The way that the attractant
influences its activity--

01:03:20.697 --> 01:03:22.530
and it has to influence
its activity if it's

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:25.040
going to do anything--
what we assume

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.699
is the way that it's doing
it is that it's changing

01:03:28.699 --> 01:03:30.240
the sort of fraction
of time that I'm

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.020
in some active conformation
where I can actually do work,

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.510
versus the inactive conformation
where I'm taking a break.

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:38.260
So when you get the
attractant and you

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.385
spend more of your time in
this active conformation

01:03:40.385 --> 01:03:43.510
where you're, in this case,
phosphorylating proteins,

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:46.090
and that's sort of the
mechanism through which

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:48.270
an attractant or a
repellent or whatnot

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:50.897
actually transmits its signal.

01:03:50.897 --> 01:03:52.355
And indeed, it has
to do something.

01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:00.360
Nothing that we're
discussing would work at all

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.700
if we don't allow the signal
to be transmitted somehow

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.842
through this receptor.

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:06.550
So there is this sense
that this activity

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:10.990
has to be a function of
the things out there.

01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:15.530
And the assumption that goes
into the perfect adaptation

01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:22.220
is really that the
rate of demethylation

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:28.445
is proportional to that
kind of active fraction.

01:04:28.445 --> 01:04:30.820
And then, you can argue about
how discrete these entities

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:33.856
have to be in order for the
mechanism to work and so forth,

01:04:33.856 --> 01:04:35.480
but certainly, there
has to be some way

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.280
that binding to an attractant
leads to what we decided

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.050
was less activity.

01:04:42.951 --> 01:04:43.451
Yeah?

01:04:43.451 --> 01:04:44.784
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

01:04:44.784 --> 01:04:46.874
So what's the relationship
between activity

01:04:46.874 --> 01:04:48.830
and methylation?

01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:49.808
Was it [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:56.780
JEFF GORE: So the idea is that
we're typically maybe assuming

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:59.330
that the unmethylated
guy has no activity,

01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:03.670
so it doesn't do any of
this phosphorylation,

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:07.290
whereas the methylated
guy has some activity.

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:12.710
And you can characterize
it by some rate of activity

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:14.580
or some fraction
of the time that it

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.118
is in this active state
that is doing something.

01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:27.240
Now, the question--
and indeed this

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:34.040
ends up-- well, you can see
here that in this model,

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.020
because you're directly
acting on the active XM, then

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.870
the steady-state
activity you can

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:47.520
get from just setting this equal
to zero and it's some number.

01:05:50.522 --> 01:05:51.980
But then, the
question is, how long

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.650
does it take to come back
to that steady state?

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:58.380
And that's where
we get differences

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:03.610
as a function of
concentration of chi R,

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.620
because what's
happening always is

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:10.310
that we have some kind
of cycle here where

01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:11.930
chi B is removing
the methyl groups,

01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:15.020
groups chi R is
adding them back.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.160
So you can imagine that
if you have more chi

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.412
R than a steady state, you get
more-- when you're moving right

01:06:21.412 --> 01:06:22.870
by a steady state,
you have to have

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:25.078
the same moving to the left,
because at steady state,

01:06:25.078 --> 01:06:25.910
it's equal.

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:28.775
So the more chi R you
have, the faster this thing

01:06:28.775 --> 01:06:31.860
is going around.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:35.190
And that means that the
more chi R that you have,

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:40.250
the more rapidly that you'll
get this perfect adaptation.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:44.670
So the experiment that Uri
did that I think is very nice

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:48.630
is he directly modulated
the amount of chi R

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.350
and he looked at
this adaptation time.

01:06:58.298 --> 01:07:01.440
And he found this
kind of came down,

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.860
whereas if you look at
the steady-state tumbling

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:16.560
frequency, this came
up, whereas the degree

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.510
of perfect adaptation,
say the ratio or the error

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:22.700
in this thing,
perfect adaptation

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:27.260
was always kind of correct, in
the sense it always came back

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.390
to its original value.

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:33.800
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:40.660
You say the [INAUDIBLE]
it only phosphorylates

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:48.500
chi B when an
attractant [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.907
Y [INAUDIBLE] attractant.

01:07:50.907 --> 01:07:51.490
JEFF GORE: No.

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.190
So the attractant
or repellent can

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:54.690
be combined to
either the methylated

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:55.898
or the non-methylated, right?

01:07:55.898 --> 01:08:00.730
AUDIENCE: But [INAUDIBLE]
only [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:05.027
phosphorylation of
chi B when [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:05.027 --> 01:08:05.610
JEFF GORE: No.

01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:11.170
So you're talking
about-- oh, OK.

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:14.730
So it's really that the
methylated state can

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:16.649
phosphorylate either
chi B or chi Y,

01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:20.260
but this is regardless whether
an attractant is bound or not.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.859
The attractant will influence
the rate or the activity

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:23.670
that this happens.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:46.130
And given this model, you can
see that you have more chi R,

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:50.910
then at steady state, you're
going to have more activity.

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:54.510
More activity corresponds
to more phosphorylated chi

01:08:54.510 --> 01:09:00.261
y and more tumbling,
so an increase

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.344
in the tumbling frequency.

01:09:04.487 --> 01:09:04.987
Yes?

01:09:04.987 --> 01:09:06.670
AUDIENCE: I guess
it's not clear to me

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:09.108
where the ligand concentration
actually come in.

01:09:09.108 --> 01:09:10.649
JEFF GORE: Where
which concentration?

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:12.107
AUDIENCE: The ligand
concentration.

01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:13.300
JEFF GORE: Oh, OK, yeah.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.441
AUDIENCE: Because
that's what [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:16.441 --> 01:09:17.399
JEFF GORE: Yeah, right.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:22.279
Yeah, so the idea here
is that if we start out

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:24.890
without any attractant--
so first of all,

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.020
so let's imagine
we're at steady state.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.210
There's no attractant
or little attractant

01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:31.859
now, where of course, the
fluxes to the left and the right

01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:32.460
are the same.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.029
So there's some
methylated, some not.

01:09:34.029 --> 01:09:37.692
AUDIENCE: No, but I agree the
mechanics of just in the actual

01:09:37.692 --> 01:09:39.576
to write an equation
for the ligands

01:09:39.576 --> 01:09:40.989
to come in like [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:43.462 --> 01:09:44.170
JEFF GORE: Right.

01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:48.300
So the idea is that when
you bind an attractant,

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:53.459
that's going to change the
activity of the methylated.

01:09:53.459 --> 01:09:55.000
So it's going to
change, for example,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.590
the fraction that are active.

01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:59.510
AUDIENCE: And
decreases the activity.

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.510
JEFF GORE: And it decreases
the activity, right.

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:03.250
AUDIENCE: And some
sort of signal--

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.120
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
there's some-- right.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.411
And of course, we haven't
specified what that function,

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:10.140
but the idea is that it leads
to a rapid decrease in activity,

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:13.010
which corresponds to a rapid
decrease in this fraction that

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:14.346
are active XM star.

01:10:19.116 --> 01:10:19.990
Does that make sense?

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.550
So the last thing I wanted
to do is say something

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:32.695
about what this means
for individuality.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.160
In particular, let's
imagine that we

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:46.130
have a clonal
population of bacteria.

01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:48.360
And the question
is, in what ways

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.284
will they be similar
or different?

01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:59.790
So now, we can just
imagine an experiment

01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:04.010
where I take a population
of cells with exactly

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:10.740
the same genetic code and I
go and I measure, for example,

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.910
the tumbling frequency
across this population.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:25.160
So we can talk about-- we
measure f1, f2, f3, fn--

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.980
so these are the tumbling
frequencies across n cells.

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:41.360
This is n we'll say
genetically identical cells.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.850
The question is, will we get
the same tumbling frequency

01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:55.820
or should these
things be the same?

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:58.880
And if not, why not?

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.440
So let's just do our
little votes, all right?

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.230
We have should they be the same
or should they be different.

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:08.790
All right.

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:10.770
Do you understand the question?

01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:11.270
Let's vote.

01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.940
Ready?

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.920
Three, two, one.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.480
All right.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.480
Well, OK, so at least
the majority of people

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.980
are saying they
should be different.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.313
And why might that be, somebody?

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.552
AUDIENCE: We might
have [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:28.552 --> 01:12:29.260
JEFF GORE: Right.

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:31.710
For example, we
might have variation

01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:41.700
in the concentration
of chi R. Now,

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.820
this variation is sort
of a natural result

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.320
of just fluctuating
this or that, right?

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.830
But it's a little bit similar
to the experiment Uri did,

01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:52.630
where he actually in
this case has actually

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:56.640
put chi R under the control of
an inducible promoter, where

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.240
he could just add IPDG
and drive expression

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.354
and then just measure
the mean of these things

01:13:01.354 --> 01:13:02.270
across the population.

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:07.140
But even if you try to have
everything be the same,

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.790
you'll have some
variation, which

01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:15.050
we found for small numbers
of proteins could be large.

01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:19.200
So that variation
will transmit itself

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.080
into variations in both
the adaptation time

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.282
and the tumbling frequency.

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:31.800
And this is indeed was
observed as early as 1976.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.930
So there's a paper
in Nature in 1976

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:39.510
by Jim Spudich and Dan Koshland.

01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:41.740
So Spudich went on
to study a number

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:43.330
of these molecular motors.

01:13:43.330 --> 01:13:48.100
In particular, he studied
many of these myosins.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:53.070
But he wrote this classic paper
in '76 called "Non-genetic

01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:56.560
individuality, chance
in the single cell."

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:02.300
What he did is they looked at
many different individual cells

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:05.170
using a few of those techniques
that I told you about.

01:14:05.170 --> 01:14:07.600
And what they found is
that some of the cells

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.340
seemed to be what they
called kind of "twitchy"

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:12.800
and some of them seemed
to be more relaxed.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:17.360
So the twitchy cells are the
guys that had a larger tumbling

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.180
frequency.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.570
So they wouldn't swim
as far as the others.

01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:22.278
So they'd swim just
a little bit and then

01:14:22.278 --> 01:14:25.230
they'd change their mind, swim
a little bit, change their mind,

01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:28.867
whereas other cells had
much longer kind of runs,

01:14:28.867 --> 01:14:30.700
even though they're all
nominally identical.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.700
Now, can somebody
say the time scale

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:40.900
over which we would expect
that personality to persist?

01:14:45.369 --> 01:14:46.660
AUDIENCE: Cell generation time.

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:47.720
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
cell generation time.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.751
And why is that?

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:50.712
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:50.712 --> 01:14:51.670
JEFF GORE: Yeah, right.

01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:58.540
So if this is chi R, over time,
it's going to do something.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.710
And so the typical
autocorrelation time

01:15:00.710 --> 01:15:04.480
should be kind of the
cell generation time.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.820
So what we call the typical time
should be rather generational.

01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:15.080
So indeed, this is
the same as humans.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.510
We have a well-defined
personality

01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:19.040
and then we pass on some of
our personality to our kids.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.530
The typical time
scale is a generation.

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:24.150
So I'm teaching you guys super
useful things in this class.

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:26.830
I don't want anybody
saying anything else.

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.230
But I think that this
is a neat example of how

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.240
different cells can have
what you might describe

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.948
as being somehow
different personalities,

01:15:37.948 --> 01:15:40.250
but it arises for a
very particular reason

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:42.960
because this information
is being transmitted

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.112
through this network.

01:15:45.112 --> 01:15:46.570
Now, despite the
fact that they all

01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:48.479
have different chi
R concentrations--

01:15:48.479 --> 01:15:50.520
so they might have different
tumbling frequencies

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.650
and so forth, but
they should all

01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:53.290
be able to display
this phenomenon

01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:56.260
of perfect adaptation.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.000
So what we then see is
that from the experiments

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.170
and from some simple
models, you can

01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:04.300
get insight into how it
is that this phenomenon

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:06.589
of perfect adaptation
might be robust to changes

01:16:06.589 --> 01:16:08.880
in the concentrations of
different things, particularly

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.820
chi R in this case.

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.960
And chi R is the
dominant source of error

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.760
because it's present
in such small numbers.

01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:18.930
Now, in the last
two minutes or so,

01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:22.377
I just want to remind everybody
about the other context

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.210
in which we studied
robustness, because it's

01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:26.930
a much simpler
example and it helps

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:28.490
to clarify what we mean by it.

01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:30.840
Does anybody remember
the other context

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.381
that we have talked
about robustness?

01:16:35.608 --> 01:16:36.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:38.610
JEFF GORE: Negative
autoregulation someone

01:16:38.610 --> 01:16:40.587
said, maybe?

01:16:40.587 --> 01:16:41.170
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:43.620
JEFF GORE: OK, good, all right.

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:47.210
So if we have some
protein that is negatively

01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:52.460
autoregulating itself,
then this adds robustness.

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.860
And this is because
we can say, all right,

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:59.330
this is the degradation term,
alpha x, the production term.

01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:03.340
And the limit of being perfect,
sharp, negative autoregulation

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.140
looks like this.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.723
So this is the
production/degradation.

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.350
And here, this might be beta.

01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:14.600
This is a k.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:18.060
Then, what we can
talk about is how

01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:23.000
the steady-state concentration
of x here is going to be k.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.620
And this thing is robust to
variations in some things,

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.290
but not other things.

01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:31.870
For example, it's robust
to changes in alpha.

01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:32.899
That changes the slope.

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:34.940
It's robust to changes in
beta, because that just

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:39.030
brings it up and down, but it's
not robust to changes in k.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:42.360
So I think that any time
that if you are confused

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.060
about robustness, in particular
thinking about robustness

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:47.530
in the context of
chemotaxis gets

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:50.150
you confused because of perfect
adaptation being confusing,

01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:52.108
I think it's always good
to come back and think

01:17:52.108 --> 01:17:55.870
about this because this is the
most clear case where you can

01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:57.615
talk about-- this
is the robustness

01:17:57.615 --> 01:17:58.990
of the steady-state
concentration

01:17:58.990 --> 01:18:03.900
of some protein against
variations in alpha and beta,

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:04.950
but not against k.

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:09.250
So it reminds you that it's
not that this level of x

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.760
is robust against
everything, but it's

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.960
robust against some things.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.668
And you can make sense
of which things it

01:18:14.668 --> 01:18:16.950
should be robust against,
which things not.

01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:18.700
So with that, I think
we're going to quit.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.960
I just want to remind
everybody that none

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.410
of the work that we're
talking about here

01:18:23.410 --> 01:18:27.110
in the context of chemotaxis
and the genetic network

01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:29.460
will appear on the
exam, but we may

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:32.840
have a problem on low
Reynolds number flow,

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.420
maybe something Stokes drag.

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:37.810
Diffusion might
make an appearance.

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:38.780
Good luck on the exam.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.673
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

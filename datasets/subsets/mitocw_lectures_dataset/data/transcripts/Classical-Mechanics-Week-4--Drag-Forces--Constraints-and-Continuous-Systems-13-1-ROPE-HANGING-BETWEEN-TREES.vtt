00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:03.810
OK.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.520
Well, I like to lay in
the hammock in the summer.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.920
And this is our version
of that hammock.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.240
So we're having one rope,
or perhaps two ropes,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.900
hanging between two trees here.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.700
And they span an angle
theta on each side here.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.440
And we want to know what
is the tension in this rope

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.740
at the midpoint and
here, right where

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.570
it is attached to the tree.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.160
And here we already have
the free-body diagram.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.970
I just drew this
piece of the rope here

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.550
that's hanging on
this tree here.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.790
And we made an imaginary cut.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.850
We just cut it in
the middle, which

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.520
means gravity is
obviously acting on it.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.870
It's hanging through.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.420
But it does so with m/2
here for our half rope.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.745
We know that there is a tension
here at the midpoint, Tmid.

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:04.970
And up here, we have a
tension at that end point

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.640
that goes under this angle here.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.130
I just use an ordinary
Cartesian coordinate system

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.460
with the i-hat direction going
in the x direction and j-hat

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.680
going in the y direction.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.100
So all we need to do is we need
to apply Newton's second law

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.810
and do an F equals ma
analysis to figure out

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.440
what these tensions are.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.229
So let's apply
Newton's second law,

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.440
the F equals ma
analysis, to figure out

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.420
what the tensions
are at the midpoint

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.900
and at the end over there.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.620
So we have F equals ma.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.560
And we'll have to very carefully
separate the components here.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.298
Let's start with i-hat.

00:01:55.298 --> 00:02:05.160
We have Tmid minus
Tend, but of course we

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.530
have only the
projection of Tend,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.400
so this is Tend sine theta.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.480
And since this rope
is just hanging there,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.890
the acceleration is 0.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:29.100
In the j-hat direction, we have
minus m/2 g and then plus Tend.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.370
And here we have the cos theta
component, and that is also 0.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.120
So we see from here
pretty much immediately

00:02:41.120 --> 00:03:00.170
that Tend equals m/2
g over cos theta.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.130
And we can stick this one
here into the i-hat equation.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:22.030
So we'll get Tmid equals
m/2 cos theta g sine theta.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.570
And that's nothing else but
mg/2 over 2 tangent theta.

WEBVTT

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.920
PROFESSOR: OK, why don't we
you get started again?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.040
I can understand why there is
an air of excitement in the

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.910
room since tomorrow's
a holiday.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.230
But we still got two hours
before the day is over.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.695
Any questions on what we have
done up to this point?

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.920
No, that's good.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.470
Let me erase some of this art
work then and ask why one

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.170
would indulge in this rather
bizarre exercise of taking the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.520
elements of something that
represents a physical property

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.450
and constructing a surface
out of them.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.700
Well, the name suggests that
maybe these surfaces, be they

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.170
hyperboloids of one or two
sheets or imaginary

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.280
ellipsoids, have something to
say about the property that

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.270
the tensor that formed the
coefficient of these

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.440
functions is doing.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.480
So let me take the case
of an ellipsoid.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.700
That would be the case
where all the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.230
coefficients are positive.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.310
And let's let this be
x1 and this x2.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.860
And let me ask a
first question.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.920
If this is to be a well deserved
function, does the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.010
surface transform in exactly
the same way

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.650
as the tensor elements?

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.990
In other words, if we take the
tensor in one coordinate

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.430
system and then change the
coordinate system to a

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.740
different coordinate system, are
the coefficients in front

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.810
of x1, x2, and x3 still the
elements of the tensor in that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.050
new coordinate system?

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.000
So let me show you that this
is, in fact, the case.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.760
Suppose our original relation,
sticking to conductivity, is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.419
that x sigma ij xi
xj equals 1.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.340
And then for some reason or
another, we change axes.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.010
So the new equation will be some
different coefficients.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.560
Because as we change axes,
they're going to wink on and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.440
off, still the same surface, but
now referred to different

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.990
axes xi prime and xj prime
still equal to 1.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.190
And let me now use the reverse
transformation to put xi prime

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.430
in the terms of xi.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:50.160
If we do that, we can say that
xi prime is cli x sub l prime.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.960
That's the reverse
transformation.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.210
So notice the inverted order
of the direction cosine

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.520
subscripts.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.210
And then xj prime is going
to be equal to cmj

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.825
times x sub ep prime.

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:12.250
To find this, let's just
rearrange these terms in a

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.420
trivial fashion.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:31.640
Then I will have cx sigma ij
cil cmj times xl prime xm

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.600
prime equals 1.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.900
And what is this?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:45.370
This is a summation of direction
cosines where the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.210
first subscript goes with the
subscript on sigma prime.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.550
What did I do wrong?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.820
This is mj.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.120
Why is that not coming first?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.620
PROFESSOR: Well, what I would
like to get this in the form

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.830
of is a summation of sigma
ij prime over two dummy

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.246
indices l and m.

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:15.668
What did I do wrong?

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.450
Ah, yes, right, right, right,
right, this is li.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.730
Thank you somebody said it.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.080
And my nose was right in it.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.160
And I didn't notice it.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.830
OK, this is a summation of all
the original elements sigma ij

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.780
prime times dummy
indices l and m.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.520
And this actually
is sigma ijn.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.730
So it's the same set
of coefficients.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.100
And that is a technicality,
which probably you wouldn't

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.470
want to worry about.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.100
So anyway, the elements of the
tensor transform in the same

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.310
way that the equations for
the surfaces transform.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.210
So if you change coordinate
system, the coefficients that

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.670
you should use should be the
elements that are in the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.410
transform tensor.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.890
OK, now I'm going to
ask a question.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.280
Suppose I define some direction
by a set of

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.990
direction cosines li and I ask
the value of the radius of the

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.450
surface in that direction.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.810
So this is some radius vector.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:39.940
The radius vector will have
components, R1, R2, R3 or Ri.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.350
And each of those components
will be equal to the magnitude

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.330
of R times the direction
cosines li.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.116
Yes, sir?

00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:55.924
AUDIENCE: Could you briefly rego
over what you just stated

00:05:55.924 --> 00:05:57.828
before you erased
it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:57.828 --> 00:05:58.780
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.370
I'm sorry.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.070
I said aij xi xj equals
1 is the original

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.020
equation for the quadric.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.480
If we change the coordinate
system, we're going to have

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.170
some new elements aij prime
times xi prime xj prime.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.840
Because we've got a new
coordinate system.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.900
And therefore, the coefficients
in front of the

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.330
equation for the quadric
have to change.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.350
And now what I did was to
express xi prime and xj prime

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:39.810
in terms of xi and xj using the
reverse transformation.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:49.360
And xi prime in terms of the
original x's will be c sub l

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.930
sub i x sub l prime.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:00.320
Usually, we write it xl
equals cil x sub l.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.920
This is the reverse
transformation where the order

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.710
of the subscripts is reversed.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.850
So this will give
me x of i prime.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:16.340
The expression for x sub j prime
will be given by cmj x

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.830
sub j where m is
a dummy index.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.600
And that's equal to 1.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:33.920
And if I just rearrange this,
then I will have cli cmj times

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:43.800
aij prime equals
1 times xl xj.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:55.860
And this is going
to be alx lxm.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:04.370
And this will be alm times xl
xm equals 1, which is the

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.890
equation for the quadric in the

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.470
original coordinate system.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.750
I think that was better when I
was standing in front of it so

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.000
you couldn't see it.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:20.280
It's just that the surface
transforms formally to the

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.020
surface that we would create
if we used the new tensor

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.130
elements for the same change of
coordinates system, which

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.630
you would probably will be
willing to take my word for.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.730
PROFESSOR: This is a direction
cosine for the--

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
right below.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.286
PROFESSOR: Right below?

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:42.536
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.440
PROFESSOR: cli cmj aij prime
xl xm, and then I collected

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.520
the cli cmj times alm.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.710
And that is the transfer.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.146
Yes?

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:05.130
AUDIENCE: In the previous
[INAUDIBLE], you defined the

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:14.094
derivitave side as being
xi prime equals cil xl.

00:09:14.094 --> 00:09:15.344
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:18.078 --> 00:09:26.325
PROFESSOR: You can say that x
prime is cil times x sub l.

00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:30.480
And if we want to use the same
direction cosine scheme but do

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:38.395
it in reverse, we would say that
x sub l is equal to c--

00:09:51.280 --> 00:10:01.255
yeah, OK, x sub i is cli
times x sub i, right,

00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:02.872
no, times x sub l--

00:10:02.872 --> 00:10:04.423
is that right-- x sub l prime.

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:13.810
AUDIENCE: On the second line
to the third line, you say

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.034
that xi prime equals
cli [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:21.994 --> 00:10:32.446
It's either xi equals xcli xl
prime or xi prime equals cil.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.160
PROFESSOR: OK, you want to say
this. xi prime and cil becomes

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.050
xl, yes, yeah.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.360
And then mj times x--

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.650
that's x sub m.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:07.310
OK, and then this says that cil
cjm times aij prime should

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.240
be alm, right, OK, OK.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.615
So it's OK then.

00:11:15.285 --> 00:11:17.980
OK, that was supposed to be a
small point that everybody

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.730
would accept.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.730
But now it's done correctly.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.970
OK, let's get back to
this, which is more

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.200
hair raising and exciting.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.870
What is the radius of the
quadric in a given direction

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.690
that we specify by three
direction cosines l1, l2, l3?

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.540
So there's some radius from the
center of the quadric out

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.090
to the surface in that
particular direction specified

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.050
by three direction cosines.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.580
And we know what those three
components are, sub i, are

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.200
going to be in terms of the
direction cosines, magnitude

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.920
of R times li.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:12:02.650
And those points at the terminus
of the radius vector

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.630
go to one point on the surface
of the quadric.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:10.190
So these values of R are
coordinates that satisfy the

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.420
surface of the quadric.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:19.280
So we can say that just
substitute Ri for the

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.260
different values xi in the
equation for the quadric.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:33.270
And this says that sigma ij
magnitude of R times li, that

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:38.220
would correspond to x sub
i times magnitude of

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.740
R times l sub j.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.990
That's the magnitude of xj.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.640
That should be equal to 1.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.150
And if I rearranged this
slightly, this says that the

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:58.690
magnitude of R squared is going
to be equal to 1 over

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.040
sigma ij times li lj.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.260
So the radius of the quadric
gives me not the value of the

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.790
property in that direction.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.770
This is the value of the
property that will occur in

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.610
the direction specified by
the direction cosines lj.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.410
The radius of the quadric is
going to be equal to 1 over

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.410
the square root of
the value of the

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.675
property in that direction.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.410
So this is why it's called the
representation quadric.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.000
If you construct the surface
from the tensor elements, you

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.060
will have defined a quadratic
form, which has the property

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.850
that, as you go in different
directions look at the

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.755
distance out to the surface of
the quadric in that direction,

00:13:56.755 --> 00:14:00.990
that that distance squared is
going to be equal to 1 over

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.530
the property in that direction
or, alternatively, the radius

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.520
is going to be 1 over the square
root of the value of

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.570
the property.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.740
There is an enormous
implication here.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:18.390
This says that the value of the
property, if the quadratic

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.920
form is an ellipsoid, the value
of the property as we go

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.170
around in different directions
in the crystal is going to be

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.760
a smooth, uniformly
varying function.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.820
They're going to be no
lobes sticking out.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.250
They're going to be no
dimples, no lumps.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.540
It's going to be an almost
monotonous property, not very

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:37.980
interesting.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.590
It's going to change
in a uniform way.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.120
And in fact, we could put the
two surfaces side by side.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.710
If this is the value of the
quadric as a function of

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.990
direction, if we make a polar
plot of the property as a

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.170
function of direction, it's
going to look sort of like the

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.200
reciprocal of this.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.630
The minimum value of the
property will be in the

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:06.980
direction of the maximum value
of the radius of the quadric.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.640
And the maximum value of the
property is going to go in the

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.260
direction of the
minimum value.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.830
So the value of the property as
a function of direction is

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.900
going to be a quasi-ellipsoidal
sort of

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.440
variation but not really
an ellipsoid.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.260
It's going to go as this
inverse square of

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.760
the radii in ellipsoid.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.140
But the thing is it's going to
be something that varies

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.690
uniformly between extreme values
of the maximum and

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.160
minimum value of the property.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.260
We are, I assure you, for higher
ranked tensor property

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:45.830
going to look at some absolutely
wild surfaces with

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.460
surfaces that do have lobes and
extreme values and very,

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.360
very irregular variation of
properties with directions but

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.195
not for second ranked
tensor properties.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:02.080
There will be a few variations
on this theme, which are also

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.405
interesting to touch upon.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:11.310
In principle, we can get other
quadratic forms from the

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:16.190
tensor if some of the elements
of the tensor are negative.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.450
And in particular, what
would we see--

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.590
and I'll draw this
relative to the

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.470
principal axes of the surface--

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.315
what would we see for an
hyperboloid of one sheet?

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:42.670
This is the sort of surface
that might result if one

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.130
principal value of the tensor
had a negative value.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.220
Well, this is the quadric.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.390
And this is a radius in one
particular direction.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.240
What would this say about
the property?

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.850
Well, let me, to make it clear,
look at one of these

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.990
sections through the quadric
that our hyperbola.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.150
In directions like this, we
have a radius that is a

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.690
minimum out to the surface.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.119
In other directions,
the radius gets

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.773
progressively larger.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:28.540
And then if we plot the
reciprocal of the square root

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.800
of that, that says that, in
this direction, we get the

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.090
maximum value of the property.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:38.430
And as the direction approaches
the asymptote, the

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.050
reciprocal will go down to 0.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.310
But how did I get
two y-axes here?

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.490
OK, so the maximum will
be in the direction

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.790
of the minimum radius.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.396
And then it will go down
to 0 for the asymptote.

00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:58.790
And that's going to be
symmetrical on either side of

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.160
this principle axis.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:09.710
So what then are the radii in
directions outside of the

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.570
asymptotes of this
hyperboloid?

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.640
Within this range, the
radius is imaginary.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.320
But if you square it, you
get a negative number.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.490
So within these two lobes,
the value of

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.940
the property is positive.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.730
As you go away from the
asymptotes, you'll get another

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.800
lobe like this and another lobe
like this where the value

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.050
of the property is negative.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.940
How in the world could
you get anything

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.830
that looked like that?

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.140
Well, a good example of a
property that has this

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:53.054
behavior is thermal expansion.

00:18:53.054 --> 00:18:54.695
And let me give you
two examples.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.780
The structure of selenium
and tellurium

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.750
is a hexagonal structure.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:11.910
And there are chain-like
molecules that are pairs of

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:21.360
bonds that rise up around
a threefold screw axis.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.510
So this is two coordinated atoms
in the structure just

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.510
spirals up in this triangular
spiral around the threefold

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.760
screw axis.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:41.060
So this is a material in which
the bonding is very, very

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.750
anisotropic.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.940
The bonding within these
covalently bonded spirals,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.610
which are like springs that you
might put on your screen

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.180
door in the summertime, the
bonding is very strong.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.280
Between these individual
molecular chains, the bonding

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.570
is very weak.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.180
So what happens when you
heat this stuff up?

00:2000:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.850
So this is going to be simply
c11 times c11 times sigma11.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.550
That's the only term
that survives.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:58.400
c11 has a numerical value of
minus 1, and that says that

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.860
sigma11 prime is equal
to sigma11.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:09.180
So is there any constraint, any
restriction on sigma 11?

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.540
No, sigma11 could be
anything it likes.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.790
So there's no constraint.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.750
Let's do another element.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.590
Let's see what sigma12
prime would be.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:32.430
This will be c1 something times
c2 something times sigma

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.380
something something.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.070
The only element of the
form c1 something that

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.360
is non-zero is c11.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.790
So I'll put in a 1 for the l.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.430
The only direction cosine
element of the form c2

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.810
something which is
non-zero is c22.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:58.630
So I'll put in c22 and
let n be equal to 2.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.840
c11 is minus 1, c22
is minus 1.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.950
So again, this gives us
something not terribly

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.010
interesting.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.690
Sigma 12 prime is equal
to sigma 12.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:17.900
So there's no constraint, at
which point you're probably

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.310
getting very restive,
say, this is

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.580
not telling us anything.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.930
So let me shake you up
by doing one further

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:31.940
transformation, and that is to
find the value for c13 prime.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.880
And that would be
c1 something, c3

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.050
something times sigma lm.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.330
The only form of this term of
the form c1 something, that's

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.720
non-zero is c11,
as we've seen.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.730
So I'll put in just that
single term and

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.400
replace l by 1.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.880
The term of the form
c3 something that

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.581
is non-zero is c33.

00:21:56.581 --> 00:22:02.130
And I'll put in a 3 for m, and
this is then c11 times c33

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:02.790
times sigma13.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:09.520
1, And c11 is minus 1.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.630
c33 is plus 1.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:18.950
And that says that sigma13
prime is minus sigma13.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.620
But if this is a symmetry
transformation, the tensor has

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.020
to remain invariant.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:30.630
And if we're to have sigma13
equals minus sigma13, there's

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:35.960
only one number that can make
that claim, and that's 0.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:41.800
So sigma13 is identically 0.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.850
And that places a rather severe
constraint on the way

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:50.150
in which the crystal is going to
relate an applied electric

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.100
field to a current flow.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.470
Sigma11 is anything.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.890
Sigma12 is anything.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.470
Sigma13 has to be
identically 0.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.330
Now, let's cut to
the bottom line.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:06.450
The direction cosine scheme is
diagonal, so we can say that

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:14.630
for any element that we pick to
transform sigma ij prime is

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:20.360
going to be cii, the diagonal
term which has the second

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:25.030
subscript equal to the first,
times cjj times sigma ij.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:39.410
And this says that if we have
i or j is equal to 3, then

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:43.530
sigma ij has to be 0, because
we're going to have a minus 1

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.250
times a plus 1.

0
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.146
coefficient in all directions?

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.620
No, that seems as though it
would violate in a flagrant

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.220
way some vast law of
thermodynamics that things

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.410
have to increase their volume
when you increase temperature.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:41.810
There were, however, a few odd
ball materials that over a

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:47.310
very, very limited temperature
range would contract but only

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.290
by a tiny amount in
all directions.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.020
And then one of the very
interesting discoveries of

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.910
recent years done primarily by
a crystal chemist named Art

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.970
Slate, who's out at the
University of Oregon, he

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.780
discovered a family of materials
that have large

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.150
negative expansion coefficients
in all directions

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.580
over a considerable range of

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.910
temperatures, like 100 degrees.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.870
So these are materials, when
you heat them up, they

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.710
contract amazing
as that seems.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.320
And there's a structural
reason for it.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.920
These are tetrahedral frameworks
in which one corner

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.860
of a tetrahedron is dangling.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.710
And as you heat it up, this
tetrahedral corner can get

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:39.110
closer to other tetrahedra,
which takes energy to do.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.570
But in so doing, you actually
are changing the net volume

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.090
occupied by the solid
so very, very

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.170
anomalous set of compounds.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.390
More of these have been found.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.830
There are probably a dozen
materials now that have

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.750
negative thermal expansion
coefficients in all

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.250
directions.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:02.060
So is the imaginary ellipsoid
a viable representation

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.240
quadric for real materials?

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.105
Yes, in the case of thermal
expansion coefficients.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:18.150
OK, so the representation
quadric then is a dandy device

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.940
for seeing with one function
how a property

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.530
will vary with direction.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:31.040
For an ellipsodial quadric, the
variation of the property

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.230
itself with direction is not
really ellipsodial but

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.120
quasi-ellipsodial in that
there's a small principal

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.270
axis, a large principal axis.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.350
And the large value of the
property goes with the short

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.600
axis of the quadric.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:54.860
So we have a nice device for
representing the value of the

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.935
property as a function
of direction.

00:25:57.935 --> 00:26:00.560
It looks as though we've lost
all information about the

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.850
direction of the resulting
vector, the generalized

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.370
displacement.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:12.180
It looks as though that's
not in here at all.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:17.650
Well, there was an ad years
ago for a bottle spaghetti

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:23.160
sauce, which offends many cooks
who are very fiercely

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.030
proud of their own
spaghetti sauce.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.280
So here's a wife who's using
the canned stuff.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.170
And her husband comes home and
looks at it very, very

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.925
skeptically and says,
where's the basil?

00:26:37.925 --> 00:26:40.140
And the housewife says,
it's in there.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.950
It's in there.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.730
And he sniffs again and says,
where is the basil?

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.820
And she says finally,
it's in there.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.330
It's in there.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.180
Well, this is a similar
situation.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.390
Where is the direction of
the generalized force?

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.820
And I say, it's in there.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:55.990
It's in there.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.890
Not obvious, but
it's in there.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.310
So let me now show you
where it is lurking.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.295
I think we have time to
carry this through.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.260
Let me describe how it's
embodied in the quadric and

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.990
then prove to you that this
is indeed the case.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:26.930
And I'll use a general quadric
in the form of an ellipsoid.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.140
That looks more like an
egg than an ellipsoid.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.735
It has a pointed end.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.670
OK, this is something
that's called the

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.985
radius normal property.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:01.370
And what it says, in words, is
that, if you pick a particular

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:08.240
direction relative to the
quadric, we know that its

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.990
length is going to be inversely
proportional to the

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.350
square root of the value
of the property.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.420
If you want to know what the
direction of the resulting

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.840
vector is, for example, in our
relation for conductivity now

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:28.230
getting very warm, it says the
current flow is given by a

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.790
linear combination of
every component of

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.250
the electric field.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.020
The radius normal properties is
that, if you want to know

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:40.060
where J is for this particular
direction, look at the point

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.040
where the radius vector
intersects the surface of the

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:49.190
quadric and, at that point,
construct a perpendicular to

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.700
the surface, which, in general,
will not be parallel

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.950
to R. And this will be the
direction of J. It won't give

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:58.770
you the magnitude.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.210
But it'll give you the
direction of it.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:27.380
OK, let me now prove to you
that the quadric does have

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.630
this property.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:41.360
In our conductivity relation,
the direction of J is going to

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.960
be given by the tensor
relation.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:51.200
Namely that J sub i is equal
to sigma ij times E sub j,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:57.950
which can be written as sigma ij
times the direction cosines

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:04.590
of E sub j times the
magnitude of E.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:09.310
I'm going to want to compare
this expression, with which

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.910
you're very familiar term by
term, with the normal to the

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.350
surface that we can
compute from its

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.740
derivative at that point.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:26.980
So this will say that J1 is
equal to sigma 1, 1 l1 times

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:34.390
the magnitude of E plus sigma
1, 2 times l2 times the

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:39.795
magnitude of E plus sigma 1, 3
times l3 times the magnitude

00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:42.910
of E. And I don't need
to write much more.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:50.640
J2 will be sigma 2, 1 times l1
magnitude of E plus sigma 2, 2

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.772
l2 times the magnitude
of E and so on.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.020
What is going to be the normal
to the surface as a function

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.270
of direction?

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:14.740
OK, to do this I'm going to
say that the normal to the

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:22.760
surfac70 --> 00:33:27.520
And if the orientation of the
axes relative to the symmetry

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:35.080
elements is quite general, all
nine elements of the tensor

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.790
will be non-zero.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.770
There will be only five
independent numbers, which

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.430
composes each of those nine
elements, and they will be

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.800
given by a product of two
direction cosines, sometimes

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.860
each of these five non-zero
elements.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.750
But there will be no zeros in
this array at all for an

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.500
arbitrary set of coordinate
systems.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.460
Something that I think I'll ask
you to do as a problem,

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:06.230
because it's really easy
to do, if the tensor is

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.100
symmetric, which most of them
are, one thing that you can

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:20.210
show quite directly is that
a symmetric tensor remains

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:30.375
symmetric for any arbitrary
change of axes.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.900
And that, again, is something
that's fairly easy to prove,

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.750
and I'll let you have the fun
and exhilaration of doing that

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.000
for yourself.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.980
OK, so this means that for
everything except thermal

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.010
electricity, you really have
to transform, at most, only

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.800
six elements if you go from one

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.040
coordinate system to another.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.270
That's still a lot, but it's
considerably better than

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.110
transforming all nine.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.070
So if the tensor originally is
symmetric in one coordinate

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.370
system, it stays symmetric in
any other coordinate system.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.380
Now, one thing that
I should mention--

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.230
I passed over it rather
quickly--

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:33.780
we said that a property of a
direction cosine scheme is

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.860
that it is what's called a
unitary transformation.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:42.680
And it has the property that
the determinant of the

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.030
coefficients is plus
1 if the axis

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:49.580
retains the same chirality.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.140
The determinant is minus 1 if
you change the handedness.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:59.520
That is only true for what is
called a measure-preserving

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.160
transformation.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:02.920
That's what it's called.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.490
And when it's a
measure-preserving

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:09.690
transformation, then the
direction cosine scheme is a

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.440
unitary matrix.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:17.210
What is measure-preserving
transformation?

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.070
If it's a right-handed system

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:21.560
beforehand, there's no squishing.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.740
It doesn't go to an oblique
coordinate system.

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.100
Cartesian stays Cartesian.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.470
If the reference axes are of
equal lengths, they don't

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.440
stretch upon the
transformation.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.150
You can define transformations
like that if you like, where

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.950
the angles between them go from
orthogonal to oblique

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.670
after the transformation, and
the units of length along the

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.900
three axes change dimension.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.920
But then the determinant of the
coefficients is not unity,

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.170
and a lot of the nice,
convenient properties that

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.420
we've seen here do not hold.

00:36:57.205 --> 00:37:01.620
All right, that is a good
place to stop, I think.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.970
Next week, no quiz.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.650
If you came in late, we're
going to postpone

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.070
the quiz for a week.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:09.710
And let's see, look at all I
can ask you just after one

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.930
lecture on tensors.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.700
What we will do next is explore
the form of the

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.830
tensors for other crystal
symmetries.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.600
It goes fairly quickly.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.340
And then having done all that,
I'll show you how you can

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.970
determine the symmetry
constraints by inspection for

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:31.990
a tensor of any rank.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.240
And you're going to despise me
for that, but this was useful,

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.090
because we can get used to
manipulating the notation.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.760
But there is a method called--

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.380
appropriately enough-- the
method of direct inspection

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.170
where you can very quickly and
very easily do the symmetry

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.800
transformations.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.470
So all this and more will be
revealed next time, which is

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.120
going to be a lot more
beneficial than taking a quiz.ific properties that
illustrate second ranked

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.460
tensor properties.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:45.500
And in particular, I would like
to look at some other

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.040
sorts of second ranked tensor
properties that represent

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.120
generalized forces, namely
stress and strain.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.760
You've seen these before in
other contexts perhaps not

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.570
actually defined rigorously
in terms of tensors.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:04.580
Because, obviously, stress and
strain can be regarded as

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.740
generalized forces.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.810
A stress is something that
you can apply to a solid.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.840
And that will cause various
things to happen.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.280
In addition to mechanical
behavior, different properties

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.910
and effects can result.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:21.850
So that is going to involve a
generalized force, which is a

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.410
second ranked tensor.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:26.050
And a thing that might happen
could be a vector.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.420
It could be another second
ranked tensor.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.040
And this is going to introduce
us to the nasty world of

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.640
higher ranked tensor properties
and their

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.830
representation surfaces.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:41.180
So this is a nice place to quit
and pause for a quiz.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:46.390
When we resume, we'll look at
stress and strain in terms of

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.640
our tensor algebra.

00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:16.560
SARAH HEWETT: All
right, good afternoon.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.630
We're going to get started
because we have a lot

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.140
to talk about for this one
lab before a lot of you guys

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.610
get to do it starting next week.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.530
So we are done for now talking
about the essential oil lab,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.280
and you'll get one
more lecture about that

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.968
in the X-ray crystallography
stuff coming up next week.

00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:35.010
And for now, we're going
to switch gears and talk

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.000
about the ester lab.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.625
So before we get
too far into it,

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:42.000
the Ellen Swallow Richards
reports are due next Wednesday

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.620
and Thursday, the 16th and 17th.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.610
The TAs will be
holding office hours

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.750
and I will post those onto
Stellar this afternoon.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.842
And then starting this
Wednesday and Thursday,

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.800
we're going be starting
our next round of labs,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.110
so wherever you are standing,
whichever bay you're

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.570
in in the lab, that
will determine which lab

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.845
you are going to do next.

00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:00.470
So A prime 2, center
of the lab, you'll

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.580
be doing essential oils,
middle group, catalase,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.050
and then the people
closest to the wall,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.550
you'll be doing the
ester lab, which

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.900
we're talking about today.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.850
If you're doing the catalase
lab, and hopefully your TAs

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.580
will remind you of this as well,
but you need to bring a laptop.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.320
You'll be working in pairs,
so if you don't have a laptop,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.403
then we can pair you up
with somebody who has one.

00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:17.900
But we need a good number
of laptops to do that.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.650
That's how you'll be
collecting your data,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.590
and we'll talk more about
that starting on Thursday.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.130
But moving on to esters, so
the structure of an ester,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.840
which hopefully you
guys have seen before

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.300
in your organic chemistry or
maybe your gen chem classes,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.720
is something like this.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.510
You have an R group
where this first R

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.240
group can be a hydrogen,
any alkyl group

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.430
or an aromatic group.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.950
Then you have your carbonyl,
another oxygen and then

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.800
a different R group.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.932
And this one can only be
an alkyl or an aryl group.

00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:47.890
It has to have carbons.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.990
It can't be a hydrogen, or else
you have a carboxylic acid.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.560
So that's the general
structure of esters.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.290
And talking a little bit
about background information

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.560
about esters, they are found
naturally in many plants,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.180
and you can synthesize
them in the lab

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.370
from carboxylic acids
and alcohols, which

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.780
we are going to be doing.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.660
They are highly fragrant,
as you guys will experience

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.610
when you do this
lab, and so as such,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.570
they are used extensively in
flavorings, scent and polymer

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.110
industries.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.370
And so some esters that you may
have seen before in the world,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.570
this is a triglyceride.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.100
This is how your
body stores fats,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.630
and it makes it from glycerol,
which is an alcohol..

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.370
It has three OH groups and
a bunch of fatty acids.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.680
So that's one biological
example of an ester that is very

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.090
common in all of our bodies.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.940
And then this is
ethyl cinnamate,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.820
which is an ester that is
found in the essential oil

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.820
of cinnamon, and it
is what gives cinnamon

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.800
its cinnamony flavor or scent.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.710
The most ubiquitous of
esters is probably polyester.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.405
And so many of you are probably
wearing polyester right now.

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:50.280
It's in your fabrics.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.200
It's what plastic
bottles are made out of.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.240
You have water bottles
or food containers,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.470
all of these things.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.660
If you see this symbol that is
the symbol for this plastic,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.820
which is the most common
one used in our fabrics

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.280
and in the food
packaging that we have,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.620
and it is polyethylene
terephthalate,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.190
and this is the structure.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.400
And so you can see that
there is the ethylene group.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.050
There's the terephthalate
group, and then there

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.383
is our ester bond in the middle.

00:03:14.383 --> 00:03:16.950
And if so if you stack
a lot of these together,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.940
you make a giant polymer, then
you have all type of plastics

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.108
that we use for many, many
applications in our daily life.

00:03:25.108 --> 00:03:26.900
So a little bit of
background about esters.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.358
And here's a chart of all of
the different types of esters--

00:03:30.358 --> 00:03:31.400
or not all of the esters.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.220
There's many, many, many types
of esters that you can make,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.290
but here are some very
common ones, especially

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.570
ones that are found
naturally in different food

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.740
and natural products.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.450
So you can see there's the
part from the carboxylic acid

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.870
and the part from the alcohol.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.845
So if you make any of these
combinations of esters,

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:50.720
then they'll have all
these different scents.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.490
And so in the lab,
you guys are going

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.320
to be synthesizing a whole
bunch of different esters,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.487
and one of the ways that
you may be able to identify

00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:57.925
it is by what it smells like.

00:03:57.925 --> 00:03:59.300
So if you look in
the lab manual,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.410
there's a whole
chart of the esters.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.410
It gives you their name.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.177
It gives you a bunch of
physical information about it,

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:05.510
and it also gives you the scent.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.670
So when you
synthesize your ester,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.220
you will carefully
smell it and see

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.450
if it matches up to what it
is supposed to smell like.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.832
AUDIENCE: What are the
boxes that say ethereal?

00:04:15.832 --> 00:04:16.790
SARAH HEWETT: Ethereal?

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.147
That is kind of--

00:04:19.147 --> 00:04:21.230
I've never smelled something
that smells ethereal.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.450
Does anyone have
a good description

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.500
of what that may smell like?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.480
I think it doesn't have
like a concrete scent.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.090
That's how I kind
of interpret that.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.270
But you can see there are
some that smell like vanilla,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.440
pineapples, different fruits.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.148
Those are ones that
smell like balsamicy,

00:04:36.148 --> 00:04:39.980
like vinegar, coconut, all
kinds of different things.

00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:44.230
So we're going to talk
about the reaction

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.438
that we're going to be doing.

00:04:45.438 --> 00:04:46.435
This is Emil Fischer.

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:49.540
He is half of the team that
is responsible for creating

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.130
or inventing this reaction.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.130
I could not find a
picture of the other guy.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.250
He won the Nobel Prize for
chemistry in the early 1900s,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.070
and now it is typically just
called a Fischer esterification

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.010
reaction.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.760
So you take your carboxyl
acid, your alcohol, some acid,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.885
and then you can
synthesize an ester.

00:05:05.885 --> 00:05:07.510
And so we'll walk
through the mechanism

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.552
really quickly so that we
know what is happening.

00:05:09.552 --> 00:05:11.020
And you guys have probably--

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.450
have you guys seen this in
your organic chemistry classes?

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.938
Yes, so this hopefully
isn't too new.

00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:18.730
So you start off with
your carboxylic acid.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.200
We're going to add a strong
acid in our case, sulfuric acid,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200
which is very corrosive.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.160
Be careful when you're
handling it in the lab.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.422
That is our proton source.

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:27.130
So the first thing
that we're going to do

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.707
is activate this carbonyl.

00:05:29.707 --> 00:05:30.540
We get our carbonyl.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.148
Now it has a proton and
a positive charge on it,

00:05:33.148 --> 00:05:34.690
and we can draw a
resonance structure

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.410
where that positive charge gets
put down on this carbon here.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.710
And when we do that,
we have our alcohol.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.920
We can add our alcohol
in, and these electrons

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.940
can come up here and attack
that positively charged carbon.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.400
We can add our alcohol group
to our original molecule.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.010
So now we have this
guy here, and now

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.570
the positive charge
is on this oxygen.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.660
And so we can lose
a proton to get rid

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.800
of that positive charge.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.590
So then we end up with
a proton over here.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.730
That's an unfortunate proton.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:18.390
And now we have this structure
here with our extra proton.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.120
We can protonate
this oxygen up here

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.850
and form this charged species.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.890
And now we have made
positively charged water,

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:35.340
and we know that water
is a good leaving group.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.380
So we can leave and
make water, and that

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.340
is where the water comes
from in our synthesis.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.655
And to kind of balance
this whole thing out,

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.780
you're also going to have
these electrons come down

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.150
and form a double bond to
help drive that water out.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.830
So now we have a
double bond here.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.990
It has a positive
charge and a proton

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.647
still on it, so we can have
this proton leave as a proton.

00:07:01.647 --> 00:07:02.730
And we have made an ester.

00:07:06.538 --> 00:07:07.970
Tada.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.650
And then we've
regenerated our acids,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.320
so that's why the sulfuric
acid is our catalyst.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.343
So I guess we can leave
this here for now.

00:07:15.343 --> 00:07:17.760
So that is the mechanism of
the reaction, and like I said,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.800
you guys have probably
seen that before.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.630
It's pretty straightforward,
and so this is the reaction

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.040
that we will be
doing in the lab.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.980
Now we need to talk
about naming esters,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.330
and there are a couple
of conventions that

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.560
are used when naming esters.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.727
There's a few ways to do it.

00:07:30.727 --> 00:07:33.610
So the first one is the
IUPAC straightforward way

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.703
to name esters, and you start
with the part of the molecule

00:07:36.703 --> 00:07:37.870
that comes from the alcohol.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.390
So if you notice over
here, the blue stuff

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.310
came from the alcohol,
and it ends up

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.400
as this group that's
attached to the oxygen,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.068
not on the carbonyl
side of the molecule.

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.360
So you're going to start there.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.490
You'll name it as though it's an
alkyl group, so something that

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.120
is attached.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.120
So it'll have that -yl
ending, like methyl, ethyl,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.540
that kind of thing.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.450
So this is a propyl group.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.470
It has three carbons.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.880
The second step is to look at
the other half of the molecule,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.940
and you want to name it as
though it isn't just an alkane

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.940
and count up all the carbons
including this one attached

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.735
to the carbonyl.

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:13.610
So you have one, two,
three carbons over here

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.910
as well, so that
would be propane.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.390
And then you want to drop
the e off the end of the name

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.450
and add -oate, So proponoate.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.790
So the IUPAC way
to name this thing

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.470
is then to combine the names.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.230
So you'll get
propyl, proponoate.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.710
So clear enough?

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.460
It gets a little bit tricky
because chemists don't always

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.200
use the IUPAC or traditional
names for everything.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.590
There are some common names
that get used and thrown

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.140
around when people are talking
about different chemicals.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.350
So does anybody know what
this carboxylic acid is?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.100
Acetate or acetic acid.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.990
So acetic acid is what
we typically call it.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.407
You'll hear it as
an acetate group

00:08:56.407 --> 00:08:59.145
if you take off that proton.

00:08:59.145 --> 00:09:01.270
If you're going to name
this according to the IUPAC

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.728
convention that I just told
you about, there's two carbons,

00:09:03.728 --> 00:09:07.210
so that's ethane, and you
would call it ethanoic acid,

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.260
but that's not commonly used.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.090
This alcohol is ethanol.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.500
So if you combine these two,
what would we call that ester?

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.520
Ethyl ethanoate, or you
can use the common name

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.940
and call it ethyl acetate,
which you guys may have heard of

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.160
or remember from
the ferrocene lab.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.900
Yes.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.670
So there are a couple
of different ways

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.397
to name the esters, and
there's a whole list of esters.

00:09:37.397 --> 00:09:38.980
If you guys have
looked in the manual,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.438
there's a whole list of possible
unknowns that you can have

00:09:41.438 --> 00:09:43.210
and that you can
make in this lab,

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.220
and they come from all
different combinations

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.860
of carboxylic
acids and alcohols.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.850
And so in order for you guys
to have some idea of what

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.350
you may be making
and the structures

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.320
that you will be looking for
when you are characterizing

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.230
your esters that you
make by different types

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.600
of spectroscopy, we need
to be able to name and draw

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.120
the esters.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.550
So if you got this handout
in the back, on one side,

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.800
it has a sheet that has
all of the common names

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.210
for the structures that you
may find in that list of esters

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.460
that we'll be making in the lab.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.338
And then on the back,
there is a blank chart.

00:10:21.338 --> 00:10:22.880
Mine's already filled
in, but there's

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.150
a blank chart that has a bunch
of different ester names.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.930
So if we want to take a
moment and practice naming

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.450
these esters using the
information in the past two

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.420
slides you should have on
your PowerPoint handout

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.250
and the structures
on the back of here,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.010
you should be able to
draw the structures of all

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.350
of these different esters.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.020
So take a moment do that and
talk with your neighbors.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.150
Work it out.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.590
Ask your TAs if
you're back there.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.420
And then I'm going
to have people,

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.112
when you are confident
that you know

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.570
the structure of
one of these guys,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.760
come down here and
draw it please.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.263
So I'll give you a couple
of minutes to do that.

00:11:02.263 --> 00:11:04.180
All right, can I get a
few people to come help

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.790
draw some of these on the
board if you have drawn

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.040
some of these on your paper?

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:09.673
Go for it.

00:11:09.673 --> 00:11:11.590
Going to need a few other
people, or else this

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.632
is going to take forever.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.270
Excellent.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.195
Wonderful.

00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:19.820
Anyone from the back
want to come down?

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.280
Go for it.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.810
Thank you.

00:11:23.654 --> 00:11:25.273
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:25.273 --> 00:11:26.940
SARAH HEWETT: Don't
worry if it's wrong.

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:34.250
If you want to draw more
than one, go for it.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.667
If anyone else wants to come
down here and be really brave

00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:38.837
and share their knowledge,
that would be excellent.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.960
All right, we'll see how many
of them these guys can do.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.550
Yeah, if more than one, go for
it because it'll be faster.

00:12:00.682 --> 00:12:01.768
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:01.768 --> 00:12:03.310
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah,
sorry about that.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.410
One more.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.665
All right, how are we looking?

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.381
Good, except this one, I think,
these are the same molecule.

00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:35.303
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:47.010
SARAH HEWETT: So butyl acetate,
it's just no double bond.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:47.880
Thank you.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.480
Well done.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.680
So there are the structures
of some of the esters

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.700
that you may or may not
be making during this lab.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.610
It's good practice.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.850
So these aren't all of
them, so you'll still

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.220
have to draw out some of
the possible structures

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.130
when you are trying to figure
out what your unknown might be,

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.270
but this is a good
start and good practice.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.670
So it looks like you guys are
good at drawing the esters.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.510
Well done.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.750
All right, so now that
we have the idea of what

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.853
the reaction looks like on paper
and what our products could

00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:22.270
possibly be, we're going to
talk about how we can actually

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.720
do this in the lab.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.900
And so I brought
some of the glassware

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.150
that you're going to be using.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.350
And I'm going to put
gloves on because I

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.783
don't know how well whoever used
this last semester cleaned it.

00:13:33.783 --> 00:13:36.200
So the first technique that
you're going to use is reflux,

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.545
and so that's to do the
first part of, or pretty much

00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:39.920
do the whole
reaction here, where

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.050
you're going to combine
your carboxylic acid

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.160
and your alcohol.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.880
You're going to heat it up,
and to reflux means to boil

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.940
without losing solvents.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.400
So it'll be boiling.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.900
You'll have a stir bar in there.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.260
So you can see you
have your stir plate.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.010
You're going to use a
heating mantle again

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.690
to heat your reaction.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.940
It'll be boiling
in there, and then

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.965
instead of using
our Vigreux column

00:14:02.965 --> 00:14:04.590
like we did in the
distillation, you're

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:11.267
just going to put a
condenser on there.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.350
So you'll have water going
through your condenser.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.430
You'll want your water going
in the bottom and out the top

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.400
so that the whole thing
fills up with cold water,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.600
and so that's when
you're boiling.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.010
Your solvent will
be evaporating,

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.000
and then it'll
condense and it'll

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.917
go back down so that you
don't boil to dryness

00:14:22.917 --> 00:14:26.350
and you don't lose all of your
product as you're boiling it.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.392
And then on the top, you're
going to put a drying tube,

00:14:29.392 --> 00:14:31.100
and your drying tube
will look like this.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.600
And when you get it, it will
be empty just like this one is,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.923
and then you will fill it.

00:14:34.923 --> 00:14:37.090
You'll put a little bit of
cotton in here as a plug,

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.465
and then you will take this
stopper off and fill the rest

00:14:39.465 --> 00:14:42.010
of it with calcium chloride.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.930
Does anyone know why
we're going to do that?

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.180
And it goes right on top here.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.300
So calcium chloride is CaCl2.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.732
It is among other things
used as a road salt.

00:14:56.732 --> 00:14:58.440
So there are three
ions in the structure,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.090
and if you remember your
colligative properties,

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.100
then it'll lower the
freezing point of water

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.615
when it has three ions in it.

00:15:03.615 --> 00:15:05.460
It's a very good electrolyte.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.770
It'll also lower the vapor
pressure of a solution

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.200
or increase the boiling point.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.840
And the dissolution of calcium
chloride is exothermic.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.910
It's very
thermodynamically favorable

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.740
and it's also
entropically favorable,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.690
so it is a very
spontaneous reaction,

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.900
and it is a hygroscopic
material, which

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.287
means that it absorbs water.

00:15:23.287 --> 00:15:24.120
So it's a desiccant.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.890
You may see those like
silica gel packets

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.340
in things that you may
buy to keep the water out.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.590
Calcium chloride is another
material that's commonly

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.080
used as a desiccant
because it's hygroscopic,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.380
but it has a property even
beyond being hygroscopic.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.840
It is deliquescent, which
means it'll absorb water

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.140
until it becomes a solution.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.500
So this is what dry calcium
chloride pellets look like.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.877
So it's just little
white chunks of solid.

00:15:46.877 --> 00:15:49.210
And if you leave it out on
the benchtop for long enough,

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.570
it'll actually pull in
the water from the air

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.580
and turn itself into a calcium
chloride brine solution.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.485
So if you spill some
of this on the bench,

00:15:57.485 --> 00:15:59.110
you want to clean it
up really quickly,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.915
or else it will start
to look like that.

00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:04.290
And so what we're
going to use it

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.912
for in our reaction
is-- what are

00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:08.120
the products of our reaction?

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.495
We're going to
make an ester and?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.210
Water.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.770
So if we go back to our
mechanism, we lose water here.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.010
And if you notice,
most of these steps

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.330
here are reversible steps.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.350
So if you remember Le
Chatelier's principle,

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.750
if this is our overall
reaction and one

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:33.050
of our products
over here is water,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.540
and this is a
reversible reaction,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.180
then how can we
force the reaction

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.810
to go towards the product side?

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.070
AUDIENCE: Take out the water.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:42.680
SARAH HEWETT: Take
out the water.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.720
You can either
add more reactants

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.213
or take out the
products, and so we

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.630
are going to be taking out the
water with our drying tube.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.650
And so that will help ensure
that our reaction goes

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.890
to completion while
we are refluxing.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.080
So once you've done
all of your reflux

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.720
and you have your product,
you've heated it for a while--

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.593
it's kind of boring to watch,
but reactions take time--

00:17:02.593 --> 00:17:04.010
so then you will
have your product

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.420
in your round-bottom flask here.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.500
And we will have our ester,
hopefully, and what else?

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.339
Potentially all of these things,
right, and some sulfuric acid.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.589
So we don't know that our
reaction went to completion.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:20.060
We hope that it
got close, but we

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.030
need to purify it from any
impurities or remaining

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.630
starting material
that we may have.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.690
So we do that in a
separatory funnel,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.240
and this is a separatory funnel.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.810
And we do a
liquid-liquid extraction,

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.810
which means that we're
going to have one liquid,

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.380
and then we're going to add
a different liquid to it.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.750
So we have two liquid
phases, and we're

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.420
going to partition the different
compounds between those two

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.150
liquid phases.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.950
And the only way
this works is that we

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.410
have to have two
immiscible liquids that

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.470
have different densities.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.880
So what does it mean for
something to be immiscible?

00:17:52.693 --> 00:17:54.110
AUDIENCE: They
won't mix together.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.205
SARAH HEWETT: They
don't mix together.

00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:55.705
Good.

00:17:55.705 --> 00:17:57.920
So when you pour your
two solvents in here,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.290
they need to not mix so that
have two distinct layers

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.938
and that you can separate
your product between them.

00:18:03.938 --> 00:18:05.730
And it will separate
them based on density.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.040
So when you have your
separatory funnel,

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.660
you will pour your
two things into it,

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.160
and you should get two layers.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.980
And so your more dense
layer will be on the bottom

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.960
and your less dense
layer will be on the top.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.700
So in our case, water
has a density of about 1

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.520
and most organic liquids have
a density of less than 1.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.190
So if you take your
product, which is an ester,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.408
and you add water to it,
what will be on the top

00:18:30.408 --> 00:18:31.700
and what will be on the bottom?

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.330
AUDIENCE: The water
will be on the bottom.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.080
SARAH HEWETT: Yep.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.900
So this will be
our aqueous layer

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.180
and this will be our product
or our organic layer.

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:49.110
And it's really
important that you

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.090
keep track of what
is where when you're

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.100
using the separatory
funnel and that you

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.280
know what you've drained out
and what you have kept in there.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.630
And you want to save everything.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.310
Save all of the stuff
that comes out of here.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.477
Save all the things that
are in there until you know

00:19:01.477 --> 00:19:03.088
that you have your product.

00:19:03.088 --> 00:19:04.630
So there are a couple
of ways that we

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.780
can use a separatory
funnel or as a sep funnel,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.520
the abbreviated version.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.560
And the frequently
used solutions

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.600
for this type of
extraction, the first type

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.575
is an acid-base extraction or
a chemically active extraction,

00:19:16.575 --> 00:19:18.950
and that's the first thing
that you're going to be doing.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.180
So in our reaction
mixture, we have

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.070
hopefully a lot of product.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.522
We probably still have some
carboxylic acid left over,

00:19:26.522 --> 00:19:28.730
and we know that we have
some sulfuric acid in there.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.430
Yes?

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.020
Great.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.020
So the way to get all
of that acidic byproduct

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.190
away from our product is to
use sodium bicarbonate, which

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.550
is a base.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.680
And when we do that--

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:51.930
so if we have our carboxylic
acid, if you add a base to it,

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:57.690
then you can deprotonate it, and
if we have sodium bicarbonate,

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.800
it will form a sodium salt. And
that is more polar than this,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.030
so it will be more soluble
in our aqueous layer,

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.930
and we will pull it
away from our product.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.820
So that's the idea behind
the base extraction.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.160
And so hopefully, that
first round of extraction

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.380
will get rid of our
acidic impurities,

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.645
and then we're going to do
another extraction using

00:20:22.645 --> 00:20:24.620
a sodium chloride solution.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.140
And that is sometimes
referred to as salting out.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.033
So we will keep our
product in there,

00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:30.950
and then we will add
sodium chloride solution.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.940
And the sodium chloride makes
our aqueous layer really polar,

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.830
and so it makes our product less
soluble in the aqueous layer,

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:44.610
and it makes any water that's
left over in our product layer

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.403
more likely to come
into the aqueous layer.

00:20:46.403 --> 00:20:48.570
So when this is polar, than
all of the polar things,

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.745
all of the water, get pulled
into the aqueous layer,

00:20:51.745 --> 00:20:54.120
and any organic-y things, the
product that we care about,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.445
gets forced out into
the product layer.

00:20:58.445 --> 00:20:59.820
There's some
terminology that you

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.820
may hear when you are
using a separatory funnel.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.930
So there's extraction,
which is if your product is

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.388
in a mixture and
you to add another

00:21:05.388 --> 00:21:08.700
solvent to extract your product
out of what's already there.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.260
And then there's washing, which
is we're going to be doing,

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.900
which is where you're just going
to pour your product in there

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.525
and you are going to
add other solvents

00:21:14.525 --> 00:21:15.660
to extract the impurities.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.077
You leave your
product where it is

00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:20.073
and you pull out the impurities.

00:21:20.073 --> 00:21:21.490
A note on how to
use a sep funnel,

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.058
and I'm going to put goggles
on just for safety here.

00:21:25.058 --> 00:21:26.850
This is just water,
but the way that you're

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.800
going to do this is
you'll have a ring stand.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.290
It'll hold itself up
right here, and then you

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.223
will first make sure that
the stopcock is closed.

00:21:34.223 --> 00:21:36.640
So if you pour your product
through here and this is open,

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.253
then that's going to be a
really sad time in the lab.

00:21:39.253 --> 00:21:41.920
So then you'll pour your product
and whatever you are washing it

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.848
with into the sep funnel.

00:21:43.848 --> 00:21:45.640
You will get two layers
because you'll have

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.700
two different liquids in there.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.555
This is just water.

00:21:47.555 --> 00:21:48.430
Then you will cap it.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.300
And then you're going
to shake it like so.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.350
Then you will point it away from
any humans and into your hood

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.180
and you will open the vent.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.840
When you are shaking
things that have are really

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.550
volatile like organic
solvents, they'll

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.170
build up pressure
in here, and so you

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.550
don't want anything to explode.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.342
You don't want this
top to come flying off.

00:22:09.342 --> 00:22:11.450
You don't want the
glassware to break.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:12.890
So you want to vent this.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.140
You're going to shake it
a little bit, vent it.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.430
When you first start,
you want to vent it

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.080
very frequently so that the
pressure doesn't have a chance

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:18.688
to build up.

00:22:18.688 --> 00:22:20.480
When you do this, you
want to point it away

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.445
because sometimes, liquid
will come flying out.

00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:23.070
You'll hear it.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.160
It'll go pssh.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.330
So you want to be very careful
when you are using this.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.700
Safety note.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.720
What happens when you add
sodium bicarbonate to an acid?

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.620
You get a gas.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.850
You get carbon dioxide.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:41.450
Think baking soda
and vinegar volcano.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.420
So when you are first adding
your sodium bicarbonate

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.580
to your product, you
want to not do it

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.080
right away in the
separatory funnel,

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.740
or else you're going to build
up a whole lot of pressure,

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.930
and it's going to create
an unsafe situation.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.900
So you will add those
to a beaker first.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.510
Wait for the bubbling
to stop, and then you

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.310
can pour it into your
separatory funnel

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.870
and you can do the extraction.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.320
And what you're going to do
is you will open the stopcock,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.600
and then you'll be able to
watch the layers go down.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.800
And here's something.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.150
So if you open the
stopcock and you say,

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.400
oh my gosh, nothing's coming
out, what's our problem?

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.820
The top is on.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.070
So you want to close it first.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.442
Take the top off and then
it will drain smoothly.

00:23:19.442 --> 00:23:20.900
And then you'll
just pay attention,

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.728
and you can stop it right when
the interface between those two

00:23:23.728 --> 00:23:25.520
layers gets right to
the bottom, and that's

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.718
how you're going to use this
to separate your solutions.

00:23:28.718 --> 00:23:30.260
But yeah, inevitably,
somebody always

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.460
forgets to take the top
off, and they're like,

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.420
my sep funnel's broken.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.430
It's not.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:36.090
Just physics.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.918
So I guess we can
still leave these on.

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.460
So that's going to
be all in day one.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.773
You will reflux your product.

00:23:42.773 --> 00:23:44.190
Then you will use
your sep funnel.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.170
You will start to purify
it, and then on day two,

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:46.710
you're going to--

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.220
Oh, wait.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.530
Before, sorry.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.197
So after you have
isolated your product,

00:23:51.197 --> 00:23:53.488
we have just added a whole
bunch of water to it, right.

00:23:53.488 --> 00:23:56.190
We've shaken it up with sodium
bicarbonate and sodium chloride

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.930
solution.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.392
We don't want water
in our product.

00:23:59.392 --> 00:24:00.600
That's not the point of this.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.400
We want to just have
our ester, so we

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.560
need to remove the water
that gets left over

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.770
from our separatory funnel
situation using a drying agent,

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.260
and a drying agent is
similar to calcium chloride.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.140
We typically use sodium sulfate
or magnesium sulfate in the lab

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.790
because they're
easy to work with

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.190
and they suck the water
into their crystal lattice,

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:22.080
and they necessarily dissolve
very well, which is nice.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.910
And so these are
fairly interchangeable.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.217
They're the most commonly
ones used in lab situations.

00:24:26.217 --> 00:24:28.800
Magnesium sulfate sometimes can
harm acid-sensitive compounds,

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.480
so if you're doing something
very sensitive in the lab,

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.230
you may want to stick
with sodium sulfate,

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.590
but for our purposes,
it will be fine.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.840
So what you're going to do
is it comes in powder form,

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.632
and you will add some
of it to your product

00:24:38.632 --> 00:24:39.985
and you will swirl it around.

00:24:39.985 --> 00:24:42.360
And you will look at it, and
then you will run to your TA

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.300
and say something like this,
like, ah, is it dry yet.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.140
How much do I add?

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.750
And your TA will look at
you and say, I don't know.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.350
You should know this.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.470
So this is how you could
tell if it is dry yet.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.943
The first time that you add your
drying agent, it will clump up

00:24:56.943 --> 00:24:58.360
and it'll all be
in one big chunk,

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.770
especially if you have
a lot of water in there.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.470
Sometimes you can
even see the water.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:02.440
If you hold up
your flask, you'll

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.690
be able to see a little
bubble of water at the bottom.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.380
That's fine.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.250
You'll add your drying agent.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.030
It'll all clump up.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.238
You'll add a little bit more.

00:25:08.238 --> 00:25:10.420
It'll have some smaller
clumps, and then you'll

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.070
add a tiny scoop more.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.338
And the rest of it that
you add won't clump up.

00:25:14.338 --> 00:25:15.880
It'll look kind of
like a snow globe.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.880
It'll swirl around and
be free-flowing crystals,

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.900
and that is how you know
when you are done, when

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.950
it doesn't clump up anymore.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.105
So you don't need to
go over and weigh it.

00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:26.480
I think there's an approximate
weight in your lab manual.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.612
Like usually, it's
maybe around a gram.

00:25:28.612 --> 00:25:30.070
But don't bother
weighing this out.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.520
You can just kind of eyeball
it, scooping a little bit

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.020
at a time.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.698
Don't go too crazy
with the first scoop,

00:25:35.698 --> 00:25:37.990
because the more of this that
you have in your product,

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:40.845
the harder it will be to
isolate your product later.

00:25:40.845 --> 00:25:42.970
So let's say, if you think
of it like at the beach,

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.512
if you have a bunch of sand and
then you put a bunch of water

00:25:45.512 --> 00:25:47.200
in it, your water
kind of disappears.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.180
And in this case, our
product is the liquid,

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.680
so in order to get
our product back,

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.110
we will gravity-filter this
away from the drying agent.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.690
And so you want to have
minimal amount of drying agent

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.523
so that your product
doesn't get stuck in it

00:25:57.523 --> 00:26:00.240
and it's easy to filter later.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.760
OK, so that's all day one.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.370
Then you'll have your
semi-purified and dried

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.350
product, and then on day
two, we will purify it

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.200
from anything that did not get
taken out in your extraction

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.940
process using distillation.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.350
And what I didn't mention
is that for this lab,

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.350
you'll be checking out a
kit from the stockroom,

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.017
or your TAs will check
this out, and you

00:26:18.017 --> 00:26:19.950
will get a kit that has
all of the glassware

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.658
that you need to do
the entire lab in it.

00:26:21.658 --> 00:26:24.312
And there's a nice list on
here of what goes in this kit.

00:26:24.312 --> 00:26:26.520
So on the first day, you
will set up your reflux just

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.320
like this, and then
the second day, we're

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.420
going to set up an atmospheric
distillation, which

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.670
is going to be very similar
to the vacuum distillation

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.300
that we talked about before.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.170
But this time, instead of having
all the glassware in one piece,

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.640
you get to assemble it yourself.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.890
So you'll have your
Vigreux column.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.297
Then you'll have a
distilling head up here,

00:26:44.297 --> 00:26:46.380
and then you will put your
thermometer in the top.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.900
And most of our thermometers
have ground glass joints.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.567
And then you will use
the same condenser

00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:52.740
that you used for your
reflux on day one,

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.000
and that will go
across like this.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.310
And you will clamp all of
this glassware very well,

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:01.800
and then you will add your spout
to the end of it right here.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.180
And that is your
distillation setup.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.210
You'll have keck clips in your
lab, those yellow things that

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.750
hold all of your
joints together.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.670
So you want to make
sure that everything

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.920
is clamped and secure
before you start distilling,

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.093
because if you have
gaps in your glassware

00:27:15.093 --> 00:27:17.510
and then you start heating and
your product becomes a gas,

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.460
you will lose it all.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.830
So the distillation
will purify your product

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.130
from any remaining insoluble
impurities or higher

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.480
boiling impurities that we do
not want in our final product.

00:27:32.563 --> 00:27:33.980
And when you do
this, you're going

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.400
to collect a few
different fractions.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.840
And so the way that you're
going collect your fractions

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.780
in this case, we don't need to
use a cow adapter because we're

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.308
not going to be attaching
anything to the vacuum line.

00:27:41.308 --> 00:27:43.850
You can see that the spot over
here, instead of attaching it,

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.267
this is where you
put your vacuum.

00:27:45.267 --> 00:27:46.380
It's just open to the air.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.273
And so you can collect your
fractions in test tubes on ice,

00:27:49.273 --> 00:27:51.440
and then you will collect
a few different fractions.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.607
So you usually collect the
first few drops and then

00:27:53.607 --> 00:27:54.690
a few different fractions.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.300
If the temperature changes,
you will switch your fractions,

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.050
and your TAs will tell
you how to do that.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.830
And then you will monitor
your purity by IR.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.600
So if we go back and
think about the IR

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.050
that we talked about
last time, and if we

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.910
think about our products and
our reactants, what IR bands

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.540
are we going to see in our
carboxylic acid reactant?

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:31.550
We have a C-O stretch, an
O-H C double-bond O. And?

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.830
You might see the
CC, you may not.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.472
Those ones are
kind of hard to do

00:28:35.472 --> 00:28:37.430
because they don't change
dipole very much when

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:38.490
that bond happens.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.240
So sometimes, maybe a C-C bond.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.050
And what else?

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.120
What's in this R group?

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.372
Yeah, C-H stretches.

00:28:47.372 --> 00:28:48.580
What about our alcohol group?

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.010
We'll have another OH stretch.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:59.570
Of we have a C
single-bond O. Yep.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:00.820
Do we have one of these?

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.410
No.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:03.035
None of those.

00:29:03.035 --> 00:29:03.910
We have some of this?

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:04.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.980
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.810
And then again,
maybe the C-C bonds,

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.950
sometimes those are in
the [INAUDIBLE] region.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:10.685
You probably won't.

00:29:10.685 --> 00:29:12.518
Don't spend too much
time looking for these.

00:29:12.518 --> 00:29:16.560
These are kind of there
but not easy to see.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.990
So now if we look
at our product,

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.313
what do we expect to
be in our product,

00:29:20.313 --> 00:29:22.230
assuming we don't have
any water because we've

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.880
done our distillation and
our extractions very well?

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:38.080
We have a C double-bond O.
A C single-bond O. A C-H.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.030
Do we have an O-H?

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:44.460
So what are we going
to look for in our IR

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.390
to tell if we still have
starting material in there

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.176
or not?

00:29:48.176 --> 00:29:50.503
AUDIENCE: The O-H [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:50.503 --> 00:29:51.920
SARAH HEWETT: The
O-H. And so this

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.253
will still have a C double-bond
O, so that one might not

00:29:54.253 --> 00:29:56.780
be as easy to tell.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.690
But we definitely should
not have an O-H peak.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:02.420
So if you take your Ir fractions
and you take your fractions,

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.920
you take the IR of
them and then you

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.460
start to see the O-H, the
characteristic O-H peak

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:10.043
up way by like
3,000 wave numbers,

00:30:10.043 --> 00:30:11.960
then you may want to
test a different fraction

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.793
because that one either
has some water in it

00:30:13.793 --> 00:30:17.738
or it still has some of
your starting material.

00:30:17.738 --> 00:30:20.030
And then once you've determined
which of your fractions

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.070
is the most pure, then
you will continue on

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.002
with that to do the rest of our
characterization techniques.

00:30:25.002 --> 00:30:26.460
And the first one
of those is going

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.877
to be boiling point
determination.

00:30:27.877 --> 00:30:31.368
So we can determine the
boiling point of the ester,

00:30:31.368 --> 00:30:33.160
and that is a characteristic
of each ester.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.020
So you have a chart.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.130
That chart at the
beginning of the lab,

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.825
it has a list of all
the boiling points.

00:30:36.825 --> 00:30:38.385
So we will measure the
boiling point of your ester,

00:30:38.385 --> 00:30:39.480
but before we do
that, we're going

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.700
to calibrate the thermometer
just like we calibrated

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.488
the melting point apparatus.

00:30:43.488 --> 00:30:45.780
So at this time, there are
only two calibration points.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.942
So you'll measure the
freezing point of water.

00:30:47.942 --> 00:30:48.900
So you'll get a beaker.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.480
You'll fill it up
with ice, some water,

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.463
let the temperature
reach equilibrium.

00:30:53.463 --> 00:30:55.380
And you want make sure
there's still ice in it

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.005
when you measure so
that it's not water

00:30:57.005 --> 00:30:59.580
and it's not heating back
up to room temperature.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.630
And then you will
measure the temperature

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:02.005
of the very cold
water after it's

00:31:02.005 --> 00:31:03.570
sat for about 10 to 15 minutes.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:07.770
While you're doing that, you can
also heat up a beaker of water

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.342
on a hot plate, measure it
and heat it up to boiling,

00:31:11.342 --> 00:31:13.050
and then you will
measure the temperature

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.710
of the boiling water.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.910
And there's a correction
factor in the lab manual

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.410
that you will use to calculate
the theoretical boiling point

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.880
of water at whatever the
atmospheric pressure is

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.380
on that day.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.090
So you'll go get the
barometer from the lab

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.410
like we brought
down to the river.

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:26.760
You can measure
the pressure in lab

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.740
because we know that
boiling point is related

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.170
to the pressure in the
atmosphere and the vapor

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.420
pressure, so there is a
correction factor for that.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.355
And then you will plot your
theoretical boiling points

00:31:37.355 --> 00:31:39.480
and your theoretical freezing
point versus the ones

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.855
you actually
measure, and that'll

00:31:40.855 --> 00:31:43.908
give you a two-point calibration
curve for your thermometer

00:31:43.908 --> 00:31:46.200
that you're going to use to
determine the boiling point

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.798
of your ester.

00:31:47.798 --> 00:31:50.340
The apparatus that we will use
to determine the boiling point

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.552
of the ester is like so.

00:31:52.552 --> 00:31:53.760
You will have your hot plate.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.680
Then you'll have a sand
bath, and then you're

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.180
going to use a very
small test tube.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.340
And you will put a very
tiny amount of your ester

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.110
in, maybe a milliliter.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.160
And then you will
suspend the thermometer.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.290
We're going to use
digital thermometers.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.480
You'll suspend the
thermometer a few centimeters

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.660
above the surface
of your liquid,

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.938
and when you heat this up,
your liquid will vaporize.

00:32:11.938 --> 00:32:13.980
It'll hit the thermometer
tip and it'll condense,

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.340
so you'll see drips coming off
of the tip of your thermometer.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:22.560
And the temperature will start
to go up, and you want to wait.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.982
So the second thing that you'll
need is a lot of patience.

00:32:24.982 --> 00:32:26.440
So the temperature
will go up very,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.082
very slowly as the vapor
reaches the boiling point.

00:32:30.082 --> 00:32:32.415
So if you've ever boiled water
and you cooked something,

00:32:32.415 --> 00:32:34.457
you know that you'll start
to see steam and water

00:32:34.457 --> 00:32:37.140
vapor before the liquid
itself is boiling.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.140
Same thing happens here.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.432
You'll start to see the drips,
but then the temperature

00:32:40.432 --> 00:32:41.440
may still be going up.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.510
So this is one of
those things that you

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.893
don't want to sit there and
watch because you will become

00:32:44.893 --> 00:32:46.560
very impatient and
you'll say, oh, good,

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.435
the temperature hasn't
changed in 30 seconds.

00:32:48.435 --> 00:32:49.380
This must be it.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.800
But then if you come
back in five minutes,

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.900
the temperature
has indeed gone up,

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.890
and then you have the
incorrect boiling point.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.140
So this is one of those
things you can set up and then

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.390
check on it after a while.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.250
And once the temperature
stops increasing,

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.583
that will be your boiling point.

00:33:02.833 --> 00:33:04.250
The next thing
that you will do is

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.260
you will determine the
density of your unknown,

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.110
and this is our density
instrument that is in the lab.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:13.580
So instead of having to
measure the mass and the volume

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.650
yourself to get grams
over milliliters, which

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.340
is our unit of density,
you can inject your sample

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.070
into the side of
this instrument.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.380
So there's the little
lower-lock valve here,

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.275
and there's a syringe, so you
will inject your sample in

00:33:27.275 --> 00:33:29.210
and it'll fill up this tube.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.805
The instrument stays
at 20 degrees Celsius

00:33:31.805 --> 00:33:34.370
so that we know for sure that
it is the density at 20 degrees

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.790
Celsius.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.255
And then you will
press Go and it

00:33:37.255 --> 00:33:38.630
will measure the
density for you,

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.600
and it'll pop out the
density number right there.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.490
So very simple, and
then you can use that

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.670
as an identifying
characteristic of your ester,

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.170
and you can compare that again
to the chart in the beginning

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.960
of the lab manual to use
as information to help

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.020
you identify your unknown.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.970
Then we're going to
measure refractive index.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.920
We talked about
refractometry a little bit

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.130
in the essential oil lab.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.630
In the essential oil lab, we
used it to-- oh, that's a typo.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.120
In the essential oil lab,
we used the refractometer

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.270
to determine the purity of
our samples, but in this lab,

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:12.060
we're going to use it
as an identification

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.620
technique for our esters.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.290
So every liquid has a
characteristic refractive

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.773
index, so we can measure the
refractive index, compare it

00:34:18.773 --> 00:34:20.940
to the literature value,
and that will also help you

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.980
identify your unknown ester.

00:34:26.142 --> 00:34:28.100
The second to last
technique we're going to use

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.330
is NMR spectroscopy.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.699
And how many of
you guys have seen

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:36.480
NMR before in your classes?

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.980
A few people.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:43.050
All right, so in, I
think about two weeks,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.815
Walt Massefski, who is the
Director of the NMR Facility

00:34:45.815 --> 00:34:47.190
here in the
chemistry department,

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:52.060
is going to come and do a very,
very thorough lecture on NMR

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.607
and how it works and
how to interpret it.

00:34:55.607 --> 00:34:58.190
Unfortunately, that lecture will
happen after some of you guys

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.670
take these spectra
in the actual lab,

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.850
so I will do a quick briefing on
NMR because we have some time.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.520
And then again, stay tuned.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.640
You will get a much, much
better idea of this technique

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.910
from Walt in a couple of weeks.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:19.010
So NMR spectroscopy,
the idea behind it

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.380
is that it uses a very
strong magnetic field

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.967
to align nuclear spin states.

00:35:23.967 --> 00:35:26.300
And you don't have to know
too much about that, at least

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.207
for right now.

00:35:27.207 --> 00:35:28.790
I'm sure Walt will
talk more about it.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.720
But the hydrogen nucleus has
a spin associated with it,

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.610
and if you apply a magnetic
field in a certain direction,

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:40.760
the spin can either align
with the magnetic field, which

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.492
is the lower energy
state, or it can

00:35:43.492 --> 00:35:45.950
go against the magnetic field,
which is a little bit higher

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:46.450
in energy.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:48.500
And so this is a
difference in energy here.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.180
So once you have your
protons in your field--

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.555
and you can do other nuclei
too, but we're going to focus

00:35:58.555 --> 00:36:00.490
on protons for the moment--

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.990
there's a radio
frequency pulse that

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:07.220
is applied that causes some
of these spins to flip.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.600
And then you remove the radio
frequency pulse, reapply

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.190
the magnetic field,
and then you wait

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:16.265
for the spin states to go
back down to the ground state.

00:36:16.265 --> 00:36:18.390
And because there's an
energy difference associated

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:19.973
with getting the
spin to flip, there's

00:36:19.973 --> 00:36:23.430
also an energy difference
associated with when it

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.150
goes back to its ground state.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.540
So it will emit energy
at a certain frequency

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.750
depending on the
environment of the proton.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:34.710
We can measure the energy
that gets emitted and plotted,

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.810
Fourier-transform it, and
then you get an NMR spectrum.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.870
This is the really quick,
five-minute version.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.150
This will make a lot more sense
when Walt talks about it later.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.820
So the important
thing to note here

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.330
is that the frequency of the
energy that a proton emits

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.030
as it changes spin state is
related to the environment

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.310
of the proton.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:58.490
So we can use this
to get information

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.070
about the different
protons in our molecule,

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.190
and we can determine
connectivity,

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.750
the number of
protons that we have,

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.000
and some information about
how they're bonded together

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.430
depending on the different
NMR experiments that you do.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.310
And the three major
pieces of information

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.210
that we will be using in our
lab are the chemical shift

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:18.000
of the proton--

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.960
so that's again related to
the frequency of the energy--

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.720
the integration-- this tells
you how many protons there are--

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.500
and then sometimes the coupling.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.410
So if there are protons
next to each other,

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.030
they will split
each other's signals

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:32.970
and you'll get multiple
lines in your NMR spectrum.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.750
So as a really,
really quick example,

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:39.870
we can look at our favorite
ester here, ethyl acetate,

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.620
and we can look at the different
types of protons that it has.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:49.190
So how many types of protons
are in this molecule?

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.830
Three.

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:55.120
So we have these methyl protons
here, the ethyl protons here,

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.690
and then these methyl
protons over there.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.650
So these three are all in the
same chemical environment.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.400
These are in the same
chemical environment

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.358
and these are in the same
chemical environment.

00:38:05.358 --> 00:38:08.080
So we should expect to see
three signals in the NMR

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.620
spectrum of ethyl acetate.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.810
So the way that an NMR
spectrum is laid out,

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:21.540
it's on a scale of 0
to 12, give or take.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.090
It can go beyond that,
but for the purposes

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.550
of most organic molecules,
all of the peaks

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.480
will be found in this region.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.620
And the location
that a peak appears

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.480
or a proton peak
appears is again

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.730
related to its
chemical environment.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.590
And the things
that are very alkyl

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.570
or have a lot of
stages around them

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.800
are going to be further upfield.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.870
We call this upfield
with a lower PPM number.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:55.840
And things that are
closer to oxygens

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.550
or electron-withdrawing
groups are

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.500
going to be-- they
call it deshielded.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.540
So the electrons are withdrawn
away from those protons.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.810
It doesn't shield= them from
the magnetic field as much.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:12.940
So they come up more
downfield, and the way that you

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:18.890
can remember that is
downfield or deshielded

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:21.530
both start with D.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:27.980
And so if we look at these
protons, which of these do

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.370
we think is going to be the most
upfield or the furthest away

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:34.590
from all of our oxygens?

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.090
This stuff all the
way on the right?

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.700
Yeah.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.940
I just want to make sure
that I am doing this right.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.840
So yes, these
methyl protons will

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.317
be the furthest to the right,
and you'll get a signal here.

00:39:51.317 --> 00:39:53.150
And so this signal, the
chemical shift value

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:57.460
will be somewhere
probably around 1 or 2.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.220
And then the integration tells
you how many protons it's for,

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.970
and that shows up down
here at the bottom.

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:05.070
So how many protons
will the signal equal?

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.840
Three from our methyl group.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.460
All right, so if we look
at the remaining two

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:15.810
groups, which one do we think
would be kind of the middle?

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.370
All the way on the left.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:23.700
So these protons here are right
next to an oxygen, so they're

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.760
going to be more deshielded, and
these have a carbon in between,

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.390
so these will be
our next signal.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:30.847
So then we'll have
another signal here.

00:40:30.847 --> 00:40:31.555
How many protons?

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.510
From this group, three.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.950
And so that leaves our
methylene group over here.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.260
That will have another signal
that's further downfield,

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:48.820
and this one will
be two protons.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.440
So already, you
can see that there

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.540
are different ways
that you can use this

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.590
to identify your molecules.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:59.037
So if you count up the number
of different unique protons

00:40:59.037 --> 00:41:01.620
there are, then you can look at
the number of signals you see,

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.560
and that is one way to
identify your product.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.560
You can also use
the coupling, which

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:12.610
is what is going to break these
signals into not just one peak,

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.090
but it'll be a few.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:16.300
So coupling happens
when there are protons

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.960
that are next to each other.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:23.040
So this methyl group is next
to two other protons, right.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.800
And so each of these protons,
each of its neighbors,

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.470
will split this signal one time.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:35.150
So if you have your signal
and it gets split once,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.500
then you have two
signals, and then

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.790
if it gets split again
in an equal magnitude,

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:43.320
you end up with three signals.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.680
So this splitting kind
of combines and this peak

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.430
gets a little bit bigger.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.110
So this is what is
called a triplet.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:59.060
So if you have two
neighbors, you get a triplet.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.240
So this peak, that methyl
group will actually

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.960
look something like this.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.210
It'll have three peaks
to it with the middle one

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.543
being the biggest, and that's
the characteristic pattern

00:42:11.543 --> 00:42:14.130
of a triplet.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.390
What about our ethyl group
here, or ethylene group,

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.390
methylene group?

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:20.690
We have our two protons.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:25.910
How many neighbors does this
group have, proton neighbors?

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:30.790
So this has three neighbors.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:33.790
So that signal is going
to get split three times.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:34.870
So you'll split it once.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.420
Split it again, so that
would be our triplet.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:50.940
And then if we split it a
third time, we get four lines.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.820
So this proton
signal will actually

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.470
look something like that.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.610
How many proton
neighbors does this have?

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:04.960
None, so will this get split?

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.640
No.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.070
So this will stay as a
singlet, one single peak,

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.215
because it does not have
any proton neighbors.

00:43:16.935 --> 00:43:19.600
So anyone have any questions
about where all of this

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.100
came from?

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:32.072
So again, that was the
super quick version of NMR

00:43:32.072 --> 00:43:34.280
and the type of information
that you can get from it.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.170
So when you are looking
at the structures

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.765
of the potential esters
that you think you may have,

00:43:38.765 --> 00:43:40.670
you can probably
narrow it down based

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.230
on your boiling point in your
refractive index, your density.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.730
And you can narrow
it down to a few,

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.480
and then you will draw
out the structures.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.420
And then you can,
based on the structure,

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.480
predict how many NMR
signals you expect to see.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.537
And you can figure out what
you expect the splitting to be,

00:43:56.537 --> 00:43:58.370
so if you expect them
to all be single peaks

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:02.580
or if you expect to see
different types of multiplets.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.620
And then when you get
your NMR spectrum,

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.702
you can compare the
number of peaks,

00:44:06.702 --> 00:44:07.910
the integration of the peaks.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:09.510
So if you know that you
have a methyl group,

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:12.060
you should be looking for some
signals that integrate to 3.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:18.960
And that is how you can use
this as a technique to identify

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.000
the structure of your unknown.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:25.800
And again, Walt will do a
much better job explaining

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.487
all of this in a bit.

00:44:27.487 --> 00:44:29.070
But just so you've
seen it, before you

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.860
get a chance to take
your spectrum in lab,

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.720
that is a quick introduction.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.615
So once you have all
of this information,

00:44:38.615 --> 00:44:40.740
you have your boiling point,
your refractive index,

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.860
your density, your NMR
spectrum, your IR spectrum,

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.990
you're going to attempt
to identify your unknown,

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:47.460
and this should all happen
at the end of day three.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.630
You'll have all of
this information,

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.950
and then you'll be overwhelmed.

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.750
You'll sit down,
put it all together

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.690
and try to figure out which of
those unknowns in that table

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.427
is the one that you made.

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:58.010
You'll fill out an
identification form

00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:59.720
that your TAs will
give you, and then

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.887
you will bring it to your
TA at the beginning of day

00:45:01.887 --> 00:45:04.550
four on the lab and you
will say, this is my ester.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.070
And they will tell you if
you are right or wrong,

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.060
and you'll find out that day
if you were correct or not.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.843
And then you will do
one more technique

00:45:11.843 --> 00:45:13.010
for your final confirmation.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.710
So if you already know,
then your mass spectrum

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.090
should be super
confirmation for you.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.850
And if you were a
little bit off, then

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.225
hopefully your
mass spectrum will

00:45:21.225 --> 00:45:22.910
be that last piece
that helps you to get

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:26.880
your final identification.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.130
Mass spectrometry, you have
already seen a little bit.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.365
We did the ICPMS
in our last lab.

00:45:32.365 --> 00:45:34.240
But there are different,
many different types

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.130
of mass spectrometry, and
a bunch of different ways

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:37.550
that you can use that technique.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.820
So ICP uses plasma to
break the compounds apart

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.340
into their atoms and ionizes
the compounds that way,

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.308
if you remember, hopefully.

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:45.850
What we're going to
be doing this lab

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.320
is electronic impact
mass spectrometry,

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.410
which instead of
using plasma just

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:54.550
shoots a high-energy beam of
electrons at your molecule.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.080
And it doesn't
have enough energy

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.930
to break your molecule apart
into its atoms or anything,

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:01.030
but what's going to
happen is the electrons

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.880
will hit the compound and
it will eject an electron

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.060
from the compound.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.595
So you'll make what is
called a radical cation.

00:46:07.595 --> 00:46:10.220
So it'll have one less electron,
so it'll be a positive charge,

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.720
but it only lost one electron,
and since it's organic-y,

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.480
it will be a radical.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.640
This also frequently
causes the molecule

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.290
to break apart, not always.

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.853
Sometimes you will
get the radical cation

00:46:22.853 --> 00:46:24.520
of your whole molecule
that will make it

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.937
through the mass
detector, and you

00:46:25.937 --> 00:46:29.950
will get the mass of
your actual compound.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.450
And other times,
it'll break apart

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.000
and you will see a bunch of
pieces of your compounds.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.910
You'll see the mass of different
fragments of your molecule.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:42.960
So you can use either the
mass of your molecular ion--

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.120
so I'll show you what this
looks like in a second.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.330
So this is what the
instrument looks like.

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:51.070
It's right near the ICPMS.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:54.940
You may or may not have seen
it, and it is slightly older

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:58.218
and looks a lot like the GC
that we talked about before

00:46:58.218 --> 00:46:59.260
in the essential oil lab.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.760
And that is because
this is actually

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.750
a GC mass spectrometer.

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:03.977
So you inject your compound.

00:47:03.977 --> 00:47:05.810
It actually goes through
gas chromatography,

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:06.880
so if you have more
than one compound,

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.962
it'll split it into the
different compounds.

00:47:08.962 --> 00:47:10.420
And then it'll take
a mass spectrum

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.250
of each of those compounds.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.493
We hopefully are only going to
be injecting one compound in,

00:47:15.493 --> 00:47:17.410
so you hopefully purified
it sufficiently well

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:18.190
at this point.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:20.065
But then it'll still
give us a mass spectrum,

00:47:20.065 --> 00:47:22.370
and the mass spectrum
looks like this.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:26.807
So this is our mass-to-charge
ratio or our mass units.

00:47:26.807 --> 00:47:29.140
So usually, the furthest
thing, the heaviest thing, that

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.340
is where you will
look to see if that

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.990
matches with the
expected molecular weight

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.560
of your compound.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.610
That's your molecular ion.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.110
So if it gets hit
with the electron,

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.815
forms a radical cation and
doesn't break apart anymore,

00:47:37.815 --> 00:47:39.690
you will see a peak at
your molecular weight.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:44.198
And so that is a giveaway
of yes, this is my molecule.

00:47:44.198 --> 00:47:45.490
Sometimes, that doesn't happen.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:47.532
If it's really unstable,
it'll break into pieces,

00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:50.230
and you will see--
so each of these

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:54.430
represents a piece of the
molecule that has broken off.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.340
So frequently, you'll
see losses of 15.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.110
So that's when a methyl
group breaks off.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.990
And Dr. Dolan will
be talking a lot more

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:03.657
about mass spectrometry
and what you

00:48:03.657 --> 00:48:05.740
will do with this information
and how it all works

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.350
in another lecture coming up.

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:10.270
Just to give you, again,
an idea before you

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.130
see it and have to
do it in the lab.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:13.180
This is just a quick
overview and you'll

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.013
get a lot more detail
about what all of this

00:48:15.013 --> 00:48:18.420
means coming up in a
couple of lectures.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.320
Last but not least, safety for
this lab is very important.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.900
The carboxylic acids
are corrosive and toxic.

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.730
They smell terrible.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:27.660
You can ask Tristan.

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.520
He was the one who made
all of the unknowns.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.370
And Brydon did the alcohols,
so he got it slightly better,

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:39.210
but Tristan will tell you
that the carboxylic acids are

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:41.280
very nasty to work with.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.647
Sulfuric acid is also
highly corrosive,

00:48:43.647 --> 00:48:45.480
so you don't want to
get that on your hands.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.620
And then you want to
vent the sep funnel,

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.890
like we said, away from people.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.080
So if you're working
in a hood with someone,

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.040
make sure that
they're not around.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.582
Don't turn around
to talk to somebody

00:48:51.582 --> 00:48:54.087
and point it in their face.

00:48:54.087 --> 00:48:55.670
The starting materials
smell very bad.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:57.170
Your product will
smell really nice,

00:48:57.170 --> 00:49:00.720
but it'll still smell a lot,
so keep everything in the hood.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.480
This is a very, very smelly lab.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.370
Even if you keep everything in
the hood, if you're walking by,

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:06.500
which everybody is doing
this, you will know.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.770
So we want to limit
the amount of fumes

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:09.770
that get out in the lab.

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:11.240
Keep everything in the hood.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.920
Do not put vials
in the glass waste.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.000
If anything breaks, or if
you like break a pipette

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.750
or if you break a
beaker or something that

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:21.145
has contacted your solutions
from the ester lab,

00:49:21.145 --> 00:49:23.270
there will be a separate
waste container for those.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.952
Your TAs will come around with
a capped, plastic solid-waste

00:49:25.952 --> 00:49:27.410
container to collect
all your vials

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:29.690
so that they are not
in the glass waste

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:32.910
stinking up the entire lab.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:34.230
And this is key for everybody.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.430
Regardless of what
lab you're doing--

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:36.550
so starting on
Wednesday and Thursday,

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.383
we're going to be doing
three different labs

00:49:38.383 --> 00:49:40.800
at the same time, and we're
going to try to keep the waste

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.160
containers in the bays
with the proper labs

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.390
they're associated with.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.510
But pay attention
to the waste labels.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:49.530
Read the red tag.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.430
If you're holding
something and you're

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:52.218
going to put it in
the waste container,

00:49:52.218 --> 00:49:53.760
take the extra second
to make sure it

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.130
is the right one for the
lab that you are doing.

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:58.710
There will be three different
sets of waste containers

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:02.820
out there, and we do not want to
mix in between, especially not

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.190
acetone with the catalase waste.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.400
If you remember from before--

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.650
we may have talked about this.

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.858
You will hear about it again.

00:50:09.858 --> 00:50:13.980
If you mix the acetone from
any of these organic-y labs

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.140
with the hydrogen peroxide
from the catalse waste,

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.840
you will generate explosives.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.840
So we are not going to
do that because everybody

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.300
is going to read the labels
and dispose of their waste

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.460
properly in this lab,
and keep everything

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.090
in the hood that should be.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:28.930
Good?

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:30.780
Excellent.

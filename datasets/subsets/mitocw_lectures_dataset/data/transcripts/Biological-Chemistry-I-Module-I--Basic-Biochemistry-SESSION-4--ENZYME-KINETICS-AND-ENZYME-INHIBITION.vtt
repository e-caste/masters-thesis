00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.930
BOGDAN FEDELES: Hi, and welcome
to 5.07 biochemistry online.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.260
I'm Dr. Bogdan Fedeles.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.810
Let's metabolize some problems.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.570
Now, I have here
problem two of problem

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.370
set three, which is
an excellent exercise

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.070
about the mechanism of
inhibition of enzymes,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.380
specifically proteases.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.820
Now, this deals with
the same protease

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.220
from problem one of this problem
set, which is interleukin

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.430
converting enzyme, or ICE.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.560
Therefore, it's best that
you familiarize yourself

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
with the mechanism of
action of this enzyme, ICE,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.300
by solving problem 1 and then
continuing with this video,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.800
here.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.620
As you found out by
solving problem one,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.110
ICE is a cysteine protease.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.520
It features cysteine and a
histidine in its active site.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.740
The mechanism starts
by the histidine

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.460
acting as a general base and
deprotonates the cysteine SH

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.780
group.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.180
The thiolate anion
then can attack

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.020
the substrate, forming first,
a tetrahedral intermediate.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.210
When this tetrahedral
intermediate collapses,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.270
it cleaves the peptide
bond and accomplishes

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.330
the chemical reaction
of the protease.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.910
Then, the newly
formed thioester is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.200
hydrolyzed to release the
other half of the product.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.060
Let's take a look
at the mechanism.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.060
Here is our peptide substrate.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.100
And this is the
peptide bond that's

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.860
going to be cleaved by protease.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.820
As we mentioned, we have a
cysteine in the active site

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.130
and we have a histidine
that's just going

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.795
to function as a general base.

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.590
I'm going to denote it as B.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.650
In the first step,
the histidine is going

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.970
to deprotonate the cysteine.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.540
The cysteine is
then going to attack

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.500
the carbonyl of
our peptide bond,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.380
and the electrons are
going to go to the oxygen,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.415
and form a tetrahedral
intermediate.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:58.090
Here, notice the histidine
is going to be protonated,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.900
and the oxygen is going
to have a negative charge.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.330
In the next step, this
tetrahedral intermediate

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.630
is going to fall
apart by breaking

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.690
the peptide bond that the
protease is supposed to cleave.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.270
There is the thioester with
the cysteine in the active site

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:34.450
and one half of our product
is going to be released, here.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.280
Once again, the
histidine is going

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.670
to be deprotonated at this step.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.470
In the second
step, the thioester

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.340
we just formed in
the active site

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.310
will be hydrolyzed by
a water molecule, which

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.470
will be activated by the same
histidine in the active site.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.843
Here is our water molecule.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.600
So, the histidine is going
to deprotonate the water,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.340
activating it for attack on the
carbonyl, forming once again,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.065
a tetrahedral intermediate.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.870
I have a negative charge
here and a positive charge

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.690
on the histidine.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.950
Finally, this
tetrahedral intermediate

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:37.380
will collapse, restoring the
cysteine in the active site,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.350
which can be reprotonated
by the protonated histidine,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.505
and releasing the second
half of our substrate, here.

00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:03.300
So there you have it.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.250
Now we restored the active
site with the cysteine

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.580
and the histidine.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.330
And this is the second half of
our peptide that we cleaved.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.610
So notice the carboxyl
side is right here

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.040
and the amine side was
released a little bit earlier.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.720
The mechanism that
you just saw is

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.600
very similar to
the serine protease

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.570
mechanism that is
described in the book

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.980
and in the lecture notes.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.340
Notice, every time we form
a tetrahedral intermediate,

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.840
this is probably
stabilized in an oxyanion

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.400
hole formed by some
of the residues

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.080
on the backbone of the enzyme.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.470
Now let's take a
look at a couple

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.020
of strategies for inhibiting
a cysteine protease like ICE.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.150
This problem is
proposing two strategies.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.810
One involves an
aldehyde inhibitor,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.040
the other involving an acyl
methyl ketone inhibitor.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.130
Let's take a look.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.800
Here is the structure of a
proposed aldehyde inhibitor.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.780
Notice here, this is a aspartate
residue, or aspartate looking

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.220
residue, which together with
the other couple of amino acids,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.610
forms the recognition
portion of the inhibitor

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.180
that we're allowing
to bind the protease.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.610
The R group is going to
be an aldehyde, which

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.080
will be crucial for actually
inhibiting the enzyme.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.210
Question one of this
problem is asking

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.920
us to propose a
mechanism by which

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.890
the aldehyde inhibitor works.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.630
We're given an
important clue that this

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.550
is a mechanism based inhibitor.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.610
A mechanism based
inhibitor means

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.030
that the inhibitor binds
in the same fashion

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.770
as the normal substrate
of the enzyme.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.120
Therefore, after
we have reviewed

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.550
the mechanism of the
cysteine protease

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.400
and remembering some of
our carbonyl chemistry,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.880
we should be able to propose
the following chemical reaction.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.260
Here is the active
site of our protease.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.330
This is the cysteine and
this is the histidine,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.410
which we're denoting
as a general base, B.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.090
And here's our
aldehyde inhibitor,

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.750
which I'm going to just show
the aldehydic group, right here.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.950
Since the R group
next to this aldehyde

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.290
resembles very closely
the natural substrate

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.970
of the enzyme,
this aldehyde group

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.510
will be positioned in the same
place where we would normally

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.770
find the peptide bond that
will be cleaved by the enzyme.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.960
Therefore, this thiolate
group, once it forms,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.250
will be in great position
to react with the aldehyde

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.557
and form a tetrahedral
intermediate.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.710
Therefore, the histidine
deprotonates the cysteine,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.480
and the cysteine can
then attack the carbonyl

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.710
to form a tetrahedral
intermediate.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:22.060
Therefore, we get this
tetrahedral intermediate

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.600
and a protonated histidine base.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:35.940
Now normally, the reaction
would proceed from here

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.220
to form a thioester, but
because this is an aldehyde,

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.010
the reaction stops
here, and that's

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.290
how the enzyme will be
inhibited because we have now

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.270
bound this inhibitor.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.110
We'll have it covalently
bound in the active site

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.230
to this cysteine.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.390
An interesting observation,
which you can't really

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.940
tell from the problem,
when people looked

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.950
at the x-ray structure of
this tetrahedral intermediate,

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.960
they noticed that the negative
charge on the oxygen is not,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.230
in fact, stabilized
in the oxyanion hole

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.630
that would stabilize such
tetrahedral intermediates

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.540
for the normal reaction.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.400
The ability of
the aldehyde group

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.380
to react with the cysteine
in the active site

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.040
and form a covalent
bond can readily

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.560
explain why the molecule would
function as an inhibitor.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.820
Nevertheless, the reaction
between the aldehyde

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.220
and the nucleophile,
the thiolate,

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.740
is readily reversible.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.200
So whenever the inhibitor
is in its carbonyl form,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.150
it can potentially fall off from
the active site of the enzyme.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.280
Therefore, how good
of an inhibitor

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.460
this molecule is will
depend on how tight

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.000
it binds to the enzyme, and
not necessarily on the fact

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.190
that it forms a covalent
bond in the active site.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.490
This is an example of
a reversible inhibitor,

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.400
even though it forms a
covalent bond with the enzyme.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.090
Therefore, its ability
to inhibit an enzyme

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.340
will depend on the
relative concentration

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.040
between the inhibitor
and the natural substrate

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.060
of the enzyme.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.600
Let's remember the
Michaelis-Menten equation

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:20.110
written for a
reversible inhibitor.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.710
As you recall, we have an enzyme
reacting with a substrate.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.010
We have k1 and k
minus 1 the rate

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:31.030
constant to form the enzyme
substrate complex, which

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.710
then with k2, is going
to form the product

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.710
and reform the enzyme.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.430
But the inhibitor will
react with the enzyme

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:49.300
in the absence of the
substrate in an equilibrium,

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.540
forming an enzyme
inhibitor complex which

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.880
does not lead to any product.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.050
The constant of
this equilibrium,

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.840
I'm going to call
it Ki, and this

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.090
is the dissociation constant of
the enzyme inhibitor complex.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.990
As you have seen in
the notes, the rate,

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.450
taking into account the
inhibition constant here,

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.315
the rate v is going to be
Vmax times the concentration

00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:17.710
of the substrate over Km.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.870
This is Michaelis
constant for the enzyme.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.670
Times 1 plus
concentration of inhibitor

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:34.510
over Ki plus concentration
of substrate, s.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:41.170
Now, this equation
tells us exactly how

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.320
the rate is going to
change as we increase

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.720
or decrease the concentration
of the inhibitor.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.800
Notice here, that this term
is always greater than 1

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.800
because concentration and Ki are
going to be positive numbers.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.660
So this is 1 plus
something positive.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.540
It's always going to
be greater than 1,

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.190
therefore, the denominator
is going to be bigger

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.900
than if we had Km
times 1 plus s.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.300
So in the absence
of the inhibitor,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.320
the denominator is
going to be Km plus s.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.270
Therefore, when we
add the inhibitor,

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.210
this denominator gets
bigger, and therefore

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.490
the whole fraction gets smaller.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.530
We get a smaller rate.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.370
This is the basis for why
the inhibitor will inhibit

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.190
the enzyme, and therefore
the rate of the reaction

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.110
is going to be smaller.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.970
To see this graphically,
we can write

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.540
the reciprocal of the equation
and look at the Lineweaver-Burk

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.560
plot.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.540
The reciprocal of the equation
is going to be 1/v equals--

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.350
and if we crunch
the numbers, going

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:59.950
to come up with Km/Vmax
times 1 plus I/Ki times 1/s

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.330
plus 1/Vmax.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.510
Let's plot this.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:21.260
I'm going to have 1/v and
here I'm going to have 1/s.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.450
Now, if the concentration
of substrate

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:28.790
is really, really high, 1/s
is going to be almost zero.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:33.940
So at the limit, when 1/s is
zero, then we should get v

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.030
equals Vmax.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.300
So therefore, let's
say here it's 1/Vmax,

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.110
and therefore without
any inhibitor,

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:47.340
we're going to get a line
that looks like this.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:57.640
Now, as we're adding an
inhibitor, this slope--

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.710
that is the coefficient or 1/s--

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.390
is going to be increasing.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.950
Therefore, we should
get higher slopes.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.540
The higher the concentration
of I, the bigger the slope.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.480
So it's going to look like this.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.430
So as concentration
of I increases,

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.090
the slope of this
graph will increase.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.210
Notice however, that
all these lines,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.750
even though correspond
to slower rates,

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.790
as the concentration of
substrate increases--

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.030
that is 1/s gets closer to 0--

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:38.110
they will all converge
to the same Vmax.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.960
This is the key feature of
a competitive inhibition

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.870
because the substrate
in high quantities

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.500
can out compete the inhibitor.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.220
Nevertheless, this
mechanism only

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.700
applies when the binding of
an inhibitor to the enzyme

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.430
is fast and reversible.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.070
If the binding is
not reversible,

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:04.330
obviously the enzyme will
be inactivated forever,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.600
and then we will see a
time dependent inactivation

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.250
of the enzyme.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.750
The same phenomenon will happen
if the reverse reaction, that

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.150
is the dissociation of the
inhibitor from the enzyme,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.310
is a slow process as well.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.310
All these considerations
form a comprehensive answer

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.110
for part one of the problem.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.290
Question two asked us to provide
several reasons for which

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.240
aldehyde inhibitors
are not actually

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.450
desirable as therapeutics.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.740
Once again, we have to think
about the carbonyl chemistry.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.260
We saw here that aldehydes
can react very well

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.470
with nucleophiles such
as thiols and thiolates.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:53.370
But aldehydes in solution
can react with water and form

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.020
what we call geminal diols.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.940
That look like this.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:05.470
Therefore, the
effective concentration

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.410
of the aldehyde in solution
will be diminished because

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.740
of this equilibrium,
and that inhibitor

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.000
might not be efficient at
that lower concentration.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.340
Another consideration involves
the oxidation of aldehydes.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.680
These could be
enzymatically or even

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.570
non-enzymatically oxidized
to form carboxylic acids

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.010
or carboxylates.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:35.590
These would obviously
not be very reactive

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.430
and any inhibitor
that gets oxidized

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.130
will stop being an inhibitor.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.020
Additionally, owing
to their reactivity,

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.860
aldehyde group could react
with many other biomolecules.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.380
Think about the amino
acid side chains.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.720
Many of them are
actually, in fact,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.030
capable of reacting
with aldehydes.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.820
This will also diminish
the effective concentration

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.470
of the inhibitor and it may
even cause side effects.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.849
Therefore taking all
these into considerations,

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:08.681
aldehydes may not be a great
solution for therapeutics.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.319
Question 3 is asking us to
propose a mechanism by which

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:19.190
the second kind of inhibitor,
the acyloxymethyl ketone

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.670
is inhibiting the protease.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:26.270
As you see here, the
acyloxymethyl ketone

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.730
is actually very similar
to the aldehyde inhibitor.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.890
Notice this group
is exactly the same

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.560
as the carbonyl group
of the aldehyde,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.040
but instead of having
just the hydrogen,

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:48.380
we have a methylene next to
a aryloxy or acyloxy group.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.530
This, as you know, is a
very good leaving group

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:55.940
and provides a second reactive
site, this methyl group here,

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.280
that can react with the enzyme.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.260
The second kind of
inhibitor is in fact

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.890
very similar to the tosyl,
phenyl, chloro ketone inhibitor

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.560
of serine proteases,
which is discussed

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.240
at length in the lecture
notes and in the book.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.260
These inhibitors fall
in a general class

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.080
of alpha substituted
ketones and they

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.910
feature two reactive sites.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.770
One is the carbonyl
and the other one

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.860
is the methylene group, which
has attached a good leaving

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:22.480
group.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.910
Now, here is a general form
of a alpha substituted ketone.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.210
Here is the ketone, here is
the methylene group attached

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.720
to a good leaving group,
which I'm going to denote x.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.570
Now, here are the residues
in the active site.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.320
Here is the cysteine
with the thiol group,

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.980
and here is the histidine,
which I'm going to draw out.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.820
Histidine, all right.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.010
So as we saw
before, the reaction

00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.900
will start by the histidine
acting as a general base.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.530
The histidine deprotonates
the cysteine, which then

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:09.960
can attack the ketone carbonyl.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.868
This leads to the formation
of a tetrahedral intermediate.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.500
And we have a positive
charge, here on the histidine,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.060
and a negative charge
on the O minus, here.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.670
Now, this tetrahedral
intermediate presumably

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.250
will be stabilized
in an oxyanion hole,

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.640
as you guys have seen before
with some kind of hydrogen

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.030
bonds to the backbone
of the protein.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.730
Now, in the next step,
this is something

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:49.139
that you can't really
anticipate or know

00:19:49.139 --> 00:19:50.430
without doing some experiments.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:55.200
But it turns out this O minus
is a good SN2 nucleophile

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.470
to displace the good
leaving group, x.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:02.770
So we're going to
have an S2 reaction,

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.070
This O minus attacks
the carbon, and then

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.390
the x takes the
electrons and leaves.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.770
What we're going to
form here is an epoxide.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:24.380
All right, so this
is the epoxide

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.840
and we still have our
protonated histidine here.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.780
And there's a
positive charge here,

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.080
and of course, the x group is
taking its electrons and leaves

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.140
as an anion.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.430
Now, in the next step, because
this is sitting actually

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.770
close enough to the
epoxide, the epoxide

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.631
is going to get protonated.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.482
This takes the proton
from the histidine.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:16.300
So now we have a
protonated epoxide,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:25.860
and the histidine now is
in its deeper native form,

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:31.570
and the epoxide has
a positive charge.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.070
Now, because we have
a protonated epoxide,

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.520
this acts as a very
good leaving group,

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.020
and this carbon becomes
very susceptible for an SN2

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.250
reaction.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.440
And it turns out, the
histidine, this nitrogen,

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:51.460
is a good enough nucleophile to
react in an SN2 type reaction.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:22:03.569
And in fact, the reaction is
helped by this other nitrogen.

00:22:03.569 --> 00:22:05.110
I should have used
a different color.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.410
So what we're
getting out here is

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.270
a covalent bond
between the histidine

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:21.200
and the alpha position of the
original alpha substituted

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.470
ketone.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:27.230
Now, this reaction will not
be, in fact, reversible.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.750
So we should just
say one arrow only.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.550
So there we have our histidine.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.240
Now it's covalently
attached to our inhibitor

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.790
and this step is, in
fact, irreversible.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.480
So this prevents the
inhibitor from ever

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.440
dissociating once this
reaction has taken place.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.520
Now, even though this
tetrahedral intermediate

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.350
around the carbonyl
carbon, it can fall apart

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:18.260
as we saw before,
reforming the carbonyl

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:23.295
and the cysteine thiol, the
covalent bond to the histidine

00:23:23.295 --> 00:23:23.795
remains.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:37.890
And this is, in fact, the reason
for which these inhibitors

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:42.210
are irreversible and will show
a time dependent inhibition.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.880
Regardless of the more
complicated mechanistic detail

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.940
I just showed you,
the take home message

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.420
here is that when using an
alpha substituted ketone,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.870
the end result will
be a covalent bond

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.730
between the enzyme
and the inhibitor

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.600
that is not reversible.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.160
Therefore, we expect to see
a time dependent inactivation

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.480
of the enzyme.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.300
The more enzyme is being
taken out of the reaction

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.480
by the inhibitor, the slower
the overall reaction will

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.100
be until there is no more enzyme
left to catalyze the reaction.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.220
The problem also provides
some kinetic data,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.720
which, in fact, supports the
time dependent inhibition

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.720
features of the second
kind of inhibitor.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.200
In this figure, we see on
the y-axis, the concentration

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.500
of the product that is
formed, and on the x-axis

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.030
we see the time.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.330
Now, if we look at the
dark circles, which

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.890
is the control
reaction in which we

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.110
have some substrate,
but no inhibitor,

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:47.670
we see that the product is
produced and increases linearly

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.050
with time.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.330
However, once we
add the inhibitor

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:56.730
at a certain concentration, and
this would be the dark squares,

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.750
then we see that the amount of
product increases for a while,

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.800
but then it grows slower and
slower until it eventually

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.750
stops.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:11.280
Now at this point, if we
add an excess of substrate,

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.060
we see that the reaction
does not restart,

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.570
meaning the entire amount of
enzyme has been inactivated,

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:22.860
and this inactivation
is irreversible.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.550
However, we're also provided
this additional piece

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:27.360
of the data.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.500
If we run the reaction in
an excess of substrate,

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.180
we see here the open circles,
the amount of product

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.200
produced increases
linearly with time.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.440
But if we add the same
amount of inhibitor,

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.130
these open squares actually
are on top or right

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:51.690
next to the open circles
on this line, which

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.930
says that the inhibitor
has virtually no effect

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.990
at this level of concentration.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.520
Which tells us
that the inhibitor

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.500
is in fact competing
with the substrate

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.770
and we will have an
excess of the substrate.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.470
The inhibitor does not
get a chance to bind

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:12.180
and inhibit the enzyme, at least
within this interval of time.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:18.300
Now this way of plotting
kinetic data is perhaps

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.440
a little misleading because
the amount of product

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.480
that we obtained
from the reaction

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.940
does not reflect how much of
the enzyme gets inhibited.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:34.560
We want, in fact, to look at the
percentage of enzyme activity

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.970
that is remaining after
a given amount of time.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:48.480
Therefore, if we were to
plot percentage enzyme

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:58.520
activity versus time,
for a controlled reaction

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.710
we expect the
reaction to proceed,

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.430
and the enzyme to stay
just as active at any given

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.640
point in time, so we
will see a straight line.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.450
However, when we add
an inhibitor, which

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.120
shows a time
dependent inhibition,

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.600
then the percentage
enzyme activity

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.770
that remains at every point
in time will be decreasing.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:29.108
And in fact, will be
decreasing to the point

00:27:29.108 --> 00:27:31.450
that it reaches the
maximum of slope

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:36.730
for the maximum amount
of inhibitor present

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.980
in the reaction mixture.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.650
So this line
represents the fastest

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.740
that the enzyme can be
completely inactivated

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.180
by an inhibitor.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.540
It will be governed by
the binding affinity

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.000
of the inhibitor to the enzyme.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.620
This answers the third and
last question of this problem.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.630
I hope you enjoyed
this exploration

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:02.230
of the various strategies
by which inhibitors

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.520
can inhibit proteases.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.670
This problem
highlights, in fact,

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.010
the importance of understanding
the mechanism of action

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.420
of enzymes.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.130
Only then we can begin to
design therapeutically useful

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.280
inhibitors.

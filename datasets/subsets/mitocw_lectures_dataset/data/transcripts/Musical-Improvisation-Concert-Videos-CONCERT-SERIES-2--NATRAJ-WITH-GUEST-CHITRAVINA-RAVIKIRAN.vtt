00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.800
PROFESSOR: The artists tonight--
this afternoon-- are of course,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.460
we'll start off with
Phil Scarff, Natraj,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.000
who plays all these
saxes in front of us.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.590
Phil is a stalwart of this area
who plays in jazz ensembles

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.815
and also tours India with his
gifts as an Indian musician,

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:50.570
and has just come back from
India, as a matter of fact.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.430
And his CD-- his Indian CD--
is up on the table there.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.570
Mike Rivard, you
probably know Mike

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.810
from several different
ensembles, especially

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.040
Club d'Elf.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.600
He's playing bass.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.120
Jerry Leake, white pants
over there, plays tabla

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.270
and he also plays the
various hand percussion.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.060
He is a member of the Cubist
Ensemble as well as Natraj.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.775
Bertrand Lehman
plays the trap sets

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:21.455
and other percussion
over in the corner.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.180
They're going to open
the program today,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.060
but Ravikiranji-- Sangeet
[? Samrat ?] Chitravina N

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
Ravikiran, to be
more exact-- is going

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.550
to join them on the second item.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.620
And I hope you'll give him round
of applause when he appears.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.450
The program today will be in
two parts, roughly an hour long

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.500
each, with a very short
intermission between,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.225
which will give you a chance
to go and look at the many CDs

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:52.270
that the artists have
brought from all phases

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.520
of their careers.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.330
So without further ado, Natraj.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:13.799
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.294
[MUSIC - NATRAJ, "AVA DE SE"]

00:14:42.308 --> 00:14:49.325
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:49.325 --> 00:14:50.700
PHIL SCARFF: Thank
you very much.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.080
And we opened our
program this afternoon

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.240
with a traditional
West African piece

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:02.960
called "Ava De Se" from
the southern Ghanaian

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.640
tradition of the Ewe people.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.890
Once again, Jerry Leake.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.985
On that piece he was
playing [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:10.985 --> 00:15:12.235
Let's hear it for Jerry Leake.

00:15:12.235 --> 00:15:12.856
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:12.856 --> 00:15:15.230
PHIL SCARFF: And on drums and
percussion, Bertram Lehman.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.777
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:17.777 --> 00:15:19.610
PHIL SCARFF: And on
string bass Mike Rivard.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.432
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:22.432 --> 00:15:24.390
PHIL SCARFF: And I'm Phil
Scarff on saxophones.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.949
Thank you.

00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:28.490
Now we'd like to
welcome to the stage

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.800
our special guest for this
evening's program, Sangeet

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.820
[? Samrat ?]
Chitravina N Ravikiran.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:40.195
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:40.195 --> 00:15:41.820
PHIL SCARFF: So we're
going to continue

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:46.050
with an original
composition by Ravikiran.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.870
This is a piece called
"River," and it's

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.770
based on the Carnatic
rag [? Saraswati. ?]

00:15:59.252 --> 00:16:01.240
[MUSIC - NATRAJ, "RIVER"]

00:27:15.325 --> 00:27:31.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.290
PHIL SCARFF: Thank
you very much.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.440
Once again, that was
the composition "River"

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.610
by Ravikiran, arranged
by both Ravikiran

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.970
and me for this program.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:50.710
And next we'd like to move
to a different tradition,

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.980
and we're going to move
to the jazz tradition--

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.000
contemporary jazz
tradition-- and play

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.620
a piece by the great saxophonist
and composer Ornette Coleman.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:09.620
And this is his classic piece
"Lonely Woman," which was first

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:15.180
released on-- I believe-- Shape
of Jazz to Come back in 1959,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.380
I think.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:22.220
And so we thought we'd give this
a little different treatment

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.035
today.

00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:29.281
This is Ornette
Coleman's "Lonely Woman."

00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:31.277
[MUSIC - NATRAJ, "LONELY WOMAN"]

00:41:47.530 --> 00:42:06.157
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:06.157 --> 00:42:07.240
RAVIKIRAN: Good afternoon.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:19.370
And I'd like to introduce
the next composition.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.800
It's titled "Red Swan."

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.210
It's actually based on a
traditional composition

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:32.000
of Carnatic music, and based
on a very popular mode of raga

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.820
called Hamsandani, which is
well known in both North Indian

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.360
and South Indian
classical music,

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.100
but the composition has
been set for arrangement

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.610
with this group,
Natraj, [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:48.630
It's a great pleasure
for me to play with each

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.260
and every one of
my friends here,

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.560
and to play at MIT for MITHAS.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.920
So this is going
to be "Red Swan."

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.370
[MUSIC - NATRAJ, "RED SWAN"]

00:57:51.584 --> 00:58:00.230
JERRY LEAKE:
[SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.260
[MUSIC - NATRAJ, "RED SWAN"
 CONTINUES]

01:08:39.611 --> 01:08:50.170
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:51.836
PHIL SCARFF: Kiran,
thank you very much.

01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:53.084
Thank you.

01:08:53.084 --> 01:08:57.240
That was "Red Swan,"
recomposed, decomposed,

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:01.010
by Chitravina Ravikiran,
arranged by Ravikiran

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:03.207
and me for this performance.

01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:04.040
Thank you very much.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.790
So you've been listening
to Bertam Lehmann

01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:06.830
on drums and percussion.

01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:07.913
Let's hear it for Bertram.

01:09:07.913 --> 01:09:12.802
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:12.802 --> 01:09:15.010
PHIL SCARFF: Jerry Leake,
tabla and multi-percussion.

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:15.669
Jerry Leake.

01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:19.560
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.420
PHIL SCARFF: Mike
Rivard on string bass.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.322
Mike Rivard.

01:09:22.322 --> 01:09:25.606
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:25.606 --> 01:09:27.439
PHIL SCARFF: And of
course our special guest

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:30.880
for this performance, on
chitravina we have Sangeet

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.050
[? Samrat ?]
Chitravina N Ravikiran.

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:37.216
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:39.174
PHIL SCARFF: And I'm Phil
Scarff on saxophones.

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:39.914
Thank you.

01:09:39.914 --> 01:09:42.560
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.460
PHIL SCARFF: And of
course we are Natraj.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:45.740
Thank you for coming out.

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.489
We are going to take
a short intermission.

01:09:57.710 --> 01:10:00.040
And we're going to
begin our second set

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.360
with a piece from West Africa.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:08.230
This is from the Dagomba
people of northern Ghana,

01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:11.970
as distinct from the Ewe
people of southern Ghana.

01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:15.260
The opening piece was a West
African piece, "Awa De Se."

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:20.070
That is from the Ewe people of
southern Ghana and also Togo.

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:23.950
And this is from the Dagomba
tradition of northern Ghana,

01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:28.110
and it's based on the-- I would
call it the-- rhythm called

01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:31.000
Damba [? So ?] [? Chandi, ?]
and there are two compositions.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:40.364
One is called "Wolenboli" and
the other one is "Bandanya."

01:10:40.364 --> 01:10:42.844
[MUSIC - NATRAJ,
 "WOLENBOLI/BANDANYA"]

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:17.565
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:17.565 --> 01:24:18.940
PHIL SCARFF: Thank
you very much.

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:19.773
Thank you very much.

01:24:19.773 --> 01:24:25.930
That was Damba So Chandi,
"Wolenboli" and "Bandanya."

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:29.130
Turn it over to Ravikiran.

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:32.380
RAVIKIRAN: I've been requested
to play a short solo piece.

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:35.940
This is going to be
a composition which

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:40.420
I'll be playing on the
tabla, just me and the tabla.

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:46.560
So it's going to be a
composition in seven beats,

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.450
a time cycle of seven
counts known as [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:56.840
The composer of this is
a traditional composer

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.510
in Carnatic music,
Shyama Shastri,

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:10.880
who lived between 1762 and 1827.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.090
And the raga is ananda bhairavi.

01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:16.620
It is somewhat
like a minor scale.

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:35.719
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:25:35.719 --> 01:25:38.650
RAVIKIRAN: I would like
more of this and less

01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:40.390
of the [INAUDIBLE], please.

01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:55.590

[MUSIC - RAVIKIRAN, "MARIVERE

01:28:13.604 --> 01:28:18.930
RAVIKIRAN: Can you please
reduce the high ends somewhat?

01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:21.840
It's like--

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:33.900
[MUSIC - RAVIKIRAN, "MARIVERE
 GATI" CONTINUES]

01:34:49.602 --> 01:35:15.784
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:15.784 --> 01:35:19.260
PHIL SCARFF: Next
we'd like to play

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.740
another original
composition by Ravikiran.

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:26.000
This one is called
"No Nonsense Fives,"

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.380
and it's in rag janaranjani.

01:35:34.954 --> 01:35:36.370
RAVIKIRAN: This
piece was actually

01:35:36.370 --> 01:35:42.896
born out of the--
against the background

01:35:42.896 --> 01:35:48.160
that all my other pieces in five
had so much nonsense before it.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.590
So I thought, OK, at least
let me attempt something

01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:52.330
with no nonsense in fives.

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:59.680
The concept behind some of these
compositions-- some of these

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.540
are actually arranged for
Western classical symphony

01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:04.350
orchestras as well.

01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:08.580
We have a different arrangement
for the jazz groups like this.

01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:12.150
Some of them are even arranged
for quartets or quintets

01:36:12.150 --> 01:36:15.240
and chamber orchestras.

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:18.630
The concept of this is
melharmony Basically,

01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:23.990
melharmony is harmony
with an emphasis

01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:29.570
on the melodic rules of
evolved melodic systems.

01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:32.910
For instance, the
Indian raga system

01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:36.170
is a very highly evolved
melodic system of music.

01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:39.140
So we do create harmony in
this-- you will actually

01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:42.820
notice it more when we
have symphonic arrangements

01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:46.210
presented by orchestras--
but in this kind of thing

01:36:46.210 --> 01:36:48.390
you'll probably be able
to see some glimpses

01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:51.410
of meloharmonic principles.

01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:54.280
And in this we are
just going to start off

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.210
with a very short
prelude by me, and then

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:57.418
follow it by the composition.

01:37:01.881 --> 01:38:22.382

That last piece was,
again, "No Nonsense Fives."

We'd like to conclude
our concert this evening

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:17.500
with a composition
by Purandara Dasa.

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:20.600
And this one is in
rag sindhu bhairavi,

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:23.180
and it's called
"Tamburi Meetidava."

RAVIKIRAN: Just for
information, Purandara Dasa

lived from 1484 to 1564.

01:45:41.114 --> 01:45:47.300
Many of his compositions,
they are traditional tunes,

01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:49.670
but some of it has also
been tuned by other people

01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:51.750
because some of the
original have been lost.

01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:55.590
But he's hailed as the
father of Carnatic music.

01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:59.222
He's had a lot of
students' lessons as well.

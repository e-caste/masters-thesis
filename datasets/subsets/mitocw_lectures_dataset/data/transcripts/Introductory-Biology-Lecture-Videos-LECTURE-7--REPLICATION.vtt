00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.430
BARBARA IMPERIALI: So
we're going to get started.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.740
This is a complicated
lecture to choreograph,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.190
but I'm going to do my very,
very best because I think

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.880
there's some pretty
amazing stuff

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.560
that we have to explain that
is carried out in nature.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.600
And one of those things is
how do we replicate the entire

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.060
genome of organisms in one
fell swoop almost perfectly--

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.070
sometimes there
are little errors--

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.570
and fast.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.030
So we're going to refer to
these numbers in a moment.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.040
But first of all, I just
want to get you back

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.970
in the picture of where we were
at the end of the last section,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.680
the biochemistry section.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.630
And in the next
few classes we're

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.290
going to address issues
related to the central dogma

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.970
and the use of nucleic acids
for information storage

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.830
and information transfer.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.360
And before I do
that, I just want

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.630
to highlight a couple of
things, just some terms

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.190
that you should recall and recap
from the biochemistry section

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.210
about nucleic acids.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.520
So nucleic acids form
complementary double strands

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.340
through base pairing,
and that base pairing

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.360
involves hydrogen bonding
between the nucleobases,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.860
one purine to one pyrimidine,
and the AT base pair

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.210
is worth two hydrogen bonds.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.590
The GC base pair is worth
three hydrogen bonds.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.350
And those are actually
pretty useful facts

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.410
to remember because they
tell us about the stability

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.760
of double-stranded DNA, where
it's easier to tease it apart,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.360
and other characteristics.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.270
So it's kind of a useful
thing to keep in mind.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.110
So the base pairing
between what--

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.370
the purine pyrimidine pair,
which sets the exact register,

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.070
down the double-stranded DNA.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.410
The backbone is the
exact distance apart

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.220
because you always
combine a small pyrimidine

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.570
with a much larger purine.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.130
So that's something you
should feel comfortable about.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.990
The components are organized in
an anti-parallel orientation,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.750
so one end runs 5
prime to 3 prime.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.310
The other end runs
3 prime to 5 prime.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.020
And I showed you
last time an image

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.740
that allows us to
state quite clearly

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.460
that the anti-parallel
orientation is significantly

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.640
more stable than the
parallel orientation

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.670
because you can't make all
those great hydrogen bonds well

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.860
in the parallel
organization apart

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.340
from everything else
that becomes complicated.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.260
Another important
thing that you're

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.770
going to have to remember,
especially in this lecture,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.370
is that we add new
nucleotides to the 3

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.370
prime end of a nucleic acid.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.550
And so I'm just going to put
this little guy in the corner

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.150
here.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.670
This is the ribose sugar.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.055
That would be where the
nucleobase is attached.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.740
And it's a deoxy
sugar, so there's

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.050
no substituent at that carbon.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.880
This is the one position where
the base is. the 2 position,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.260
where it's deoxy,
the 3 position.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.820
And these are all prime numbers.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.430
Remember, the sugars
have prime numbers.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.070
The bases themselves have
numbers without primes

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.650
to distinguish what
we're talking about.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.970
So 3, 4, 5, and
they're all prime.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.350
And when we grow the
single strand of DNA,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.970
we always add new basis
to the 3 prime end.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.670
That's an important
numbering system.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.890
I don't like that
piece of chalk.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.335
So we always grow from
5 prime to 3 prime.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.030
And that will be
important to you

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.520
as we go through the
discussion today.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.110
And then finally, a feature
of double-stranded DNA,

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.649
quite unlike proteins,
which sometimes you'll

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:26.120
thermally or with pH
melt out and will often

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.990
have a problem reforming their
reliable structure because

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.010
instead of the structure
refolding, they aggregate.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.200
Double-stranded DNA
doesn't aggregate

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.750
because it's got all the
negative charges that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.550
would be quite repulsive.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.550
So it would be very
difficult for DNA strands

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.140
to aggregate as
such because there's

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.140
too much of a concentration
of negative charges.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.710
That would be repulsion
amongst the same type charges.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.200
So DNA can be peeled
apart with heat,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.980
and it will reanneal
faithfully to its partner

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.720
a complementary strand.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.840
Once you get to six,
seven, eight base pairs,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.960
that is a nice interaction
between the strands,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.640
and it forms faithfully.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.100
If we have a mistake
in the strands,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.420
the stability of the double
strand will be a bit less,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.100
and we can measure that
through physical measurements

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.720
that we carry out in the lab.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.850
So we can measure
the denaturation

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.210
or the thermal melt temperature.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.690
So we call this
process, after you

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.470
separate double-stranded
DNA, we call it reannealing,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.290
or it's also designated
as hybridization

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.290
to form a hybrid, which is
the composite of the two

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.400
structures.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.010
Those terms are used
fairly interchangeably.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.510
All right.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.730
So the goals in the
next four classes

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.700
are to show you how the
structures of the nucleic acids

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.940
really are purposed for
the sorts of processes

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.260
that they undergo.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.680
So the replication of
DNA, the conversion

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.610
of a strand of DNA into
complementary messenger

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.270
RNA once the process
of protein synthesis

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.550
needs to be initiated,
that second step.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.510
The first step is
called replication.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.340
The second step, when you
transcribe DNA into RNA,

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.110
is called transcription.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.310
And then finally, when you
translate messenger RNA

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.280
into proteins.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.550
So going to a
completely new language,

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.200
we call it a translation.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.500
And that's the basis
of these lectures.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.870
There is a little bit of
stuff in these lectures

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.710
about more complicated issues
in the mammalian cell, where

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.860
we have to process the
messenger RNA a bit

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.200
before we can have
it leave the nucleus.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.680
And I'll explain at
the time when it comes.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.500
So this is the lineup
for the four lectures.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.680
All right.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.490
Well, I already talked
to you how when you add--

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.110
I mentioned it over here--

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:01.520
when you add cytidine
triphosphate, GTP, ATP, TTP,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.910
these are the
activated nucleobases,

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:10.520
so they're the deoxy
nucleoside triphosphates.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.180
They are nucleotides because
they include phosphate,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.970
but when we describe
them, we'll call

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.960
them nucleoside
triphosphates if we're going

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.640
to mention the phosphate part.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.640
I know that probably doesn't
make any sense at all.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.780
Is everyone OK with that?

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.170
If you're just generically
describing something

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.050
with a phosphate in it,
you call it a nucleotide.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.270
If you want to be a
little bit more specific,

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.870
you say nucleoside, and then
you say how many phosphates.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.530
All right?

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.310
And so for the building blocks,
it's a nucleoside triphosphate.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.710
And believe me, I get
that wrong all the time,

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.510
and my students correct me.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.330
So I don't have a
problem if you're not

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.190
perfect with that nomenclature.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.110
So these are the building blocks
for DNA, for polymerization.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:03.450
And I just showed you how you
grow from the 5 prime end--

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.420
that number's not shown there,
but it's shown over here--

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.560
and you add to the 3 prime end.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.160
And the convention,
remember, when

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.970
we describe a strand of DNA,
because we make it 5 prime

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.480
to 3 prime, we write
it 5 prime to 3 prime

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.980
just so that we're
all consistent

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.840
and we know what
we're talking about.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.070
Now I want to talk about
two experiments that

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:32.190
enlist the use of isotopes
because these were quite useful

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:37.980
early on to describe some of the
characteristics of replication,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.370
so some of the details of
replication, and also the fact

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.430
that DNA was the
genetic material.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.670
So isotopes are
elements that share

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.950
the same number of
protons and electrons,

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.910
but they differ in the
number of neutrons.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.300
So the common isotopes
of the elements

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.380
that are in all the covalent
structures of the body

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:08.580
are hydrogen,
carbon, and what I'm

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.270
putting as the number next
to it is the common isotope,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:17.610
so that number designates the
sum of the number of neutrons

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.480
and protons.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.300
So carbon-12, phosphorus-31.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.810
I should have put nitrogen here.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.337
Let's see.

00:09:27.337 --> 00:09:27.920
Wait a minute.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.800
I'm going to put these in order
because it makes more sense.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:39.830
Phosphorus-31, nitrogen-14,
PS, phosphorus-31, and sulfur.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.360
What's the sulfur isotope?

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.670
32.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.660
So these are the
common isotopes that

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.770
comprise the majority of those
elements within the body.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.390
But there are lots
of experiments

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.340
done that have different
isotopes of these atoms

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:08.180
that we can use as
traces or markers, kind

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:08.970
of the same thing.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.050
But you'll see when I mention
the word tracer, to me,

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.530
it brings up the radioactive
isotopes because we

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.370
use very little of them.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.910
So when we talk
about these elements,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.420
there are different isotopes
that we use commonly.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.570
There's the hydrogen that
has an extra neutron.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.280
That's also called deuterium.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.680
And then there's the
hydrogen that is radioactive.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.910
It's metastable.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.990
It will decay and emit
a radioactive particle.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.460
So this one, we would
call it the heavy isotope,

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:54.990
and this one we would call
the radioactive isotope.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.820
So we could trace certain
hydrogens in biomolecules

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.670
by either making those
hydrogens the heavier ones,

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.010
or making them the
radioactive ones.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.980
Carbon also has useful isotopes.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:15.320
Carbon-13 is the heavy
isotope and carbon-14

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.250
is the radioactive isotope.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.380
So they're used quite commonly.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.470
And then things get a little
bit different for nitrogen.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.790
We use a heavy isotope of
nitrogen, which is N-15, just

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.390
one extra neutron.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.830
But while there is a
radioactive isotope of nitrogen,

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.160
it's too short of a half-life
to work within the lab.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.890
It's not useful to us, so
we never talk about it.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.560
But I will describe
to you an experiment

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.890
with the heavy N-15 when
we talk about the mechanism

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.310
of replication.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.410
And then for
phosphorus and sulfur,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.550
the most important
ones are P-32,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.580
which is a radioactive
phosphorus,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:02.550
and S-35, which is a
radioactive sulfur.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.210
There is another radioactive
phosphorus that's P-33.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.800
Has a slightly longer half life.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.540
It's kind of handy
to work with if you

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.490
have certain experiments.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:16.050
The half-lives vary a lot, but
the half-life of tritium C-14

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.130
are long.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.140
That's why we do carbon dating.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:25.950
The half-lives of P-32 are
short, less daytime frame,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.870
and sulfur 35 is a
little bit longer.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.810
But those are nuances that
you don't need to worry about.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.210
Now how are these
isotopes useful

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:38.280
as traces and markers to tell
us about biology and details

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.430
of biology?

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.160
So what I'm going to
just show you here

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.290
is a particular
experiment that's

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.350
carried out with what
are known as baculovirus.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.340
So viruses infect
eukaryotic cells.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.220
Baculoviruses infect bacteria.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.260
So there's a commonality there.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.550
And when baculoviruses infect
bacteria, just as the parallel

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.540
with eukaryotic cells,
they deposit material

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.670
into the bacteria so
they can replicate,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:12.120
so they can hijack the bacteria
to make new baculoviruses.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.300
So an early experiment
was done to ask

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.770
what is the genetic material
that transfers the information

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.820
from the baculovirus
to the bacterial cell

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.640
in order to make
more baculovirus.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.780
So they were able to
demonstrate, in this Hershey

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.440
and Chase experiment,
that you could

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:40.830
label protein and DNA
with particular isotopes

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.220
and find out what part
of the baculovirus

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.220
was important for
transferring information

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.340
for the production
of new baculovirus.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.800
So they wanted to label
the capsid protein,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.130
so the proteinaceous
material that's

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.980
on the outside of
this lunar lander.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.180
This is a baculovirus.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.280
It's sort of amazing
how it looks.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.230
So they wanted to
label the protein.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.230
But they also wanted
to label the contents

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:12.640
of the baculovirus, the DNA,
with tracer radioisotopes.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.460
So what would be
the best isotopes

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.360
to use if you wanted to
differentiate between protein

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.340
and nucleic acid?

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.030
And what you want
to think about is,

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.840
what does protein have that
nucleic acids don't have,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.660
and what do nucleic acids
have that proteins don't have?

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.870
Which are the elements that are
important for differentiating?

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.370
Yeah.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.885
Over there.

00:14:34.885 --> 00:14:35.760
AUDIENCE: Phosphorus.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.218
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
Yes, phosphorus.

00:14:37.218 --> 00:14:40.232
Do you want to give a
little bit more of a--

00:14:40.232 --> 00:14:44.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.270
BARBARA IMPERIALI: OK.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.210
So the answer is
we'd use phosphorus

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.740
to label nucleic acids because
that phosphodiester backbone is

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.180
rich in phosphorus.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.250
There are a few
phosphates in proteins,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.450
but they're very transient.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.770
They're part of signaling.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.190
But every nucleotide
has a phosphorus

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.640
in every building block.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.080
And then in proteins,
they have sulfur in them

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.270
where nucleic acids do not.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.410
And the sulfur is in two amino
acids cystine and methionine.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.720
So you can use those two
tracers for the building blocks.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.010
And the way the
experiment works is

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:25.080
if you've labeled the protein
with sulfur, you infect a cell,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.390
the virus replicates.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.240
And what you're
going to do is then

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.550
centrifuge the bacterial cells
to see what's in the cell,

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.360
and then you can,
alternatively, label the DNA--

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.100
and in this case, I've
shown it as green,

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.110
but that would be
the other isotope--

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.290
let it infect the cell
and deposit its contents

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.190
in the cell, centrifuge
the cells out.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.260
And you want to know where
the radioactivity is,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.090
and the radioactivity
is strictly

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:59.010
associated with phosphorus-32
because the genetic material

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.370
that coded for the
production of new baculovirus

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.080
is the thing that
stays associated

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.770
with the bacterial cell.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:11.510
In contrast, there's no
radioactivity associated when

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.960
you label the cells with S-35.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.560
All right?

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.030
Nice experiment.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.860
Easy way to do it.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.663
Rather nice way to do it.

00:16:20.663 --> 00:16:22.580
The other experiment I
want to describe to you

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.460
very briefly because it
relies on central irrigation

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.550
technology that's very powerful.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:37.980
And it's a method that utilizes
N-15 very, very nicely.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.350
So let me tell you
about that experiment.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.210
There are things
in the laboratory

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.970
that we use every
day, ultra centrifuges

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.480
and regular centrifuges, that
spin at a very fast speed

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.640
where we can really
differentiate things

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.710
by molecular mass, which relates
to sedimentation coefficients.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.880
How fast does the particle
spin to the bottom of the tube

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.620
when it's under high
centrifugal force?

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.819
The heavier it is, the
faster it will spin.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.190
So the question that came
up very early on-- it

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.780
looks like a
nonsense question now

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.920
because it looks so obvious that
we replicate DNA the way we do.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.920
But originally, it
wasn't absolutely certain

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.640
whether DNA was replicated
through a semi-conservative

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.160
mechanism, where the
strands came apart

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.069
and you made two copies,
a copy of each strand,

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:31.260
to make two identical daughter
new double-stranded DNA.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.720
Alternatively, could you
have a mechanism that

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.880
was quite conservative,
you kept your DNA,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.170
and somehow you
made a copy of it.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.930
A little harder for
me to understand.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.870
So your two new
strands, one would

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.100
look like the original one, but
one would be very different.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.070
Or dispersive, where you're
just copying bits of the DNA

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.270
and somehow reassembling
this gigantic jigsaw puzzle.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.630
The centrifugation
experiment allowed

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.180
people to absolutely
and clearly state

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.490
that the replication is via
a semi-conservative process.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.690
So let's walk through it.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:10.470
And what was done is that the
nucleotides within the DNA

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.290
were all labeled
with heavy nitrogen.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.400
So for every nucleic acid--

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.130
let's say, for
example, when there's

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.540
an adenine in the backbone,
there are five nitrogens,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.520
so that would be
five atomic mass

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.680
units heavier than nitrogen-14
in that nucleobase.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.790
So N-15 nucleobase, five
mass units heavier than N-14

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.630
nucleobase.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.130
Make sense to everybody?

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.630
All right.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.520
So it's heavier by some amount.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.480
It's not a massive
amount, but it's

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.870
enough to differentiate in
a centrifugation experiment.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.680
So the bacteria were first
grown up in heavy nitrogen,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:53.160
so all of the DNA sediments
at a certain rate and place.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.040
And it's all got N-15
in it, so it's as heavy

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.330
as it can sediment.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.150
And then they let the
bacteria replicate

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.350
in the presence of N-14, the
lighter isotope of nitrogen.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.470
And what one would
anticipate to happen

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.600
is whenever you
replicate, you peel apart

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.670
the two heavy strands, and each
one pairs with a light strand.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:20.220
So you now have two copies,
two new identical copies of DNA

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:27.160
where half of one strand has
N-15, one strand has N-14.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.420
So it will sediment
less quickly because it

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.250
is of a different
density, a lighter

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.530
density than the all N-15.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.680
So you would get an
intermediate weight band

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.560
in the centrifuge tube
when you're sedimenting.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.130
If you peel those two
strands apart again,

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.020
you've got a heavy and a light.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.210
If you're growing
in N-14, the light

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:54.090
will combine with another light,
and there are two of those.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.070
And then the heavy will
combine with a light.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.220
So you'll get new
sedimentation where you still

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.500
have a band that's
the combination

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.300
of the light and heavy.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.790
But then you start
having some material

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.330
that is all of the light.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.180
So this would be this cycle.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.800
So two that are still light
plus heavy, and then two that

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.930
are exclusively light.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.730
You keep on
replicating, and you'll

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.590
keep on diluting the heavy.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.300
Does that experiment make sense?

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.640
It's kind of a cool experiment.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.500
You can hardly
believe it's feasible,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.100
but the centrifugation
ability to differentiate

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.320
with these isotopes
is really valuable.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.680
So I just want to put in a
plug for the use of isotopes.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.930
Obviously, they're used
in nuclear physics.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:41.310
We use a lot of the radioactive
isotopes for different reasons.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.340
But in biology, they are
indispensable for some

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.360
of these experiments.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.250
And even to this day,
you can do things

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:52.410
with isotopes you can't by
other experiments, either

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.410
the radioactive or the heavy.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.830
There's a great deal of work
done nowadays in proteomics

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.830
using mass spectrometry
and heavy isotopes,

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.680
where you can really
track where things go

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.030
and treat cancer cells
differently from healthy cells,

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.770
but actually track
what's happening

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.715
by putting heavy isotopes in one
of the growing dishes of cells.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.890
So I like both of those
experiments a lot.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.100
I would put them in the
category of oldies but goodies.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.760
All right.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.100
Now I've got some
details over here

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.915
that we've got some explaining
to do as we move forward.

00:21:32.915 --> 00:21:34.290
And I just want
to, first of all,

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.540
start with a couple
of details that I want

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.020
to highlight on this board.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:51.100
First of all, prokaryotes
such as bacteria, E. Coli,

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.620
and eukaryotes such
as human cells.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.330
Have some differences
in their DNA.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.200
So the size of the
bacterial genome

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.410
is about five
million base pairs.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.310
The size of the human genome is
not quite 1,000 times bigger,

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.570
but a good deal bigger.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:15.640
The DNA in bacteria is
circular, whereas the DNA

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.220
in eukaryotic cells is linear.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.370
And it's actually in the form--
you see all these little images

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:25.210
where you see the pairs of
chromosomes sort of stuck

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.400
together at the
center, and that's

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.160
linear DNA from one
end to the other.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.500
In bacteria, the
DNA is circular,

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.750
so it doesn't have an end.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.850
So they're different, all right?

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.300
So replicating circular
DNA is a little bit

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.620
different from
replicating linear DNA.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.970
Now in both cases, the
DNA has to be packaged up

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.960
so it will fit in the cell.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.930
Otherwise, it's just too
much of a disordered thing.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:59.500
In the case of bacteria, the
circular DNA is wrapped up

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.000
and super coiled
with what are known

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.240
as a polyamines, compounds
that are very positively

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.190
charged to neutralize all that
negative charge in the DNA.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.240
And in man and other
eukaryotes, the chromosomes

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.240
are wrapped around very,
very positively charged

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.670
proteins known as histones.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.540
They're similar principles,
but they're different entities.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.440
So when we start talking
about replication

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.150
of a prokaryotic cell, here's
the typical circular DNA.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.340
So you can see the
double-stranded DNA.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:38.570
And I've put a little symbol
here that I call the ORI.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.480
So that's origin of initiation.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.295
So that is the place where
you start copying your DNA.

00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:55.670
And we're going
to talk about how

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.760
to spot these places
in genomes in a moment.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:05.720
And so the bacterial genome
is copied bidirectionally,

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.880
so you can go in both directions
copying in the appropriate

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.780
direction-- we'll talk
about that in a moment--

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:19.070
to make the entire circular DNA
and a perfect copy of the DNA

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.470
with bidirectional copying.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.810
And that's not bad
for small genomes

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.150
because you've only got
one origin of replication.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.050
You've got to get all the
way around the circular DNA.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.630
It's quite a bit smaller
than the human one.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:37.310
But what do you do
with gigantic genomes

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.520
such as the one that's
about 1,000 times bigger

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.170
than the bacterial one?

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.740
How do you manage
to still catalyze

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.020
the replication of
the entire genome

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.290
quickly enough to
make the copy of DNA

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.810
in some reasonable
amount of time?

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.930
And that is taking
also into consideration

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.690
that the speed of
bacterial replication

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.210
is 1,000 base pairs per second.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.840
Pretty impressive-- 1,000 of
those bonds made every second--

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.150
whereas in eukaryotes,
it sits somewhere down

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.650
from 50 base pairs per second,
depending on conditions.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.400
These are not very
explicit numbers.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.590
There's a little
bit of variability.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.840
So how would you do it?

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.470
If you had this
massive chunk of gene,

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:28.540
and you've got to copy it just
really pretty quickly in order

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.530
to replicate an entire cell
contents in eight hours,

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.820
what would you do?

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.461
How could you expedite things?

00:25:36.461 --> 00:25:38.870
Yeah.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.280
Yes.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.740
So the answer here is start
in a lot of different places

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.890
so there's a lot of
collaborative work going

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:50.330
on all along that large genome.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:55.480
And so when the replication
of the long linear chromosomes

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.490
that are in
eukaryotic cells, you

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:01.420
end up with just a lot of
origins of replication.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.880
So you're basically
starting all over the place

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.520
so you can get the job
done quickly enough for it

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.460
to make sense.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.910
Does that make
sense to everybody?

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.460
So start in a lot of places.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.820
It's a pretty easy thing.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.320
All right.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:21.670
Now I mentioned very briefly
that before you can copy DNA,

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.470
you have to unpack it.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.940
Now we think a lot
about packaging DNA,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.630
less about unpacking it.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.660
So I've got these pictures
sort of in a reverse direction.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.240
So it's only this form
of DNA stretched out

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.290
that can be copied, whereas
the DNA in your cells

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.530
is bundled up very
tightly into chromosomes.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.360
How are they put together?

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.230
Those chromosomes are
made up of chromatin,

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:54.400
which is a bunch of balls which
are histone proteins with DNA

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.580
wrapped around them.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.950
That's compact chromatin.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:00.590
Sorry, guys.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.850
Let me go back,
not to go forwards.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.030
So this is chromatin
in a compact form.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.370
This is chromatin now unraveled.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.410
They look more like
beads on a string,

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.410
DNA wrapped around
each histone protein

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.440
to form those
nucleosomes structures.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.050
And then each nucleosome
looks like this.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.680
It's got protein in the middle
and DNA wrapped around it.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.430
So in order to go
forward and replicate,

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.100
we have to unpackage DNA.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.280
There are lots of signals
to unpackage the DNA that we

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.050
will talk about later.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.610
The nucleosomes look like this.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:42.585
So you can trace the DNA and the
proteins bundled in the middle.

00:27:42.585 --> 00:27:43.960
And if we have
time at the end, I

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:48.610
will show you the video
of the packaging of DNA

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.100
and the video of the
replication of DNA.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.870
They're about a minute
and a half each,

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.280
so it's not a whole bunch.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.830
Later on, we will
talk about what

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.280
happens when there is a
determination that a cell needs

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.320
to replicate its genome.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.110
A bunch of things have
to happen as signals

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.150
to do the unwrapping.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.160
And one of those
things is actually

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.150
to alter the charged state
of the histone proteins

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.670
so you neutralize
the positive charges

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.620
so the DNA can unravel for it.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.190
Makes sense.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:21.370
It's still just a plain old
electrostatic interaction.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:25.180
So the synthesis
of DNA is what's

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:35.530
known as template-driven
polymerization.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.240
OK.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.380
So template-driven
polymerization.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.210
You'll get a sense of
exactly what that means.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.850
We know the two strands
are complementary,

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.980
and we're going to use
one strand as the code

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.560
to make a new
complementary strand.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.920
So when we're making DNA,
we have one strand there.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.950
That's what's known as
the template strand.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.640
I want to make a complementary
copy of that strand.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.880
So what the DNA
polymerase is going to do

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:15.190
is systematically
add nucleotides

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:20.140
to the 3 prime OH of the ribose,
and then you keep growing.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.660
But the base that
gets put in is the one

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.560
that's complementary to the
base on the template strand.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.100
So if it's thiamine on
the template strand,

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.300
it's adenine put in on
the new strand, and so on.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.310
And just to get
these numbers again,

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:40.930
the new strand is grown
from 5 prime to 3 prime.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:45.180
The old strand is read
3 prime to 5 prime.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.550
So you're reading a strand
and you're reading it 3 to 5,

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.590
and you're making 5 to 3.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.800
That's how you end up with
complementary anti-parallel

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.600
strands.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.080
OK with that, everyone?

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.690
All right.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.420
And when you form
the bond, you go in

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:07.180
with nucleoside triphosphates,
you form a new phosphodiester

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.330
with just one of
those phosphoruses,

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.860
and you kick out
phosphate phosphate,

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.700
which we would call
pyrophosphate or diphosphate.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.200
OK.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.160
So here you could
just sort of see, just

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.410
check that you know
what you're doing.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.140
I'm going to just say this is
really a pretty simple thing.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.960
We're going to put in a T,
then we're going to put in an a

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.380
then we're going to put in a C
because our template is telling

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.910
us to put in the appropriate
purine or pyrimidine that forms

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:36.770
a nice base pair with that.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.980
So there's a question here.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.330
But I've already given
you the answer to it.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.690
So it should be
very straightforward

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:48.230
for you to look at
a template strand

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.710
and decide what would be on
the complementary strand,

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:54.410
and also decide on
the directionality

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.970
of the complementary strand.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.070
Now origins of replication.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.760
What do they look like?

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.840
It's the old where
do I start problem.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.623
Where do I start?

00:31:06.623 --> 00:31:07.915
What's the best place to start?

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.610
Someone?

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:13.480
Not you.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.050
Not you.

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.110
Anyone else want to answer here?

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.293
I've got this whole genome.

00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:19.210
I've got to get going.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.860
I've got to start
making a copy of it.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:26.170
Where's the best place to break
into it to start making copies?

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:26.730
Yeah.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.130
There.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.660
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Correct.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.290
It's simple.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:35.360
It's the difference
between two and three.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.950
If you go to the
area where there's

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:41.210
lots of G's and C's, every
GC has three hydrogen bonds.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:42.800
If you go to a
different area where

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.530
there happen to be a lot
of A's and T's in a row,

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.530
each pair is only worth
two hydrogen bonds.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.260
You're going to pick the
stretch that has the most

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.980
A's and T's because it's the
place where the base pairing is

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.240
weaker.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.800
It's actually very
simple concept.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.400
So it would be
the AT-rich region

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.860
is the place where
origins of replication

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.920
are more predominant.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.420
OK.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.010
So what we're going to do now--

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.110
and this is going to
be tricky, but I'm

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:11.000
going to make this work--

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.670
is we're going to
talk about replicating

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.730
an entire chunk of gene.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.810
And what I've done here is
I've put the pieces that we're

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:24.350
going to discuss over here.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.480
That's my menu.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.100
And we're going to work
through what we need

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.320
to copy a large chunk of DNA.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.280
All right?

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.450
Everybody with me?

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.690
So I redrew this this morning.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.070
I promised myself
I'm going to be

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:41.600
super tidy on this blackboard,
which is a far stretch for me.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.895
So replication, we know
where replication starts,

00:32:44.895 --> 00:32:47.030
AT-rich region.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.070
We could pick those
out in the genome.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:53.720
We know that we've got to unwind
the DNA to make a copy of it,

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.150
so we must have had to
unwrap the DNA beforehand.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.650
These are all known things.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.520
So let's now take a look
at double-stranded DNA

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.260
and try and figure out how
we use all the components.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.660
Actually, I'm going to bring
this board down because I

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.260
don't see it as well up there.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.470
How do we make use of
all these components

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.300
that are part of the
menu that we need

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.860
to make the new strand of DNA?

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:35.245
So we have double-stranded
DNA and there are base pairs

00:33:35.245 --> 00:33:35.745
across.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.200
That's typical
double-stranded DNA.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.110
That's what we're
starting from, unwrapped.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.570
I haven't made it helical
because my helices will

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.530
get messy.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:49.580
And so we need to start.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.070
So the first thing
that will happen

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.550
is that the important
enzymes like the helicase

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:59.030
will scan to find an
origin of replication,

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:06.887
so somewhere for the process
to start because that's where

00:34:06.887 --> 00:34:07.970
they're going to break in.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:12.770
So David, one of your TA's,
works in Steve Bell's lab.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.170
And they study the
mammalian origin

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.860
of replication complex,
which is this much more

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.810
complicated situation
than what I'm

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:22.940
going to describe to you today.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.040
But they do fabulous
single molecule

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:29.393
work to show how those
pieces are assembled.

00:34:29.393 --> 00:34:30.560
But I'll tell you the truth.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.270
As dorky as I am,
the thing that I

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:40.040
find the most cool about the
origin of replication complex

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.030
is that it spells ORC.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.260
And if any of you
are Lord of the Rings

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:50.239
fans, who can't be excited by a
complex called the ORC complex?

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:54.469
So there's going
to be the screening

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.239
of the genome for ORI.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:35:01.370
And I want you to
remember what is up here

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.510
is the rest of the chromosome.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.570
It's not just a fuzzy end.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.340
It's something that's
got a lot of stuff

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.770
there that's still base paired.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.330
So the first thing
that happens is

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:20.460
that helicase needs
to start unzippering

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.390
the double-stranded DNA, so
you get to a new intermediate.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:26.760
We're going to draw like this.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:48.440
And the helicase is going to
intercept to basically start

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:53.460
separating those
two strands of DNA

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.790
in order to do the replication.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.790
But don't forget that these
are still base paired,

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:02.910
and these now are
single strands.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:07.170
So I'm going to need
something from that menu.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.400
I'm going to need it quickly.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.358
What do you think's the
next thing we're really

00:36:10.358 --> 00:36:13.140
going to need in order to
be able to move forward

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.920
in our job?

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.350
What do we need from over here?

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:18.940
We're already using the
double-stranded DNA.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.940
It's not going to be too
difficult to figure out

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.020
the NTP's.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.470
We're already using the
unzip arrays, the helicase.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.590
What are we going to need?

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.890
Yeah.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:30.940
Primase.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.890
Ah, primase shortly.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.420
But we've really
got to do something

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.230
to stabilize our
unzippered stuff.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.880
Anyone else?

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:48.690
So those two single strands
are right near each other,

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.610
and they're complementary.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.670
What's going to stop them going
straight back together again

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.620
and not allowing replication?

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:59.310
So there are proteins
that basically

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:07.020
sit on the single-stranded
parts of DNA

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:12.270
as are known a single strand
binding proteins that stabilize

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:16.260
this transiently made
complex long enough for it

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.000
to be copied.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.790
So so far, we've
used the helicase.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:25.270
We've used the single
strand binding proteins.

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.250
And I'm going to
draw them there,

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:32.230
still remembering that I have
an entire chromosome up here.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.450
Now the heavy lifting
has to start fairly soon,

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:40.190
so we need the
enzyme that's going

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:44.450
to start making a copy of
one of those single strands.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.450
That's going to be a
DNA polymerase, which

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.210
is right here.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.300
But DNA polymerase is
kind of a finicky enzyme

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.000
because it doesn't
like to just start cold

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.070
on the genome, on
the single strand,

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.410
and start making a copy.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:04.880
DNA polymerase needs
a primer of some kind.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.120
So I'm going to just put
that as a note up here.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:17.450
DNA polymerase needs
what's called a primer.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:18.500
And what is a primer?

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.390
A primer is a sequence--

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.490
I think I've got
something up here--

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:26.420
a primer is a sequence that is
complementary to a little bit

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.630
of DNA so that when DNA
polymerase comes along,

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.325
it's actually grabbing
a double strand

00:38:31.325 --> 00:38:34.950
and then filling up the
rest of the single strand.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:38.310
So this would be a typical
depiction of a primer.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:40.710
Here's a strand we want to copy.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:44.180
But the blue one is a primer
strand giving you something

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.250
double-stranded to hold onto.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:49.670
And then in this
situation, DNA polymerase

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:53.090
would be happy to fill in
the rest of the sequence.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:56.300
So for the purpose of
this discussion to start,

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:01.390
we're just going to
provide a primer that

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:05.800
is complementary to the
DNA just to give us a go.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.260
We have an alternative
in the cell, where

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.830
it's to actually use a
primase and RNA building

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:13.300
blocks to build a primer.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.340
But let's keep things
simple for a minute

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.320
and get on with a lot
of the major work.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.700
And then we'll come back
to that in a second.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.790
So this part is a primer.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.430
And that primer-- if this
is the 3 prime end, that's

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:31.940
5 prime 3 prime.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.960
So the primer is complementary
to the DNA in that direction.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.880
It's anti-parallel.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:44.462
And then DNA polymerase can go
along and fill in the strand.

00:39:44.462 --> 00:39:46.170
And I'm going to draw
it dashed, and it's

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:49.940
going to keep on growing.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.240
And what I want you to
notice is DNA polymerase

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:59.960
grows from 5 prime to 3 prime.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.990
That is a cardinal
rule, the directionality

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.450
that we grow the new DNA in.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.850
So basically, looking
at this picture,

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:13.100
it's going in this direction
because the 3 prime OH is free,

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.900
and you're building onto it.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.720
So you use a primer
first, and then you

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:34.670
use DNA polymerase plus deoxy
nucleoside triphosphates.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:38.360
So all those AT CG
building blocks.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.970
So we've been using these.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:44.090
We've used the single-stranded
binding proteins.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:48.140
We've used a primer, but
there are an alternative.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.030
I'll get to that
in just a second.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.940
But we now have a
complex where I'm

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.580
going to briefly divert
you to tell you about,

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.760
in the cell, what else
you could use as a primer.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.260
And then we're going
to have to deal

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.280
with copying this other strand.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.670
But this first
strand that is made

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:07.130
is called the leading strand.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.200
It's the one that's easy.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.240
I peel apart the DNA.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.910
I have a primer there,
and I can just build.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.440
Goes really smoothly.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.160
I'm building in the
right direction.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.160
If you look over on the
other side of the fence,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.040
you've got a problem
because I can't build

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.740
on this side from here, right?

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.164
Why not?

00:41:33.164 --> 00:41:34.192
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:34.192 --> 00:41:35.150
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yes.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.050
I'd be doing it the
wrong direction.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.000
I would be the
total mess, frankly.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.112
There would be a
crisis in the cell.

00:41:41.112 --> 00:41:42.820
So we're going to have
to deal with that.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.480
So let me just get you out
of the primer, just deal

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.010
with this primer issue.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.900
In the cell, it's
not like we can micro

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.380
inject all these little primers
to get our DNA synthesized.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:42:04.480
So RNA polymerase, believe it
or not, doesn't need a primer.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.330
So you can build little
bits of primer with RNA.

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.853
You don't build very much,
just build short segments.

00:42:11.853 --> 00:42:13.770
And then once you've got
sort of enough there,

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.560
DNA polymerase can
start polymerizing.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:23.190
So you use RNA polymerase and
nucleoside triphosphates, not

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.230
the deoxy ones.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.840
So later on, we've
got this piece here

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.500
that might be made
deoxy RNA, which is why,

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.880
coming over here to my menu--

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.520
do I have it?

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.280
Yes.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.930
We need an RNA
primase, and we need

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:45.720
RNA's to chop them out so that
DNA polymerase can come back

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.690
because now there is
double-stranded material

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.740
and fill in the gap.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.870
And then we need one more enzyme
to stitch together the gaps.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:56.280
And that's the ligase.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.050
The logic of this
stuff is great.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.990
I think it's just really
amazing because all these moving

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:04.200
parts have evolved to make
all these functions fall

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.320
into place.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.640
Now we need to talk about
this pesky other strand.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.730
So we have a problem
here because we've

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:13.800
got the wrong directionality.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.550
So what happens in nature
is as soon as there's

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:22.450
enough of a stretch, a
primer is put in place,

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:25.190
growing the DNA in
the right direction.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:30.880
That's from where the
helicase is unzipping.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.160
So we put in another primer.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.960
And then DNA polymerase--

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.900
that's the white one--

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.680
can build its
complementary strand,

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.730
building in the appropriate
direction to be consistent.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:50.540
So you basically fill
in a chunk and then

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.540
you have to wait awhile
till more is unzippered,

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.880
put in another primer,
and then grow the DNA.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.550
So in that other piece you're
making little segments of DNA

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.280
intervened by RNA primers.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.190
Later on, those small primers
are going to be chewed up

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.840
by RNA's.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.510
DNA polymerase is
going to fill them in,

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.740
and ligase is
going to join them.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.000
Does that make sense?

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.370
It's a lot to grasp.

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:19.400
And this other side
is called what's

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.740
known as the lagging strand.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.360
And there are
pieces of short DNA

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.980
that are transiently made
that have their own name.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.810
You can remember it or not.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.760
I just feel I'm not
being complete if I

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.090
don't mention their name.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:47.150
They're called Okazaki
fragments after the guy

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:48.740
who discovered them.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.130
And they're longer in
bacteria than in humans.

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:56.350
So Okazaki fragments are the
transient short stretches

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:59.780
of DNA that are made
in the lagging strand,

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.500
and then they get
zipped together.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.835
So that's sort of the story
for replicating the DNA.

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:08.330
Let me make sure I've
described everything to you.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.000
Leading strand, lagging strand.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.500
Oh, can't believe I
almost forgot this.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.000
All right.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.660
Now we got a problem.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.590
So we've come all this way.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:19.790
We've used all the pieces.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:23.600
We haven't used
one of the pieces.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.120
So we're in a small
bit of trouble

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:32.290
because what's going to happen
when you're, for example,

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:35.690
trying to peel apart your DNA?

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:39.180
What trouble are you
going to run into?

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.930
Who wants to come up here
and get involved in my demo?

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:45.540
And you've got to be aware that
you're going to be on screen.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.620
You and you up there.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.000
You've got your hand up first.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.270
OK.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.370
I need someone who's
going to hold onto this as

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:53.750
if their life depends on it.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.850
You can't let the
yellow ones slip out.

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:57.820
So you are the rest
of the chromosome,

00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.960
so make sure that you
really hold-- and you

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.190
don't let things come apart.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:03.980
Now you are helicase, OK?

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:04.480
OK.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.120
So come on.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.080
Start helicasing and really
pull as hard as you can.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.230
He's going to hold it.

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.240
No, I don't want you to
unwind it because we're

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.490
in the middle of a chromosome.

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.960
So you've literally got
to do what helicase does.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:17.950
Yeah, keep on pulling.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:20.500
Come on, you can do it.

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.670
Can you go much further?

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.260
I mean, your arms
aren't any longer.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.910
But it's almost
impossible, right?

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.940
We get to a stage
where we need help.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.910
The help we have coming
is from topoisomerase.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:36.720
Topoisomerase does something--
so walk just one step this way.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.220
Yeah.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:42.760
Topoisomerase some comes
along and it cuts the DNA.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.930
It holds the pieces in
its hands, if you will,

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.450
lets the super coiling
relax, and then it

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:51.490
joins them back again.

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:53.740
So topoisomerase-- thank
you very much, guys.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.400
That's it.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.800
Chromosome, helicase, thank you.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.960
We really have some
tightly wound DNA here.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.550
So topoisomerase is the get out
of jail free card because it

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:08.410
allows you to deal with all of
this tension you got in place

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.420
that you cannot unravel.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.510
So you need someone who is
literally going to cut, hold,

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:16.080
let the thing relax, rejoin it.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.610
And there are some
topoisomerases

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:20.560
called DNA gyrases.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.590
But the really cool
thing about topoisomerase

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.990
is that it's a
wonderful drug target

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.860
in both mammalian
and bacterial cells

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:34.550
because they're quite different
in the two types of organisms.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:38.350
So in bacteria the
antibiotic ciprofloxacin

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.930
is a topoisomerase
inhibitor that

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:44.890
actually stops your bacteria
dividing because if topo

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.930
doesn't work, you can't go on.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.760
And in human biology
and cancer biology,

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.700
there are also topoisomerases--

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.410
there's one called
[INAUDIBLE] --

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:58.030
that does the same thing in
the eukaryotic topoisomerase

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:03.820
to stop cancer cells dividing
rapidly so that those cannot go

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.310
on and make larger tumors.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:07.720
So I want to show you something.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.560
And I am actually
certain that I have time.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.910
Come on.

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.030
Now I'm going to show you.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.697
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:48:14.697 --> 00:48:16.980
- In this animation, we'll
see the remarkable way

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:20.140
our DNA is tightly
packed up so that six

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.860
feet of this long molecule fits
into the microscopic nucleus

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.790
of every cell.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.900
The process starts when DNA is
wrapped around special protein

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.440
molecules called histones.

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.050
The combined loop of DNA and
protein is called a nucleosome.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.510
Next, the nucleosomes are
packaged into a thread.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:49.070
The end result is a
fiber known as chromatin.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:17.380
This fiber is then looped
and coiled yet again,

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.540
leading finally to the
familiar shapes known

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:23.180
as chromosomes, which can be
seen in the nucleus of dividing

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:23.680
cells.

00:49:27.748 --> 00:49:32.130
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Now I'm going
to take you forward to DNA,

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.990
what we just talked about here.

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:40.680
- Using computer animation
based on molecular research,

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.320
we are now able to see
how DNA is actually

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.490
copied in living cells.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.880
You are looking at
an assembly line

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.600
of amazing miniature biochemical
machines that are pulling apart

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.090
the DNA double helix
and cranking out

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:56.330
a copy of each strand.

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.370
The DNA to be copied
enters the production line

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:04.770
from bottom left.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:09.210
The whirling blue molecular
machine is called helicase.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:12.360
It spins the DNA as
fast as a jet engine

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:17.220
as it unwinds the double
helix into two strands.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.890
One strand is
copied continuously

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:22.000
and can be seen spooling
off to the right.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:27.360
Things are not so simple
for the other strand

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.780
because it must be
copied backwards.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.670
It is drawn out
repeatedly in loops

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:36.330
and copied one
section at a time.

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:39.210
The end result is two
new DNA molecules.

00:50:44.367 --> 00:50:44.950
[END PLAYBACK]

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:46.158
BARBARA IMPERIALI: All right.

00:50:46.158 --> 00:50:47.420
OK.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:50.450
That's what you saw
today, replication,

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.990
a lot of the mechanics, a
lot of the moving parts.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.480
There's this tricky
stuff with primers.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.960
You'll get used to that.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.110
But this is really
the quintessential set

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:02.840
of pieces to replicate DNA.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.700
It is an amazing process.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.140
Look at the speed.

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:08.270
1,000 base pairs a second.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:10.640
Can you even believe it?

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.640
An entire circular chromosome
copied in 20 minutes.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.590
So these are really
things to think about

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:22.160
because they are so impressive
that it's a delight to actually

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.610
be able to teach them to you.

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:24.110
OK.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:26.230
I'm done for today.

00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:12.680
PROFESSOR: Do them individually
so I can continue

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.090
to put names and
faces together.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.150
I'm happy to announce that
the registrar has now got

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.740
everybody's photograph
online for

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.250
registration in the course.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.580
So anonymity is a thing of the
past, so you have to watch

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.060
your step from now on.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.940
I handed back, to those who
didn't get it, problem set

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.660
number four, which asked you
to tackle some patterns,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.290
nontrivial patterns.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.410
And actually, that was a dirty
trick, because we hadn't, at

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.950
that point, derived the plane
groups, and you really didn't

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.800
know what to do or
what to look for.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.710
But nevertheless, it got you
thinking about patterns and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.500
some of the symmetry elements
which we had discussed up to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.150
that point.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.400
At this point we have derived
exhaustively every last one of

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.330
the 17 plane groups.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.130
So now you are armed with this
new-found power, and when

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.600
faced with a pattern, you should
know exactly what to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.080
look for and how to go
about deciding what

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.180
plane group it is.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.290
At the very least, you'll
have the drawings of the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.600
arrangement of symmetry elements
in the plane groups

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.400
before you, and you can work by
the process of elimination.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.390
For example, high symmetry
usually hits you right between

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.090
the eyes, and if something is
square-ish, you can pretty

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.980
quickly guess that it's based
on a square lattice.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.590
And if it has a square lattice,
there jolly well

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.510
better be a 4-fold axis in there
that makes it square.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.300
If you can find the 4-fold axis,
then you have to ask

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.060
yourself only three questions.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.510
So 4-fold axis, fine.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.650
Is there a mirror
line in there?

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.160
Yeah.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.730
Does the mirror line go through
the 4-fold axis?

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.560
Then it is P 4 MM.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.690
And you know just where to
look for everything else,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.050
including these very
subtle glide planes

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.640
that are hard to spot.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.940
If there is a mirror plane
there, but it doesn't go

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.290
through the 4-fold axis,
then it's P 4 MG.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.350
And if there is no mirror
plane, then it's P 4.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.550
So just by asking one or two
simple questions, you can

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.560
narrow it down to what the
plane group has to be.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.330
This is another indication that
the informed intellect is

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.440
always more than a match
for sheer, raw native

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.330
intelligence.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.520
If you know what to look
for, it's a lot easier.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.810
Because you really didn't have
much practice with patterns,

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.510
we're having a quiz, as you
know, next Thursday, that will

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.060
cover up through completion of
the plane groups and not the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.290
material we've been doing now.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.900
So I think it might be of use
to you to have some practice

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.970
analyzing a few more patterns.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.640
So there are four additional
patterns in this problem set.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.670
As always, it's optional, but if
you would like to try them,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.310
and you want to see if you've
got them right, come in and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.360
see me tomorrow or on
Thursday morning.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.170
I'd be happy to go over them
with you on the spot.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.110
So this is for practice.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.130
And some of you did
extraordinarily well

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.050
on the first try.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.625
Others, I think, could use
the additional practice.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.460
There were a few people who
identified the plane group

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.620
correctly, but got the name
that's assigned to it wrong.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.610
And one other very confusing
thing is that there is one

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.470
plane group that has the symbols
G and M, and another

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.200
plane group which has
the symbols M and G.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.090
So if you found a mirror plane
and a glide plane is an

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.800
independent symmetry plane,
when is it MG,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.070
and when is it GM?

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.790
I have a little mnemonic
device.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.220
GM, general manager, is the
guy who sits on top of the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.500
organization.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.350
So GM should be the
plane group that

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.650
has the highest symmetry.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.320
P 4 GM, P 4 general manager.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.910
Now that is--

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.690
hey, it works for me.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.750
But another way of saying it
is that there are two plane

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.760
groups, one has MG and the other
has GM, and I like cars,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.340
and I think an MG is much
classier than anything that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.880
General Motors, GM, puts out,
so MG should be the one of

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.530
highest quality, highest
symmetry.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.820
And that's just the reverse.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.010
But whatever works for you.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.720
You could keep them straight
through that simple algorithm.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.310
And as they say, if it works for
me, but if it doesn't work

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.170
for you, don't use it.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.420
All right.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.170
What I will bring in during
intermission, for those of you

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.650
had trouble identifying
translations in the patterns

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.300
that we handed out earlier, I've
taken these and put them

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.780
on overhead transparencies.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.540
And I'll have two of each.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.540
So if you don't see the symmetry
or translations that

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.100
are present, you can actually
take one pattern and

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.470
physically move it and lay it
on top of the other one, and

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.960
that's a good way to convince
yourself what a translation

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.010
looks like when it occurs
in a pattern.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.250
So I'll bring those in at
our break between class.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.340
All right, any questions
before we move on?

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.380
Any questions that have arisen
as you have gotten

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.290
ready for the quiz?

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.956
You haven't gotten ready
for the quiz yet, so

00:05:46.956 --> 00:05:48.170
there are no questions.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.800
That's OK.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.750
I know how things work at MIT.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.560
You deal with one crisis
at a time.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.210
Any questions?

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.280
Anything you want to go over?

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.620
There was one interesting
wrinkle in a problem that I

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.590
had not encountered before,
and this was the one that

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.990
asked you to look at, in two
dimensions, a plane with

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.160
indices h and k.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.260
And then, when h and k were
mutually prime, to move that

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:26.670
plane by the translations plus
T1 and plus and minus T2, and

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.850
then show that the number of
intervals between the origin

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.710
and the intercept plane, the one
that hit lattice points on

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.860
both translations, was equal
to h times k if they were

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.790
mutually prime.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.800
That is true only if the
lattice is primitive.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.870
And what the problem said was to
pick one of the cells that

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.130
you used in the first
problem, number one.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.590
Well, that problem asked you
to begin with identifying

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.230
different primitive cells.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.920
If you take a multiple cell,
this operation of going plus

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:09.010
and minus T1 does not put a
lattice line through each of

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.670
the lattice points.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.420
If you picked a double cell,
that process decorated only

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.440
half of the lattice points with
planes, and the other

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.150
half sat there with nothing
hanging on them at all.

00:07:23.785 --> 00:07:27.560
The key to the difference, if
you looked at a double cell,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.070
was that if h plus k was even,
then you automatically got a

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.020
plane on every lattice point.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.110
If h plus k was odd, as it would
have been for the plane

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.450
2,1 for example, 2 plus 1 is 3--
hey, this isn't even one

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.830
of my good days--

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.010
then half of the lattice points
did not have planes

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.850
hanging on them.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.880
Now, there's great relevance
of this observation to

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.970
diffraction, and you probably
are all familiar, if only

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.060
vaguely, with the magic rules
that say, if h plus k is equal

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.480
to 3 pi plus 4, then the
intensity is identically 0.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.340
Well, for a double cell, the
lattice planes that are

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:16.160
repeated by translation diffract
x-rays, and there is

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.750
no reason why the intensity
should be

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.240
something other than 0.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.810
So here comes, a la Bragg, an
x-ray beam coming in at angle

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.850
theta, and then you say you
get diffraction when

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.640
scattering from this lattice
plane is exactly in

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.700
phase with this one.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.100
And this gives the familiar
relation that an integral

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.360
number of wavelengths is equal
to 2 d sine of theta when the

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.799
crystal diffracts.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:46.380
So there is exactly-- this
says there's exactly 2 pi

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.430
phase difference or n lambda
path difference between these

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.680
two planes.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.690
Now, if the lattice would be a
double cell, then there is an

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.710
additional lattice point in here
that does not get a plane

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.300
hung on it.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.070
So if the lattice is a double
cell, there's another plane

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.650
that has to hang on this lattice
point, and that one is

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:13.890
exactly out of phase with this
plane, and the intensity is 0.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:20.260
So this observation that a
non-primitive lattice has a

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.000
interplanar spacing that is a
sub-multiple of that of a

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.190
primitive lattice gives some
insight into why certain

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.100
reflections--

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.520
certain diffraction maxima-- are
identically 0 in intensity

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.480
for a crystal that has a
non-primitive lattice.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.750
So that is something I had
not noticed before.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.600
I should have, but I will phrase
the problem a little

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.300
bit more precisely
in the future.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:49.110
All right.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.410
So to conclude my preamble, I
hope you'll try playing with

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:58.300
some of the four additional
patterns that I handed out,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.370
just to give yourself
some practice.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.010
And the implication of this is
that you're going to see a

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.680
pattern on the quiz, and I will
tell you that you will.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.300
So if you want to see how you
did on the patterns that I

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.120
distributed, please come in
and talk to me about them.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.330
All right then.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.150
Let me remind you where
we were last time.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:29.530
We started to begin to build a
framework of symmetry elements

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.410
in three dimensions.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:37.680
And we asked the question, what
would happen if we take a

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.230
first rotation axis, A alpha,
combine it with a second

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.440
rotation axis, B beta, in
such a way that they

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.270
intersect at a point.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.500
This means that their operation
and reproducing

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.630
atoms or motifs is going to
leave at least one point in

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.480
space unchanged, and that will
be the point of intersection.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.270
We ask ourselves, what will
be the combined effect--

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.580
we have two operations
in space--

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.160
what would be the combined
effect of rotating alpha

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.910
degrees about A followed
immediately by beta degrees

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.710
about B.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.785
So what we're going to do then
is to take a first motif--

00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:23.670
and let's say it's
left handed.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.600
Being a left-handed person, I
like to give right handed

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.080
motifs and left handed
motifs equal time.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.760
If we rotate that through an
angle alpha, and this is

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.830
number 2, it will stay
left handed.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.100
Then if we rotate that by B
beta, it'll move it over here

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.682
to number 3 and it will stay
left handed as well.

00:11:45.682 --> 00:11:49.980
And the question is then, what
net operation is equivalent to

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:55.258
the combined operation of these
two transformations?

00:11:55.258 --> 00:11:59.070
And to specify the type of
operation is really a

00:11:59.070 --> 00:11:59.730
no-brainer.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.500
All of these motifs are of the
same corality so the only

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.950
thing that can relate them is

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.260
translation or another rotation.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.420
And clearly the first and the
third have no reason to be

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.450
parallel to one another, and the
distance between them is

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.120
going to depend on how far they
are away from the axis,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.260
so translation won't do the
job, a and the only thing

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:29.270
that's left as a net operation
that's equivalent to those two

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:35.050
steps is rotation about
a third axis C.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.240
And what we're going to do today
is answer the question,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:48.670
where is axis C located, and
what is the angle of rotation,

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.670
given the value of alpha and
beta and the angle between

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.010
these two axes?

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.540
And let's define that
as a lowercase c.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.460
So clearly the location of the
axis and the amount of the

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.260
rotation is going to be a
function of alpha, beta, and

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.350
the angle between them.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.970
We want this to be a combination
of operations that

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.470
exists in a symmetry
operation.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.260
And if this is to be a
crystallographic symmetry,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.380
these will be restricted to
the angular throws of a

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.180
1-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold,
4-fold, a 6-fold axis.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.110
We can take these two at a time,
ask what the net effect

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.020
is if we combine at
a given angle c.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:38.890
And what comes out here must
be a rotation which is also

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.140
crystallographic.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.270
So there are going to be severe
constraints on this

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.730
combination.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.440
Two rotations about an
intersecting point will always

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.060
be a third rotation, but if
this is to be a set of

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.060
operations in a symmetry group,
the result must be

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.880
crystallographic.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.320
That's a tough problem, and how
will we undertake it is

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.570
going to be non-intuitive.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.870
OK, the problem is most readily
treated with spherical

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.610
trigonometry.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:23.530
So on the surface of a sphere,
I'm going to map the point at

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.300
which A alpha protrudes--

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.190
and I'll call this point A--

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:32.510
and then I'll mark out the point
where axis B beta exits

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:41.210
the sphere, and I'll mark that
point B. And this is the angle

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.120
C.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.650
And we said that in spherical
trigonometry, the measure of

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.910
the length of the arc separating
A and B is given by

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.630
the angle subtended at the
center, so the length of this

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.530
distance between A and
B is the angle c.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.500
Again, it sort of boggles the
mind when you measure lengths

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.500
in terms of degrees rather
than some metric unit.

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:08.110
All right.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:14.350
So I will now not bother to show
the sphere on which the

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.080
geometry is taking place.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.710
I'll just draw A and B,
and this is the arc

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.850
between them, c.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.590
And somewhere or other there
will be some third axis, C,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.900
which is going to be the
combined effect of the

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.990
rotation about axis A and axis
B. So what I would like to do

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:39.530
is to locate the position
of this axis C.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.880
In order to do that, I'll have
to know what the angle between

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.600
A and C is, and I'll call that,
by analogy to what I've

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.400
done here, I'll call that b.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.250
And I'll want to know what the
angle between B and C is, and

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.270
I'll call that angle a.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.190
So again, going back to three
dimensions momentarily, if

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:04.920
this is the rotation operation
C gamma, and this is A alpha,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.200
and this is B beta, the axis c
is this, the angle b is this,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.940
and the angle a is this.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:19.480
OK.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.870
It's a non-trivial problem and
it is not by accident that the

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.080
solution to this problem was
first given by a very, very

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.130
famous mathematician, Leonhard
Euler, and this construction

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.950
that we're about to go through
is called Euler's

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.200
construction.

00:16:41.719 --> 00:16:42.200
All right.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:50.290
Let me find where these
different locations

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.850
are going to be.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.230
We've specified the location of
point A and the location of

00:16:55.230 --> 00:17:00.100
point B, and we know that the
angle between them is the

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.460
length of the arc ab, which is
the angle between A and C. So

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.690
let me now do some
constructions.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:15.270
Let me find a great circle that
by design is alpha over 2

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:20.619
away from the arc ab, and
that is by construction.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:24.859
And I'm going to say, then, that
if A alpha works in this

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:29.900
direction, the operation of A
alpha is going to take this

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.020
great circle and move it over
to a great circle which is

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:39.730
alpha over 2 on the other
side of the arc ab.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.100
Fine, you say, so what?

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.120
Well, just going to leave
those there for now.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.300
I'll have B beta work
in the same sense.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:54.660
And I'm now going to create a
line here that by construction

00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:00.250
is beta over 2 on one side of
the arc ab, and if I let B

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:06.130
beta go to work, that will map
this great circle over to a

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.660
new location beta over
2 on the other side.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.010
What has this done for me, other
than perhaps confuse me

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.530
and clutter the diagram?

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.710
Well, now I'm going to determine
unequivocally the

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.630
location of the axis C, and
where it emerges from the

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.750
reference here.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.880
And how will I do that?

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.680
I'm going to use a definition
that may have seemed trivial

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.550
the first time we made
the observation.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:45.610
I said that a symmetry element
is the locus of points that is

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.832
left unmoved by an operation.

00:18:49.832 --> 00:18:52.730
OK?

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:57.540
I rotated by A alpha from here
to here, that took everything

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.800
along this line and mapped it
to a new location here.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:07.290
I took this line and rotated
it by B beta, and that took

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.760
everything along this line and
moved it to a new location.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.010
So my question now is if I
rotate by A alpha and then

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:19.120
rotate in the same direction
by B beta, what

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.405
point is left unmoved?

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.940
It's only one point that can
make that claim, and that is

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.320
where these two great
circles intersect.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.510
The rotation A alpha will
take this location--

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.250
and I'm going to call it C
because I've identified now

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.760
what it is-- it's going to take
C and move it over to

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.470
here, call that C prime, and
then B beta takes that point

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.350
and only that point, and
restores it back to its

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.410
original location.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.770
So this, then, ladies and
gentlemen, is where the

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.420
rotation axis C gamma pokes
out of the sphere of

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.670
reflection.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.940
Still don't know what this angle
is in here, and I would

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:11.820
dearly love to know what these
arcs b and a are, and then I

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.170
will have specified all three
of the interaxial angles

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:22.490
between A, B and C.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:28.420
OK, let me do something quite
similar to what I did before.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:32.290
I'm going to again let A alpha
work on a particular point,

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.090
and then let B beta map it.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.830
So here's A alpha,
here's B beta.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.580
And now I'm going to look
specifically at how these two

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:46.820
rotations transform point A,
where A is the point at which

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.000
axis A alpha pokes out
of the sphere.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.640
A alpha, when it acts on this
point, does nothing to it.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.240
It leaves it alone.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.820
B beta is going to map A to
a new location, A prime.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.750
Now, doing A alpha and following
up by B beta is

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:17.230
supposed to be equal to
the rotation C gamma.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:24.770
So that says that this point and
this point must be related

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.170
by the rotation gamma.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.720
So say that again.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.360
We're doing exactly what we did
here except we're starting

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.720
with an initial point, not this
arc, but we're starting

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.480
with the specific point A,
operate on it by A alpha, it

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.120
twirled around but stays put.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:47.480
Rotate that by B beta, it goes
through a total angle beta to

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.030
this location here.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.340
The net effect of getting from A
to A prime is supposed to be

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.530
the rotation C gamma, so this
angle is then gamma and this

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.835
is the location of C. OK?

00:22:04.585 --> 00:22:08.620
OK, one other step that's
a fairly easy one.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:14.700
This length is equal to this
length, because they were

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.010
produced by rotation.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:29.490
This side is common to these two
triangles, and this angle

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.110
then is beta over 2, this
is beta over 2.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:39.470
And if these two triangles, A,
B, and C, that triangle is

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:47.110
similar to A prime BC, and
therefore I can say that angle

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:58.780
A prime CA is identical to ACB,
so therefore this angle

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.540
has to equal this angle, and if
the total angle is gamma,

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.410
this is gamma over 2, and
this is gamma over 2.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.020
So now let me extract from this
the information that I

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.550
would like to use.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:20.560
Here are three axes, A alpha,
B beta, and C gamma.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.820
This angle in here
is gamma over 2.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.930
This angle in here is beta over
2, and this angle in here

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.180
is alpha over 2.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.030
And let me emphasize that in
this magic triangle, out of

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.600
which we're going to extract
some dazzlingly profound

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.920
stuff, it is half the angular
throw of the rotation axes

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.430
that appear in here as these
spherical angles, and not the

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.720
entire angle of rotation.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.020
So here's how properties of the
three rotation axes are

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.400
related one to another.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:11.340
And now, we introduced without
proof last time something

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.140
called the law of cosines in
spherical trigonometry.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.120
And I not only do not want to
prove it, but I have no idea

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.010
how I would go about doing so,
but that doesn't prevent me

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:24.480
from using it.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.460
So if here are three edges, a,
b, c, and three angles in

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.810
there, A, B, and C, we said
that the law of cosines in

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:37.350
spherical trigonometry,
analogous in a way to the law

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.070
of cosines and plane geometry,
except since the lengths of

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.500
the triangles are measured
in degrees, there are

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.460
trigonometric functions of these
angles that appear in

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.880
the law of cosines.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:54.750
This says that cosine of b
cosine of c plus sine b sine

00:24:54.750 --> 00:25:00.745
of c times cosine of a is
equal to cosine of a.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.630
So this now is an interesting
relation that we can apply to

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:13.620
this spherical triangle, which
connects together the three

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.080
rotation axes.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:24.770
Let me apply it to find the
angle c which we have picked

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:30.850
as the angle between the initial
two axes a and b.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:34.650
That says that this should be
equal to cosine of b cosine of

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:40.240
c, the angle between the other
two axes, plus sine of b sine

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:54.340
of c times the cosine of angle
a, and angle a is cosine of

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.738
alpha over 2.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.940
So all these quantities that
we'd like to determine are

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:07.640
hooked together by the
law of cosines.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:13.060
And this is a lovely relation,
but it doesn't do us a bit of

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:20.220
good, because in this relation
we know only one quantity, and

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.530
that is the rotation
angle of a.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:28.170
We can pick the angle between
a and b, that's this, but I

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.130
have no idea what these
other angles are.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.600
That's what I'd like
to find out.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.980
I'd like to find out the
angles at which three

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.870
rotations have to be combined
in order that rotation about

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.150
one followed by rotation about
the second be the third.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.650
So this equation is a beautiful
equation, but it

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.860
involves everything that I
don't know and only one

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.470
quantity that I do know.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.130
So it looks as though
we're up the creek.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.910
Yes, sir?

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:59.637
AUDIENCE: So you're looking for
cosine c, so shouldn't it

00:26:59.637 --> 00:27:01.700
be cosine b cosine a?

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.950
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.200
Yeah, I did that wrong.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.340
Yeah.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.030
You're absolutely right.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:17.070
This should be cosine of a,
and this a goes with this

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.205
alpha over 2.

00:27:18.205 --> 00:27:18.890
Absolutely.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.140
Sorry about that.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.000
So anyway, the point still
stands that what this equation

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.230
involves is the three interaxial
angles, and I would

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.460
like to know how I could combine
a and b to get it to

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.170
come out to a crystallographic
rotation c, and where that

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.460
location is relative to
the first two axes.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.710
So it involves everything I
don't know, and only one

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.370
thing that I do.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:53.340
But now we introduce another
curious aspect of spherical

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.830
triangles, which I mentioned
last time.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.450
You may have thought
that that's

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.230
interesting, but who cares?

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:06.640
Here are the three points, A,
B, and C, and these are the

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.290
three arcs little c, little
a and little b.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.210
And then we said we could
construct something called the

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:17.350
polar triangle of ABC.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:23.480
And what we would do, we would
find the pole of arc b, and

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.340
that will be some
point B prime.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:31.680
We'll find the pole of arc
a, and that will be

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.360
some point A prime.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.060
We'll find, similarly, the pole
of arc c, and that will

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.210
be some point C prime.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:43.250
And now we can connect together
A prime, B prime, and

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.440
C prime, and get something
that's

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.005
called the polar triangle.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.400
And now comes the useful part.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:57.990
We said that a curious property
of the polar triangle

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:05.290
is that the side of the polar
triangle plus the angle

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:10.680
opposite it add up
to 180 degrees.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.790
In my original triangle, this is
beta over 2, this is gamma

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.960
over 2, and this is
alpha over 2.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.370
So the length of this side is
going to be 180 degrees minus

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:28.540
beta over 2, the length of this
side is going to be 180

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.490
degrees minus alpha over 2, and
the length of this side is

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:38.270
going to be 180 degrees
minus gamma over 2.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:43.630
And now let's use these angles
and these lengths in the law

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.310
of cosines, and I'll leave
out the little bit

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.210
of intervening algebra.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:55.760
And what we will get out of
this is that cosine of c--

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.720
and I'll solve for that--

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:03.940
is equal to cosine of alpha over
2 cosine of beta over 2

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:10.140
plus cosine of gamma over 2
divided by sine alpha over 2

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.860
sine beta over 2.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.820
And that is something we can
sink our teeth into and run

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.570
with, because now I can ask the
question, suppose I want a

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:28.010
to be a 2-fold rotation axis,
b to be a 3-fold rotation

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.830
axis, and c be a 4-fold
rotation axis?

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:39.040
Then the value of alpha over 2
is half of 180 degrees or 90.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.470
Well, you can see I put
in half the value of

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.970
the rotation axes.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.990
And then I solve for c, and that
is the angle at which I

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:51.950
have to put axis a and b
together to get c to turn out

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:55.050
to be whatever angle
gamma over 2 is.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.220
So I can do this

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.850
systematically now without thinking.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:11.090
And I can set up the problem by
taking the crystallographic

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.140
rotation axes and combining them
together three at a time

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.060
in all possible combinations.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.070
Right?

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.400
In addition to this relation,
I have two other relations.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.120
And let me assemble them off to
the left, because we have

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.820
to solve three equations to
find out the nature of the

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.460
combination that is required.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:40.010
So just permuting terms, the
angle between A and B, c, has

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:45.330
to follow from cosine of c
equals cosine of alpha over 2

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:51.050
cosine of beta over 2 plus
cosine of gamma over 2.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:56.470
Notice that the single term by
itself is the cosine of half

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:02.200
the angle of the opposite
rotation axis c.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.340
Then in the denominator is the
sine of these two angles.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.690
And so just permuting terms, one
can see that cosine of b

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.850
is going to turn out to be
cosine of alpha over 2 cosine

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:23.280
of gamma over 2 plus cosine of
theta over 2 divided by sine

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.570
of alpha over 2 sine
of gamma over 2.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.600
And a third analogous expression
will give me the

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:37.230
angle that will be the one
between B and C. And this will

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:42.590
be cosine of beta over 2 cosine
gamma over 2 plus

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:48.330
cosine of alpha over 2 divided
by sine beta over 2

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:52.690
sine gamma over 2.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.590
OK?

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.090
So now we don't have
to think anymore.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.990
It's just plug and chug.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:01.100
And I'll pause to suck in air
and let you catch up, and then

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.515
we'll set up the problem and
look at a few solutions.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.210
And all this, in the event
that you're thoroughly

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:31.240
bewildered, is in the
set of notes that I

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.260
handed out last time.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:37.060
So you can read it over
at your leisure.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.540
AUDIENCE: Will this stuff
be on the quiz?

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:39.980
PROFESSOR: No.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.940
Quiz will go up to the end of
the two-dimensional plane

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.100
groups and stop.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.350
We won't say anything
three dimensional.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:06.030
OK, let's, then, if there's no
objection or complaint, look

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.449
at possible values for--

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:11.179
let me do it the same way that
I did it in the notes so that

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.340
it's consistent--

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:17.690
let's put down the value for
axis b, the rank of axis b and

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.120
the rank of axis a.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:32.460
And A could be a 1-fold axis,
B could be a 1-fold access,

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.280
and we could take a 1 with a 1
with a 1, a 1 with a 1 with a

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.810
2, a 1 with a 1 with a 3, a 1
with a 1 with a 4, and a 1

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.060
with a 1 with a 6.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.739
This is clearly impossible.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.920
If I did nothing, and followed
it by doing nothing, and

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.989
wanted it to come out to be a
6-fold rotation, you'd all be

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:57.580
spinning on your axes
like tops right now.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.270
So you can't do nothing and
follow it by doing nothing and

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.200
have it come out to
be a net rotation.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.630
So these are impossible.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.590
So we don't have to
consider those.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:13.220
A could be a 2, though, and I
don't want to do 2, 1, 1,

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.930
because I've got
a 1, 1, 2 here.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.310
The order doesn't make
any difference.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:22.440
So I'll start with a 2, 1,
2, a 2, 1, 3, a 2, 1,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.050
4, and a 2, 1, 6.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:31.020
So those are four combinations
that I should be examining.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:36.070
I could look at a 3 with a--

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.200
2 with a 1, I have here in the
form of 2, 1, 3, so the next

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:55.250
one I would want to look at
is a 3, 1, 3, a 3, 1,

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:59.850
4, and a 3, 1, 6.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:03.310
And let me put in a
couple more here.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:10.480
If B were a 2, I should look at
a 2 with a 2 with a 2, a 2

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.040
with a 2 with a 3, a 2
with a 2 with a 4, 2

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.230
with a 2 with a 6.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.530
And then A 3 with a 2--

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:25.192
and I've got 3, 2, 2 up here, so
I'll start with 3, 2, 3, 3,

00:36:25.192 --> 00:36:28.980
2, 4, 3, 2, 6, run out of room
here, but there should be a

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:33.700
similar entry with
a 4 and a 6.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.000
So this sets up the problem.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.170
If you count up the number of
ways one can do this, we only

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:42.600
have to consider the
off-diagonal boxes here,

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:48.160
because interchanging a and b,
for example, looking at 3, 1,

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.030
3, that's going to be the
same as 1, 3, 3 up here.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.110
So it's just the off-diagonal
boxes

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.680
that we have to consider.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:06.330
So there should be a 3,
3, 3 in here, a 3, 3,

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.065
4, and a 3, 3, 6.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.890
So what we would have to do in
order to determine the unique

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:21.950
combinations is to look at all
of these combinations in turn,

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:28.190
and I'm going to not
try all of them.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:34.740
I will do one that's going
to be clearly impossible.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.730
So let's look at 2, 1, 4.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:44.390
So here A corresponds to a
2-fold axis, B corresponds to

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:53.830
a 1-fold axis, and C would
correspond to a 4-fold axis.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:58.500
So could we combine these three
axes at appropriate

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.620
angles such that a 2-fold
followed by a 1-fold is

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.420
equivalent to a 4-fold?

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.310
This clearly isn't
going to work.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:10.820
If I do a 180-degree rotation
then don't do anything and ask

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:15.850
is that equivalent to a 4-fold
rotation, that is saying that

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.080
the 2-fold axis should be
identical to the 4-fold axis,

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.460
and that is not going to work.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.580
So let me do now a generic
family that I know turns out

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.220
to be possible.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:36.120
Let me look at an n-fold axis
with a 2-fold axis with a

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:41.590
2-fold axis, and I can show
that this combination is

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:45.260
possible for any integer
n whatsoever.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.080
So this will include a lot
of non-crystallographic

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.980
symmetries.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:58.130
So let's say that this is C,
this is A, and this is B. But

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:59.995
make it C, B, A if you'd like.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:11.770
OK, so my first equation says
that cosine of c, the angle

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:17.610
between A and B, should be equal
to the cosine of alpha

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:22.640
over 2 times the cosine of beta
over 2 plus the cosine of

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:28.290
gamma over 2 divided by sine
of alpha over 2 sine

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.370
of beta over 2.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:39.390
B is a 2-fold axis, so alpha
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.780
A is a 2-fold--

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:41.970
I'm sorry.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:44.530
B beta, A alpha.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.510
Beta is equal to 180 degrees,
the angular

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.510
throw of a 2-fold axis.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.570
Alpha is equal to 180
degrees, the angular

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:56.080
throw of a 2-fold axis.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:04.140
And gamma is equal to whatever
2 pi over n would be.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.300
That's the throw of the n-fold
axis than I'm letting be equal

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.520
to C.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:17.940
So the cosine of A and B, to get
the result of rotation A

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.360
followed by rotation B being
equal to the net rotation of

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.340
an n-fold axis is that the
cosine of c should be the

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:33.210
cosine of 180 degrees over 2
times the cosine of 180 over 2

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:39.340
plus the cosine of gamma over
2, and gamma is whatever the

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.600
rank of the axis determines, and
that's divided by sine of

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:50.920
alpha over 2, and alpha is 180
and sine beta over 2, and

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.870
that's 180 over 2.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:59.550
So the cosine of c is going to
be the cosine of 90, which is

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:04.600
0, times the cosine of 90, which
is 0, plus the cosine of

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.540
gamma over 2, whatever that
might be, over the sine of 90

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.020
which is 1, sine of
90 which is 1.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:18.405
So this says that cosine
of c is equal to cosine

00:41:18.405 --> 00:41:20.350
of gamma over 2.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:25.520
So the angle between axis A and
axis B ought to be equal

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:32.710
to one half the angular throw
of rotation axis C. So let's

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.680
start putting down some
of this information.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:43.470
This says that if this is axis
C gamma, then A pi and B pi,

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:47.180
the 2 180-degree rotations,
should be at an

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.000
angle gamma over 2.

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:57.530
We still need values
for b, and we still

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.470
need a value for a.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:03.400
So let's find out
what those are.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.620
And let me start over here at
the left again, because I've

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.430
got the relation that I need
for b sitting here.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:18.160
The cosine of b is equal to the
cosine of alpha over 2,

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:26.185
and that is the cosine of pi
over 2, plus alpha is a

00:42:26.185 --> 00:42:27.850
90-degree rotation.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:32.990
Then cosine of gamma over 2,
whatever gamma happens to be,

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.290
plus the cosine of beta over
2, and that's cosine of pi

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:41.760
over 2, and this is all over
sine of pi over 2 times the

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:50.110
sine of gamma over 2.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:55.360
So this is going to be cosine of
pi over 2, which is 0, plus

00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:05.620
cosine of pi over 2 divided by
sine of pi over 2, which is 1.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.510
This gamma over 2--

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:13.800
no, cosine of pi over 2 is 0.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:20.530
So this is 0 plus 0 times sine
of gamma over 2, whatever that

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.070
turns out to be.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:27.090
So cosine of b is 0, and that
says that the angle b between

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:32.680
axis A and axis C turns
out to be 90 degrees.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:40.780
So in order to get pi followed
by c gamma to be equal to b

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.400
pi, I've got to make b be
equal to pi over 2.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.420
And if I put it in this
orientation, then a pi

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.960
followed by c gamma is going
to be equal to b pi.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.870
One final angle, and that's
the value for a.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:12.890
OK, cosine of a should be equal
to the cosine of beta

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:18.410
over 2, that's pi over 2 times
the cosine of gamma over 2,

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:26.700
whatever it is, plus the cosine
of beta over 2, and

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:34.200
that's cosine of pi over 2, over
sine pi over 2 sine of

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.930
gamma over 2.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:43.880
And this, as for b, turns out
to be 0 plus 0 over sine pi

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:50.810
over 2, which is 1 times
sine of gamma over 2.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:54.820
So cosine of a turns out to be
0, and this says that the

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:58.750
angle a is also pi over 2.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:59.600
So we've got a whole--

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.502
Yeah.

00:45:00.502 --> 00:45:01.704
AUDIENCE: Did you really
need to go

00:45:01.704 --> 00:45:03.210
through all three equations?

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because I had
to show that all three work.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:10.300
And in general, if I combine,
let's say, a 4-fold with a

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.350
3-fold with a 2-fold, which is
something I want to do, all

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:18.238
three angles a, b, and
c, will be different.

00:45:18.238 --> 00:45:20.700
OK?

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.510
So the answer is yes.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:26.270
And there will be a few cases
where a value for one angle

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:31.600
will exist and the value for the
one or two others will be

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.880
impossible.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.240
And that's also something
that I have to know.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.830
So repetitious as the exercise
might be, the answer is yeah,

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:42.822
you do have to do all three.

00:45:42.822 --> 00:45:44.072
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:48.234 --> 00:45:50.460
PROFESSOR: Oh, you don't have to
do different permutations.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.830
That's just a question
of labeling.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:53.080
OK?

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.490
So n with a 2 with a 2 is the
same as a 2 with an n with a 2

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:58.080
is the same as a 2
with a 2 with an

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.000
n, that's just labeling.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.500
So that's why my boxes, when I
filled them out, the list got

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.940
shorter and shorter, until
finally for a 6-fold axis, it

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:12.780
would be just 6, 1, 1, 6, 1,
2, 6, 1, 3, and so on.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.450
Just that one entry in the box
where I enumerated what should

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:16.700
be considered.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:28.440
Well, here is a whole slew of
possible solutions and a lot

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.990
of them are
non-crystallographic, but

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:31.450
still possible.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:37.450
This says that a combination
of a 2-fold axis--

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:40.540
but remember now that these are
equations and operations.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:44.910
But the only operation that's
present for a 2-fold axis is a

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:47.415
rotation a pi, b pi or c pi.

00:46:47.415 --> 00:46:52.940
So I could combine three 2-fold
axes that are mutually

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:58.850
orthogonal, and that is an
allowable combination.

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:03.650
And what we are obtaining here
is a sort of scaffolding, a

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:08.170
framework, based on pure
rotation operations, that by

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.270
themselves will be an allowable
3-dimensional point

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:16.630
group, but which also provides a
framework, a Christmas tree,

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.230
that we can decorate with mirror
planes and inversion

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.500
centers to get still additional

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.760
groups of higher symmetry.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.470
So here's one possible
crystallographic o combination

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.030
of rotation axes.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.860
What we will use to denote this
combination is the same

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:35.200
rule that we use for
our other notation.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.880
We will make a running list of
the independent operations

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:43.030
that are present, and what we
have combined here are three

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.390
distinct independent
2-fold axes.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:54.150
A solid that would have this
symmetry plus some other

00:47:54.150 --> 00:48:00.790
symmetry would be an orthogonal
brick with one

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.050
2-fold axis coming out here.

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:10.130
This is the operation c pi,
another 2-fold axis coming out

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:15.740
the front, and this would be
the operation a pi, and

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.510
another 2-fold axis coming out
of this face, and this would

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:20.040
be the operation b pi.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.430
Now let me show you-- it's
rather amusing-- that what we

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.740
have done really works.

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:34.990
We've shown supposedly that a pi
followed by b pi should be

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:40.390
equal to a net rotation c
pi about an axis that's

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:42.070
orthogonal to the first two.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:45.680
So let's pick a motif, and for
convenience I'll put it at one

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.340
corner of this brick.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:52.420
Here's object 1, I rotate it
by 180 degrees about a.

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:57.090
Here sits object number 2,
same corality, and then I

00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:02.900
rotate it 180 degrees about B
beta, and that's going to give

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.240
me number 3.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.990
What is the net way of
getting from 1 to 3?

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.860
Holy mackerel.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:14.720
It's a net 180-degree
rotation about c pi.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.970
It really works.

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:21.360
Or I could do the operations
in a different order.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.580
I could rotate by d, rotate by
c, and the way I get from the

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:30.160
first to the third is
a rotation a pi.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.260
So that is a self consistent
set of rotation axes.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.610
That is 2, 2, 2.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:38.722
Let me do one more.

00:49:38.722 --> 00:49:41.730
Well, no, let me take a break
here and let you absorb all

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:45.140
this, and then we'll look at
some remaining ones, and this

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.340
will include some that are
non- crystallographic.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.800
And that's perfectly OK.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.980
But they're lovely groups, they
constitute groups, but

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.250
they won't be groups
that can occur in

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:55.760
combination with a lattice.

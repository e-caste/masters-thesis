00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.700
PROFESSOR STRANG: Okay, shall
we start on this review session?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.360
And I'm figuring that the main
topic would be finite elements,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.840
because the last review session
focused on the truss problems.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.850
One note about codes.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.920
So probably you've looked
at the CSE page, where

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.270
some codes that we had
earlier are put there,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.270
section by section.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.630
Now people are
contributing a truss code,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.640
so I don't see any reason
why that shouldn't eventually

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.960
go onto the CSE page.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.450
If you have other codes,
like finite element

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.570
codes, for specific
problems, think about,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.630
if you get them
with some comments,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.210
if they're appropriate
to go on the CSE page,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.730
that's certainly a possibility.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.260
And the homework
solutions, which

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:28.750
are now on the 18.085 page,
will migrate to the CSE page,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.710
for their permanent status.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.480
So that's just to say, this
is a page that's growing,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.450
and any help is
very, very welcome.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.170
So, I'm ready for questions
about finite elements, maybe

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.770
specifically, or
other things, too.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.940
Thanks.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.620
Yeah, lots to say
about finite elements.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.120
Yeah?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.887
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:01:58.887 --> 00:02:00.720
PROFESSOR STRANG: So
this is finite elements

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.010
for heat transfer.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.770
Okay, which course was that?

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.170
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.350
PROFESSOR STRANG: Okay.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.310
Right, free or fixed
boundary conditions.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.850
Okay, I see.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.520
So the question is, how do
we handle boundary conditions

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.400
which are not
something equal zero,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.390
but something equals a
constant, or something is given.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.890
Right.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.560
Good point.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.720
So, somehow when
we're given numbers,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.180
they're going to--
Input, source terms,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.740
they're going to show up
on the right-hand side.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.400
Right?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.930
Eventually, they'll be part
of the right side vector F,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.320
in some appropriate way.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.680
So that we'll be solving
KU=F, where U will represent

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.900
the unknown displacements,
whatever they are

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.160
in the problem.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:23.150
So let's see, what do I say
about getting things correctly

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.720
onto the right hand side?

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.660
My general thought would
be, so we create a matrix

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.120
that I might call K_0.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.030
That's a matrix where
we have not knocked

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.640
out any rows or columns.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.300
It's probably, almost
surely singular.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:51.850
It's got all possible
unknowns, even those that

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:02.030
are not actually unknown,
associated with the columns

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.080
of that matrix.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.150
So we start with that.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.010
Start with that.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.250
Okay.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.940
Now, suppose-- Let's take
things in order then.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.800
Suppose U_7 is set to zero.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.620
So what will that
do to our matrix K?

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.150
How do we-- Having
created this matrix K,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.970
let's suppose we've got
it, how do we include in it

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.890
the boundary condition U_7=0?

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:41.120
Okay, well that column of
the matrix, the column number

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.600
seven, I guess, or the column
corresponding to that unknown,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.880
is going to go.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.420
Is that right?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.200
Yes.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.860
That's what we've done,
we've struck out a column.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.560
And we should also, I
guess, strike out a row.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.660
We would really like to end up
with symmetric, and normally

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.780
positive definite, matrices.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.950
So this would be a column
row-- I'm speaking roughly,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.350
because I didn't have advanced
preparation on this question.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.440
So column/row removed.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.100
Okay, now suppose
U_7 has some value

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.670
A. How do we account for that?

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.740
So what do we do?

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.200
U_7 isn't still unknown, so
we want to get that column out

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.620
of our matrix.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.120
But something has to happen
to account for the A.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.050
So what is that?

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:56.260
So my picture is that in my
original K_0, which had--

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:03.550
My original K_0, and then all
the U's equal all the F's.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:14.040
So this had a column for
everybody, including U_7.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.420
So there was the other
U's, including U_7,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:26.070
and these F's maybe came
from body forces, stuff

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.620
inside the interval.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.790
Now here comes perhaps
a boundary condition.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.100
Oh, I wrote it in
the middle anyway.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.340
So what happens
when I set U_7 to A?

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.160
So I think that becomes,
I strike out that unknown,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.060
strike out that column,
strike out that row, I think.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.130
But what should happen?

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.750
How does the A come in?

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.880
Well that A multiplied
that column, right?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.640
That A multiplied-- This
equation expressed equilibrium.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.110
Those equations were all valid.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.380
You could say we haven't imposed
the boundary conditions yet.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.880
Now when we do-- So that
A multiplies that column.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.720
So what happens now, what
do you think should I do?

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.620
It seems to me that I should
bring A times that column over

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.330
to the other side, with
a minus, of course,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.120
because I put it on the
other side of the equation.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:37.140
So I would think I do
this: A times column seven.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.450
I think.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.120
I think that would seem right.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.705
Now you're going to ask about --
you unfortunately did ask about

00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:47.870
-- a free condition.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:55.380
Say u'-- So what
am I going to do?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.760
I'd better think here.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.550
What's cooking now?

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:06.550
So I could prescribe u',
let me say one, equal zero,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.710
let's just think about that.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.400
What happens with that?

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.650
Hmm.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.420
So let's see.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:30.470
Well, so u' was
not one of our U's,

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.350
so this isn't just simply,
OK assign a value, zero or A,

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:42.430
to a U. u' being zero, well that
came in as a natural boundary

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.820
condition, right?

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.150
If I remember my own lectures.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:52.620
So that u'=0 came in as a
natural boundary condition.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.460
And what did that mean?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:01.310
That meant that I don't
have to impose it.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.960
The finite element method
should deal with that.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.540
This is really our w.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.390
Our dual unknown, w.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.650
It's better to think of it as w.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:19.930
Maybe cu' is what it is, but
it's good to think of it as w.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.210
Okay, so I think of
that as something we

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.420
don't have to impose.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.400
In other words, the
way I'm thinking now,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.300
I don't have to
think about that.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:40.100
I've got trial functions
whose combinations will get

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.660
me close to the correct answer.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:51.970
And the equations will
naturally do that.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:58.650
Okay, now you're asking
this serious question?

00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.620
What about w=A?

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.000
What about that?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.880
Or B. Let me make it
something different.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.290
Okay.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:22.770
Let me say right off, without
having prepared a good answer

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.490
to this question, I'm not going
to do it as well as I should.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.790
So maybe what my real
answer should be,

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:37.040
let me think through the best
answer and do it another time.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:48.660
It's going to contribute
some term, some new term.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.460
When we integrated by parts
to get to the weak form,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.630
this guy just showed up.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.240
And up to now, we've just
assume that B was zero,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.310
and we didn't worry.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.890
But somewhere in that
integration by parts,

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.950
a term is going to appear
that I can't just throw away.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:09.450
Yeah.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.730
So let me think about
that more properly.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.280
I mean that's a
very good question,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:19.930
and the lectures
didn't allow for that.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.330
Okay, if I can put that one
off and give you a good answer.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.900
Because it deserves it.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.910
Okay, other questions.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.400
Other discussion.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.192
Yeah, you have one?

00:11:29.192 --> 00:11:30.858
AUDIENCE: I have maybe
a silly question.

00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:33.041
PROFESSOR STRANG: You
have a silly question?

00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:33.540
Good.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.080
Okay.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:43.042
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:43.042 --> 00:11:44.750
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Compare finite elements

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.940
with finite differences.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.790
Okay, yeah.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:55.960
That's not a silly question.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.790
So finite differences
is certainly

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.770
associated with
values at a mesh.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.800
Here would be one
way to think of it.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.340
So the question is,
finite elements,

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:13.160
finite element method versus
finite difference method.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.610
And of course, there
are other methods, too.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:25.710
Okay, I could think
about finite differences.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.160
One way of seeing
them together is,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.700
I could think about finite
differences this way.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.480
My test functions, you
remember, which I always

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.010
integrate against.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.060
Instead of taking
the test functions

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.380
to be the trial functions,
which is giving us

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:55.550
our standard finite element K,
I could take the test functions

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.230
to be delta functions.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.810
What would happen
if I take the-- So,

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.420
again just think about that.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:11.860
Suppose my solution U is
a combination of the phis,

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.180
as always.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.630
As before.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:32.380
But my test functions, V, are
delta functions at mesh points.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.400
Because up to now,
we've always taking

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.280
the V's to be the
same as the phis.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.930
So the V_i, the test functions,
and I'll want n of them.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.300
I'll have n mesh points.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.190
My n mesh points, those will
give me n delta functions,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.810
n test functions.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:58.050
And what happens then, when
I look at the integral?

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:08.030
The finite element deal
says, take the weak form.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.770
Well, OK.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:17.070
And you'll see why, I'm going
to take the weak form before I

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.480
take the integration by parts.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.180
Why is that?

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.180
Because when I
integrated by parts,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.050
do you remember
what the effect was?

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.620
The effect was to take
a derivative off of U

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.020
and throw it onto
the test function V.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.640
But now that I'm choosing delta
functions for the V's, it's

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.800
too risky.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.850
I don't want a derivative
of a delta function.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.660
I better keep it all over here.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:53.340
So I'll have -cU'', times V.
This is what I had originally.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.560
I just took the
equation, you remember

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.110
how we got these equations?

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:05.270
I just took the strong form,
multiplied by V, integrated,

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.840
and now I usually
integrated by parts,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.680
but I'm backing off of that.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:20.280
Because my V is too
singular to do it.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.890
So again, what would I do?

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:28.210
My U would be a combination,
as always, of these.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.710
And what will I get
for these integrals?

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.800
What will I get for
those integrals?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.500
Well, of course, if
that's a delta function

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.390
at a mesh point, when
I integrate something

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:44.420
against a delta
function, I get--

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.290
What do I get when I integrate
against a delta function?

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:55.360
If V_i is the delta function
at a particular mesh point i,

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.170
as always I get the
value of that at i.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.340
At i.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:06.950
So I'll get -cU'' will
be whatever it is.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.790
It will be the sum of
U_i's, the unknown constant,

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.100
times the phi_i double prime.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.660
And what will I get on
the right-hand side?

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.690
When I integrate f times V_i?

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.280
I'll get f at that
mesh point, f_i.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:34.240
In other words, I think what
I've got there is essentially

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.720
a difference equation.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.280
I'm back pretty much
to finite differences.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.680
I'm taking the value f, not
integrated now, but just

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.740
its value at i,
because that's what I

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.050
get when I do a delta function.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.160
And I'm taking this.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.970
Notice, a lot of things
are different here.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.290
And there's a name for this.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:17:00.760
This is called collocation.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.680
I guess what I'm saying
is collocation, this idea,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.620
is somewhere in between.

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:17.290
I'm interpolating -- collocation
-- between the finite element,

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.040
the Galerkin principle,
and finite differences,

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.600
where I don't even think
about trial functions.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.320
In between is something
that really looks like--

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:35.900
[SOFT MUSIC] [LAUGHTER] I don't
know if that wonderful music

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.750
comes through on the
OpenCourseWare tape,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.310
but anyway.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.360
This is MIT.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.700
We get a brass band here.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:18:04.500
Okay, that would be a very
finite-difference-looking set

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.450
of equations to approximate the
original differential equation.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.640
The point I want to
make, this gives me

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.630
a chance to make a point here.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.410
Could I use hat functions?

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:25.100
Could I use hat functions in
this as my trial functions,

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.310
if I was not going to
integrate by parts?

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.360
When are hat functions allowed?

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.500
Because hat functions
have a jump in the slope.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.750
Right?

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.220
Hat functions have
a jump in the slope.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:42.210
Then my answer, you can
see it coming, is no.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:47.620
Hat functions, they don't
have good second derivatives.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.880
So I wanted to make that
point, also, for beam bending.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:56.460
And let me make it.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.270
So your question is
leading me to another topic

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:04.440
that I wanted to mention.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:16.000
That hat functions, phi' is OK.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.150
Phi double prime, second
derivatives of hat functions,

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:27.460
are basically, let me just
say it in a word, not OK.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:33.910
So this is OK, this is for
second order equations.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.460
Well, second order equations
have a second derivative.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.310
Looking bad.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:47.690
But when I integrate by parts--
After integration by parts.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.460
And that's exactly
how we've used them.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.020
We've used them for our
second order equation.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.660
We integrated by parts.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:03.030
We had terms like cu'--
c phi primes times V'.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.350
First derivatives, no problem.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:18.910
But not OK for
collocation, this method

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.710
that I've just spoken about.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.200
Because we're not
integrating by parts.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.290
Our test function V,
the delta, was not

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.900
smooth enough to move a
derivative over there.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:38.280
And, now my additional
not OK, for bending.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.640
So this is just bringing
us into today's lecture,

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.060
but maybe it completes a point.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:52.390
So in bending we did
integrate by parts.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.810
So what did we get?

00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:01.750
Our bending weak form,
our fourth order equation

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:02.860
weak form.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.000
Say u fourth
derivative equal f(x).

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.200
When I integrated
by parts twice,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:17.070
you remember, I had
u fourth times a v,

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.070
times a test function, dx.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.500
And my idea, so really
we're seeing it here

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.750
for the first time, was to
do two integrations by parts,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:36.320
get two derivatives off
of u, put them onto v,

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.620
and maybe there's a
c(x) in here, too.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.900
This was our
integral to be done.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:51.390
That's the basic integral that
leads to all the entries of K.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.120
But the trouble is-- So
that's in the bending problem.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.050
In the fourth order
problem, our integrals

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.640
are going to look like that.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.460
And we have to use functions
that are good enough.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.270
So if I use hat functions,
they're not good enough.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.890
Why's that?

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.380
If you suppose u
and v are the same,

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.980
then I'm integrating the
second derivative squared.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.850
And what is the second
derivative, what's its square,

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.010
and what's the integral?

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:26.220
This is really
worth recognizing.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:32.970
So suppose phi is the same as
v, and it's the hat function.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.750
And if I want to
integrate some constant,

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:45.690
or some nice function times
phi'' times v'', what do I get?

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.660
What's the second derivative?

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.900
What's the first derivative
of my hat function?

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.790
It's up, right?

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.350
It's the first derivative.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:01.830
So let me do phi'*v', is,
let me draw its graph.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.850
The first derivative
is zero up to there,

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.690
then the first derivative
jumps up to something high,

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.000
up to the middle.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.110
Then it drops to the negative.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.800
And then it comes back to zero.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.010
Right?

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.090
That's my first derivative.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.510
I'm OK integrating that.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.450
I'm OK squaring it
and integrating.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:32.390
But the second derivative, if
I graph phi'', which will be

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.300
the same as v'', what's the
second derivative of that

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.160
function?

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:42.130
It's zero, and then what
is it at this point?

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.300
The derivative now?

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.520
Delta, right?

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.030
Spikes up.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.280
Then nothing until this point.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.900
At that point what happens?

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.730
Spikes down twice as far.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.260
Really way down.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.870
And then finally
there's a spike up.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:02.610
Okay.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:07.690
I can integrate spikes
times nice functions.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.430
What I can't integrate
is a spike times a spike.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.990
So the answer for
this integral is what?

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.220
It's infinite.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.340
The integral is no good.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:30.660
If I have a spike times a spike,
you see-- Delta functions,

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:41.930
I'm OK with a nice function,
f(x) times a delta, is OK.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:48.910
But not OK for the integral of
delta of x times delta of x.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.130
That's not OK.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.660
That one is infinite.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.640
That one is not in
our space of functions

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.140
that we can integrate.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.640
OK.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:10.460
So this is the difficulty
you meet with higher order

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.530
problems, is that
your functions, some

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:19.960
of the old functions that
worked fine, are no longer OK.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.970
I need two derivatives.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.990
Or I need to be
able to integrate

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.760
the second derivative squared.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.020
It can have a jump, but
it can't have a spike.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:41.700
So what functions
have we chosen?

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.740
How would we deal
with bending problems?

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.910
And I guess that'll probably
come, maybe quickly,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.740
into Friday's lecture.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.880
How would I do finite
elements for bending?

00:25:53.880 --> 00:26:01.630
I'm not allowed to use
hats, so what will I use?

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.120
Do you remember that
construction, Monday?

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.030
Those cubics.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:14.020
Remember those cubics, those
C^1 cubics would be OK.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:14.800
Why's that?

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.060
Because they have a
continuous derivative.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.710
They're one degree smoother
than hat functions.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.640
These were C^0 hat functions.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.300
And they were still C^0
when I put bubbles in there.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.100
I had to get up to that
extra degree of smoothness,

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.680
this continuous slope.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.880
Then I can take the
second derivative.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.620
The second derivative
may have a jump.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.200
Jumps are OK.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.760
A jump in the second derivative
there and a jump there,

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.950
I can multiply two jump
functions and integrate.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.550
So those C^1 cubics
that we constructed,

00:26:54.550 --> 00:27:00.060
you remember at every
node I had two unknowns,

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.190
the height and the slope.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:05.880
So there were two cubics
for each mesh point.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:12.590
But the key idea was that they
had this extra continuity.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.820
And let me just
say, looking ahead,

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:19.230
these splines that
are also coming Friday

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.830
have one more degree of freedom.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.670
I'm sorry, one
more, there's C^2.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:31.030
So splines, cubic splines
-- I'll just put it here

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:41.480
because it fits -- C^2 for cubic
splines, that's coming Monday.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.600
That's functions that have
two continuous derivatives,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.000
and the jump is in
the third derivative.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.130
So those could be
used, well, they

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.730
could be used for
sixth order problems.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.870
Of course we're never going
to see a sixth order problem.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:57.730
I hope.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:59.630
But they could be used there.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:04.645
Or they could be used in
collocation for fourth order--

00:28:04.645 --> 00:28:06.770
Well, could they be used
for fourth order problems?

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.170
I'm not sure.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:15.570
Anyway, the more smoothness,
as I go up in the derivatives,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:22.290
I have to get more smoothness
in all the finite element

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.480
constructions.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.630
And it gets a lot harder.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.420
Actually, I can do it in 1-D,
but it gets seriously hard

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.410
in two dimensions to figure
out function surfaces

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.960
that-- This is what CAD
is all about, actually.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.950
Is figuring out, how do
you get smooth surfaces?

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:48.990
The whole CAD/CAM world of NURBS
and piecewise, rational things.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.030
It's a very complicated
construction,

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:57.060
to get the shape of
some engineering piece

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.040
approximated, including
its curved boundary,

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:07.330
by smooth piecewise polynomials,
or piecewise something.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:14.500
That whole world of CAD is
not trivial, to do that.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.330
Well, OK, that's my speech.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.050
You got me started
with your question.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.797
Did I answer your
question in some way?

00:29:22.797 --> 00:29:23.880
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.838
PROFESSOR STRANG: It went
beyond your question.

00:29:25.838 --> 00:29:27.760
Yes it did.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.610
That's right.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.120
These are things
that I may not have

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.740
time to develop in
Friday's lecture,

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.180
because I really have to
get on to two dimensions,

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:44.190
and gradients and divergences,
all that good stuff

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.610
has to start Monday.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.510
So we'll see something
about splines Friday.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:56.250
But the whole world
of different elements

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.640
is sort of interesting.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:04.380
Actually, can I say one more
thing about the elements

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.540
that we've already constructed.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.330
I want to say one more
point that occurs to me.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:17.490
And then I really will
stop and answer questions.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.080
This extra point occurred to me.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:28.070
You remember our example
where we had hat functions,

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.730
and then we also had
bubble functions.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.690
Right?

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:36.180
So where did the bubble go?

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:44.390
These were only C^0, hats plus
bubbles, plus parabola bubbles,

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.560
quadratic bubbles.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.900
Parabola bubble functions.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.030
So how did those go?

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:59.455
Between two mesh
points-- Sorry, I'd

00:30:59.455 --> 00:31:05.960
better leave myself more
space for that bubble.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.970
OK, so one of these
guys goes up, down.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:14.150
One of these guys, another
hat goes up and down.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:20.700
And then between two I threw
in a bubble function, like so.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.760
Right?

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:28.110
So those were all in my list
of trial functions and test

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.240
functions.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.860
Two kinds, hats and bubbles.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.300
Now, that's all fine.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.750
And we can do these integrals.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:44.190
But one point I
sort of went past.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:51.260
So let's call this phi left,
phi bubble, and phi right.

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.090
OK.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:32:00.050
So my trial functions, my
approximate solution, U,

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:05.380
is going to be some
amount of that left hat,

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:14.130
some amount of the bubble,
some amount of the right hat.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:21.580
And more functions
on other intervals.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:26.200
Now, my point is
just a simple one.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:33.050
When we only had hats, then U
and the coefficient of this hat

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:36.600
was exactly the value
of U at that mesh point.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.530
Why was that?

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.410
Because all the other
hats were zero there.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:45.940
So when I only had hats,
these U's, U left and U right,

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:51.330
were exactly the values of my
approximation at the nodes.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:55.430
That's why it looked so much
like finite differences.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:01.220
What I want to ask you is, so
if I take the halfway point

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.660
as the sort of mesh
point for the bubble,

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.520
what is the value of
U of my approximation,

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.030
at that halfway point?

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.560
I just want to plug
in halfway point,

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.030
evaluate everything
at the halfway point.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.800
So I want to find U
at this halfway point.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.540
Right there.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.900
Do you see what's happening?

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.860
U bubble, what is U
bubble, or phi bubble

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.140
at the halfway point?

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.260
One.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.890
The bubble goes up to
one at the halfway point.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:39.740
So the coefficient that
multiplies it multiplies one.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.540
And you think, ah.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.940
You might think, all
right, that's the value

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.910
of my approximation
at the halfway point.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.660
But that's wrong, correct?

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.410
What is the value
of my approximation

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.370
at the halfway point, here?

00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:01.170
Well, this guy is not
zero at the halfway point.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.790
This one is not zero.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:08.030
This should have been R, sorry.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.900
These hats are not zero there.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.870
My basis is not
quite as beautiful.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:19.690
It's not quite as beautiful,
because my trial functions

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:23.670
are not one trial
function per mesh point,

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:30.380
including halfway
points, as before.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.290
No problem.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:35.480
I can do all the integrals,
I can get the values,

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.240
I can solve KU=F to
find the weights.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:44.520
And then I just have to remember
that my basis is not as perfect

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.840
as before, because
at that mesh point,

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.000
three functions
are contributing.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.960
Probably I'm making this
sound like a big deal.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.520
It isn't a big
deal, but you have

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.700
to remember that
that's the case,

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.680
that that coefficient
of the bubble

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.010
is not your solution
at that point.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.180
You have to remember that the
left hat and the right hat

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:14.740
are also contributing
at that point.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:21.930
Or I could rethink my
functions, and make them-- Now

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:23.060
that's the cool thing.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.710
So that's the idea.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:30.200
Just so you see that
I could do that.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.250
Here is my left point,
here's my halfway point,

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:36.370
and here's my right point.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:42.340
So I'm going to have the
same combinations, which

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:53.810
are the piecewise parabolas that
are continuous at the nodes.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.220
Let me show it to you.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.660
I could change from
hats and bubbles to,

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.370
I'll keep the bubble,
because that's

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:06.310
one at the halfway point.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:08.200
That's good.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.820
But I have to fix
those hat functions.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:19.000
If I want the hat
functions to be focused--

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.330
If I want the phi left function,
I call that a hat function,

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:29.020
but it's going to change shape,
it won't be a conical hat.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.480
If I want a phi
function, I want it

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.810
to be one at that point,
its own home point,

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.120
but what else do I want?

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.450
I want it to be zero there.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.230
I don't want it to
contribute there,

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.220
if I want this perfection.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.070
Or there.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:52.460
So you see my hat, instead
of coming down like that

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:59.190
and being 1/2 at that
point, what shall I do?

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:02.060
I replace that hat
by some combination

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:08.470
of the hat and the bubble to
make a parabola that does that.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:15.910
And of course, this other
way will be the same.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.490
So that's not a hat anymore.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:19.780
What name should I give it?

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.240
Anybody suggest a name?

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.611
It's sort of a hat.

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:27.110
Sombrero.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:30.820
Sombrero. [LAUGHTER]
OK, so I now

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.270
have sombrero functions, right?

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.990
OK.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.630
Good.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.653
And there'll be a sombrero
function, instead of the hat,

00:37:40.653 --> 00:37:43.360
it was replaced by a better hat.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.060
Now what about the one here?

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.680
Just tell me, how
do I draw that one?

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.890
What's that function?

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.970
I'll do it with dashed
lines, it's zero,

00:37:55.970 --> 00:38:02.640
it should be zero at its
nodes-- at the nodes that

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.150
are not its nodes.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:09.680
So you see each one is going
to come down and back up.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.290
Really, I'm just saying you
have the freedom to do this.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:16.410
By using combinations
of those functions,

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.780
I get exactly the
same as combinations

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.140
of these functions.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:26.700
The only difference is that with
these new sombrero functions--

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:32.140
So now I have a U left sombrero
times a phi left sombrero,

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.570
and a U bubble times its
own bubble, I didn't change.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:41.500
And a U right sombrero times
its phi right sombrero.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.720
And the only point is that,
at that halfway point,

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.580
what does this equal
at the halfway point?

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.151
It equals that.

00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:52.650
Right.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.760
I've just done a little
change of variables.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.940
I've changed the
function, so that

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:05.520
would change its coefficients,
but it's still the same space

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.480
of test functions.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.360
I didn't change that.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.390
My space of test
functions, these

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:15.350
are all still
piecewise parabolas.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:18.360
They always were piecewise
parabolas, but some of them

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.040
were straight parabolas.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:25.050
Now they're more
interesting parabolas.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:31.200
OK, that may be a point you
didn't think about, anyway.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:42.380
But it shows you that in
constructing finite elements,

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.760
it's really what
combinations you

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.730
get, more than what
individual hats or not,

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.810
or sombreros you might use.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.950
In other words, you could
use either of those.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.840
If you use the hat
functions, then you

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.600
could build on easy integrals.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.710
Those integrals would be a
little trickier, not seriously.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:13.530
And then the solution would be
like a finite difference thing.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.690
Every U would link
to a mesh point.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.330
OK.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.650
I'll leave that
and hope you guys

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.240
have some questions
about homework.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:23.740
Thanks.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.950
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:30.410
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh,
a question about this?

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.070
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:41.940
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah, when
I say better accuracy, when

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.900
I put the hats and
the bubbles together,

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.690
the improvement would
be noticed in between.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:49.190
Yeah.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:55.580
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.150
PROFESSOR STRANG:
These guys, you mean?

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.770
Well yeah.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.160
I didn't change a thing.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.630
The answer would
still be the same.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:08.140
My capital U that would come
out would be no different.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.730
It's just I've chosen
a different basis,

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.470
you could say, to represent it.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.910
But there wouldn't
be any difference,

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:19.450
and it would still be-- So
what would be the accuracy now?

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.160
This is like a good review.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.510
How close will U be
to the true solution?

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:30.100
Well, I've got up to
quadratic, second degree,

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.680
so I would expect h cubed error.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.400
Because that's the
term I'm missing.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.660
And that's the term that
the cubics would get.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.710
Right.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:41.670
Yes?

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:51.920
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
PROFESSOR STRANG:

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:58.120
The question is, why did
I pick-- So I had my hats.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.430
I guess essentially,
I wanted to throw

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.430
in some additional
functions, the bubbles, that

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:10.470
would up the accuracy without
serious increase in work.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.210
And the natural
construction was that one.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.710
Yeah.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:26.690
Then I got piecewise parabolas.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.120
You look for a construction
of finite elements

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:34.210
that kind of comes out
neatly, and this one did.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:35.370
There was another question.

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:40.682
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:42:40.682 --> 00:42:42.890
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh, these
parabolas would produce--

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:44.190
That's a good question.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:47.530
Yeah, these parabolas would
produce a delta function

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:49.420
right there.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.990
You see, they have
a jump in slope.

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:58.360
Even if they're parabolas,
they don't have smooth slope.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:04.290
So this could not be used
for a bending problem.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.020
Or let me say it a
little differently,

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.660
because people commit crimes.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.490
I call them variational crimes.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:14.497
People have tried.

00:43:14.497 --> 00:43:16.080
You know, it's a
heck of a lot of work

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:20.220
to construct smoother
trial functions.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.900
So people say, well, just
ignore that delta function.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.700
Put it in anyway, integrate
elsewhere, and just skip

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.920
the delta function.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.610
So that would be called
a nonconforming function.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.530
There's a very famous way to
create nonconforming function.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.810
And that's very hot
stuff, actually.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:48.680
Professor Peraire and others in
Aero are world experts on that.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.790
Those are called
discontinuous Galerkin.

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:54.350
Discontinuous Galerkin.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:55.300
This is fun.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.290
You see what this
world is about.

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.910
So what's
discontinuous Galerkin?

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:07.590
Those will be ones where
there's a jump in the function.

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.210
Here I don't need
much space to show

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.150
you discontinuous Galerkin.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:16.040
So there's a mesh point,
there's a mesh point.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:21.560
Discontinuous Galerkin
might do this.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.060
Oh no, not there.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.140
That's continuous, sorry.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:35.120
Discontinuous Galerkin would use
half hats inside the interval.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.330
It would use that one.

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.100
And then another
one it would use

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.530
would be one that
jumped this way.

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:53.130
In other words, it sticks
within an interval,

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:58.910
it uses two functions
instead of one.

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:05.370
There are two unknowns.

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.460
Do you see what's happening now?

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:14.610
My space of trial functions
is going to have jumps.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:18.650
Up to now, all my good hat--
my ordinary hat functions

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:19.950
were all continuous.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.820
They were all C zero.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:26.290
Now I'm dropping
back to C minus 1.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.720
Somehow my functions have jumps.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.600
So this is called DG,
discontinuous Galerkin.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:39.340
And how could it be justified?

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.030
I mean, right?

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:43.500
These are functions--
Now I've got

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:47.710
a function that's not allowed
in my second order problem.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:48.550
Right?

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.000
If I looked at my
list here, what was OK

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.710
and what was not OK, if I
look at interior half hats,

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.720
if I look at functions
that have a jump,

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:04.440
jump functions, shall
I say, jump functions.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.740
Those would be C^(-1),
jump functions.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:15.800
And phi' is not OK.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:21.770
So I won't tell you, and I
wouldn't be able to do it well,

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:24.170
how do they rescue that?

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:28.220
However Professor Peraire
and others, others,

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:32.220
Professor Darmofal, a
whole group in Aero,

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.900
computing with functions
that have jumps.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.050
And the way they
manage to do it is,

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.180
they have to add some
penalty term that

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.300
penalizes the jumps,
that controls the jumps.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.650
If they just took
the standard set up,

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.540
as we have, and tried
their functions,

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.490
it would fail completely.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:47:00.570
So they adjust the
energy to penalize jumps.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:04.450
Anyway, somebody
might sometime end up

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:09.160
working on some
project with them,

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:14.160
and DG would be very possible.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.000
So you didn't ask me about
any homework problems yet.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.180
Last chance.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.260
Anything to ask about?

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.660
You got a lecture about
crazy stuff today.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:31.340
Sorry about that, in a way,
but I hope it was all right.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:41.180
So homework is now posted,
with a MATLAB question using

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.570
the elements that we've talked
about and some questions

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.100
from the text.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.850
And don't forget, then,
my original comment

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:54.830
that if we end up with some
good codes for CSE that

00:47:54.830 --> 00:48:00.531
could be used by other people,
I'm very grateful to get them.

00:48:00.531 --> 00:48:01.030
OK.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:05.450
Let's end today a little
early, and I'll see you Friday

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:06.587
for splines.

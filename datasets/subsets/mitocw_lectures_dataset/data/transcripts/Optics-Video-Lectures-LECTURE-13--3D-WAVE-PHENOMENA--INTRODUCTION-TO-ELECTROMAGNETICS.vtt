00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:23.770
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So I'd
like to continue with what

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.840
we were discussing last time.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.870
We were at the point where
we're discussing the three

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.020
dimensional wave equation.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.640
Before we start,
let me take care

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.680
of a couple of
administrative things.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.050
So for one, I'm very close to
finishing grading the quizzes.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.000
So as soon as I do,
I'll put them on a DHL

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.660
and ship them back to Boston.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.493
Of course, those of you
who are in Singapore

00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:53.520
will get them from--

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.760
locally.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.770
And so that's done.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.720
The quiz solution, of
course, has been posted.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.550
You must have seen it by now.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.332
So I would encourage you
to go over this solution.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.540
It was a pretty good problems,
actually, both of them

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.360
were pretty good.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.410
And the other
thing I want to say

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.150
is that I have posted
the new homework.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.720
So has anybody looked at it yet?

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.870
OK, if you look at
it, it might appear

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.210
to be a little bit
intimidating, especially

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.680
the graduate version.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.150
It is about six or seven pages.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.000
But you may know from experience
that if your homework is

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.330
very wordy, it means
that most of the work

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.810
has been done for you.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.450
So basically, what
I've done is I've--

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.580
the reason I-- this is the first
time I give this assignment.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.880
And basically I
develop the analogy

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.130
between the optical Hamiltonian
and the mechanical Hamiltonian.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.380
And I guide you through a
few derivations, a few proofs

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.358
that basically, I think, in my
opinion, elucidate the analogy

00:02:11.358 --> 00:02:12.150
and the difference.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.270
Of course, they're
not exactly the same.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.680
OK, and the reason I did
it is because last year was

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.080
the first time that they
taught the Hamiltonian.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.840
It used to be--

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.590
I used to just skip that
part and do other things.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.570
But last year I did it.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.028
And I got some
pretty good feedback

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:32.890
from the students who thought
that, well, you know, this

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.660
is kind of a cool analogy.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.530
So this year I
expanded it a bit.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.670
So that's why this homework
is a little bit rich.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.630
But it's not to bad, really,
once you get into it.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.350
And if you follow the
instructions carefully,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.080
each equation should taken
no more than two lines.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.780
So it is not like a long
derivation or [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.230
or anything like that.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.623
It's just a step by
step, and if you--

00:02:56.623 --> 00:02:57.540
but read it carefully.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.678
Because there's some
derivatives involved.

00:03:00.678 --> 00:03:03.220
So you will want to make sure
you take the correct derivative

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.850
each time.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.320
That's the only challenge.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.580
If you can manage to
do it, which you will,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.270
if you follow the
instructions carefully,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.710
then it should be painless.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.002
And there's a little bit of
MATLAB that you have to do.

00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:15.400
But that's not valuable.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.640
And the code, actually the
MATLAB that you have to do,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.580
I also give you the code.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.070
It's posted to the website.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.590
It's a bunch of functions.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.470
And one of the things that
I do in the assignment

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.365
is I walk you through how
to use the MATLAB code.

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:32.990
So what you will have
to do, basically,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.870
is take one of the
functions and modify it.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.023
Yeah, someone, turn on the mic.

00:03:38.023 --> 00:03:38.690
Have a question?

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.750
Or-- OK.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.765
So going back to the--

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:49.890
I think there's a question.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.605
Somebody has turned on your
mic, which is OK, actually,

00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:56.980
as long as you
don't say anything

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.080
embarrassing to [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.730
So let me go back.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.180
Let's go back now
to the main topic.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.318
So, of course, we have
moved on from Hamiltonians

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:13.110
and all that stuff.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.040
We're doing wave optics now.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.019
And the last time we
discussed the wave equation.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.850
And without really a proof--

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.910
we did the proof of the
one dimensional case.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.580
But then without the
proof, I just added.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.350
Basically, the one
dimensional case

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.120
was this one, just the
derivative of the Z term

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.910
without any additional terms.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.120
And then you can think
of it simply by symmetry.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.010
If you accept that 3D
space is symmetric,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.770
then the way you go
from one dimension

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.270
into the three
dimensions is by just

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.720
adding two derivatives
similar to the one

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.380
that you already had.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.340
And, of course, the waves
that we'll get in 3D

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.800
are much richer than the waves
that we expected to get in 1D.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.120
And here I plotted two cases.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.610
One is a plane wave, which
I will play the movie.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.070
So you will see the
fringes, in this case,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.330
of the plane wave are moving in
some arbitrary direction now.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.250
It can go anywhere in 3D.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.740
Of course, I can
only show a slice

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.050
on the plane of your projector.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.650
And there's a spherical wave
where the wavefronts are not

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.940
circles as you see here.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.470
But they're actually spheres.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.690
So they're spheres
that are propagating

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.940
clearly outwards in this case.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.450
So this is what we used to call
it a diverging spherical wave

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.130
in geometrical optics.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.860
Well, you can also
have the opposite.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.590
You can have a
converging spherical wave

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.400
if the wavefronts
are moving inwards.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.180
So one of these are valid
solutions to the wave equation.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.470
And the plane wave
is very simple.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.870
I will do it next.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.300
The spherical wave is
not really difficult,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.350
but it involves a transformation
of the coordinates

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.322
from cartesian that
we have here to polar.

00:06:01.322 --> 00:06:02.530
And this is done in the book.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.560
I'm not going to
do it in the class.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.000
It is a little bit of work.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.270
And you don't get any
particular intuition.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.090
If you take a class
in electromagnetics

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.250
or electrostatics, they
will probably do it.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.630
But because in
this class, we will

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.360
use the spherical wave in its
full form very radically--

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.020
we'll use an
approximation to it.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.240
That's why I don't bother
to do the full derivation.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.210
OK, I'm going to skip
now a couple of slides.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:42.490
And I'm going to go directly
to this one, slide number 16,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.780
which is the plane wave.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.820
So what I would like to do--

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.540
so, for the rest of the class
now, pretty much for the next,

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.770
what is it, seven or eight
weeks that we have left?

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.460
We will be talking
almost exclusively

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.720
about plane waves and
their superpositions.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.870
Because what we will discover
is that we can describe

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.120
every optical wave and--

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.440
well, at least within
the approximations

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.250
that are valid in this class--

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.170
you can describe
every optical wave

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.290
as a superposition
of plane waves.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.010
It's a very powerful property.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.720
Because plane waves, as we
will see, they're very simple.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.210
And they obey some relatively
straightforward properties.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.720
So if we learn how to
describe those properly,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.620
then we can describe a great
variety of other phenomena,

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.820
including diffraction,
interference, refraction,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.840
and a number of other things.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.590
So I would like to make sure
that we understand plane waves.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.750
It is a crucial
part of the class.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.310
OK, so in the last lecture,
we wrote a simple wave

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.650
that we'll call
the harmonic wave.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.330
And it used to look like this.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:01.010
From now on, I will start
using a phasor notation almost

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.320
without warning.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.520
So when I start throwing
complex exponentials,

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.490
you know that I'm
using the phasor.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.030
OK, so having said
that, now let's

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.480
look at the phasor of
what I wrote last time.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.640
So last time I wrote something
that looked like e to the ikz

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.350
e to the minus i omega t.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.420
And I call this a harmonic wave.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.640
So this was in 1D.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:40.179
So the plane wave is basically
the generalization of this one.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:49.010
Now, I'm going to have to write
terms of the form y and x.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.300
Do you remember what
we call the quantity k

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.720
in the case what I still had
the one dimensional wave?

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.133
What was the name of k?

00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:02.050
AUDIENCE: It was the--

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.910
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Wave number, sorry, yeah,

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.990
wave number, yeah.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.230
I'm sorry, someone answered
in Singapore, so I--

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.985
OK, but he was diligent.

00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:12.360
So make sure to
push your button.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.980
OK, so k is the wave number.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.670
And it is fair to use it
if you have one dimension.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.330
But if you have
three dimensions,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.340
then we actually need,
at least apparently,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.790
we need three such quantities.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.010
So I need to put the
z subscript here.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.980
And then I need two more,
one for the y and one for x.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.965
So now the triad
of these three--

00:09:45.965 --> 00:09:47.590
I don't want to call
them wave numbers.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.120
They're not really wave numbers.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.450
But these three
quantities that have the--

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.500
I mean, these are essentially
spatial periods, aren't they,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.430
in the three dimensions?

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.070
So these quantities, if you take
the triad of these quantities,

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.050
it is called the wave vector.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.640
And it is usually--

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.270
we use the same symbol
as the wave number,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.490
but with the vector now.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:19.270
And it consists of the
three components, ky, kz.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.300
It is a matter of taste
how you write vectors.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.870
In this class, I actually--

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.180
I will alternate a little bit.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.060
Sometimes I will write
vectors like this

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.100
as a triad in a parenthesis.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.110
Sometimes I might
write the vectors

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:37.870
like this where I
use the unit vector,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.670
the unit Cartesian vectors.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.450
Of course-- OK, I hope
that's not confusing.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:49.590
One can easily-- clearly
they're both commonly used.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.590
So that quantity k,
then, is the wave vector.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.305
And its significance, you
can see it on the slide.

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:02.680
It's probably better if I
don't attempt to draw it there.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.380
But you can see it on the slide.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.580
So the wavefront
of the plane wave

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:16.380
is a surface which is
perpendicular to the wave

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.730
vector.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.100
And what is a wavefront?

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:28.630
Well, wavefront, you
saw it in the movie

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.440
that I played earlier.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:36.350
Wavefront is the surface upon
which the phase of the wave

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.100
is constant.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.460
So what is this?

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.450
This is basically a three
dimensional sinusoid of which

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.490
we only see a 2D slice.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.350
So this is sinusoid
which alternates.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.310
The black regions are
negative, minimum.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.560
I mean they're sort of a
maximum negative value.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.030
The bright stripes are
maximum positive value.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:08.410
And the wavefront is a surface
on which the phase of the wave

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.290
has the same value.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.740
For example, if
the phase is zero,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.740
then we're talking
about the positive peak.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.720
If their phase is pi,
then we're talking

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.700
about the negative
trough, and so

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.740
on, and so forth, or anywhere
in between, for that matter.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.820
And the wavefront has a
sense of travel to it.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.100
Because if I play
the movie again,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.870
then you can see that these
surfaces of constant phase

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:31.810
are moving.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.700
This is the sense that the wave
transports energy, if you wish.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.320
Because the wavefronts are
moving with the wave speed.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.170
OK, so then we call
it the plane wave,

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.388
because this surface is of
constant phase or planes.

00:12:47.388 --> 00:12:49.180
Of course, you only
see them as lines here.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.010
Because, again, we're looking
at the slice of the wave.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.560
But in 3D, they
would be actually

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.880
planes that would be propagating
with the speed of the wave.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.000
So that is-- so then
the wave vector,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.770
we need it in order
to tell us what

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.270
is the orientation
of these planes.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.810
And for reasons
of convenience, we

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.400
define it to be perpendicular
to those planes.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.660
Now, that's one
useful thing to know.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.340
But that's not all.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:29.940
The wave vector, it appears to
be composed of three elements.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.813
So the question is are these--

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.230
do I really have
three parameters?

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.480
Can I describe a plane
wave with three parameters?

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:46.890
Well, even before I do any math,
you could probably guess that I

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.300
shouldn't.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.730
Because these are surfaces.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.980
These are planar
surfaces in 3D space.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.580
So I cannot really fit 3
dimensions of planes in a 3D

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.087
space, right?

00:14:01.087 --> 00:14:02.670
Something is wrong
with that argument,

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.590
even without doing any math.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.740
So in actuality, these three
numbers, kx, ky, and kz,

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.680
they have to be related somehow.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.780
I cannot arbitrarily
define all three of them.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.130
But I have to
somehow relate them.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.800
So the way I relate
them is I actually

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.140
go back to my wave equation.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.540
And recall this
thing here, the wave,

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.940
which I will call it something.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.020
What did I call it?

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.560
I didn't call it
anything, actually.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.790
I just put an amplitude
coefficient in front.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:40.210
So the amplitude coefficient,
it is good for completeness,

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.440
I guess.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.637
And it must satisfy
the wave equation.

00:14:43.637 --> 00:14:44.470
So it must satisfy--

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.000
I'll call it something
now, because--

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.830
f, I guess.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:57.210
So it is f of x, y, z, t.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.480
And it must satisfy
this nasty thing, which

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:09.840
looks like df dx squared plus
df dy squared plus df dz squared

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:18.210
minus 1 over the velocity now,
d squared f over dt squared.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.680
It must equal to 0.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.650
This is what we call
the wave equation.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.640
And for future
reference, sometimes,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.900
instead of writing all
these deduced derivatives,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.290
there's a shorthand
which collapses

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.575
all of this with a symbol del.

00:15:33.575 --> 00:15:34.950
So you can just
write del squared

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.420
f minus 1 over c squared
df dt squared is 0.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.790
OK, that's the wave equation.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.560
Very good, so now
what I need to do

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.210
is I need to plug this
expression into the wave

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.038
equation.

00:15:51.038 --> 00:15:51.830
So what expression?

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.050
This expression that
I had for the wave,

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.490
I need to put it
into the equation.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:01.430
OK, almost by inspection, we
can see what's going to happen.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.050
So we have an
exponential, right?

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.670
And if I take one derivative,
the first derivative,

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.680
it will knock out--

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.840
it will multiply by ikx, right,
if I take the x derivative.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.000
If I take the
second x derivative,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.120
it will bring out another ikx.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.660
And since i squared
equals minus 1,

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.140
it means that the derivative
will look like this, d--

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.260
let me write it separately here.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.970
The second derivative,
for example,

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.460
of F with respect
to x squared, it

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:40.180
will equal minus kx squared
times f itself, right?

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.850
And then it can do the
same for y, and z, and t.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.870
Except in the case of time, I
will pull out omega squared.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:52.400
So if I substitute all of that
now and I put it in, I will get

00:16:52.400 --> 00:17:00.230
that minus kx squared minus
ky squared minus kz squared--

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.470
these are the first
batch of derivatives--

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.790
and then minus omega squared--

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.560
but I have to divide by c also
because c, actually, c squared

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.910
is in the wave equation.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.140
So all of this, according to the
wave equation, must equal to 0.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.200
And, of course, it is
possible to satisfy this

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.579
by setting f equal to 0.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.180
But that's not very interesting.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:27.560
So basically what this means,
that this quantity here, it

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.780
must equal to 0.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:36.370
So then, as advertised, the
three parameters, kx, ky, kz,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.630
they're not independent.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.770
But I can specify two of them.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:48.520
The third one is completely
determined by the two

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.950
among the three plus the
frequency of the wave.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.840
So if I give you
omega, kx, and ky,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.920
then this equation will force
kz to have a certain value.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.130
And you can see from
this equation, which

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.896
is written bottom of the
whiteboard and on the slide--

00:18:07.896 --> 00:18:09.722
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:11.680
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Oh,
oh, oh, oh, thank you,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.950
thank you, yes,
because I have a--

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:13.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.780
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yes, thank you.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.180
Because I have a
minus sign here.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.310
So the extra minus will
become a plus here.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.220
Yes, OK, now it is correct.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:31.467
And so if you look at
this equation now, what

00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:32.175
does it describe?

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.620
If you think of kx, ky, kz,
if you think of them now

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.320
as a new three
dimensional space,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.890
what is the surface
that the three of them

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.448
are constrained to lie upon?

00:18:48.448 --> 00:18:50.300
Button.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.550
AUDIENCE: A spherical shell?

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.592
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: It's
a sphere, that's right,

00:18:53.592 --> 00:18:55.870
a shell, the shell
of a sphere, yeah.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.720
And this sphere is not new
to us who have seen it.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.660
It actually popped up
in a different context.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.090
We called it the
Descartes sphere.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:10.600
It is actually the
same sphere that--

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.000
actually not even
Descartes, an Arab scientist

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.220
in the 11th century,
guessed from Snell's law.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.640
So it is a little bit, I
guess, magical, or soothing,

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.940
or rewarding, whatever
combination of those

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:34.420
adjectives you like, that we
found a nice analogy-- or not

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.250
analogy, actually,
we found an agreement

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.400
with geometrical optics.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.350
In geometrical optics, we said
that the radius of this sphere

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.870
equals 2 pi upon lambda.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.510
This is now what,
in our new language,

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.530
we call it the wave number,
times the index of refraction,

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.340
n.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.770
Now this is something that
I haven't told you yet.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.420
But I will tell you later today.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.940
In this equation, I
haven't said anything

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.860
about index of refraction.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.890
However, we know, again
from geometrical optics,

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.620
that c, the speed
of light, depends

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.130
on the index of refraction.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.150
So another way to derive
this equation is to say--

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:21.498
to put the free space
speed of light over here.

00:20:21.498 --> 00:20:23.540
And then in order for the
equation to be correct,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.210
I would have to
multiply by n squared,

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.747
the index of refraction.

00:20:27.747 --> 00:20:29.330
So you can see from
this that, indeed,

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.757
the radius of the sphere.

00:20:30.757 --> 00:20:33.090
Oh, and of course, to compute
the radius of this sphere,

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:38.630
I have to use, once again,
these dispersion relations.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.410
So the radius of
this sphere, if you

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:45.420
look from this equation over
here, the radius of this sphere

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:52.470
is k, the magnitude
of the wave vector.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:21:00.420
It must equal n omega
over c free space.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.680
OK, and now it is a
matter of preference

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.060
how you want to do it.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.950
For example, you can
write omega as 2 pi times

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.050
nu, where nu is
of the frequency.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.810
Remember, omega is the
angular frequency--

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.590
over cfs.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.540
Then you can use the
dispersion relation,

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:25.030
which says that c free
space equals lambda nu.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.600
So nu will cancel.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:32.850
And you end up with n times
2 pi over lambda free space.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.737
And, of course, nu--

00:21:38.737 --> 00:21:40.320
I don't say anything
about free space,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.120
because nu is the
same everywhere,

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.400
whether it is free
space, or a slave--

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.020
I mean, not free space.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.320
I'm sorry.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.530
OK, so that's where this
equation comes from.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.105
That's why the radius
of the k sphere,

00:21:52.105 --> 00:21:56.340
it equals n omega
over the free--

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.840
over the speed of light
in a vacuum or 2 pi

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.350
n over lambda, the
wavelength in free space.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.120
Now, those of you--

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.730
some of you may have
taken solid state.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.090
This k sphere also
comes up there.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.940
And it is called
the Ewald sphere.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.560
In our language in optics, we
seldom call it Ewald sphere.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.730
We call it k sphere
or Descartes sphere.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:30.500
But all of these three terms,
all of these three names,

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.340
they actually denote
the same thing.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.920
And, of course, in the
case of solid state,

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:44.270
this sphere does not
apply to light usually.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.260
But it applies to what?

00:22:49.472 --> 00:22:52.117
Button?

00:22:52.117 --> 00:22:52.950
AUDIENCE: Electrons.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.033
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: To
electrons, that's correct.

00:22:55.033 --> 00:22:58.200
So according to
quantum mechanics,

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.650
electrons are also waves.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.230
And they satisfy-- actually that
don't satisfy this equation.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.400
They satisfy the
Schroedinger equation,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.690
which is in one of the
problems of the homework.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.640
So anyway, so
Schroedinger equation

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.810
similarly leads to a
sphere like this one.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.300
Is there one thing that--

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.790
OK, so this is a sort of
preliminary introduction

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.350
to plane waves.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:34.620
One thing that I would like
to very strongly emphasize

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.740
is this expression over here,
the complex exponential--

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.690
I will rewrite it once again.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:55.410
e to the i kx x plus ky y
plus kz z minus omega t,

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.510
OK, this expression,
when we see that,

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.860
when we see an exponential
with linear terms

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.070
in the Cartesian coordinates,
that's a plane wave.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.300
And now you know why, right?

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.730
Because it corresponds
to this moving wavefront.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.890
And, of course,
most of the time,

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.620
we will not add it like this.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.640
We will omit this term
because of the phasor business

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.070
that we discussed last time.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.140
So we will actually
see it like this.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.370
And also, very often, when--

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.500
several things that
happen in here.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:34.310
For one thing, these three
numbers, as I said before,

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.640
they're not free.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.250
So they are given by kx
squared plus ky squared plus kz

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:45.560
squared equals omega
over c squared or--

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:04.660
OK.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:10.330
This is another way
of solving the sphere.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.490
So we will see these
kinds of expressions.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.120
For example, I might
write something like e

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:24.110
to the i kx x plus ky y plus.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.175
And there's a z here
outside of the square root.

00:25:39.175 --> 00:25:40.550
So this looks a
little bit scary.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.230
But it doesn't need to be scary.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.210
It a plane wave.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.550
And we will see expressions like
this one later in the class.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.610
But I want to sort
of prepare you now

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.330
so that they are associated
with a physical meaning

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.540
in your minds.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.330
It is not just an expression.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.360
It's actually
denotes a plane wave.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.100
The two linear terms here--
actually, all three are

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.420
linear. x, y, and z
appear as first powers.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.870
And the reason this
square root appears here

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:12.460
is because of the Descartes
sphere, or the Ewald sphere,

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.050
or whichever.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:20.838
OK, any questions
about plane waves?

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:39.280
The other wave that we'll
be dealing with quite a bit

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.890
is the spherical wave.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:51.420
And so clearly, as the name
suggests, in this case,

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.800
you have spherical wavefronts,
which are either going away

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:01.830
from a source, a diverging wave,
or inwards, a converging wave.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.670
Just as an aside,
by the way, I should

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:12.910
emphasize that the spherical
wave is not a physical thing.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:17.060
So plane wave is not
physical either, by the way.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.880
Why is the plane
wave not physical?

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.880
I mean, what's an obvious
reason why a plane wave must be

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.210
an approximation of something?

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.710
Button.

00:27:28.402 --> 00:27:30.360
AUDIENCE: Energy of the
plane wave is infinite.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:30.660
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.010
It has infinite energy.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.060
It is infinitely large.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.400
So, clearly, I cannot
create plane waves per se.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.510
I can only create sort of finite
approximations to plane waves.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.240
A spherical wave is--

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.300
but nevertheless, it is
an interesting thing.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.760
And the reason we spend
all this time defining it

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.720
is because it provides a lot
of mathematical convenience

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.660
in dealing with more
realistic waves, waves

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.070
that can be realized.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.130
I can express them in terms
of this fictitious entity,

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.147
the plane wave.

00:28:05.147 --> 00:28:06.730
The same is true for
the point source,

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.150
but for a slightly
different reason.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.690
It is actually impossible to
create an ideal spherical wave.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.870
The best thing you can do is
you can create a wave that

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.330
would sort of, if you--

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:26.710
well, the only-- the best
thing that you can do

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:29.240
is you can create a
dipole source here.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.330
So if you aim the
dipole the same,

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.760
the vertical direction,
then what you can do

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.000
is you can create a
radiation pattern that

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.590
has approximately 60, or
actually, 120 degrees opening,

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.570
126, to be--

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.090
63, isn't it?

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.850
I think it's 63
degrees, the dipole.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.520
Anyway, so you can create a
direction pattern like this,

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.680
but never quite
a spherical wave.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.080
In fact, someone as
famous as Einstein

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.220
said that spherical
waves don't exist.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.170
Nevertheless, it is
a very convenient

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.430
mathematical quantity.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:06.800
And that's why
we're describing it.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.110
But again, by the way, this
is true in any kind of physics

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.970
that you might learn.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.918
For example, in
mechanics, very often

00:29:14.918 --> 00:29:16.085
you deal with frictionless--

00:29:16.085 --> 00:29:16.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.160
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Is [INAUDIBLE]??

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:17.770
Yeah.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:23.330
AUDIENCE: Suppose you burst a
small cracker in a water tank?

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.720
Then it wouldn't--
wouldn't it be?

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.910
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Oh, I'm
sorry, I meant only in optics.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:27.200
AUDIENCE: Optics.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.510
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yeah, in water tank,

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.360
possibly you can create
a spherical wave.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.818
Even so, it's not
a spherical wave.

00:29:31.818 --> 00:29:33.010
Because it is finite, right?

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.240
It has a finite source.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.240
Anyway, the reason in optics
you can fundamentally not

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.950
create this kind of thing is
because of charge conservation.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.370
You cannot-- in order to create
a spherical wave like this,

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.300
you would have to create
an oscillating charge here.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.470
And no such thing exists.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.160
So the only thing you can do
is you can create a dipole.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.070
That is two charges which are
alternating, up and down, up

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.900
and down, positive and negative.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:02.510
That would result in a wave
that it looks approximately

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.820
like a spherical wave, but only
in the direction perpendicular

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.130
to the dipole.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.090
In the direction along
the dipole axis, it

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.490
actually, the wave vanishes.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:13.820
So it is very different
than a spherical wave.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:22.360
To justify it a little bit why,
even though it is non-physical,

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.550
why we spend so much
time discussing it,

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:30.060
it has to do, actually,
with systems theory.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.780
Yes, question?

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.180
AUDIENCE: Isn't a dipole
actually canceling out

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:40.110
because of the distance between
the top and bottom source?

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.300
You have like a different
distance between them.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.430
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: The
charge, the charge is 0.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:45.097
The charge is 0.

00:30:45.097 --> 00:30:46.555
But you still have
a dipole moment.

00:30:46.555 --> 00:30:48.840
Then moreover, if the dipole
is oscillating, that is,

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.700
if it is going from
positive to negative,

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.700
positive to negative
very, very fast, then you

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.870
have charges accelerating.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.440
So therefore you generate
electromagnetic radiation,

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.790
as we will see in a little bit.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.920
AUDIENCE: No, no, I
mean the intensity

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.580
of the field from the
dipole isn't necessarily

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.240
vanishing along the axis if the
spacing's set the right way.

00:31:12.945 --> 00:31:15.070
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Not
everywhere along the axis,

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.112
but you will definitely
get nulls along the axis.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.755
If I remember correctly,
yeah, the dipole

00:31:24.755 --> 00:31:26.630
has a radiation pattern
that looks like this.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.370
It looks like a butterfly.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but it's
dependent on the distance

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.500
between the plus and
the minus charges.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.000
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
No, I'm talking

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.340
about an infinitesimally
small dipole now.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.132
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:31:39.132 --> 00:31:40.507
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yeah, if you

00:31:40.507 --> 00:31:42.255
have like a lambda
over four and 10

00:31:42.255 --> 00:31:43.660
or something like
that, then yes,

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.170
the radiation pattern
looks different.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.500
But in the simplest possible
case that you can approximate

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.730
the best spherical wave is an
infinitesimally small dipole

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.950
whose radiation pattern
looks like a butterfly.

00:32:02.727 --> 00:32:05.060
So we actually went a little
bit ahead of ourselves now.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.840
Because this entire
discussion, it

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.350
involved electromagnetics,
which we haven't done yet.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.360
But by the end of
this lecture, it

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.860
will be a little
bit more clear what

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.970
I mean by dipoles and
all of these things.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:20.870
The thing I meant to say
is that the spherical wave,

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:25.300
mathematically, it
corresponds to a point source.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:30.230
And that is something that
most of you, probably,

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:34.430
at some point or another,
took a class on linear systems

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:40.725
where typically you learn a
term called an impulse response.

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:42.350
So the impulse pulse
in the time domain

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.850
is a very narrow excitation.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.700
In fact, it is
infinitesimally narrow.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.360
And it is so narrow
that, because it

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.570
has to carry finite energy, it
also has infinite amplitude.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.680
That's what it's
called an impulse.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.290
So the spherical wave is
the equivalent of that,

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.840
but in space now.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.920
The spherical wave originates
as an infinitesimally small

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:09.200
disturbance, if you wish, which
then mathematically creates

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:15.552
this uniformly or isotropically
expanding spherical wavefront.

00:33:15.552 --> 00:33:17.510
And from that point of
view, it is very useful.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.210
Because even the dipole
that I said before,

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.700
it can be described,
actually, as a superposition

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.730
of a spherical wave.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:34.320
So I can be physically correct
if I do my physics correct.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.000
I can get the proper answer.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.990
So the spherical wave provides
this mathematical convenience.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.530
Also, to be honest, the
math that we will do here,

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.310
it is a very good
approximation to what

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.750
you observe in the laboratory.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.750
That's another good
justification for using it.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.760
Because even though
we know that there

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.790
is no such thing
as a point source,

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.670
many of the things that we
will derive in the next two

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:01.030
lectures based in this sort
of crude approximation,

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.900
they tend now to be very
good approximations for what

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.400
you see in the laboratory.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.280
For example, if
you take a pinhole,

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.900
a pinhole is a
finite thing, right?

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.480
I mean, the smallest
pinhole that people

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.139
use in the laboratory, it may
have a diameter of one micron.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.449
Sometimes we use bigger,
three, five micron,

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:19.429
something like that.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.179
Well, if you pass light
through a pinhole,

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.610
the light that comes out is,
to a very good approximation,

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.070
described by a spherical wave,
but of course not everywhere,

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:27.570
right?

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:30.250
The light coming
out of a pinhole,

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:31.570
it doesn't come out backwards.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.250
It only goes forward, right?

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:37.409
So therefore, you have-- you
know, clearly, the expression

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.600
is approximately
correct, but only

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:44.300
for the part of the wave,
the portion that is physical.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.070
So we have to be a little
bit mindful of what

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.310
is the meaning of everything
that we write down,

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:55.014
especially when things
like that are involved.

00:34:55.014 --> 00:34:56.639
The spherical wave
has another problem.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:35:01.150
It has the problem that
it blows up at the center.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.140
And the reason it
blows up is because--

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.350
well, like the impulse
in the time domain

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:12.980
that you learned in
linear dynamical systems,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.720
it has to have a finite energy.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.000
So in this context
here, the finite energy,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.930
as you proved in the
homework some time ago,

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:25.260
it means that the amplitude
of this spherical wave

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.100
must decrease like
one over the distance.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.050
So this 1 over r that we get
in the denominator, of course,

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.950
at r equals 0, it
explodes, right?

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:39.020
So, again, that is the delta
function, the impulse analogy.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.650
So the spherical wave has a
few mathematical inconveniences

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:44.810
of this sort that we
have to be mindful with.

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:53.900
Now, there's one more
mysterious thing about it,

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.270
which I will just point out.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:59.372
And I will then move
on without saying why.

00:35:59.372 --> 00:36:01.580
If you look at the expression
of the spherical wave--

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.455
let me write it down.

00:36:02.455 --> 00:36:16.770
It looks like cosine kr
minus omega t over r.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:21.040
And let's take stock here.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.570
So the 1 over r we discussed.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.330
The 1 over r is
energy conservation.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.280
We always like that.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:30.030
The cosine that you
see in the numerator,

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:39.514
if I go back and play the
movie of the spherical wave,

00:36:39.514 --> 00:36:42.910
we have to wait for the
plane wave to finish here.

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:45.900
So the kr minus omega
t, it is this sort

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.770
of explosion of the wavefronts
that you see in the movie.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:57.110
So kr, if i is the radius, kr
describes this sphere again.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:00.520
So the cosine kr
basically tells you

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.880
that you have these alternating
positive and negative

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.100
valued spheres.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.500
And the minus omega t
is the traveling aspect.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.140
It tells you that
these spheres explode.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.960
They propagate outwards
as a function of time.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.800
So this is the meaning
of the kr minus omega t.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.980
Then it bothers to put
another term over there,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.350
minus pi over 2.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.450
And this might sound
a little bit weird.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:30.460
I mean, in general, you can put
any phase that you like there.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:36.760
It means that you have
a shifted time axis.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.200
So I could put 5 there.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.790
Why did they bother
to put pi over 2?

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.460
What is the pi
over 2 relative to?

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:47.240
OK, it turns out if you properly
solve Maxwell's equations,

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.000
which we haven't
seen yet, but I'm

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.760
sure you are aware that
there is such a thing called

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.610
Maxwell's equation
that describes

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:55.680
electromagnetic waves.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.210
OK, so if you solve it properly
with this kind of point source,

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:05.360
because of something having
to do with magnetic fields,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.990
you pick up a phase delay
with respect to what?

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:10.730
You pick up a phase delay
with respect to the source.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.070
So this is now really weird.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.980
It tells you if you have a
source that is oscillating,

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.450
let's say, like a cosine, so
it is maximum at t equals 0,

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:22.240
the wave that comes out
will actually be a sine.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.910
So it will be phase
shifted by pi over 2.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:29.670
There's no easy way to explain
this either than solving

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.910
Maxwell's equation.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:35.120
There is actually some papers in
the literature-- this is very,

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.230
very interesting for an--

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.520
I don't know.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.277
it's strange, right?

00:38:40.277 --> 00:38:41.860
It can be explained
from the equation,

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.460
but it's still a
little bit strange.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.380
So people are actually
working on this phase shift.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.390
There's some very
strange aspects to it.

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:52.450
Anyway, for us, the phase
shift, we'll just accept it.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:53.860
It is well established.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.850
So we'll just accept
it and move on.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.690
When we write it
as a phasor, I mean

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:03.700
in the complex
presentation, of course,

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.180
e to the minus i pi
over 2 is minus i.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.760
So I skipped a few
steps of the slide.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.690
So let me do them
on the whiteboard.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:15.320
So to go from this in
the complex presentation,

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:21.350
you would write e to the i, kr
minus omega t minus pi over 2.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.930
And, of course, you still
have this thing outside.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:28.300
Nothing can-- this
is not affected.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.890
OK, then remember
that e to the minus

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.820
i pi over 2 equals minus i.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.590
And it equals 1 over i.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:41.380
So this is why the i appeared
in the denominator over here.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.010
So because pi over
2 is kind of a pain

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.520
to write down, when we
write the spherical way,

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.130
we'll just write it with
the i in the denominator.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.600
And this i is actually not--

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.700
I mean, it's not a
big deal, you know.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:40:00.910
If you-- in fact, myself,
sometimes I will just skip it.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.640
But it's kind of nice
to know that it's there.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.830
And, of course, in
the-- the other thing

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.590
that we'll do
commonly, but by now

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.260
a thing where we're
comfortable with that

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:19.110
is that we neglect the
temporal variation.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.360
And then we'll get the phasor.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.880
The last thing that we'll do
before moving on to a slightly

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.150
different topic is--

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.010
remember in
geometrical optics, we

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:34.650
derived a lot of
useful things using

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.750
this paraxial approximation.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.700
So the paraxial approximation
basically says that--

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:48.330
in this case, the wave
originated relatively far away.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.370
And you have these
spherical wavefronts

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:53.850
which are nice spheres
near the source.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:59.270
But if you go at a relatively
long distance, basically,

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.730
you cannot tell the difference
between these spherical

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.490
wavefronts and parabolas.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:06.830
And it turns out that,
because the sphere involves

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.860
this nasty square
root, it is much more

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.820
convenient to represent
this as parabolas.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.430
So the way you go from the
sphere to the parabola,

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:16.402
I did it on the slide.

00:41:16.402 --> 00:41:17.360
And I will do it again.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.610
Because this is a
derivation I want

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.860
you to be very familiar with.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.060
We've done it a few times.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.220
And we'll do it again and again.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.920
You start with the
expression for the wave.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.000
So it is e to the ikr, right?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.620
And there is bells and whistles.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.533
There is all the r's.

00:41:34.533 --> 00:41:35.200
There's the i's.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.990
Let me just write this.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.550
OK, and then remember,
so we have r.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.620
This is the polar coordinate.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:47.280
So it is x plus
y plus z squared.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.370
And the paraxial approximation--

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.800
let me put this back--

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:57.300
in our convention, usually,
is that this is the z-axis.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:04.110
So z is the axis of
propagation, the optical axis.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.060
And then you have the other
two axes perpendicular to it.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.260
Typically, we'll denote
x as being vertical.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.880
OK, and is this now right
handed, the way I did it?

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.080
Yeah, right hand, OK good.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.650
All right, so the
paraxial approximation

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:22.910
then means that z is much
bigger than the values

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.320
of the other two coordinates.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.660
Because, basically,
I'm limiting myself

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.120
to operate in this region.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.800
that's the meaning of the
paraxial approximation.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.100
So what you do then is
you do a Taylor expansion

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.840
on this square root.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.880
So you pull z outside.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:51.660
Then you use the Taylor
property that says 1 plus small

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:55.380
is approximately equal
to 1 plus small over 2.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:59.320
And then you can
see that r equals

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:07.750
z 1 plus x squared plus y
squared over z squared times 2,

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:09.945
which is also known as z plus--

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:16.540
OK.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.370
So that's the
paraxial approximation

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:21.750
for the polar variable.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:26.020
And now I can, of course,
put it in my expression.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:30.750
So this means that e to the
ikr is approximately equal

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:40.590
to e to the ikz, e to the ik, x
squared plus y squared over 2z.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:43.650
And sometimes we will
leave it like this.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:51.780
Or sometimes, we will remember
that k equals 2 pi upon lambda.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:58.830
And then this expression
now becomes e to the i 2 pi

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:00.900
z upon lambda.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.730
e to the i, notice
what will happen.

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.640
The 2s will cancel.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.290
A pi will remain.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:08.370
And you'll get--

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.960
OK.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.520
So all of these are
interchangeable expressions

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.590
that we can use for
spherical waves.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.580
Another interesting question--
I omitted something.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.262
I omitted 1 over ir.

00:44:30.262 --> 00:44:31.970
And actually, there's
also the amplitude.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:35.230
Let's put the amplitude
for completeness.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.560
What happens to the ir?

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:42.240
Should they also do some
paraxial approximation over it?

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:54.840
It turns out it is sufficient
to simply approximate it as z.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:00.000
For the part that appears
outside of the exponent,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.850
we can simply
approximate it as z.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.390
And the reason is because r,
it is actually slowly varying.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.720
You know, if you compare--

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.920
what is r?

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.150
Let's see if we can use the--

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:17.733
yeah, so r is this, right?

00:45:17.733 --> 00:45:18.525
So if you compare--

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:39.910
OK, so basically, you have
to pick z equals constant.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:42.240
So I have to pick
a plane that is

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.760
tangential to the
sphere at this place.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.990
So I compare r1 to r2, right?

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:53.710
So r1 goes all the way to the
plane. r2 simply stops here.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.530
So think about it this way.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:01.780
Let's say that the
error that they make--

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.460
when I say z is
approximately equal to r,

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.163
let's say that they
make a small error.

00:46:07.163 --> 00:46:08.830
Let's say that they
make an error of 1%.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:16.770
That means that they
misrepresent the amplitude

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.850
of the wave by 1%.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:25.680
Now, let's look at the term
that is inside the exponential,

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.080
e to the i pi xy, x squared
plus y squared over lambda z.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:41.320
If I miss by 1%, that is,
if I had e to the 1,000 pi

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:50.270
and I miss by 1%, then it means
I went to e to the 990 pi,

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.100
right?

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:55.060
So this 1% error
actually caused me,

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.410
how many, 10 full oscillations.

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.680
That's why you have to
keep a better approximation

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:09.840
inside the exponential than
I can afford to keep outside.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:15.360
So with the phase, I have to
be much more accurate in order

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.120
to make sure that I don't make
a big error in the phase delay.

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.510
And that's because the
cosine varies very rapidly.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:25.170
As you increase r, the
cosine is oscillating.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.710
But 1 over r is a slowly,
what we call a slowly varying

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.270
function of r.

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:33.540
And therefore, we can afford
to be sloppier with it,

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.620
if you wish.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.770
So the paraxial approximation,
then, for the spherical wave

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:45.850
is just like that with
z in the denominator

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:50.523
but this additional quadratic
term in the exponent.

00:47:50.523 --> 00:47:52.440
And, of course, this
additional quadratic term

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.770
is the one where all of
the action is happening.

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:58.890
And this-- we will see
this later in the class.

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:00.960
And that's the second
important lesson

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:07.160
from today, which is that if
we see an expression which

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:12.498
is quadratic in the
Cartesian coordinates,

00:48:12.498 --> 00:48:13.790
we'll call it a spherical wave.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:20.570
So we went through all
these adventures, I guess,

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:25.210
to arrive at two
very basic waves.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:31.060
One is the kind of wave in whose
phasor you have linear terms

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.520
in the cartesian coordinates.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.840
That we'll call the plane wave.

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:51.895
OK, so if you see
something like this,

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:54.020
it doesn't really matter
what these things are, kx,

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.650
ky, and so on.

00:48:55.650 --> 00:49:01.110
But because these terms
are linear, it is plane.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:04.030
When you arrive at an
expression that looks like this,

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:07.630
you might have
all kinds of junk.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:11.770
And somewhere you have something
of the form e to the i pi

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:18.150
x squared plus y
squared over lambda z,

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:29.100
this quadratic means that it is
spherical, or, more accurately,

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.280
the paraxial approximation
to a spherical wave.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.290
Yes, button.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:44.150
AUDIENCE: I'm curious what
would be the propagation

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.155
of an evanescent wave?

00:49:46.155 --> 00:49:48.530
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Let's
postpone that for a little bit

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.392
later.

00:49:50.392 --> 00:49:51.350
That's a good question.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:55.260
But we don't have the tools
to deal with that yet.

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.630
[INAUDIBLE] is asking--

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:57.880
I wrote this square root here.

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:02.590
Here it is.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:10.120
[INAUDIBLE] is asking,
what if I pick kx and ky

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.830
so that the argument of the
square root becomes negative?

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.220
Therefore, this quantity
would become imaginary, right?

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.710
That is called an
evanescent wave.

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.330
But let's not go into it now.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:24.113
Yeah, we'll come
back to it though.

00:50:24.113 --> 00:50:25.030
It's a valid question.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.110
And other questions?

00:50:38.783 --> 00:50:41.200
Or I should say, any questions
that I'm willing to answer?

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.825
Because that is a
good question, but--.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:56.180
OK, did you come up with any
questions about spherical waves

00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.340
or plane waves during the break?

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.200
AUDIENCE: OK, here
I have one question.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.530
So just now we mentioned
that when the kx, ky is

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:10.510
very small while the kz is very
big, we call it plane wave,

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:11.050
correct?

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.832
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Not quite.

00:51:14.832 --> 00:51:16.290
It is true, actually,
what you say.

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.020
kx and ky will be very small.

00:51:21.097 --> 00:51:21.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, at--

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:23.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.350
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:25.933
AUDIENCE: OK, but
this one I'm talking

00:51:25.933 --> 00:51:27.410
about in the k dimension.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.390
How about in the space,
in the real 3D space.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.640
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK, the
paraxial approximation, I

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.500
did actually in space.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:41.010
So this diagram over here,
that was space, x, y, z.

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:44.730
But what you say is true
in the spherical wave.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.027
The reason I'm reluctant
to admit what you say

00:51:50.027 --> 00:51:52.110
is because the spherical
wave is not a plane wave.

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:56.950
So therefore kx, ky, kz, they
vary across the wavefront,

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:57.637
right?

00:51:57.637 --> 00:51:59.470
So it's a bit more
complicated what happens.

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:04.350
But yeah, if you took a small
portion of the wavefront here,

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:09.420
and you plotted kx--

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.060
well, this is the direction.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.070
If you plotted, kz would be big.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.580
And then kx would be very small.

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.958
So it is true. kx and
ky are also very small.

00:52:18.958 --> 00:52:21.000
But you have to be careful
with a spherical wave.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:28.390
Because, for example, here,
we have a different kx and kz,

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:29.360
right?

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:34.540
So what it means
here, kx and ky--

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.540
well, what does it mean?

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:42.920
Let's not go into Wigner
distributions, right?

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:49.160
OK, so let me say
what I'm trying

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.180
to say in plain language.

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:56.290
The kx, ky, kz will define
them for a plane wave.

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.960
So a plane wave is this kind
of thing, where you have

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.020
a well-defined wave vector.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:05.158
And the entire
wavefront is planar.

00:53:05.158 --> 00:53:06.700
Now, what you are
saying is that if I

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:11.480
have a spherical wavefront
like this, locally,

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.320
I can define normals, right?

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:18.430
And I can call those
wave vectors as well.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:20.140
And that is actually true.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.760
But they're not plane waves.

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.800
You can think of them as rays.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.420
That's a good approximation.

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.430
They would be the equivalent
of geometrical rays,

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:31.723
but not plane waves.

00:53:31.723 --> 00:53:33.140
But nevertheless,
you are correct.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.210
They would-- these
things are also paraxial.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:42.830
So they would also satisfy
kx, ky much less than kz.

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:43.380
That is true.

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:54.576
Other questions?

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.730
I'd like to talk
about a fun topic.

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.860
Today, I was-- I want
to do electromagnetics.

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.210
So I don't want too spend
too much time on this.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:12.820
But I'll talk about
it, because it's fun

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:18.030
and very useful
in many contexts.

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:28.108
So in all of this
business, we wrote the--

00:54:28.108 --> 00:54:29.525
this is, again,
the wave equation.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.420
But we didn't say anything
about the speed of light.

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.930
So actually, we
did a little bit.

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:43.680
I mentioned-- I guess this
is better than a whiteboard.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.310
I have a history of what I've
written throughout the lecture.

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:49.470
Yeah, so at some point,
we did mention this.

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:52.890
We did mention that
the index of refraction

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:56.340
actually enters in this
equation over here.

00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:02.130
But if you remember diligently
from your geometrical optics,

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:04.050
the index of
refraction also happens

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:05.833
to be a function of wavelength.

00:55:09.385 --> 00:55:10.510
It's not a constant, right?

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:12.770
It is a function of wavelength.

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:19.720
So what is means now is that
in this equation over here,

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.970
if I have a single frequency--

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:26.110
now, a single temporal
frequency, a single omega--

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:28.390
then everything is fine.

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:32.080
Because, sure, for this
particular frequency,

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.500
I can find the
index of refraction.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.380
And I'm OK.

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:46.950
However, the index of refraction
is a function of wavelength.

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:55.590
And the wavelength, yes, it
is a function of frequency.

00:55:55.590 --> 00:56:00.040
We do know that this
equation is true.

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:04.280
But we also said, if you
recall, or if you go back

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.020
to the video of
the first lecture

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:09.200
when I first presented this
equation, I gave you a warning.

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.930
And I said that this is
the dispersion relation.

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:16.310
But it is not the only
possible dispersion relation.

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:18.670
It is possible to have
waves where the dispersion

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.900
relation is different.

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:23.690
OK, first of all,
just to make sure

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:27.260
that the [INAUDIBLE] stuff about
dispersion that we discussed

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.430
about the glass, it is true.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:32.630
In other words, in glass,
yes, the index of refraction

00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:35.310
is a function of wavelength.

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:38.010
So this is a plot
that we saw before.

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:40.190
But now, in addition
to that, I'm

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:43.670
talking about a slightly
different type of dispersion.

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:48.770
So this dispersion happens,
for example, in waveguides.

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:51.470
In everything that
we'll do so far,

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:54.390
we sort of assume that
light propagates freely.

00:56:54.390 --> 00:57:00.230
We may put some
lenses or whatever,

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:02.480
prisms in the path
of the light, that

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.630
is refractors, and
mirrors, and so on.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.370
But all of these are
relatively large.

00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:11.850
We never try to confine the
light to a very small space.

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:12.880
But you can do that.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.760
You can create waveguides.

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:20.570
Actually, for visible light, you
will never actually use a metal

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:21.540
here.

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:23.570
You would use a
dielectric waveguide.

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:26.430
But in microwaves, this
is done very commonly.

00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:33.020
In microwaves, people trap
the wave in a metal tube

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:38.660
as if it were water, I suppose,
or some kind of a liquid.

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.160
You just have a hollow
tube that is a metal.

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.220
And then you launch the
microwave inside the tube.

00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:47.530
And to give you an idea,
the wavelength in microwaves

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.040
is in the order of--

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:56.150
well, as the name suggests,
it is the order of--

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:58.370
the frequency's gigahertz.

00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:01.340
So the wavelength should
be between millimeters

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.060
and centimeters.

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:07.455
That is typically--
actually, less,

00:58:07.455 --> 00:58:09.080
no the wavelength is
a little bit less,

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.870
maybe in the order
of millimeters,

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:13.820
typical millimeter.

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:16.098
So the size of these
tubes might also

00:58:16.098 --> 00:58:17.640
be on the order of
a few millimeters.

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.200
So now you have a guide
that is approximately

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:25.040
of size of a few wavelengths.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.140
So in that case, it turns this
equation, c equals lambda nu,

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.790
does not hold anymore.

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:32.740
It is true for a free space.

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:35.080
But it is not true
in a waveguide.

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.480
The reason it is not
true in a waveguide

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:40.850
is because the wave must
satisfy boundary conditions.

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:43.020
If you recall when we
gave the wave equation,

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.490
we said we would need to
satisfy an initial condition

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:47.070
and boundary conditions.

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:49.595
In free space, there is
no boundary condition.

00:58:49.595 --> 00:58:51.220
Actually, there is
a boundary condition

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.410
that the wave must
vanish with infinity.

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.710
OK, fine, but that doesn't
have any implication

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:59.860
in our calculations.

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.140
But, for example, in
the case of a metal,

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:06.790
you have to force the
wave to be 0 on the metal.

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:09.940
Because, well, we'll see
later in electromagnetics

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:10.990
why this is the case.

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:13.300
But take my word for it.

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.250
On the metal, the
field must equals 0.

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:24.250
So now if you have a
sinusoid in this metal,

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:26.670
the sinusoid is in
kind of a straitjacket.

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:30.480
Because it is
sinusoidally varying.

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.110
But also, it must be
over such a period

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:38.650
that it vanishes at the
edge of the waveguide.

00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:40.290
So, for example, it can be--

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:49.530
if this is the waveguide, the
sinusoid can be like this.

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:51.500
That's fine,
because it vanishes.

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.830
It can be like this.

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:53.920
That's also fine.

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.860
It can be like this, and so on.

00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:05.820
But, for example,
can it be like this?

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.620
No, that wave cannot.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:14.140
OK, so I will not do
the full derivation.

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.860
And again, it's a little bit--

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.770
well, we would have to solve
the partial differential

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:21.760
equation in a serious way.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.000
But it turns out that
this straitjacket

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.880
that we put the
light in actually

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.770
results in a
different dispersion

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:30.030
relation that looks like this.

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:32.790
It is not the c equals lambda
nu anymore, but it's this one.

01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:34.500
AUDIENCE: I have a question?

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.780
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes?

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:39.050
AUDIENCE: What happens if
a is smaller than lambda?

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.930
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Then
the wave will not even

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:46.190
get into the waveguide.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:47.510
It will become evanescent.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.490
So it will not go in.

01:00:51.609 --> 01:00:52.442
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.690
AUDIENCE: What is
shown in the diagram,

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:00.800
isn't it a standing wave?

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.530
Because it's not--
oscillation is--

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.940
the way you have drawn--

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.940
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah,
it is a standing wave

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.480
in the vertical direction.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.105
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
how does it propa--

01:01:13.105 --> 01:01:15.355
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Well,
if the [INAUDIBLE] of it is

01:01:15.355 --> 01:01:16.490
bouncing back and forth--

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:18.032
another way to think
of the waveguide

01:01:18.032 --> 01:01:20.970
is that the light is--

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:23.100
you can think, actually,
in terms of rays.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.950
You can think of rays
bouncing back and forth.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:29.635
But you can also have
the conjugate ray.

01:01:29.635 --> 01:01:30.635
These are both possible.

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:37.230
And the result is a standing
wave in this sentence.

01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:38.760
But you can still
have propagation

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.780
on the horizontal axis.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.110
Because there is a component
that goes towards the right.

01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:54.850
OK, so when you get an
equation like this one which

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:58.060
relates omega to k-- and, of
course, as you can imagine,

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:00.820
now there's a great
variety of such equations

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:01.780
that you could have.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.490
This is the equation
that happens to be

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:05.470
true for the metal waveguide.

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:07.840
If you replace it with
a different waveguide,

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.050
for example, if you
have dielectrics

01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:14.530
of different indices here,
then this equation changes.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.840
The bottom line is that if
you have this equation, then

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.630
you can plot one of the two.

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:22.990
You have one term here that
is determined by geometry.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.540
a is the size of the guide.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:29.650
And then you have the wave
vector and the frequency.

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:32.410
And, of course, you have
the free velocity of light.

01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:35.260
OK, omega is fundamental.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.100
As soon as you
specify the frequency

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.100
of the electromagnetic
wave, nothing

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:42.295
can change that anymore since
we're in the linear region.

01:02:42.295 --> 01:02:44.170
But the question is,
what is the wave vector?

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:45.730
So the wave vector
is really what

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:48.620
you are after in this equation.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.810
Omega is given.

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:52.660
It is, say, 10 to the 15 Hertz.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:56.040
What is the k?

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.540
Or in other words,
what is the wavelength?

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.390
Now, for reasons which
will become apparent

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:05.142
in a moment, the people who
invented these diagrams,

01:03:05.142 --> 01:03:07.350
they actually plot them kind
of the other way around.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.200
Instead of omega on
the horizontal axis,

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.990
since omega is given, they put
omega on the vertical axis.

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.330
And the horizontal axis is k.

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:18.330
So the way you read this
diagram is-- of course,

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:20.380
you solve this equation.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.590
And the way you read it
is that if I give you

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:26.810
a certain omega, then you have
to draw a horizontal line.

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:32.550
And wherever this horizontal
line meets the plot, this--

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:35.312
you read the abscissa and--

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:36.270
I never get this right.

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.380
Is this the abscissa
or the other one?

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.213
That's the abscissa?

01:03:39.213 --> 01:03:40.432
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:40.432 --> 01:03:42.140
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's the ordinate?

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.788
OK.

01:03:43.788 --> 01:03:45.580
I must come up with a
mnemonic to remember.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.030
Anyway, so the value
of the horizontal axis

01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:52.660
gives you the wave vector,
and hence, the wavelength.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.908
Now, interestingly, if
you were in free space,

01:03:55.908 --> 01:03:57.450
this would look like
a straight line.

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:00.420
Because, well, of
course in free space--

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.400
I have written this
equation many times.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.500
I don't feel like
writing it again.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.930
In free space-- well,
let me do it once more.

01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:18.480
So in free space, I have
that c equals k over 2 pi.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.475
That's also known
as lambda times--

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:25.920
what am I doing?

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.940
The other way around--

01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:30.720
2 pi over k, that is
also known as lambda,

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.460
times omega over 2 pi.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:38.700
So in free space, then,
you have omega equals ck.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:44.590
This is an equivalent way of
writing this equation here.

01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:46.950
These are basically
the same equation.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:50.520
So in free space, this
is a straight line.

01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:57.200
Now, if you have an
equation like this one,

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:03.010
you can see that at
relatively high frequencies,

01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:04.030
they approach.

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:07.100
So, indeed, all of the-- oh, by
the way, what are these curves?

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.150
So this equation involves
an integral parameter.

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:12.760
You can plug in--

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.112
well, not quite 0, please
erase that from your notes.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.320
I should not have put 0 here.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.550
0 doesn't make sense.

01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:22.330
But you can have plus/minus
1, plus/minus 2, and so on.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:24.310
And these are known as modes.

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:27.970
So the index defines
the mode that

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:31.810
is launched into the waveguide.

01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:38.030
So each one of these modes,
at very high frequencies,

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:41.690
it actually kind of approaches
the free space mode.

01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:44.030
But as you go to
lower frequencies,

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:47.120
you see that it bends away
and then eventually hits

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.900
the ordinate axis.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.620
And there's a gap here now.

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:57.600
Because there's nothing
in this place over here.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.400
So what will happen
if you come up,

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:03.200
if you use an omega that
falls in this range?

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.660
AUDIENCE: Evanescent wave.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.660
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Correct-- actually, someone

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.830
asked it before in Boston.

01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:16.050
Someone asked me
before, what happens

01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:19.530
if you pick a to be
smaller than a wavelength?

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:21.940
Well, this is what happens.

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:25.250
In fact, I wouldn't espouse
it exactly like this.

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:27.390
A more accurate way
to say it is what

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:31.560
happens if you pick an
omega which is very small?

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:36.060
So therefore, given the value of
a and given the value of omega,

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.860
you cannot find the k anymore.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.130
The square root
becomes imaginary.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.950
Well, if that happens, the wave
does not enter the waveguide.

01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:44.730
It becomes
evanescent, as we say.

01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:46.800
So basically, it may
penetrate a little bit

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.300
for a couple of wavelengths.

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.930
And then it will
exponentially decay.

01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:55.500
Now, if you-- as you
go progressively-- so,

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.600
if you launch at
very low frequency,

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.800
the wave does not enter.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.360
As you start increasing
the frequency now,

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.540
you will see that
the intersection only

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:07.823
meets one mode.

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:09.615
So basically, at the
range of frequencies--

01:07:09.615 --> 01:07:10.870
I don't know what it is here.

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:13.230
This looks like 3 or something.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:16.290
So between-- so the
way you read this axis

01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:18.480
is you read the ordinate.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.570
And you multiply by
three times 10 to the 14.

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:26.970
So, for example, 5
actually means 15 times 10

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:28.620
to the 14 Hertz.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:32.130
OK, so then between
3, the value f3, which

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:38.400
is 9 times 10 to the 14, and
the value, whatever it is, 7,

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.830
you only launch one mode.

01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:44.180
As you go up in frequency,
if your intersection here

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.800
meets more than one
line, then actually you

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.050
can have multiple
modes in this guide.

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:54.260
Anyway, so these modes,
these little wiggles

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.940
that I drew over
here, the first mode

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.480
is the field shape that
looks like this, only half

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.360
of the period of the sinusoid.

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:07.050
The next mode, you
allow one full period.

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:09.330
The next mode, you
allow 1 1/2 period,

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:10.770
then so on and so forth.

01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:12.750
So as you go higher
in frequency,

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:14.370
it means that the wave--

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:17.649
basically, what it means
is that the waveguide now--

01:08:17.649 --> 01:08:20.399
or, I should say the
wavelength of the wave

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:24.540
becomes progressively smaller
than the size of the waveguide.

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:29.649
So therefore, you can pack
more modes into the guide.

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:31.123
So I only plotted three here.

01:08:31.123 --> 01:08:32.290
Of course, there's infinite.

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:34.240
But anyway, as you
go up in frequency,

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.270
you have the possibility to
excite more than one mode.

01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:38.743
Now, how do you
excite the modes?

01:08:38.743 --> 01:08:41.410
Now, that depends, of course, on
your initial conditions, right?

01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:44.080
If you create a
distribution in the entrance

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.120
of the waveguide
that looks like this,

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.620
then you will excite
the first mode.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:50.200
If you create a distribution
that looks like this,

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.359
well, if the second
mode is allowable,

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:55.029
that is if you are
above the green line,

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:56.410
then you will excite it.

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:57.939
If you are below
the green line, you

01:08:57.939 --> 01:08:59.350
will probably excite nothing.

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.880
Because the first mode
cannot be excited this way.

01:09:05.727 --> 01:09:07.310
The reason I'm telling
you this is not

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.069
because I want to do waveguide
theory, but because I

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.920
but because I want to do
something that's called a beat.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.740
And a beat is an
extremely useful concept,

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.770
both in the space domain
and in the time domain.

01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:22.189
So in the time domain,
the beat is actually--

01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:23.390
it is a very simple thing.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.460
It is defined as
the superposition

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:30.390
of two sinusoids of slightly
different frequency.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:33.140
So we said this many times,
that if the wave is linear,

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.569
therefore a
superposition is allowed.

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:38.720
If I have two solutions
to the wave equation.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.560
I take the sum.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.819
It is still a solution.

01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:43.979
So now what you can
see here very easily--

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:46.960
that's a diagram that I
stole from the textbook.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.779
Because the two waves have
slightly different frequency,

01:09:50.779 --> 01:09:51.890
they will misalign.

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:55.400
So you can, for example,
start at the point

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.172
where the waves are
exactly aligned.

01:09:58.172 --> 01:09:59.630
So they kind of
oscillate together.

01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:02.150
When one is positive,
the other is positive.

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:03.860
But because the
period is different,

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.350
or the frequency is
different, a little bit later,

01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:09.410
they will kind of separate.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:12.080
And now, over here, you can
see that this is the opposite.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.390
When one of them is positive,
the other is negative.

01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:17.750
And if you also happen
to judiciously pick

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:19.790
them to have the
same amplitude, it

01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:24.240
means that here when, as we say,
they oscillate out of phase,

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:30.210
it means that the wave amplitude
overall becomes very small.

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:33.480
And so-- and of course,
in the other case,

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.340
where they are in
phase, the amplitude

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:38.010
becomes twice the
amplitude of one.

01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:41.190
So this is sort of a static
picture from the book.

01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:44.310
I also made a movie out of it.

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:46.534
So here you see the
beat propagating.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.595
OK, so now, what is really
interesting about this--

01:10:55.595 --> 01:10:56.720
I'm going to play it again.

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:06.370
If you look at it carefully--

01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:09.720
it takes a-- let me
play it once more.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.970
Actually, I think I can just--

01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:22.900
if you look at it
carefully, you will

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:27.660
see that there is two
different velocities here.

01:11:30.072 --> 01:11:31.280
There's two things happening.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:37.120
One is you have this envelope
that is moving to the right.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.460
But also, inside
the envelope, you

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:44.220
have small fringes, wiggles that
are also moving to the right.

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:48.305
Now, I told you, of course,
but if you look at it once

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.430
again more carefully, you
will see that the two are

01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:52.050
moving with different speeds.

01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:57.840
Can you see it?

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:03.307
The wiggles are moving
faster than the envelope.

01:12:03.307 --> 01:12:05.390
And you can see that the
wiggles are moving faster

01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:07.830
than the envelop
if you look here

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:10.095
near the vicinity of the null.

01:12:10.095 --> 01:12:11.970
You will see that there's
a little bit of a--

01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:14.820
once in a while, there's a
pulse, like a little pulse.

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.390
That means that the
fringe are passing by.

01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:20.010
So the reason this
is happening--

01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:22.110
and now I will not
derive it on the paper.

01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:25.030
Because it will end
a little bit late.

01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:28.200
But the reason this
is happening is

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.460
because if you take the
superposition of the two

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:34.170
sinusoids, now we have to
be a little bit careful.

01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:37.180
Because they have
different frequencies.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.270
So if we use phasor--
we could use phasors.

01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:42.270
But we might get a
little bit confused.

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:45.030
So for that reason, I just
wrote it in the real space

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:46.363
simply with cosines.

01:12:46.363 --> 01:12:48.030
So you do the same
thing with it before.

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.260
You take the sum
of the two cosines.

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:52.170
You apply the
trigonometric identity

01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:53.910
to write it as a product.

01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:57.000
And then you find that the
product contains two terms.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.940
One of them-- actually,
by the way, the--

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:02.630
oh, shoot.

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:04.770
There's one more
error in the notes.

01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:07.800
There should be a cosine
between the two parentheses.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.200
There shouldn't be a cosine.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.286
I better write down
the correct expression.

01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:47.210
OK, where kc equals
k1 plus k2 over 2,

01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:57.340
and the same for omega c, and
km equals k1 minus k2 over 2,

01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.590
so one of them is the average.

01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:01.130
The other is the difference.

01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:12.220
So now each one of those,
each one of these cosines--

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.680
OK, there's a
missing cosine here.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.437
But imagine that
there was a cosine.

01:14:15.437 --> 01:14:17.020
Each one of those
is a traveling wave.

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:22.680
So basically, what you see
now is the product of the two

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.460
traveling waves.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.430
And you can see very
clearly it's a product here.

01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:32.920
This is-- I have one sinusoid
of relatively low spatial period

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:38.400
and another sinusoid of
relatively fast spatial period.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.562
And I multiply them.

01:14:39.562 --> 01:14:40.770
But they're both propagating.

01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:44.310
Because they're both of
the form kz minus omega t.

01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:47.220
But they're propagating
with different speeds.

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:49.970
Because the speed of the--

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:53.070
oh, and-- so, what
are the names?

01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:58.830
Well, the fast sinusoid
here is called the carrier.

01:14:58.830 --> 01:15:00.562
Those of you who are
electrical engineers

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:01.770
are very familiar with those.

01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:03.990
The carrier wave is--

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:09.450
in radiowaves, for example,
it is the frequency upon which

01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:11.910
we'll modulate the signal.

01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:20.630
And the slow sinusoid,
that's called the modulation.

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:27.370
And-- I lost my
train of thought.

01:15:27.370 --> 01:15:31.270
All right, but each one of
those is a propagating wave.

01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:36.292
So therefore, their velocities
would be equal to the--

01:15:36.292 --> 01:15:38.250
it will depend on which
wave I'm talking about.

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.960
So, for example, the
velocity of the carrier

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.290
will equal omega of
the carrier divided

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.270
by the k of the carrier.

01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:48.070
And the velocity
of the modulation

01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:50.110
will equal omega
of the modulation

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:52.450
over k of the modulation.

01:15:52.450 --> 01:15:55.360
OK, and so this is not magic.

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.430
We'll just apply the
theory that we learned.

01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:00.280
But now it is the two
waves that are propagating.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.670
And, of course, in general, the
two velocities are different.

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.340
Because the two
rations over here,

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.620
they have no reason
to be the same.

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.240
In fact, it is
quite the opposite.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.350
Most of the time
they are different.

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:21.230
So this velocity, I actually
used a slightly different

01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:22.220
notation.

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:28.570
The velocity of the carrier
is called the phase velocity.

01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:30.280
And the velocity
of the modulation

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.037
is called the group velocity.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:55.280
So the group velocity, it
equals, as you can see,

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.260
the ratio of the
difference of omega

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:02.990
to the ratio of the
difference of k.

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:06.983
So if you imagine a beat--

01:17:06.983 --> 01:17:08.400
this is called a
beat, by the way.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.450
I think I said it before.

01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:12.900
So if you imagine a beat where
the two frequencies of the two

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:16.463
numbers are very close, then
it will become the derivative.

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:24.590
So the group
velocity is basically

01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:26.630
the derivative of the--

01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:29.960
whatever omega is
as a function of k,

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.450
if you take the derivative
of that expression,

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:33.980
you get the group velocity.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:37.070
The phase velocity
is the same velocity

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:40.020
we've been talking about so
far while we're doing waves.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:43.040
So there's nothing new
about the phase velocity.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.480
It is still the ratio
of omega over k.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.060
But the group velocity
is the derivative.

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.680
And the reason now--

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.460
ah, now the reason is revealed.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:54.580
AUDIENCE: George?

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.247
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
There's a question?

01:17:56.247 --> 01:17:58.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, why did
the derivative come about?

01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:00.350
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yeah, you're right.

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:01.740
I kind of blasted through.

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.300
So if you look at
the group velocity,

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:07.760
it equals omega
of the modulation

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.720
over k of the modulation.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.120
And this equals omega
1 minus omega 2 over 2

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.250
over k1 minus k2 over 2.

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:20.960
That is omega 1 minus
omega 2 over k1 minus k2.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.220
And if you take
omega one very close

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.340
but not quite the
same and k1 very close

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:30.167
but not quite the same, then v
sub g will become d omega dk.

01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:35.420
So that is the reason
people put omega

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.440
on the vertical axis of it here.

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.060
Because the group
velocity, then,

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:44.900
is simply obtained as the slope
of the dispersion diagram.

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:48.200
And that's fascinating,
if you think about it.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.470
Because it suggests
some weird things.

01:18:51.470 --> 01:19:05.090
For example, it suggests
that if I could somehow

01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:08.780
create this pendulum
diagram that

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:12.490
looks like this, what is the
strange thing about this?

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.520
That's right, it has a
negative group philosophy,

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.800
which means that in the wave,
the carrier and the modulation,

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.830
they go in opposite directions.

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:28.850
The phase velocity
is going to the left.

01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:30.600
The group velocity is
going to the right.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.433
I meant to make a movie
of this to show you.

01:19:32.433 --> 01:19:34.230
It actually looks
a little bit weird.

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:36.170
But I didn't have time to do it.

01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:37.750
And I'll show you one next time.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:42.200
But now, of course, it
demands-- it's interesting.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.960
How can you do
something like this?

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:49.390
It turns out to be an extremely
hot topic in optics research.

01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:54.290
Now we know how to design,
theoretically, structures.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:57.930
By the way, natural materials,
they don't have this property.

01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:00.890
So you have to try really hard
to make this property happen,

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:03.650
for example, by
patterning a dielectric.

01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:06.570
If you create patterns
in a certain way,

01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:08.320
then you can cause--

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:11.900
you can make group, I
mean dispersion diagrams

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:13.490
that look like this.

01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:16.310
And, of course, to
fabricate them--

01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:18.017
you know, it is one
thing to design them

01:20:18.017 --> 01:20:20.100
and simulate them and one
thing to fabricate them.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:24.070
So these are all very hot
topics in optics research.

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:26.130
So that's why I--

01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:29.610
and also, beat is sort of
a very important topic.

01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:31.730
So that's why I spend
some time talking about.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.380
And one of the problems--

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.560
again, in the new homework that
I posted, one of the problems

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.340
I'll get you to play a little
bit with this dispersion

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:49.580
relation so you can
get a feel for it.

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:52.910
Unfortunately, in this
class, we do mostly optics

01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:54.890
in the space domain.

01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:58.720
This, what I'm discussing here
is kind of time domain, right?

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.750
Because we're talking about
modulations, and carriers,

01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:03.753
and so on.

01:21:03.753 --> 01:21:05.420
This class is mostly
about space domain.

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.340
So we don't spend too
much time on this topic.

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:10.460
But anyway, it is sort
of important to know.

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:12.110
That's why I covered it.

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:21.300
With that, unless
there is any questions,

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:25.300
I will move on to
electromagnetics.

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:26.291
Questions?

01:21:34.908 --> 01:21:36.200
AUDIENCE: George, one question.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.050
So just now, we show that
carrier and the modulation wave

01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:40.980
actually have
different velocity.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.280
But in everyday
life, common sense

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.560
for [INAUDIBLE],, for
example, the red light

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.800
and the yellow light
travel at the same speed.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.170
I mean that how
different frequency

01:21:51.170 --> 01:21:52.350
have different wavelengths.

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:56.430
But the product of
these two is constant.

01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:59.350
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Not
at all, for example, we

01:21:59.350 --> 01:22:01.720
know that is not true in glass.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:09.134
That is the reason why a
prism analyzes white light.

01:22:09.134 --> 01:22:11.990
It is because red
and yellow, they

01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:14.840
travel with different
velocities in glass.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.030
So any medium that
is dispersive,

01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:19.550
they have different velocities.

01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:22.420
AUDIENCE: So only in a vacuum
they have the same velocity.

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.930
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
In vacuum, yes.

01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:27.200
So the linear
dispersion relation

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.315
that I showed before,
that is for vacuum.

01:22:41.710 --> 01:22:44.485
Actually, it is also
linear in a medium,

01:22:44.485 --> 01:22:45.610
but with a different slope.

01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:47.325
I should have said that.

01:22:47.325 --> 01:22:49.450
COLIN SHEPPARD: I was just
going to point out that,

01:22:49.450 --> 01:22:51.340
actually, you show
in the phase velocity

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:54.150
there for the free
space, not for the--

01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:55.900
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
For free space, yeah.

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.490
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Yeah, but the point

01:22:57.490 --> 01:23:02.190
where you've measured the
group velocity, that you've

01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:07.270
labeled omega c kc, if you
drew a line from the origin

01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:09.895
to that point, the slope of that
would give the phase velocity.

01:23:09.895 --> 01:23:11.853
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: You
are correct, actually.

01:23:11.853 --> 01:23:13.680
Yes, yes, yes, thank you, yeah.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.210
Yes, that's very true.

01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:18.640
The phase velocity
is omega over k.

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.200
So it should be that one.

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.800
Yes, so I need to
correct the slides.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.810
Thank you.

01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:26.670
Yeah, this is the phase
velocity of free space.

01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:29.430
COLIN SHEPPARD: And it's
greater than the speed of light.

01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:30.847
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

01:23:35.433 --> 01:23:36.850
How could that
happen, by the way?

01:23:39.773 --> 01:23:41.440
Because this is a
phase velocity, right?

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.607
It can do anything it wants.

01:23:42.607 --> 01:23:46.600
It can go faster than
the speed of light.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.070
Because it carries
no information.

01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:50.900
It is simply an oscillation.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.660
The group velocity, as
you will see actually--

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:56.260
in the homework, I get you
to derive the group velocity

01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:57.350
for this case.

01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:59.860
You will see from the answer
that the group velocity

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.770
is actually smaller
than the speed of light.

01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:06.410
You will see that the group
velocity for this diagram,

01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:13.300
it is given by something like c
square root 1 minus something.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:18.770
So the group velocity
is always less than c.

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.970
OK, so I will post
the corrected version.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.241
Any other questions?

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.020
AUDIENCE: So would a patterned
metamaterial basically

01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:59.310
be the same thing as a special
case of a gradient index

01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:00.750
lens, a GRIN?

01:25:10.127 --> 01:25:11.710
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
I don't know what

01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:13.150
you mean by a special case.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.517
I mean, they have quite
different properties.

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:23.690
AUDIENCE: Well, I
mean you can maybe

01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:28.523
imagine the idea of the gradient
in the dielectric material

01:25:28.523 --> 01:25:30.440
where the gradient and
the index of refraction

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:33.200
sort of creating a
negative group velocity

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.530
or some case where you're
actually diverting light away

01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:39.290
from what you're
trying to image.

01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:46.150
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I don't
think with a simple gradient

01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:48.360
index you can--

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.040
OK, it depends on what
you mean by gradient.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:54.820
If it is a slowly varying
gradient like the GRIN optics

01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:59.410
usually, I don't think you can
create sufficient dispersion

01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:02.890
to turn the light around.

01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:06.640
If you have
subwavelength patterns,

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.610
then yes, because the
resulting evanescent waves

01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:11.560
that can adapt in ways that--

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.115
yeah, I mean, this is the whole
area-- yeah, so metamaterials.

01:26:15.115 --> 01:26:16.490
But those, usually
the gradients.

01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:17.170
Are huge, right?

01:26:17.170 --> 01:26:21.880
Because within a space of less
than the free space wavelength,

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:24.430
you might have variation
of index from 3 to 1,

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.380
and then back to 3, and so on.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.099
So those are huge gradients.

01:26:36.418 --> 01:26:37.960
AUDIENCE: You say
that group velocity

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.802
is the velocity with which
the information is traveling?

01:26:41.802 --> 01:26:44.010
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Well,
that's one interpretation,

01:26:44.010 --> 01:26:44.902
yeah.

01:26:44.902 --> 01:26:46.110
This has been challenged too.

01:26:46.110 --> 01:26:49.200
Because people saw that
group velocity in some cases

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.360
can also exceed
the speed of light.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:57.930
So therefore, even
that is questionable.

01:26:57.930 --> 01:27:01.560
But anyway, in most
cases, group velocity

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:05.970
is the velocity at which
the modulation travels.

01:27:05.970 --> 01:27:09.870
So the modulation usually
denotes information.

01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:11.965
If you exceed the group--

01:27:11.965 --> 01:27:13.980
if the group velocity,
if you manage to make it

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:17.480
exceed the speed of light,
which has been proposed,

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.230
then it means that the
modulation actually

01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:20.390
does not carry information.

01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:25.140
It is something that you
artificially put in there.

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:28.770
AUDIENCE: So why we means--

01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:32.100
what is the advantage of
negative group velocity means

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:35.555
opposite direction
information travel?

01:27:35.555 --> 01:27:36.930
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Well, it can

01:27:36.930 --> 01:27:39.268
make you a pretty
good career and get

01:27:39.268 --> 01:27:40.560
you papers published in Nature.

01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.540
No, no, I mean, there's--

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.050
I'm joking.

01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:50.780
But [INAUDIBLE]
it is interesting.

01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:53.180
It is interesting physics
and very counter-intuitive.

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.490
That is cool, right?

01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:57.970
But also, the people
who work on it,

01:27:57.970 --> 01:28:01.970
they have shown
mathematically that you

01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:05.390
can get focusing of light
that is sometimes tighter

01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:09.260
than traditional refractive--

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:13.730
you can get interesting kinds
of dispersion for pulse shaping,

01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:14.540
very narrow--

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:17.000
you know, you can do some
clever things with it.

01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:23.570
You can slow down
light, which is--

01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:25.500
slow down light means that--

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:39.360
if you go back to
this diagram, you

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.360
see that as you go
towards lower frequencies,

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.590
the group velocity becomes
progressively smaller.

01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:51.830
In fact, over here, well,
if there's a point where

01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:53.900
it is actually 0--

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:55.200
so what does it mean?

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.660
Well, it means
that if you really

01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:01.940
had the light pulse, not
the fringe of the light,

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:06.770
not the carrier wave, but
the envelope, the modulation,

01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:08.900
if you were to run
into this frequency

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.650
or very close to this frequency,
that could stop, right?

01:29:12.650 --> 01:29:15.500
It would actually-- or it
would move very, very slowly.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.795
That's the principle of slow
light, which actually also

01:29:17.795 --> 01:29:18.920
has potential applications.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.630
For example, you can store data.

01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:23.625
If you can slow light down, you
can create an optical buffer.

01:29:23.625 --> 01:29:26.000
You can wait for something
else to happen and then launch

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.740
the wave again.

01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:32.242
So there is things that you
can do with this in addition

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:33.200
to interesting physics.

01:29:47.732 --> 01:29:49.190
It's a fascinating
topic, this one.

01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:51.540
So I'm glad you're
asking questions.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:06.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and if you
go for a higher frequency,

01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:10.520
we can see that we can excite
many modes in the waveguide.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.370
So all the waveguides will--

01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:16.123
it means all the modes will
have different velocity?

01:30:16.123 --> 01:30:17.540
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:18.110
AUDIENCE: So--

01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.840
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Which is bad, right?

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.170
Because it means that
if your information

01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:25.400
sample split between those two
modes, then they will separate.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.520
So they will arrive
at different times.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.910
That is called modal dispersion.

01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:32.652
And it is a very serious
problem in telecommunications.

01:30:32.652 --> 01:30:34.610
It means that you get
distortion in the signal.

01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:40.490
Was that your question,
or, I'm sorry,

01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:43.344
I kind of answered your question
before you even asked it.

01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.940
OK, here they are.

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:21.880
I'm sure all of you, at
some point or another,

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:25.070
at some moment, probably
a moment of a nightmare,

01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:26.580
you saw them, right?

01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:29.510
These are Maxwell's equations.

01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:33.100
So you can read
them in the notes.

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:38.372
I have the two slides preceding
these where I sort drew them

01:31:38.372 --> 01:31:39.330
in the traditional way.

01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:42.770
And, of course, the book
also has an explanation.

01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:46.420
But I would like to ask you if
you remember from your physics

01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:49.060
802, those of you
who are at MIT,

01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:53.870
or whatever it was, your basic
electromagnetics class, do you

01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:57.080
remember each one of those,
what is it telling us,

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.598
and why does it look
the way it does?

01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:00.890
Let's start with the first one.

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:01.807
Does anybody remember?

01:32:01.807 --> 01:32:02.990
What does the first one do?

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:05.240
So actually, these are--

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.240
you know, these are
the same equations.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:11.990
One on the left hand side
is written in integral form.

01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:15.440
The right hand side is
written in differential form.

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:18.080
Does anybody want to
volunteer and say,

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.060
for example, the first row?

01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.750
It is the same equation.

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:22.990
So what does it tell us?

01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:25.020
AUDIENCE: The-- you want to say?

01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:30.160
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Toss a coin.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.260
AUDIENCE: The first one
says, the integral form

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:40.030
says that the total electric
flux passing through a closed

01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:44.920
surface is equal to the
total charge enclosed

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.900
inside that surface.

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:50.200
And the equivalent
differential form

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:55.300
says that the total amount of
electric field emerging out

01:32:55.300 --> 01:33:01.030
of a point is equal to the
amount of charge at that point.

01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:02.800
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's correct.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.780
So basically, it is telling you
that if you have a charge, then

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:12.580
you have field lines
radiating out of that charge.

01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:15.580
And if you enclose this
charge with a surface

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:21.325
and you compute the
integral of the--

01:33:26.145 --> 01:33:27.520
I don't know why
this is a cross.

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.020
By the way, there's
another mistake.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.770
This should have been
a dot, not a cross.

01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:37.490
But anyway, if you
compute this integral,

01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:42.140
it is determined by the
total amount of charge.

01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.170
OK, we can go back
to the notes now.

01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:45.140
[INAUDIBLE]

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:57.570
So this is what your
colleague just said.

01:33:57.570 --> 01:33:59.000
You have a charge.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.760
Then you have field
lines radiating out.

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.580
And then if you take
all of these lines,

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:10.210
dot product them with
the elemental surface,

01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:13.380
and then integrate, then you
get the amount of charge.

01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:17.020
And why?

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:19.770
Why should it be so?

01:34:19.770 --> 01:34:23.930
AUDIENCE: Principle of
charge conservation.

01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:27.010
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK, but why
do the field lines emanate out

01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:27.690
of the charges?

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.770
AUDIENCE: It goes
from positive to--

01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:37.750
I mean, it originates
from positive.

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:43.150
And we can say that
field line represents

01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:46.748
the direction of the force on
a-- you need positive charge.

01:34:46.748 --> 01:34:49.040
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK,
that's what I was looking for.

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.790
So the field lines are
basically-- they tell you,

01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:57.130
exactly like you said, what is
the direction that the small

01:34:57.130 --> 01:35:00.040
positive charge--

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:00.700
let me repeat.

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:03.700
What is the direction
of the force

01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:05.560
that the small
positive charge would

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.750
feel if you were to
place it at any given

01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:09.730
position in that space?

01:35:09.730 --> 01:35:13.150
This is what the
electric field says.

01:35:13.150 --> 01:35:15.610
And then there is a
relationship called

01:35:15.610 --> 01:35:21.090
Coulomb's law, which
for two given charges,

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:22.510
it tells you the force.

01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:24.410
So if you have a
single charge here.

01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:26.830
And then you apply
Coulomb's law,

01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:29.410
then you get these
radiating lines.

01:35:29.410 --> 01:35:31.450
So then Gauss' law is
basically nothing other

01:35:31.450 --> 01:35:32.620
than Coulomb's law.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.170
And yes, it also has to do
with charge conservation.

01:35:35.170 --> 01:35:38.500
Because if you somehow
cancel all the charges

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:42.130
inside this volume, then
the integral will vanish.

01:35:42.130 --> 01:35:45.400
Because it means that you
don't have any net electric--

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.740
actually, you can have
electric charge radiating.

01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:49.020
But the integral will vanish.

01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:55.180
In other words, if you have the
charges surrounding, somehow,

01:35:55.180 --> 01:36:01.460
this space, the space
cannot pull them all inside.

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:04.110
OK, what about--
you have a question?

01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:08.380
What about the second one?

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.050
AUDIENCE: That
means, [INAUDIBLE]

01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:27.903
line integral is 0 means
b is a closed line.

01:36:27.903 --> 01:36:29.570
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
B is a closed line.

01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:33.740
And b is a closed line why?

01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:37.310
AUDIENCE: It means that
there is no magnetic charge.

01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:39.030
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:41.390
Magnets only come as dipoles.

01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:45.670
You cannot have an isolated
north pole, for example,

01:36:45.670 --> 01:36:46.760
of a magnet.

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:50.105
So actually, this is
the same equation.

01:36:50.105 --> 01:36:51.980
In fact, they're also
known by the same name.

01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.080
They're known as Gauss' law.

01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.240
This type of equation,
except there's

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:00.650
no such thing as
magnetic charge.

01:37:03.190 --> 01:37:05.440
What about the next one?

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.575
This one looks awful,
del cross c equals db dt.

01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:18.580
So let's look at the integral.

01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:23.550
Usually the differential form
is mathematically better but not

01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:26.970
very insightful physically.

01:37:26.970 --> 01:37:31.380
So one gets more information by
looking at the integral forms,

01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.440
even though the integral
forms look really frightening.

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:41.640
But anyway, the third equation
is known as Faraday's law.

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:49.500
And it says that if you
have a viable magnetic field

01:37:49.500 --> 01:38:01.330
inside a wire, then a potential
will develop across this wire.

01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:08.920
And do you know of any
places where this is used?

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.252
Button.

01:38:16.252 --> 01:38:17.210
Even I cannot hear you.

01:38:17.210 --> 01:38:18.460
Imagine the people in Boston.

01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:23.050
Not working?

01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:28.360
Oh, maybe use someone else's.

01:38:32.150 --> 01:38:33.670
OK, [INAUDIBLE], you're on.

01:38:33.670 --> 01:38:36.892
AUDIENCE: It's
induction motors and--

01:38:36.892 --> 01:38:39.350
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah,
voice coils and generators, they

01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:40.560
use the same principle.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.250
So, for example, if you--

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:45.470
people do this in
hydroelectric plants.

01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:47.600
You have a giant magnet.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:53.370
And you somehow move a
coil inside that magnet.

01:38:53.370 --> 01:38:55.370
And, of course, you have
to arrange it properly.

01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:57.200
Then the coil will
develop a voltage.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:58.740
So that's the principle of--

01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.220
of course, you have to
move the coil, for example,

01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:05.370
by pouring water over it,
or by steam, or whatever.

01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:10.680
But anyway, that's the
principle of a generator.

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:15.430
OK, so and the last
equation that--

01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:18.710
AUDIENCE: George,
just as an aside,

01:39:18.710 --> 01:39:25.580
how does a nuclear power plant
generate energy, electricity?

01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:26.990
Does it rotate something?

01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:28.436
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Actually, I don't know.

01:39:28.436 --> 01:39:30.620
COLIN SHEPPARD: I think it just
generates steam, and then you--

01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:31.010
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:32.360
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Then you
move a coil, I guess, yeah.

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.485
AUDIENCE: Right, right, OK.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.450
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: And
then the last one is actually

01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:46.730
the most interesting one.

01:39:46.730 --> 01:39:51.110
Because this law actually was
involved with a breakthrough

01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:52.940
in electromagnetics.

01:39:52.940 --> 01:40:05.380
It can be known for a long time
that if you have a current,

01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:07.880
a magnetic field develops
around that current.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.370
That is actually Lorentz--

01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:12.020
it is known as Lorentz force.

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:17.420
If you have a moving charge,
and then you put a little magnet

01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:20.082
nearby, then the--

01:40:20.082 --> 01:40:21.680
what am I saying.

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.180
Anyway, if you have
a moving charge,

01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:29.870
and if you have a current,
it creates a magnetic field

01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:30.370
around it.

01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:32.930
That has been known
for a long time.

01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:35.360
But what was not
known and was noticed

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:41.790
by Maxwell was that if
you have a capacitor--

01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:44.590
well, in a capacitor, you can
not have a current per se.

01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:47.580
Because the capacitor, well,
inside there's a dielectric.

01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.800
So there can be no current.

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:55.360
But you can have
a variable charge

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.760
density in the capacitor plate.

01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:02.650
So what I'm trying to say
is that if you apply a--

01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:05.050
think of charge in a capacitor.

01:41:05.050 --> 01:41:10.660
When you charge a capacitor,
the capacitor, at the beginning,

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:13.840
the voltage across
the capacitor is 0.

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.820
And by the time you
have totally charged it,

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:19.590
the voltage has
reached some value.

01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:22.560
Well, while the
voltage is changing,

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.660
there is actually charge
flow into the capacitor.

01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:31.080
There is a positive charge
going to the positive electrode,

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:36.600
then negative leaving from
the opposite electrode.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:38.280
And at the same time,
what is happening,

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.860
the electric field inside
the capacitor grows.

01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:43.830
Because as you get more charge
accumulating in the capacitor

01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:48.340
plates, then the electric field
of the capacitor is changing.

01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:52.110
So in a sense, you can think
of it as a current as well.

01:41:52.110 --> 01:41:55.860
And what Maxwell-- he
guessed it, actually.

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.770
He didn't observe it.

01:41:58.770 --> 01:42:00.300
But he guessed it.

01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:05.100
He guessed that this kind
of variable electric field

01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:09.160
should also generate
a magnetic field.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:12.120
And the only reason he
guessed it is by symmetry

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.370
from the previous law.

01:42:14.370 --> 01:42:15.280
What does that say?

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.020
It says that if you have
a variable magnetic flux,

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.990
you generate an
electrical potential.

01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:23.700
Well, he looked
at this equation.

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:25.070
And he said, wait a minute.

01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:27.350
It's fine that if I
have a moving charge,

01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:28.470
I have a magnetic field.

01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:29.370
OK, fine.

01:42:29.370 --> 01:42:31.080
But if also I have a moving--

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:34.020
if I have a variable
potential, then why

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.090
should I not generate
a magnetic field?

01:42:36.090 --> 01:42:37.890
I should.

01:42:37.890 --> 01:42:40.210
And it turned out to be true.

01:42:40.210 --> 01:42:43.900
I mean-- Maxwell,
by the way, he was--

01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:46.910
do you know what
was his day job?

01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:55.610
James Clerk Maxwell, he
was a fluid mechanic.

01:42:55.610 --> 01:42:57.640
He was [INAUDIBLE].

01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.670
And that's why the terminology--
not the terminology,

01:43:00.670 --> 01:43:03.270
but the notation in
electromagnetic magnetics

01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:07.150
is actually very similar to the
fluid mechanics notation, rho,

01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:08.513
and epsilon, and all that stuff.

01:43:08.513 --> 01:43:10.430
I mean, they're not the
same things, but the--

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:18.500
and also, these theorems,
the mathematical theorems,

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:20.660
they come from fluid mechanics.

01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:22.430
They apply to
incomprehensible flows.

01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:24.200
For example, the
Gauss theorem, it

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:34.960
applies to incomprehensible
flow in the pressure potential.

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:38.270
Anyway, so Maxwell
did that first.

01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:45.520
So he guessed that you should
have this form in here.

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.860
And then he actually wrote
down all of these equations

01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:50.970
in a coordinated form.

01:43:50.970 --> 01:43:53.500
And the reason this was
a very valuable thing,

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:58.340
and I guess we're all employed
because of this [INAUDIBLE],,

01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:02.803
is because if you manipulate
Maxwell's equations--

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:04.970
and I will not do it now,
because I ran out of time.

01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:07.500
But if you manipulate
them, you can actually

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.680
show that you arrive at the
wave equation for the electric

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:12.880
or the magnetic field.

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.710
I did it here for
the electric field.

01:44:14.710 --> 01:44:17.590
But you can also derive
the same equation

01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:19.267
for the magnetic field.

01:44:19.267 --> 01:44:21.100
So therefore, what this
means is that if you

01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:28.850
have electric and magnetic
fields which change in time,

01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:30.590
Maxwell's equations
tell you that they

01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:32.960
change in a coordinated way.

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:36.890
And the way they change is
as an electromagnetic wave.

01:44:47.110 --> 01:44:48.340
I think it's time to quit.

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:51.300
In fact, we're already
five minutes late, so.

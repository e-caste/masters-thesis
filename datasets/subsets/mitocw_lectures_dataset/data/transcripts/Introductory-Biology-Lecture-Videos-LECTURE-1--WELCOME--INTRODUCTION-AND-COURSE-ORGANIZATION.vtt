WEBVTT

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:18.600
BARBARA IMPERIALI: OK.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.642
We're going to get going.

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:21.740
Now, we have a small
class this year

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.830
because of changes in the
institute with pass/fail types

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.360
of things, but Professor
Martin and Dr. Ray

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.020
and I consider this to be a
special opportunity for us

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.320
to run the course a little bit
differently with a few more

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.150
quirks and surprises.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.460
Because we have a
small number of you,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.290
we can listen to you all.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.180
We can get input from you.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.490
We can even get feedback
from you of something

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.650
you might like to see more of.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.280
And in general, we really want
to capture the sense of you.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.680
I have looked at the
registration list.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.320
We have people from every year.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.130
We have people from many,
many different disciplines.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.250
So this is what we're going to
do today after we I start doing

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.310
some introductions and so on.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.060
We're going to talk
about the nitty gritty

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.560
of the organization.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.820
We need to tell you this.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.190
We need to convey this
information to you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.000
clearly about when exams are,
and what requirements are,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.480
and how to do well in this
course without even realizing

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.980
it, that kind of thing.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.940
And then I'll take you through
this sort of fast track

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.520
through molecules to
man, all the way down

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.250
to cells and
organisms, to show you

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.260
that there was a breakpoint
in the 1950s where

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.970
the structure, the
non-covalent structure of DNA

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.620
was elucidated.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.420
And there was an
entire revolution

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.870
after that which makes
modern biology, the study

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.610
of modern biology, so entirely
different from the study

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.280
of biology in the
era before that.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.940
Biology used to be considered
taxonomy and dissection,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.950
like listing and looking at.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.200
But now biology, modern
biology, is a molecular science.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.160
So as we talk about these
topics, what you will see

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.750
is the blueprints for life are
common across domains of life.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.240
And if you learn
basic principles,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.510
you'll have an exponential
increase in your ability

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.780
to appreciate these
characteristics,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.940
that modern biology is
a synthesis of science,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.500
technology, engineering,
where all the tools from those

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.560
disciplines, different
disciplines-- physics, math,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.850
computation--

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.540
funnel into modern biology to
make what we know now feasible,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.600
and that's a dramatic and
fantastic opportunity for all

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.180
of you moving forward
in your careers.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.500
Now I want to
introduce the team.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.110
So I'm Barbara Imperiali.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.140
I'm a faculty member in
chemistry and biology,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.160
and I'm really interested
in chemical biology,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.350
glycobiology, biophysics.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.520
I love to tease apart
complex pathways in organisms

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.530
where you biosynthesize very
unusual glycol conjugate that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.130
are very important for cell-cell
communication and host cell

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.650
pathogen communication,
for example.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.690
I was trained as
an organic chemist.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.840
In fact, I did my
PhD degree at MIT

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.450
about five million years ago
on a sort of current scale.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.410
So my co-instructor
is professot--

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.721
sorry about this, but
they want us on video.

00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:41.900
ADAM MARTIN: Hello.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.900
I'm Professor
Martin, and my lab is

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.130
interested in how cells
generate mechanical forces

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.830
and how this is involved
in sculpting tissues

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.850
during development.

00:03:55.388 --> 00:03:57.680
BARBARA IMPERIALI: So what
Adam hasn't told you is he's

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.230
a cell biologist,
a biophysicist,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.650
and he's a lot better
at genetics than I am.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.540
Our instructor is Dr. Diviya
Ray who's been with this course,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.060
now this is the
sixth year, and she

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.990
is trained in immunology,
cancer biology, and also

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.820
cellular signaling.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.410
But what you can't
tell from that

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.010
is how dedicated she is to
each and every one of you.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.420
If you have any trouble in the
semester, just contact Dr. Ray

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.590
and say, I need some help,
be it a particular problem

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.260
in the material, or there's
just something come up

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.100
that makes it difficult for you
to do your best in the course.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.940
She will help you.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.930
She'll work out mechanisms to
get you through troubled spots.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.020
So let's get going here.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.330
Now, what I want to
try to do is just

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.820
give you sort of a
flavor of where we're

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.380
going to within the course
by starting with a few bullet

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.230
points and topics just
that I can sort of

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.830
pique your interest.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.700
So as I mentioned
before, studying biology

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.930
in the 21st century is
a fabulous opportunity.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.260
No matter what
discipline you come from,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.480
you can add to the expertise
that will move biology forward.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.150
Biology would not
be where it is today

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.140
in the absence of science,
engineering to promote it

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.660
and to support
progress in biology.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.360
So you really want
to realize that,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.470
that you have an opportunity.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.132
You may say, well, I'm in
this discipline or other.

00:05:30.132 --> 00:05:32.090
I don't think biology is
going to have anything

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.140
to do with my future career
or career opportunities.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.360
But it has a lot to
do with your life.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.540
It has a lot to do with
understanding health

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.860
and disease, understanding
new scientific discoveries

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.060
and developments.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.660
So it's so important
that you, as a scholar

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.830
of the 21st century, have a
good grasp on these materials.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.650
And we're not trying to feed
you anything dull and boring.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.450
This is really exciting stuff,
because the level of complexity

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.520
that we can study nowadays--

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.240
whole genomes, whole organisms
at a molecular level--

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.900
is amazing.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.670
It's amazing.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.560
We're not just
peering down a slide

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.350
and looking at one
cell or something.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.110
We will be able to
do full descriptions.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.820
So what we'll try to
give you is a view

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.590
of the fundamental
principles that are

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.150
common to all living organisms.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.330
So the study of
biology, some people

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.480
are microbiologists, or
eukaryotic biologists,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.770
or human biologists,
or they study virology.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.920
But we're going to build for
you, in the first few weeks

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.430
of class, information on
the common building blocks

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.610
that go across all
domains of life.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.270
Because once you start to
learn about those molecules,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.180
the build up, the
macromolecules of life,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.170
then you'll start to really gain
an understanding how amazing it

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.140
is that these same
sets of molecules

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.680
function across from
bacteria to man.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.315
So you learn the rules for
the simplest organisms.

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:08.690
You look at the
molecules and you

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.680
see how form fulfills function,
which is something I'm really

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.630
excited about,
and then you'll be

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.490
able to apply it as we get
ever more complex systems which

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.740
demand a lot of attention.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.400
So there's a common
molecular logic

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.790
of very complex processes.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.900
Motivations-- I just
mentioned a few.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.680
Sure, you want to understand
health and disease.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.380
You want to understand
what might be going on

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.180
with current therapies.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.510
When you have a relative
who's been diagnosed

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.140
with a serious disease, what
are the current opportunities?

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.130
What's coming down?

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.820
What sorts of opportunities
for therapy might be available?

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.770
Because there are
so many diseases now

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.270
we understand at
a molecular level.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.230
We may not understand
how to treat them yet,

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.110
but we understand
what their origin is,

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:05.000
and that's why molecular
approaches are so important.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.550
You may often hear
of words like systems

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.980
biology and synthetic biology.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.520
These are kind of jazzy words
for fairly straightforward

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.090
things.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.880
Systems biology is a
little bit like treating

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.710
an organism or a cell as an
electrical network, a wiring

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.360
diagram.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.250
What proteins talk
to what proteins?

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.050
What are downstream functions?

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.570
Where are signals amplified?

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.070
And so on.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.760
So that's systems
biology at its heart,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.130
quantifying different
intermediates

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.530
in a complex map of the cell.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.679
Synthetic biology is
about using biology

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:42.350
to make stuff, which
is really cool.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.020
Many, many important molecules
can be made in the lab,

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.760
but it's so much more effective
to make them in an organism.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.520
People are doing what they
call synthetic biology,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.680
and that's exploiting
and harnessing

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.350
nature to make things that
are useful for mankind.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.720
And all the way
through, what I just

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.930
want to emphasize how
integrating technology

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.020
and engineering for
science is really

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.640
what we're all about
here, because we

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.400
appreciate we couldn't make
the progress without it.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.120
There are also issues
general biology impacts

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.840
that are in the social
sciences and impinge

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.230
on things like ethics,
designer babies,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.550
cloning people, cloning your
pets, all kinds of things,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:35.020
treating a disease through
genetics or not, [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.950
some of these new innovations.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.780
But you really
need to understand

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.120
ethical issues
related to them to be

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.450
able to explain to your
parents, or your grandparents,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.900
or your sister or brother who
hasn't taken biology, what

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.510
the implications of
some of the things

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.430
that we can do in
biology, but probably we

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.530
shouldn't do in biology.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.220
And we will welcome your
thoughts on some of that

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.700
later on.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.230
OK.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.110
So where did the world start?

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.330
Arguably four and a
half billion years ago

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.250
is kind of a vague
theme, but it started

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.190
with the world, the earth,
being a ball of fire,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.740
and it took quite a
while for it to cool down

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.140
to establish the hydrosphere and
the globe as it's known today.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.620
There was a period of time known
as the prebiotic world, where

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.890
there were not living
organisms that replicated,

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:29.450
and that was basically a world
where building blocks started

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.110
to evolve out of
fiery hot mud pits

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.380
and in volcanoes and
goodness knows where.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.510
People believe that
the building blocks

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.540
of life, just the
molecules, came together

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.300
from things like hydrogen
cyanide, or sulfide,

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.060
or other primordial
components that

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.400
were in the primordial soup.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.190
There was a phase known as the
pre-RNA world, where the RNA

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.600
building blocks were around.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.890
There's reasonable arguments
in favor of the RNA world,

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.080
where a lot of
functions were catalyzed

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.290
not by proteins, but by
nucleic acids, specifically

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.460
ribonucleic acids.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.870
So it's a period of
time still pre-biotic

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:19.160
that had the first pre-RNA,
and then RNA world.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.800
But then things really
started to get interesting

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.710
when the first cells evolved.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.270
Now, I will talk a little bit
about this in the next class,

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.580
because the thing
that's critical to be

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.690
able to build a cell is to be
able to build a wall around it.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:41.090
So very, very early on in life
lipid bilayers, membranes,

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.770
evolved in order to make
compartmentalized structures

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.890
where you could differentiate
the in from the out.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.970
And so much of life is
completely reliant on the fact

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.200
that we're made of cells.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.100
We're not just one big sort
of bucket of water with things

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.330
floating around in it.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.660
Because so much of function
becomes coordinated

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.930
by cellular compartmentalization
through things

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.070
known as lipid bilayers, which
are semi-permeable membranes.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.870
Oxygen can move across.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.810
Some small hydrophobic
things can move across.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.050
But a lot of things get
either stuck in or stuck out.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.800
So we'll talk a lot about that.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.820
So the first prokaryotes
were cyanobacteria.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.980
They're photosynthetic bacteria.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:30.200
It was quite a long time until
those unicellular organisms

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.680
that totally lacked a nucleus,
lacked a lot of intracellular

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.580
compartmentalization,
evolved to eukaryotes,

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.630
and those cells are different.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.890
They're 100 or
1,000 times bigger.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:43.970
They're complex.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.710
They're compartmentalized.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.600
They can do a lot of functions.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.710
In a full organism they're
very differentiated,

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.070
and they may look different
in muscle, or in heart,

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.120
or in skin, or in bone.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.020
And so those eukaryotes-- so
that's a long gap of time,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.440
but there was a lot
going on in that phase.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.620
And about a half a billion
years ago, multicellular life

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.550
evolved.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.250
And multicellular life
now can be looked at,

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.070
if we think of the
evolution of homo sapiens,

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.000
can be thought of as something
that we can keep track of a bit

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.260
through fossil records over
the last five million years,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.900
where the first
humanoid life evolved.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.520
Then you got sort
of to a stage--

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.750
I think he's homo ergaster, that
this sort of Shrek-like person

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.680
evolved quite early on.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:37.400
And then the humanoids gradually
became different, evolved.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.710
In some cases there were
branches of the tree

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.750
of evolution and dead ends.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.060
In other places
there was a branch

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.410
that carried on for a while.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.160
For example, the neanderthal
and homo sapiens kind of

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.170
kept on evolving for a while.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.820
But there's a lot
of developments

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.730
that have been characterized
from the fossil record.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.360
But now there's a lot of belief
that if we trace things back

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.170
through genomes, we might
get more precise information

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.310
on steps in evolution.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.620
Now, the evolution of the
advanced, if you will,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.170
hominids really came along
with a number of things.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:17.150
There was a stage at which a
particular gene, the FOXP gene,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.400
is attributed to the
ability for complex speech.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.320
And that could have been a
leap forward when humanoids

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.510
could communicate
more, and it seems

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.520
to be associated with that.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.250
But there are other sort
of sociological functions,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.160
like burying the dead,
or making jewelry,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.670
or making tools, that are
associated with the more

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.350
evolved organisms.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:43.580
There are other types of things
like cranial capacity, standing

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.380
upright, looking forward.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:50.000
A lot of things came through
those years of the evolution

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.960
of homo sapiens.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.410
So it's fascinating
to think about that

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.490
and to think what light
genetics can shed on those five

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.280
million years of evolution.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.710
Now, the world of biology
took a mega kick start

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.050
with the elucidation
of the human genome,

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:12.140
but more importantly
of the technology

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:17.820
necessary to solve the map
of the whole human genome.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.030
In 2001 there was
a major development

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.450
with the publication of the
first map of the human genome.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.540
It's fascinating to
think with humans,

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.680
we humans have about
three billion genes,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.070
but there's only across human--

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:34.680
is that right?

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.460
No, sorry.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.780
Base pairs, yes.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.190
Thank you very much.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.420
But across humankind
there's enormous diversity,

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:49.420
but that's accounted for by only
about 0.1% of the diversity.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.450
So you can see people
look very, very different,

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:57.210
but we still share
99.9% of our genome.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.660
Another very interesting thing
is that genomes vary in size

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.413
quite considerably.

00:16:03.413 --> 00:16:04.830
Before I move
forward, I just want

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.320
to quickly show you this map.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:15.120
I mentioned tracing evolution
through a molecular clock,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.230
so looking back in time not by
following the shape of a skull,

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.020
for example, or
physiologic changes,

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.340
but looking at genomes using
the genome as a molecular clock

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.090
based on mutation rates that are
fairly constant amongst domains

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.750
of life.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.570
You couldn't compare a
human and a bacterium,

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.050
but you can go back through
a lot of eukaryotic evolution

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.340
and see where
divergence has happened.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.280
So in this map, you can see that
human and neanderthal diverged

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.010
from the chimpanzee
a certain time ago,

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.430
which had diverged from the
gorilla further ago based

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.650
on the molecular clock
that's available.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.390
OK.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.550
So now I want to talk
a little bit more

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.460
about getting into the
details of the genome.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.610
So genomes differ
greatly in size.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.450
Our genome includes about
three billion base pairs

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.589
in our 22 chromosomes plus
the X and Y chromosome,

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:13.530
but the typical genome
of a model bacterium

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.150
has only five
million base pairs.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.240
So far, far smaller,
more tangible,

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.900
more easy to study,
because those genes

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.560
are more limited in
size, but the genome size

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.500
is not necessarily
proportionate to the number

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.890
of genes that are expressed
and made into proteins.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:37.830
A fascinating discovery is
that of the three billion base

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:43.950
pairs, only about 1.5% to 2%
actually code for proteins,

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.920
and there's a ton
of interest now

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.320
in what's the rest of
the genome doing there.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.530
Where did it come from?

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.663
What's its function?

00:17:51.663 --> 00:17:53.580
There are different
functions that Eric Lander

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.910
calls the dark matter of the
genome, different functions

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.650
to the rest of the genome.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.050
But the part that we
focus on is the part

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.870
that gets encoded
into proteins that

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.250
form the functions of
the molecules of life.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.650
So we're going to focus
ourselves in on those.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:12.240
But here you see differences
in sizes of genomes

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.930
based on base pair.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.490
But what's fascinating is
despite this huge breadth

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.960
of sizes and huge
differences in organisms,

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.610
the building blocks
are the same.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.570
And that's what I think is the
wonderful part of what we're

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:32.610
able to teach you is, we
can take you from the 1950s

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:37.170
when the structure of double
stranded DNA was first solved.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.810
Now, there were 60, 70,
or more years of work

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.630
before that where they
figured out the pieces,

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.090
they figured out the
chemistry, the covalent bonds,

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.120
and the bases, and the sugars,
and the phosphodiester.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:54.240
But they had no clue how the
DNA could encode and program

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.310
the synthesis of a protein.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:01.380
But once the structure, the
three-dimensional structure

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.840
of double-stranded
DNA was solved--

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.630
this is this beautiful
anti-parallel structure that

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.800
you see here--

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.070
by Watson, Crick, and
Rosalind Franklin,

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.198
then the clues came pouring in.

00:19:14.198 --> 00:19:16.740
Without that structure, without
the structure of what's known

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.250
as the non-covalent structure--
not the covalent structure,

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.000
you'll see all those
building blocks--

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.580
but the non-covalent
structure, how

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.000
you could zipper apart
the two strands of DNA

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.480
and make copies of both of
them and replicate DNA and then

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.450
go forward.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.750
That was an amazing
step forward,

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.360
and for that, there was
a Nobel Prize awarded.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.550
Unfortunately it was
after Franklin's death.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:44.260
So it was given to Watson
and Crick and a third person.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.780
Now, here's has that
structure of DNA.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.960
I could sort of watch it
for hours to be honest.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.620
The phosphodiester background--
backbone going up the back,

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.130
and the bases base
pairing across.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.290
And these are the key steps
that happened from the '50s.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.900
So in the definite--
after the definition

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.140
of the double stranded
structure, it took a few years,

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.290
but they cracked what's
known as the genetic code.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:13.930
How does that DNA get
converted into a protein?

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:17.260
What happens is you make
an RNA copy of the DNA.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.110
And the RNA is read
to make a protein.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.600
And you will learn about
all those components.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.060
But that was another
real landmark.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.240
Then what was really exciting
is that some technology

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.390
companies started
figuring out, first, there

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.750
were very slow ways
to sequence DNA.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.560
But in the-- and that
happened in 1977.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.950
But what was really important
is about a decade later,

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.140
where the ability
to sequence DNA

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.680
was not done anymore
using huge agarose gels

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.570
and a bucket of radioactivity.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.090
But it was done through
using fluorescence,

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:56.560
in order to allow you to
read out the sequence of DNA.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.750
And you will learn about that.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.900
And in 1987, the
instruments were

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.770
commercialized, major, major
technology and engineering.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.110
We wouldn't be
anywhere without that.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.620
In 1990, the Human
Genome Project began.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:16.300
In '01, the draft of the human
genome sequence was completed.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.940
2010, you could
sequence a single strand

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.940
of DNA, one molecule of DNA.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.530
And now there's so
many initiatives

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.680
that have come out of that.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.550
And so much amazing
technology that has evolved.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.760
So things like the
1,000 Genomes Project

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.757
to look at variation
across man, so all people

00:21:34.757 --> 00:21:36.340
from all different
parts of the world.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.660
You can look up that website.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.760
That's very cool.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.310
The Human Cell Atlas, there
was quite a bit of news

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.460
about that in MIT
Technology News,

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.420
where Aviv Regev is playing
a major part in that,

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.210
to actually sequence
representatives

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:58.210
from all of your trillions of
cells and see how they differ.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.710
And then there's cancer genome
projects and precision medicine

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.710
sequence every type
of cancer cell,

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.540
find out what's
different about it,

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.940
and precisely figure
out how to treat

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.130
it, all very exciting things.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.620
And then of course, there's
synthetic genomes, where

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.410
you can literally build
a cell and its genome,

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.163
program it to do what
you want, hopefully.

00:22:20.163 --> 00:22:21.580
And then there's
one of the things

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.413
that your generation
will have to deal with,

00:22:23.413 --> 00:22:24.640
and that's all the data.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.640
Because we've just found
ways to churn it out.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.730
But you guys are going to have
to do the heavy lifting there.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.720
So DNA, then, looking
at that structure,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.150
is packaged into cells.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.340
So figure this one out.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:44.740
Each human cell has 1.8
meters of DNA in it,

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.900
yet it fits into a cell that's
10 to 100 microns in diameter.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.090
And it's bundled tightly up.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.500
So you'll learn how DNA in cells
gets bundled up and wrapped

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.100
around proteins that
neutralize the negative charges

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.970
of the double stranded DNA with
positively charged proteins

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:05.470
and enable packaging.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.690
So we will talk
about all of this.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.640
When is DNA unraveled?

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.860
What signals its unraveling?

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.130
Because in order to copy
it, you've got to unpack it.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.310
So these are a lot
of details about DNA

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.040
that you'll be able to sort of
have much more sense of as we

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.620
move forward.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.870
Cells are different in size.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:30.070
I just mentioned to you
a typical eukaryotic cell

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.840
is about 10 to 100
microns in diameter.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.950
A typical bacterial cell
is about 1 to 10 microns.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.380
So there is a vast
difference in sizes

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.860
for these simple cells
that have no nucleus,

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.580
relative to the cells
that are compartmentalized

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.470
and perform a lot of functions.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:54.190
So we will learn to appreciate
that difference in size,

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.010
looking at the building blocks
that go into all of them,

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.700
but then understanding
how big cells have

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.210
to have a lot more
complexity in their signaling

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.580
in order to establish
their functions

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.970
but also interact with
other cells in multicellular

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.920
organisms.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.380
We're still doing
fine for time, yes.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.500
The other thing that we will
spend several classes on

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.820
is imaging and visualization
of things going on in cells.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.640
So what we'll talk to you
about is the discovery

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.670
of fluorescent proteins,
which have provided

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.150
an unparalleled opportunity
to label proteins

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:35.050
within living organisms in
order to track what they do.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.630
And through the efforts
of protein engineers,

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.050
there is an entire panel
of colored proteins that

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.610
fluoresce at
different wavelengths

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:48.910
that we can use to study biology
in live systems, in real time.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.180
These slides show you
a little bit of that.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.600
I love these pictures, just
showing a dividing cell.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.080
Where the chromosomes you
see red because the histones

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.420
are labeled with red
fluorescent protein,

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.260
and all that green fuzzy
stuff are microtubules around.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.250
We can do this now.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:09.960
You couldn't do this 15 years
ago, observe these changes.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.110
We can also look at changes
as cells divide and go

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:14.610
through the cell cycle.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.470
One of my favorites
is this where

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:21.420
of going through the stages
to program a cell to divide,

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.390
a new protein gets made,
and then it settles down.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.170
But then when you go to divide
again, you keep making--

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:32.160
you cyclically make
different sets of proteins.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.060
And you can observe them
in real time dividing.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.790
So just think if you were trying
to make a chemotherapeutic

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.980
where you wanted to
stop cell division,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.830
or you wanted to inhibit
one of those proteins,

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.170
you could literally
watch it function.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.490
Does it get in to cell?

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.980
Does it disrupt the normal
pattern of cell division?

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.713
So these are capabilities that
are now, really are available.

00:25:55.713 --> 00:25:57.130
So I've talked to
you about cells.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:00.210
But I'm going to pass you
over to Professor Martin

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.255
for a little bit-- you'll get
a little bit of a sense of how

00:26:03.255 --> 00:26:03.840
he thinks.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.480
And then I'll do the wrap up.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.170
PROFESSOR MARTIN: Thank you.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.340
So this is one of my
favorite model organisms.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:22.270
This is a fruit fly, at
larger than real size.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:27.970
And so one topic that
I'll start on when

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:32.140
I start lecturing either
at the end of this month

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.040
or beginning of October is
we'll talk a lot about genetics.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.640
And one thing we'll start
on is pioneering research

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.900
done in this system to
establish the chromosome

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.790
theory of inheritance.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:46.740
OK.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.140
And we'll talk about the
importance in model organisms

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.900
in discovering new biology.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.150
But in addition to
that, I also want

00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:00.280
to talk about how genetics will
affect you guys as you go on

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.020
and graduate from MIT and
go into your own careers.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.440
Because genetics is really
playing an important role

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.270
in all our lives.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:14.170
And already, you
guys have the option

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.310
to get your DNA
genotyped, right.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:23.140
There are lots of companies now
like 23andMe and Ancestry.com

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.270
where you can get
your DNA genotyped.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:28.660
And you can learn
about your ancestry.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.050
You can learn about whether
you might be predisposed

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.790
towards certain diseases.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:40.480
And so in order to appreciate
the data you get back

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.240
from these companies, you really
have to understand something

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.740
about genetics.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.250
And another thing which
I find very fascinating

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.860
are ethical issues that come
up with the use of such sites.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.890
And you might have seen this
in the news last semester.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.330
Both forensic experts
and police identified

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:05.410
a suspect in a killing
that happened 40 years ago.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:11.650
And this was in part due to
using the suspect's family

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:12.430
tree.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.690
OK.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.760
And so they used the family
tree, you know, some--

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.720
you know, this guy's relatives
had done one of these

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.350
Ancestry.com's.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:25.810
And they used the
information from DNA

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.330
acquired from other
individuals to track down

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.130
this other individual.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:32.150
OK.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.030
So one thing that I
find incredibly exciting

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:39.260
about biology is that
it is truly dynamic.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.160
OK.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.260
And this is a human neutrophil.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.700
And it's just a bright
field microscopy.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.370
Nothing's labeled.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.660
And what you're
seeing here is this--

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.930
this neutrophil is chasing
after this bacterium.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.600
And it illustrates
another concept

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.290
that we'll talk about in this
course, which is signaling.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.440
So this neutrophil
is receiving a signal

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.800
from this bacteria that
tells it where it is.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.230
And it's then able to chase that
bacterium and track it down.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.870
And there you see it
just got the bacterium.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:13.990
OK.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:19.000
So we'll talk about dynamic
processes that cells do

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.200
and how that's important
for their function.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.880
In addition to
considering single cells,

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.660
we also want to understand
how entire organisms

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.370
and tissues work.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.950
And I want to
emphasize that, yes,

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.700
we have sequence-- or
researchers have sequenced

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.080
the human genome and the genomes
of many different organisms,

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.890
OK.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.210
And that's great, right.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.790
We have this data set.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.080
But we still don't understand
how all the components that

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.900
are in the genome
are wired together

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.500
and work in order to create
a complicated organism

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.900
like ourselves.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.720
OK.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.660
And so one aspect of
that, which is mysterious,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.890
is how does the
genome encode shape?

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:05.590
OK.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.900
How do we get our
shape, and how do we

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.980
get the shape of our organs?

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.940
And this is something that
my lab is interested in.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.400
And so this is a
fruit fly embryo.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.830
And you can see at
the beginning here,

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.260
this is three hours
into development.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:26.190
You just have a smooth
surface for this embryo.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.760
But during development,
this changes.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.520
And I'm just showing
you here a cross-section

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.470
of the same embryo.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.130
And you see, it's
a sheet of cells

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.480
that surrounds a central yolk.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:37.980
OK.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.070
And this changes three
hours into development,

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:47.570
because a population of about
1,000 cells in this organism

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.260
fold to form a crease.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:49.760
OK.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.490
So this is a dramatic shape
change for this embryo.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.740
It goes from being
a single layer

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.910
to now having multiple layers.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.810
So this is a time
course here, showing you

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:02.630
how cells change
shape in this tissue

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.030
and how this leads
to what's initially

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:09.440
a single layer of cells to
become two layers of cells.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.820
And this process is similar
to morphogenetic events

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.160
that happen in human embryos.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:21.350
But we can study this in fruit
fly embryos or many other model

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:25.430
systems, in order to try to
understand mechanistically

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.150
how this happens.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.490
So again, this is dynamic.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.830
And I want to show you
a movie that shows you

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.670
the dynamics of this process.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.620
So now this is an embryo
that's been labeled

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.540
with some of these
fluorescent proteins

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.400
that Professor Imperiali
just introduced.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.730
One's green, that's the--

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.080
and it's shown here in green.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.810
And the other is a red
fluorescent protein in red.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.410
The red fluorescent protein
is marking individual cells.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:58.280
The green protein is a motor
protein that generates force.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.360
And what you see is, where
the motor protein is,

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.910
this is where the
tissue contracts.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.150
And this is where
the tissue folds.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.270
OK.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.410
And so because we're able to
see these proteins in action,

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:16.110
we can infer how they're
functioning during development

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:22.470
to essentially
program tissue shape.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.540
And there are many
other opportunities

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.880
where, even though
we have the genome,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.170
we still don't understand
how collectives of proteins,

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.380
or collectives of cells,
are sort of interacting

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:39.600
with each other to sort of
create emergent properties that

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.080
are what are responsible
for patterning something

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.540
as large as a human.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.050
Another thing that we'll talk
about is how cells divide.

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.450
And this is another
fruit fly embryo.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.940
And it's labeling histones.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.040
So it labels the DNA.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.920
And so you're seeing nuclei
here divide sequentially.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.490
There'll be one more division.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:04.730
And then it's going to stop.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:05.230
OK.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.170
And my point here is
that cell division

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:12.850
during development and in adults
is under exquisite control.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.320
OK.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.930
And a breakdown
of this control is

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.550
important in the
progression of cancer.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.860
So we're going to talk about
how cells control whether or not

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:29.920
they divide, and how this
is impacted in cancer cells.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.530
I also want to point
out that this video is

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:37.284
from Eric Wieschaus who is
at Princeton University.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.240
OK.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.407
Want to just hit the lights.

00:33:42.407 --> 00:33:45.580
I have one last thing
just to mention.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.970
So I just want to reinforce
what Professor Imperiali said,

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.740
we have a small class.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.770
So this is really an
opportunity to have

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:57.520
this be more interactive
than it would be if we had

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.230
like 300 people in the class.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:06.070
So I want to really encourage
you guys to ask questions.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:09.350
Also if you have ideas, we
would love to hear them.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:14.199
And I want to try one
new thing this semester.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.690
So I find that students
are a little hesitant

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.610
to come to my office hours.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:23.000
So this year I want to hold
what I'm calling running hours.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:30.560
So one thing that I really
like to do is I like to run.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.949
And I've noticed that
many of my students

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.650
are also runners, because
I'll like see them out

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:38.300
around the river.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.920
And so I just want to hold
sort of weekly running hours.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:48.580
I'm going to choose 3 o'clock,
not three hour run, all right,

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.000
3:00 PM on Fridays.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.450
And we'll just
meet in my office.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.990
And so if you like to run,
you can just meet there.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.560
We'll go on a run
around the Charles.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.140
And this is not a
competitive event.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.900
I'm not some fitness nut.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:13.610
I ran home last week, and I
ate half a bag of Swedish fish

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:14.630
on the way.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:17.000
So it's not a competition.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.430
It's just to try to
get to know you guys

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:24.123
and to try to break the ice
in sort of a non-academic way.

00:35:24.123 --> 00:35:25.040
BARBARA IMPERIALI: OK.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.040
So I'm just going
to wrap up here.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.590
So we bombed you with quite
a lot of-- yes, over there.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.090
You want to know
more about running.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.787
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:34.787 --> 00:35:36.870
AUDIENCE: Will you still
have normal office hours.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:39.850
PROFESSOR MARTIN: Yeah I'll
have normal office hours.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.840
Yeah, or you could
join me at CrossFit

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.870
if you would like as well.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.870
We will both have office
hours, and we will post them.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.840
And we welcome you to come
visit us and, you know,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.760
find out more, tell us
more about yourselves.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.990
We are fountains of information.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:00.660
So basically over the
first half of the course,

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.840
we tend to cover foundations.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.240
And so we build on biochemistry,
one of my favorite subjects,

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.840
where we cover all of
the molecules of life.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.270
What are all the bits it takes
to make a cell, lipids, sugars,

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.310
proteins, nucleic acids.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:18.560
Then we synthesize
them all together,

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.650
where we show, in
molecular biology,

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:24.980
how the genome
encodes the proteome,

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.740
and what happens to the
proteome after that.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.350
So you'll see me for
all of those lectures.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:34.700
Then I will hand you over to
Professor Martin for genetics,

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:38.630
for the learning how
to manipulate DNA.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:41.570
And we'll cap-off this
first phase of work

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.000
with cell signaling
and understanding

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.580
much more about
dynamics of cells,

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.010
as opposed to static
building blocks.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.950
But you've got to understand
the building blocks before you

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.870
can understand the complexity.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.830
That's why I really like
to cover those molecules

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.030
at a reasonable depth.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.710
It's kind of
ridiculous, 4 classes.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.970
But nevertheless,
that's how we start.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.540
For some of you, you've
seen some of it before.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.660
For others, you've
seen none of it before.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.310
It doesn't matter.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.160
We will give you
our flavor on it.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.110
If your chemistry
is a little weak,

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.640
I suggest you read the textbook.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.600
There's a couple of sections
on just chemical covalent

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.790
and non-covalent
bonding, that you'll

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:25.280
need to do the first P set.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.470
If your chemistry is
strong, you're fine.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:29.900
If your chemistry is weak
and you need a little help,

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.700
I'll run an extra
session next week.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.160
We can take care of
every eventuality

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.290
because you're a smaller class.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.390
And then we'll
take it from there.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.300
And then what I
really want to do

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.490
is encourage you
to do the reading.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.340
Make sure you're
in a recitation.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.260
And next time, but
it's in the sidebar,

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.930
I'd like you to take a look
at the sliding scale which

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:54.710
shows you the dimensions of
molecules, macromolecules,

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:58.280
and organisms, which I find
rather cool, even though it's

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.090
probably built for
high school students.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:00.590
OK.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.010
That's it from us for now.

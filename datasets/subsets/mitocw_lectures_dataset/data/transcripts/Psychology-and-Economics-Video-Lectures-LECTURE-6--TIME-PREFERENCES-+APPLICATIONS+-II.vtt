[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.916 --> 00:00:03.832
[RUSTLING]

00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:05.269
[CLICKING]

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.300
FRANK SCHILBACH: So the quizzes
are not meant to be difficult.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.170
They're mostly meant to provide
some incentives for you to, A,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.620
keep up with the class,
B, to do the reading, C,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.455
to come to class.

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:25.330
Are they actually a
commitment device or not?

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.388
Yes?

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:35.243
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:37.910
FRANK SCHILBACH: In general, are
the quizzes a commitment device

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.190
or not by the
definition that we had?

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.662
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:41.662 --> 00:00:42.870
FRANK SCHILBACH: Why is that?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.810
AUDIENCE: Because
we [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:49.970
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.317
But I guess one condition
that we have in the commitment

00:00:53.317 --> 00:00:55.650
device-- and that's more like
a question of definition--

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.350
is like it's chosen by the agent
to actually engage in this,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.070
and I guess you don't
have the choice.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.528
So in some sense,
if I offer to you

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:06.770
to choose quizzes versus not
and you could particularly only

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.960
do worse by doing the
quizzes, I could offer you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.180
the choice either you'd
always get 5 on the quizzes,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.240
or you can opt into
saying you do the quizzes,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.250
then you choosing the quizzes
would very much be a commitment

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.750
device.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.780
But if I sort of just
impose it on you,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.060
then, strictly
speaking, it is not,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.580
even though it sort of
functions in the exact same way

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.570
as if you had chosen it.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.750
OK.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.630
Mostly we are discussing
empirical questions

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.480
related to hyperbolic or
quasi-hyperbolic discounting.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.010
I want to have a
short intermezzo

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.990
very briefly about
sort of telling you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990
about how to solve problems with
quasi-hyperbolic discounting

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.420
in part because that's
relevant to the problems set.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.280
I already talked
with you briefly

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.800
about how do you deal
with fully naive agents

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.770
and how do you deal with
fully sophisticated agents.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.620
In some sense, it's fairly
simple in these two cases,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.990
in part because these are
special extreme cases.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.540
Now, the third case
is, what do you

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.700
do when you have a partially
naive decision-maker?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.009
And that's a little
trickier, and we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.440
tend to not have
that many problems

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.790
related to partially
naive decision-makers.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.480
[INAUDIBLE] is a
little tricky to do.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.670
So essentially, what
you do is you kind of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.250
do the same as you do for
the fully sophisticated

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.060
decision-maker.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.862
You do start by doing
backwards induction.

00:02:23.862 --> 00:02:25.320
You essentially
solve for what does

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.950
the person think they're
going to do in the future.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.720
For that-- I'm speechless.

00:02:41.013 --> 00:02:46.890
For that, what do you do is
you use people's beta hat,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.920
and beta hat is essentially
what the person believes

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.510
they will do in the future.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.050
And then, essentially, solve
using backwards induction what

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.730
the person thinks they will do.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.290
This is the exact
same thing as you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.630
do for a sophisticated
person, except for that you're

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.460
using now people's
beta hat as opposed

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.428
to people's actual beta.

00:03:04.428 --> 00:03:06.720
The difference is, of course,
it's always the beta hat.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.120
It just happens to be for
the sophisticated person

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.678
that the beta hat
actually is the beta.

00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:13.470
So then, essentially,
you start at the end.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.460
You do backwards induction.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.380
You go back in time,
work yourself [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.735
period two, so then the
person using the beta hat

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:20.610
knows what they're going
to do in the future,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.902
thinks they know what they're
going to do in the future

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.607
starting in the next period.

00:03:24.607 --> 00:03:26.940
Then you're going to start
solving for the first period,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.040
like what is the person
actually going to do?

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.190
For that, what you need is
the person's actual beta

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.940
because that's essentially
what determines

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.130
people's actual choices.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.780
And then you go
to the next period

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.100
and do exactly the same thing.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.850
Again, you do sort of
backwards induction.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.950
You already have solved
that from the previous step.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.780
But then, essentially,
in period two,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.210
then, the person actually
uses again their actual beta

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.980
for making their decisions.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.260
So the beta hats are
guiding people's beliefs

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.340
about what they think they
will do in the future,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.048
but then you have to
go back and actually

00:03:56.048 --> 00:03:57.820
look at what does the
person actually do.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.900
And that often
differs, in particular

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.780
when you get to like period two,
three, and four in the future.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.604
Sorry, this is not--

00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:15.470
The second thing I
wanted to say is--

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.470
and this is mostly relevant
for problem set two.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.019
So far, we have essentially
looked at continuous choices.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.670
It's like going to
a movie versus not,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.680
or at some point you have
like one movie that you can go

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.388
to which essentially
is sort of following

00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:29.420
the O'Donaghue-Rabin
papers and examples.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.977
You have one problem set you
need to do at some point.

00:04:31.977 --> 00:04:33.560
This is essentially
a discrete choice.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.720
Do you do it, or
do you not do it?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.780
Of course, many choices in
life so exactly like that,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.880
like, essentially, when
do you do the problem sets

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.310
and so on and so forth,
but other choices in life

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.210
are continuous consumption
savings or continuous choices.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.820
It's about like how much do you
eat, how much do you consume,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.810
and so on and so forth.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.200
And sort of the canonical
thing to do in economics

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.740
are consumption savings choices.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.990
You have some amount of money.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.100
You think about
how much should you

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.200
consume in this period,
how much should you save.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.040
There's an interest rate.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.082
You're going to get more
money than in the future

00:05:03.082 --> 00:05:05.360
if you save more and
so on and so forth.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.280
The same principles
here apply as well

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.450
except for now you're not
comparing discrete choices,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.950
but now you do, essentially,
[INAUDIBLE] conditions the same

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.040
what would you do in
any optimization problem

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.860
as you would do in
1401 or one or any sort

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.520
of intro micro class where,
essentially, you optimize

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.770
using [INAUDIBLE]
conditions, et cetera,

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.860
subject to some
budget constraint.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.200
In the recitation, you get
some additional guidance

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.253
how to do that, and
particularly, the TAs

00:05:35.253 --> 00:05:36.920
will walk you through
a previous problem

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.480
from like a few years
ago that essentially

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.910
is sort of doing exactly that.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.370
I just want to sort of flag
this so you're not surprised.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.240
This is essentially
sort of 1401 basics

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.100
that we discussed in
the first recitation.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.760
There's also some handout
on some refreshers for that,

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.270
but that'll come as well.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.820
But the same
principles apply here.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.600
That's exactly the same thing as
we do here in the other choices

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.230
that people make
except for now we

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.990
have, essentially,
continuous choices.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.100
Any questions on this?

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.570
OK.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.070
All right.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.278
So then we're going to talk
about other applications,

00:06:13.278 --> 00:06:18.390
starting with credit card teaser
rates or credit card behavior.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.430
This is an old paper
by Ausubel [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.680
You can have any concerns
about it, but in some sense,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.360
it's sort of nicely illustrates
very simple behaviors

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.880
that are very nicely fitting
into the quasi-hyperbolic

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.140
discounting model.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.405
So this is evidence from using
real-world credit card usage.

00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:36.780
So essentially,
there's a company

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.360
who has a bunch of data
on credit card usages,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.360
and as you might be aware,
credit card companies

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.443
send out all sorts of
mailers about getting people

00:06:44.443 --> 00:06:46.080
to sign up for a credit card.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.830
In particular, once you're
out of school and gainfully

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.920
employed, you get
all sorts of mailings

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.365
and so on asking you to
sign up for credit cards.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.890
Now, in this particular
example, the company

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.680
mailed out randomized
credit card offers

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.060
of the following types.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.620
There was like a
standard credit card

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.500
offer, which was a 6.9% interest
rate for six months and 16%

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.530
afterwards, so there's already,
in some sense, a teaser rate

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.810
built-in in the sense
it's starting to be looks

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.140
like it's really cheap.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.880
You might sort of think, oh, I'm
going to just bar for a month,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.762
and then eventually,
it gets more expensive.

00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.220
The hope of the
company, of course,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.610
is that you keep borrowing
from them once it actually

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.900
gets more expensive.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.090
And then there's two
randomized conditions.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.780
There's what they call
the teaser deal, which

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.000
is 4.9% followed by
16%, and then there's

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.750
what they call the
post-teaser deal, which

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.080
is 6.9% followed by 4%.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.570
Notice that if you borrow a
given amount for quite a while

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.540
and that these two conditions
are pretty much similar,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.640
depending a little bit
how long you borrow,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.040
if you borrow for
something like a year,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.892
then it's about
similar or the same.

00:08:00.892 --> 00:08:02.350
If you borrow for
more than a year,

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.280
then you know option
three is probably better

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.090
than option two for you for a
given amount that you borrow.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.880
But what the company
then has is response rate

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:17.310
and people's 20-month borrowing
history for individuals

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.205
who take up the card.

00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:19.830
Now, these are kind
of selected, so you

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.080
want to be a little bit
careful how to interpret that.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.452
But the response rates
surely are the right thing

00:08:25.452 --> 00:08:27.660
to look at because they'd
be randomized across people

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.040
who read which letter.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.890
What they find is
that the response rate

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.000
is about 2.5 times
larger increase

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.240
in take-up in the second
relative to the third group.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.580
Now, given subsequent
borrowing behavior-- and that's

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.480
kind of endogenous.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.397
You want to be a little
bit careful with that.

00:08:44.397 --> 00:08:46.830
But essentially, if you
look at people's behavior,

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.687
the latter is a
much better deal.

00:08:49.687 --> 00:08:51.270
So you'd much rather
have-- as I said,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.590
you'd much rather have like
deal number three compared

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.460
to deal number two.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.160
And particularly, if you
borrow for, say, two years

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.180
like $1,000, you're going
to pay much more interest

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.370
in deal number two
compared to number three.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.677
Yes?

00:09:08.677 --> 00:09:11.010
Now how do we think about
this from the quasi-hyperbolic

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.790
discounting model?

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.123
How do we explain this behavior?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.501
Yes?

00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:35.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
one with the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:44.588 --> 00:09:45.880
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.600
So let me just
repeat what you said.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.200
So you said, people think they
will not borrow in the future,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.820
or they're like, I'm going
to borrow for a while.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.840
I'm going to borrow
for a few months.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.310
I just need some
money right now.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.000
In the future, surely
I'll be patient.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.840
I'll pay everything back,
and so it doesn't really

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.540
matter what the interest
rate is after six months.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.880
Therefore I'm just
going to optimize

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.120
according to the six-month
period that I see.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.668
The third deal is
cheaper than the second,

00:10:11.668 --> 00:10:12.710
so let me just pick that.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.430
And then so, surprise, people
actually then keep borrowing,

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.360
and it ends up being a lot
more expensive than it is.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.600
That's exactly right.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.610
That's what I have here as well.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.430
Now, if people are
sophisticated, why would

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.790
they choose option two?

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.200
Yes?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:41.187
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:41.187 --> 00:10:43.020
FRANK SCHILBACH: So
there's sort of the idea

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.330
that, essentially, if you
don't like your future self

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.450
to borrow, you might want to
actually choose a high interest

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.270
rate to protect you
from doing that.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.060
Now, that's a very
sophisticated type of behavior.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.540
My guess is, at
the end of the day,

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.208
that will not be
particularly successful

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:00.750
because, at the end of the day,
the 2% difference is probably

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.650
not making a huge difference.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.230
But in principle, the data are
sort of consistent with that.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.150
We cannot rule this out.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.310
Now, there's other issues
with like substitution

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.360
to other cards and so on,
so you might sort of--

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.160
that might backfire
in various other ways,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.090
but in principle, at least,
that's exactly right.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.340
Now, what evidence can
be collect to separate

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.170
these stories?

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.940
I show you this data from
the paper that they have.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.730
Now, as I'm telling
you, I can't really

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.070
disentangle these stories
because there's no other data

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:29.768
available.

00:11:29.768 --> 00:11:31.560
But what other data
would you want to know,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.560
would you like to collect
to sort of disentangle

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.940
from these two stories or
disentangle these two stories?

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.567
Yes?

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:43.770
AUDIENCE: Whether people
continued borrowing.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.710
FRANK SCHILBACH: So you could
look at their boring behavior,

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.710
and then what would you
conclude, or what data--

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.845
what would you--

00:11:50.845 --> 00:11:52.470
AUDIENCE: So if they
stopped borrowing,

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:57.145
that would imply they are
sophisticated and they continue

00:11:57.145 --> 00:11:58.067
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.880
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.920
I think a little
inconclusive in some sense,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.740
but yes, I think that's right.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.970
What else can we collect?

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:14.740
Yes?

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.984
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.790
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes, exactly.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.730
So if you ask people, what do
you think you're going to do,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.060
that would be helpful.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.910
And then in some
ways, it will also

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.760
be nice to have some form of
like demand for commitment.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.310
We don't quite have this
here because neither

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.520
of these options is
actually dominated.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.600
You could sort of tell
stories either way.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.170
But once you have
a dominated option,

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.540
the naive person would
not pick that anymore.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.180
I think it's also right that
looking at people's borrowing

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.530
behavior-- we can also learn
from that in some sense.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.810
It can't be that you keep
doing stuff that's bad for you

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.360
if you're really sophisticated.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.090
Sorry.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.568
So two things I think
that you can potentially

00:13:03.568 --> 00:13:05.360
collect clearcut evidence
to rule stuff out

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.663
is, one, collect beliefs
about for borrowing behavior.

00:13:11.663 --> 00:13:13.580
So there's one very nice
paper, a recent paper

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.520
by Hunt Allcott, and
Dmitry Taubinsky,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.820
and co-authors that looks
at payday borrowers.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.478
This is like payday lending at
really extremely high interest

00:13:22.478 --> 00:13:24.020
rates where people
essentially borrow

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.090
against their future
paycheck, and they keep

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.425
doing this over and over again.

00:13:27.425 --> 00:13:29.300
And what they do there--
they actually elicit

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.963
people's beliefs
and say, what do

00:13:30.963 --> 00:13:32.630
you think is the
probability that you're

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.200
going to borrow again?

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.800
You can ask several people
and then, essentially, just

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.750
look at what are
the actual beliefs--

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.000
sorry, what are the actual
borrowing rates, about what

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.730
fraction of people are actually
borrowing again compared

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.340
to the perceived fraction.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.440
And what they find, in
fact, is payday borrowers

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.217
seem to be quite sophisticated.

00:13:50.217 --> 00:13:51.800
So these are people
who actually know,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.860
I'm going to like borrow
again in two weeks from now

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.440
and so on, and I'm going to
roll it over and over again.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.553
Now, they also find that that
is more common among repeat

00:14:02.553 --> 00:14:04.220
borrowers, so like
somebody who has like

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.960
rolled his over five times--

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.717
they actually don't have a lot
of illusions of what they're

00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:09.800
going to do in the future.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.870
They know they're going
to roll it over again.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.453
When you look at people who are
like first-time or second-time

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:16.358
borrowers, things are different.

00:14:16.358 --> 00:14:17.900
There people tend
to think, I'm going

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.840
to do this only once
or twice, and then

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.710
they sort of surprised
themselves by borrowing again.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.210
That's consistent
with some story

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.202
of learning in a sense of they
can't really necessarily nail

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.910
that, but I think they
find, essentially,

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.300
that or they interpret
their evidence as people do

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.280
seem to be learning over time.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.430
They also offer some form
of commitment device.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:45.590
Essentially, they offer him to
say, if you don't borrow again,

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.020
we'll pay you $100
or versions of that.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.540
Or you have to pay or
you can forego money

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.560
if you commit to
not borrowing again.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.020
They also find some
evidence of that sort

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.540
of suggesting that, again,
these payday borrowers seem

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.400
to be quite sophisticated.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.990
Now, of course, it's
a different type

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.900
of sample, a different
type of population.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.010
So credit card people,
particularly who

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.280
got credit card mailings,
in particular, people

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.560
who just started their jobs
and so on and so forth,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.170
might be not as sophisticated.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.485
Now, if you are a credit card
company, what would you do?

00:15:18.485 --> 00:15:20.360
How would you react to
that kind of behavior?

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.318
Suppose you believed what
I showed you earlier,

00:15:22.318 --> 00:15:25.010
the evidence that I just showed
you about from the Ausubel

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.380
paper in terms of
people seem to be

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.340
either naive or sophisticated
quasi-hyperbolic discounters.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.020
What do you do as a
credit card company?

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.728
Whom do you target,
and how do you do it?

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.160
Yes?

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.920
AUDIENCE: Perhaps you could
map some kind of characteristic

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.610
of the person, maybe
demographics like education

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.640
or socio-economic
characteristics

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.310
with possible
naive/sophisticated

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:10.015
and then almost
price [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:10.015 --> 00:16:12.651
target each person based
on those characteristics.

00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:17.110
So the sophisticated person
would have the lower teaser

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.094
rate and then the higher
interest rate towards the end,

00:16:20.094 --> 00:16:23.198
and you could do the same
for those who are naive.

00:16:23.198 --> 00:16:24.240
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.310
So what you kind of want
to know in some sense--

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.530
you want to know who are
the naive people, who

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.105
are the people that we
can essentially exploit

00:16:32.105 --> 00:16:34.230
because the naive person
is the person who is going

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.140
to be the person who
signs up and then ends up

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.390
paying really high interest
rates surprisingly.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.280
So you can
essentially figure out

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.440
some ways of making a
lot of money from them.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.380
The exponential discounters or
even the sophisticated people--

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.050
they will not be helpful
for you because either they

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.420
will, essentially, just
optimize in some sense.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.620
They use some offers.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.540
They get some bonus
points or whatever

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.245
for signing up in
the first place

00:16:56.245 --> 00:16:57.870
and then essentially
just drop the card

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.190
and not use it anymore.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.230
Even a sophisticated
person you can't really

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.630
exploit that much
because if you could,

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.390
the sophisticated person
would understand that and then

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.849
would just not sign
up in the first place.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:12.750
And this is kind of the answer
to what Lauren just said about,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.359
if somebody if you can make a
lot of money from that person,

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.400
it can't be that
person is perfectly

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.890
sophisticated because
then, otherwise, the person

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.359
would never sign up
in the first place.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.145
Now, credit card
companies-- there's

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:27.270
some evidence, at least,
that credit card companies

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.820
do exactly what you just
said, which essentially

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.190
is-- so they don't have a
lot of information of people

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.600
that they actually mail to.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.560
The one thing that they have
is zip code-level information,

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.320
very often about education
and some other characteristics

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.980
from some other data sets.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.160
So there's a very
nice paper by Ru

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.990
and Antoinette Schoar at
Sloan, at MIT that looks at,

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.980
analyzes a detailed data set
of mailed credit card offers.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.480
So essentially,
there are people who

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.397
are paid to collect all
the mailings that they

00:17:56.397 --> 00:18:00.930
get from different companies,
and just collect them, and have

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.980
them analyzed.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.140
And there's sort of a data
set doing exactly that.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.200
And so what they
did is they analyzed

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.050
this data set
specifically and looked

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.560
at how some of the
details of these offers

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.140
relate to things like
education, zip code.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.020
So you look at sort of
education-level data,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.420
like where do the
highly-educated people,

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.760
and where do other
people live, and what

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.370
they find is that education
levels are systematically

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.420
related to things like
backloaded and hidden fees,

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.440
teasers, stuff that's
written in small font,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.840
having more photos, color
print, and so on and so forth,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.310
essentially a bunch
of stuff that's

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:43.385
trying to trick people into
things that are bad for them.

00:18:43.385 --> 00:18:44.760
So what the credit
card companies

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.718
are doing-- they're
essentially sort of saying,

00:18:46.718 --> 00:18:48.450
here's some stuff
that is exploiting

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.210
potentially naive customers.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.020
Now, you only want to send that
kind of stuff to naive people

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.010
or mostly to naive
or less sophisticated

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.740
customers, the reason being
that, A, it's costly to do it.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.860
So if you send it to people
who are exponential discounters

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.520
or who are more sophisticated,
you're just wasting money,

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.160
or they might actually
exploit your offer

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.125
by optimizing and getting good
deals out of it in some ways.

00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:16.500
So what do you
kind of want to do

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.870
is you want to focus
on the naive customers

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.540
and sort of exploit
them as much as you can.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.988
Now, actually, it's not that
you want to exploit them

00:19:23.988 --> 00:19:24.780
as much as you can.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.710
There are some constraints.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:26.960
What are the constraints here?

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.100
What is a credit card company,
in some ways, worried about?

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.600
Yes?

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.892
AUDIENCE: They want to make
sure that they can actually

00:19:32.892 --> 00:19:33.920
pay the [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.962
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:19:34.962 --> 00:19:36.890
So this is a pretty
cynical view of the world,

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.430
but I think it's a pretty
correct one in some ways, which

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.520
is, the credit card company
wants to exploit people

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.067
but only to the extent that
they can actually repay.

00:19:46.067 --> 00:19:47.900
The last thing the
credit card company wants

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.050
is for people to default, not
because a credit card company

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.300
actually cares about the
people who might default

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.380
but rather because
the credit card

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.172
company has, then,
trouble actually getting

00:19:56.172 --> 00:19:58.183
their money back.

00:19:58.183 --> 00:19:59.600
So there's,
essentially, some form

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.700
of a participation constraint.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.470
And so what Ru and Schoar find
is that, at times-- and maybe

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.650
this is suggestive evidence, but
it's pretty neat in some way.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:15.650
At times when unemployment
insurance from the government

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.780
increases, essentially,
as more people have

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.170
more money available, a lot
of these fees, et cetera

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.140
tend to be higher,
and so one way

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.060
to interpret that is,
essentially, there's

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.520
a participation constrained
if you want an optimization

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.020
problem.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.190
That is to say, they try
to exploit the customers,

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.075
but it's subject
to the constraint

00:20:33.075 --> 00:20:34.700
that the person
doesn't default or just

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.410
doesn't use the offers at all.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.630
Now, that participation
constraint

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.530
gets relaxed now that
people, due to unemployment

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:47.190
and other types of insurance,
have more money available,

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.240
so essentially, you
can exploit them more.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.970
This is sort of a
pattern, I think,

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.900
that's general for many cases.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.002
I think when you, for
example, think about gyms,

00:20:57.002 --> 00:20:58.460
you might sort of
say, well, people

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.470
choose in gyms the offers
that gyms give to people.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.127
In a way, they are meant
to exploit customers.

00:21:06.127 --> 00:21:08.210
Or do you really want what
I showed you last time?

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:12.620
You really want to offer people
these monthly fees or whatever?

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.870
Like you want people to
sign up but then actually

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.310
not show up very
much to your gym

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.950
because you have a
certain capacity.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.020
You'll then hit
your gym capacity.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.330
But some people might
say, well, why not just

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.060
ask people to give them
even more and more expensive

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.180
contracts that they sign up so
they really sort of-- to screw

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.920
them over more and more?

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.190
The problem is there's again
a participation constraint.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.890
If the person realizes, I'm
spending way too much money

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.140
on this and I'm not
actually going to the gym

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.685
ever, that person is
just going to quit.

00:21:41.685 --> 00:21:42.560
So you kind of want--

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.477
there's this game where,
essentially, you want

00:21:44.477 --> 00:21:45.920
your customer to be engaged.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.740
You want your customer to
come back sometimes and feel

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.870
good about going to the
gym sometimes and not

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.940
feel terrible about
not coming, so that's

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.400
why the gyms and other
companies are always

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.750
trying to be very motivating.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.280
We choose the best
contract for you.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.500
We're trying to help
you with this and that.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.080
But really, it's, in some
sense, making the appearance

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.570
of trying to help the
customers, keeping them happy

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.575
while you can exploit
them at the same time.

00:22:07.575 --> 00:22:09.450
Now, that's a very
cynical view of the world,

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.000
and I'm sure there are some
companies who are actually

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.205
care about their customers.

00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:13.580
But in some sense,
I think it can

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.193
explain quite a few patterns
that we see in the world.

00:22:17.193 --> 00:22:18.110
Any questions on this?

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.790
Or comments?

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.540
OK.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.680
So then next is--

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.040
and this is sort of, again,
almost like a classic paper now

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.900
because it's from
quite a while ago.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.570
It's a paper by Nava Ashraf and
colleagues in the Philippines.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.330
And these are clients
of a Philippine bank,

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:44.870
and they are randomized
into three different groups

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:49.940
to be receiving three different
kinds of savings product.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.620
The first one is essentially
like a very simple--

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.120
sorry.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.210
The first one, number three,
is like a control treatment,

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.080
or it's just a standard
savings account.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.660
Here's an account
that you can open,

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.170
and you're going to
get some interest rate

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.580
for saving in this account.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.430
The second one is like
a marketing treatment

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.010
which essentially is
encouraging people to sign up.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.930
Otherwise, it's like
the same, essentially

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.353
trying to get people to do it.

00:23:14.353 --> 00:23:15.770
Number one-- and
this is, I guess,

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.312
the treatment of
interest-- is what's

00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:19.790
called the SEED Treatment,
which is encouraging people

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.770
to sign up, plus a
commitment offer, which

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.220
is clients can restrict
their access to the deposits

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.970
upon opening the account.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.330
So what you can essentially
do is you can set some goals.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.780
These goals are either
date-based or amount-based.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.370
So you can say, I want to
save $1,000 or some amount,

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.710
and until I've reached that
amount I cannot withdraw any

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.490
money.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.110
Alternatively, you
can say, I would

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:45.710
like to save until my
husband's or my wife's

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.390
birthday or some other--

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.860
child's graduation
and whatever you

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.960
want to save for,
Christmas, et cetera,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.120
and only then you can
withdraw the money.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.270
As you can see, most
people seem to be choosing

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.820
date-based types of
goals, but others also

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.310
have a amount-based.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.220
You can see about 70%
here are date-based,

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.800
and 30% are amount-based.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.270
Now, what they
find is, A, there's

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.220
quite a bit of take-up
of this account,

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.380
and again, when you
think about this,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.300
there's not a good
reason to take up

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:19.560
this account unless you want
to restrict your future self.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.200
So there's some evidence
of demand for commitment.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.500
Second, offering
just kinds of account

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.300
increases people's savings, so
on average, people save more.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.160
I'm going to tell
you a little bit

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.452
about the distribution of that.

00:24:32.452 --> 00:24:34.620
Is actually everybody
better off from doing that?

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.330
But on average,
people do save more,

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.940
so essentially, it's kind
of similar to the evidence

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.140
that I showed you earlier.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.030
Commitment devices,
at least on average,

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.390
can improve outcomes or
affect outcomes in some way.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.770
And then number three--

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.270
and that's a little
bit suggestive--

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.957
but essentially saying, if you
look at money now versus later,

00:24:49.957 --> 00:24:52.040
a question that I showed
you earlier in the class,

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.490
they actually do predict
commitment take-up consistent

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.900
with some form of--

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.850
this is really about
time preferences

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.520
as opposed to maybe other
things like demand effects,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.725
social-desirability
bias, essentially

00:25:03.725 --> 00:25:06.350
customers maybe just wanting to
make the bank happy in some way

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.880
because they feel
compelled to do it

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.850
because they get some marketing
treatment and a particularly

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.300
strong one.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.430
Any questions on this?

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.930
Yeah?

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:14.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.040
FRANK SCHILBACH: No, I
think it's taking it--

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.500
I think it's taking it up
and putting some money in it.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.010
Yeah, the take-up
is put in like,

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.890
once you put in some money, it's
counted as using or taking up

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.753
the account.

00:25:34.753 --> 00:25:36.170
Otherwise, it would
be like, yeah,

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.110
that's not really anything
now, essentially restricting

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.690
your choices in some way
by putting in some money

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:42.460
into this account.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:46.790
OK.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.610
So next is some work that
I've done in India on alcohol

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.750
consumption, and this
is a very common issue

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.050
among low-income workers, in
South India, in Tamil Nadu,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.370
and Kerala, and other places.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:03.300
It's also an issue in other
countries, in Uganda and so on.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.810
So large fractions
of low-income workers

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.292
drink large amounts of
alcohol, often daily.

00:26:09.292 --> 00:26:10.250
What do I mean by that?

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.240
They drink something like five,
six standard drinks per day.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.240
What's a standard drink?

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.190
It's like a small beer or like
a shot of liquor, so five,

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.200
six standard drinks
are a lot of alcohol.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.750
Now, they also
spend large amounts

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.060
of their money of
their income on alcohol

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.850
on the order of magnitude
of 20%, 30%, 40%,

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.510
so think of these as like
families of five or six.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.480
Sorry, families of
four or five often.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.020
What they earn is something
like 300, 400 rupees per day.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.880
That's usually, often,
the family income.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.100
Some earn a little bit
more, but that's something

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.780
like $5, $6, $7 per day.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.140
And often they spend
$1 or $2 on alcohol.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:52.250
And so when you ask
people, when you ask women,

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.030
when you ask men about, how
does alcohol affect your lives,

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.280
you get sort of this uniform
response of people saying

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.700
like, well, if only
liquor stores closed,

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.130
my life would be so much better.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.800
I would love for liquor
prices to be higher,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.800
and I would like to find some
way to reduce my drinking.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.230
But I have trouble doing so.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.292
When you ask people,
OK, now you would

00:27:14.292 --> 00:27:15.500
like to reduce your drinking.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.875
It would be great for you the
liquor stores to be closed.

00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:20.990
Why is it difficult for you
to reduce your drinking?

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.940
The common response is
always, A, addiction,

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.560
which makes things
tricky anyway,

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.190
but B, people say they
have physical pain,

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.210
physical pain from work.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:33.170
Particularly, these are
people with very low levels

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.680
of education, so often
they're illiterate and so on.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.500
So it's very hard for them
to get any job or the like,

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.190
so what instead
they have to do is,

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.500
essentially, do physical
labor, hard physical labor.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.000
These are like
construction workers,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.262
rickshaw drivers,
sewage workers,

00:27:46.262 --> 00:27:47.220
and so on and so forth.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.730
This is really
hard work, and they

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.980
tend to have, then, lots of
physical pain from their work.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.790
Now, why is it that, then,
the pain exacerbates,

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.627
potentially, people's
self-control problems?

00:27:57.627 --> 00:27:58.960
Why is that making things worse?

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.563
Yes?

00:28:11.563 --> 00:28:23.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you might
have been drinking for instance

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.900
social reasons or alcoholism.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.162
Now you're also self-medicating
for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:32.162 --> 00:28:33.120
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.620
So what are you
saying, essentially,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.302
is you can do self-medicating
physical pain, in addition

00:28:38.302 --> 00:28:40.510
to maybe some other reason,
social reasons and so on.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.800
It turns out, in this setting,
at least, specifically,

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.140
people tend to not drink
so much for social reasons.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.670
There's some social function.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.510
There's like funerals or
other sort of festivals where

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.280
lots of people
drink, but they're

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.110
drinking-- in
particular, in rickshaw

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.020
is often people
drink on their own,

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.900
essentially to numb
their pain in some ways.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.480
Now, when you think about
self-control problems,

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.240
often where self-control
problems arise

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.328
is when you have short-run
benefits and long-run costs.

00:29:10.328 --> 00:29:12.120
Essentially, that's
sort of the consumption

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.710
good that people over consume.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.870
Now, when you think about
physical pain, what does

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:16.900
physical pain do?

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.290
It very much increases
the short-run benefits

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.110
of drinking while keeping
long-run costs or anything else

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.947
constant.

00:29:22.947 --> 00:29:25.530
And so if you think about, you
have lots of short-run benefits

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.440
now of drinking because there's
lots of pain that alcohol helps

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.160
numbing--

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.390
and alcohol is a very powerful
anesthetic as it turns out.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.140
So then, essentially,
it sort of increases

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.557
the short-run
benefits, and that's

00:29:35.557 --> 00:29:38.190
sort of the short-run
desire to drink.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.680
And then any long-run
costs about health

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.368
and so on and so forth are
very much in the future,

00:29:43.368 --> 00:29:45.660
and that's where, essentially,
the self-control problem

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.510
potentially arises.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.870
Now, people not only
drink a lot overall

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.873
in Chennai and in
surrounding areas,

00:29:54.873 --> 00:29:57.540
but they drink also quite a bit,
in particular rickshaw drivers,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.600
during the day.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.680
So what I was doing there
is essentially just randomly

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.860
walking around in Chennai--
our RAs would do that--

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.500
walking around in Chennai
and just breathalyzing people

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.500
more or less randomly, offering
them, essentially, would

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.920
you like to do a breathalyzer
test for some small amount,

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.720
regardless of the result.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.210
And about half of these
rickshaw drivers-- and these

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.640
are all cycle rickshaws,
so it's not particularly

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.470
dangerous to do that.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.300
But about half of them are
showing positive breathalyzer

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:25.800
scores.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.383
So essentially, half of them are
at least somewhat inebriated.

00:30:28.383 --> 00:30:32.100
About 20%, 25% are
pretty drunk, as

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.280
in their blood alcohol content
is about 0.1 or higher,

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.440
which is above the US legal
driving limit overall.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.240
Now, this is during
the regular work hours.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.910
These are people who
are actually at work.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.485
Now, then sort of
seeing that and sort

00:30:47.485 --> 00:30:49.860
of having people report about
their self-control problem,

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.235
I was then sort
of wondering, OK,

00:30:51.235 --> 00:30:53.160
now, what kinds of
commitment devices

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.500
could be perhaps offered
to people to reduce

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.990
their drinking given
that they tend to report

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.480
self-control problems,
or physical pain,

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.850
or self-control problems
related to physical pain

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.940
are a key issue
and preventing them

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.640
from reducing their drinking
if they desire to do so,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.240
of course?

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.170
What could we do?

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.243
Yes?

00:31:28.243 --> 00:31:29.618
AUDIENCE: We could
just tell them

00:31:29.618 --> 00:31:31.951
you're going to randomly
administer a breathalyzer test,

00:31:31.951 --> 00:31:36.743
and if they haven't been
drinking [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:36.743 --> 00:31:39.160
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah, so we
could, essentially-- exactly.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.280
So you could essentially say,
I'm going to try and find you.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.890
I'm going to call you
sometimes randomly,

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.860
and you get some
reward if you're sober,

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.960
so essentially incentivizing
people to be sober.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.835
That's exactly right.

00:31:50.835 --> 00:31:51.850
You could do that.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:53.450
Now, is that a--

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.160
so what would be a
commitment device?

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.792
What would a commitment
device for that look like?

00:31:57.792 --> 00:31:59.500
So what you just
mentioned is essentially

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.708
just providing people
incentives, incentivizing them,

00:32:01.708 --> 00:32:03.460
and that could truly work.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.280
How would I show that these are,
in fact, self-control problems

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.318
or people have quasi-hyperbolic
or similar preferences?

00:32:11.318 --> 00:32:13.708
AUDIENCE: So if they choose
to enter into this study,

00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:17.054
they're [INAUDIBLE] for
example maybe [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:17.054 --> 00:32:20.022
they've been
drinking [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:20.022 --> 00:32:20.980
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.020
Essentially, you have
to give people choices,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.430
and some choices are
potentially dominating.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:26.600
So what does that mean?

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.760
I'm giving you some choices.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.970
You can choose to either
receive the incentives,

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.640
and you only receive these
incentives if you're sober.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.220
Alternatively, I'm going to
just pay you some amount,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.340
and that amount, ideally, is
like higher than the amount

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.615
that you could get
from these incentives.

00:32:41.615 --> 00:32:43.240
Now, then if you
choose the incentives,

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.210
what does that mean?

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.043
Essentially, that means
you want to increase

00:32:46.043 --> 00:32:47.470
your future prices of drinking.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.950
That would be, essentially,
demand for commitment.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:52.930
Now, the other thing
we could potentially do

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.515
is what I showed
you earlier, which

00:32:54.515 --> 00:32:56.890
is the drug that's called
Antabuse which, essentially, is

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.800
a drug that you can take to
prevent yourself from being

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.620
able to metabolize alcohol.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.420
I was actually thinking
about that for quite a while.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:09.070
The reason why I wasn't doing
that was the tricky part

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.870
here is that, once
you actually start

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.820
drinking while you're on this
drug, that's very dangerous.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.570
And particularly if
you have been drinking

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.600
for quite a while, withdrawal
symptoms related to alcohol

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.000
are very dangerous, so if you
have been drinking alcohol

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.360
for 10, 20 years like many of
the people in the sample have,

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.910
abruptly reducing your
drinking is dangerous

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.530
because you can
essentially get what's

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:35.290
called delirium tremens, very
severe withdrawal symptoms that

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.080
could even-- you could
even die from that.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.000
Now, one thing you
could do is when

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.790
you get withdrawal symptoms,
you can actually start drinking,

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:43.810
and that helps.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.150
Now, the problem is, when
you have taken Antabuse,

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:46.942
you can't do that.

00:33:46.942 --> 00:33:48.400
So essentially,
there's the issues,

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.070
and then you get this
alcohol-Antabuse reaction

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.850
which is really bad.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.420
So I ended up not doing that
for various ethical and other

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.170
reasons.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.840
But what I did do is essentially
give people the option

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.397
of dominated choices.

00:34:01.397 --> 00:34:02.980
So what does the
experiment look like?

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.800
It's a three-week field
experiment with the rickshaw

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.050
drivers in Chennai.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:11.650
We didn't do the random
breathalyzing in the field,

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.983
in part because it's really
hard to actually find people

00:34:13.983 --> 00:34:16.150
if they're sort of roaming
around on their rickshaw.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.070
Not everybody has
their phone, or answers

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.252
their phone, and so on.

00:34:19.252 --> 00:34:20.710
So instead, we
asked people to come

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:24.639
to the study office between
6:00 and 10:00 PM every day.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:27.520
It's between 6:00 and 10:00 PM
because breathalyzer tests can

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.340
tell you about drinking during
the previous something like six

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.117
to 10 hours, so if you
breathalyze me now,

00:34:33.117 --> 00:34:34.659
what you can tell
is what I have been

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:37.090
drinking in the last, let's
say, eight hours or something.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:39.909
You cannot really tell whether
I have been drinking yesterday.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:41.739
So if we did the breathalyzer
test in the morning,

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:44.139
that would not be particularly
helpful because, really, it

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:45.931
can't tell you very
much about the drinking

00:34:45.931 --> 00:34:48.070
on the previous day.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.580
And then we provided financial
incentives for sobriety

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.810
for a subset of individuals.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.179
What do these financial
incentives look like?

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:56.860
They look very
simple and something

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.590
very similar to what
you just suggested.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.780
So option A-- these are
the financial incentives--

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:06.040
are people are given 60
rupees, which is about $1, just

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:06.700
for showing up.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.782
So just come to the
office, and show up.

00:35:08.782 --> 00:35:10.990
Do a breathalyzer test, and
do some survey questions.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.820
And you get like
$1 for doing that.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.480
And then if your
breathalyzer score is 0,

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.630
you get another
dollar, 120 rupees.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:23.110
That's essentially the
incentives for sobriety.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:28.540
Now, option B-- and people
were given choices for that.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.060
Option B was-- there was
like three different versions

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.050
of that.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:35.030
The first one is where option
B was 90 rupees, which,

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.640
essentially, is,
come to the office,

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.230
and you can choose
to get 90 rupees.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.430
Just come to the office.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:42.730
Whenever you show up, you
get 90 rupees, regardless

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.530
of what your
breathalyzer score is.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.930
You are breathalyzed, but
it doesn't matter what

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:48.700
your scores for your payment.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.890
Now, when you choose the
incentives over option B,

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.525
is that a commitment
device, or how

00:35:52.525 --> 00:35:53.860
do we think about this choice?

00:35:59.163 --> 00:36:00.580
What do we learn
from that choice?

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.515
FRANK SCHILBACH: Why?

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:20.702
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:20.702 --> 00:36:22.160
FRANK SCHILBACH:
So let me give you

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.020
an example of a person
who might choose this.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.250
Suppose there's a person who
is actually mostly sober,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.350
is an exponential
discounter, and wants

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:31.860
to be drunk just once a week.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.830
So-- sorry-- these are
choices for six days

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.240
for like the following week.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.100
So the person is
perfectly rational.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.650
The person has perfect
foresight and knows

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.780
that they're going to
be drunk once next week,

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.080
and they're going to choose
option A because they

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.430
think it's a great deal.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.955
And so they actually
don't want any commitment.

00:36:50.955 --> 00:36:52.580
The only reason why
they choose that is

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.520
because the expected value of
the money that they will get

00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.830
will be higher if they are, at
least half of the time, sober.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:03.540
So that choice, in fact,
is not a commitment device.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.460
However, moving towards
choices two and three,

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.220
now we get into territory
of dominated contracts

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.600
that, in fact, are
commitment devices.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.630
So the key part
here is that, when

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:17.630
you look at the second
choice, when you choose, now,

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:21.610
option A over option B, you
can actually only do worse.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:23.540
The only reason why
you choose option A

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.570
is because you want
to have incentives.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:31.190
Now, you risk showing up drunk
on some days, in which case

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.392
you get less money,
but the benefit of that

00:37:34.392 --> 00:37:36.350
now is that then now you
have these incentives.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:38.053
So essentially, you
want incentives,

00:37:38.053 --> 00:37:40.220
but what you take into
account is that, potentially,

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.887
if you don't show up
sober all the time,

00:37:41.887 --> 00:37:43.380
you might lose some money.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.610
So this kind of contract
or this type of choice

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:50.150
we cal a weekly-dominated
contract or choice

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:51.710
in terms of steady payments.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:55.640
So if people choose option
A and the second choice,

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.268
that is some demand
for commitment.

00:37:58.268 --> 00:37:59.810
Now, when I look at
the third choice,

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.970
now option A is
strictly-dominated.

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:07.640
So now, if you choose option
A, you will do worse for sure

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.710
in terms of how much
you will be paid.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.080
Every day, you got like 30
rupees, which is about 10%

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.640
of people's daily incomes.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.880
Every day, you got
30 rupees less,

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.615
and the benefit, again, is
like incentives for sobriety.

00:38:19.615 --> 00:38:21.740
So if you want to choose
these incentives that will

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.870
be costly for you for sure--

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:27.690
and now you have a sort of weigh
whether you like those or not.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.690
So what I find is
and what you see here

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.780
is, essentially, the fraction
of people choosing incentives

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.330
for choice one, two, and three.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.900
So in black you see choice one,
which is a 90 rupees choice.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.950
In dark blue you see
the 120 rupees choices.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.840
You see the
weekly-dominated choices,

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:50.240
and then you see, in light
blue, the 150 rupee choices.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.412
These are the
strictly-dominated choices,

00:38:53.412 --> 00:38:54.620
and there's like three weeks.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.620
And people will do this.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.798
So each week, they choose
for the following week

00:38:57.798 --> 00:38:59.840
what incentives they would
like to set themselves

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.940
for the next six days.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.700
So these are the
three options again,

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.290
and you see the
choices over time.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.590
So what we find is or
what I find is that,

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.170
in fact, quite a few people,
about half of the individuals,

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.420
choose the incentives when
they're weekly-dominated,

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.880
which have some evidence
of demand for commitment,

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.310
but perhaps more strikingly,
about a third of individuals

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.560
choose the incentives when
they're strictly-dominated.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.040
So these are people who are
willing to forgo three times

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.438
in a row, not just once
but in the second week

00:39:27.438 --> 00:39:29.480
and also in the third
week, and then if anything,

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.580
the fraction of people
choosing these incentives

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.880
goes up over time.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.850
People are willing to
choose these incentives

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.660
and willing to give up about
10% of their daily incomes

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.200
for like an entire week to
receive incentives to be sober.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.890
So that's very strong evidence
of demand for commitment.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:49.230
Now, what we also find is,
when you sort of randomize

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.580
just the incentives
themselves for some people

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.680
versus unconditional
payments overall,

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.540
these incentives are,
in fact, successful

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.010
in reducing people's
day drinking.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:01.520
So people actually
show up more sober

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.930
when they receive incentives.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.250
However, as you might
have expected as well,

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.690
the problem is the
breathalyzer incentivizes

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.360
during the day, the time
before 6:00 and 10:00

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.640
PM, before people come
to the study office.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.988
It is not incentivizing the time
after that's in the evening.

00:40:16.988 --> 00:40:18.780
And as you sort of--
this is some work by--

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.280
Holmstrom and others would
say, if you have multitasking

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.752
at different times of the
day or different actions

00:40:24.752 --> 00:40:26.960
that you can take, if you
incentivize one thing, what

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.270
often happens-- people
follow these incentives,

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:32.130
but then they substitute to
other things in their life.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.550
So then what, in fact, happens--

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.200
overall, people's
overall drinking

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.257
does not decrease very much.

00:40:38.257 --> 00:40:40.340
So while people seem to
have quite a bit of demand

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.430
for these incentives,
in fact, it

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:45.890
is helpful for increasing
their daytime sobriety

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.550
but not helpful for decreasing
their overall drinking.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.252
So then I was
looking at the impact

00:40:51.252 --> 00:40:53.210
of that treatment in the
sense like, now people

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.315
are more sober during the day.

00:40:55.315 --> 00:40:56.690
In fact, somewhat
surprisingly, I

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.120
find very little evidence
on labor market outcomes.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.400
It's not like actually
people are working better,

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.650
but I do find people make
different savings decisions.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.293
People are willing to save a
lot more when they're sober,

00:41:06.293 --> 00:41:08.210
even when you take into
account that they also

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.180
might have more money overall,
or at least more money

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:11.720
available.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.892
Yes?

00:41:12.892 --> 00:41:26.065
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if there was [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:26.065 --> 00:41:31.312
but they may drink at night

00:41:31.312 --> 00:41:33.270
FRANK SCHILBACH: So I
spent quite a bit of time

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.060
thinking about demand effect and
making sure that people are--

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.130
some of the people
in the setting

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:42.063
have much less concerns
about what other people think

00:41:42.063 --> 00:41:42.730
when they drink.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:48.010
They're very happy to tell you,
yesterday I drank six drinks.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.010
They're also very happy
to tell you, yesterday I

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.090
spent a third of my income
on alcohol and so on.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.423
People are very open about
this, so it's not like people

00:41:54.423 --> 00:41:57.000
misreport in surveys and so on.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.570
People's reported drinking
is also very much consistent

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.270
with the actual
breathalyzer scores,

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.270
so if you sort of
matched that up

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.920
in terms of how much have
you been drinking today

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.930
versus what the
breathalyzer score says,

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.190
that seems consistent as well.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.680
Now, there are some
studies looking

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.200
at social-desirability
bias and demand effects,

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.928
and often what you find is
that when choices are not

00:42:15.928 --> 00:42:17.970
incentivized, when they
are very weak incentives,

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.920
there is often evidence
for demand effect

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.510
and social-desirability bias.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.940
But when you make things very
costly in a sense of like,

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.398
this is a very
costly thing for you

00:42:25.398 --> 00:42:27.510
to do to just make the
experimenter happy--

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:28.927
we spent a lot of
time essentially

00:42:28.927 --> 00:42:31.302
being very clear about like,
you can do whatever you want

00:42:31.302 --> 00:42:32.290
and so on and so forth.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.830
And what we tend to find is
that, in the first few days,

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.730
people seem slightly
uncomfortable in this.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:38.313
There's more to the
study, but there's

00:42:38.313 --> 00:42:40.230
like a baseline period
of about a week,

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:41.970
and the first few
days, people seem

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.980
to be slightly uncomfortable
of being drunk in the office

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.750
and so on and so
forth and sort of

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.320
having positive
breathalyzer scores.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.910
That goes away very
quickly, so people

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:54.670
are very happy to show
up as drunk as they are.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:57.707
So overall, I would think,
if this is one choice,

00:42:57.707 --> 00:42:59.790
and you're like, maybe
people are making mistakes,

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.710
or people maybe want
to make you happy,

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.710
once you make that choice
once, for a whole week

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.293
you get, essentially,
a lot less money

00:43:05.293 --> 00:43:06.645
than you would get otherwise.

00:43:06.645 --> 00:43:07.770
You make that choice again.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:09.270
Again, you get, like
for a whole week a lot

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.870
less money than you
would otherwise,

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.370
and then people
choose it yet again.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:16.170
So while I can't entirely
rule out this explanation--

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.108
there's a discussion
of that in the paper.

00:43:18.108 --> 00:43:19.650
While I can't rule
out this entirely,

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.990
it seems unlikely, at least in
the second and third choice,

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:26.065
given that it's really,
really costly for people.

00:43:26.065 --> 00:43:27.690
AUDIENCE: My question
was also related.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:29.977
If they know that the
[INAUDIBLE] device is not

00:43:29.977 --> 00:43:31.769
working because they
are drinking at night,

00:43:31.769 --> 00:43:32.640
why do they keep--

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.450
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:34.830
So the second
question is like, OK,

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.520
now why are people
making these choices?

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.280
So one broad question
is like, OK, so--

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.280
when talking to people, a lot
of people would say, well--

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.670
they would come, be like, last
week it was really difficult.

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:49.410
I didn't really
succeed and so on.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:51.060
And then they would be
like, from tomorrow onwards,

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.030
things will be different.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.970
So there is lots of
people who, in fact, seem

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.130
naive in the sense
of they really think,

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.610
going forward, they will
change their behavior.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.980
Often, I think what
they are reasonably

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.840
clear about is how
often they will actually

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.577
be sober going forward.

00:44:05.577 --> 00:44:07.410
What they have trouble
with is, essentially,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.300
predicting their behavior
later in the day.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.830
So they seem to think
like, OK, tomorrow

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.538
I'm not going to drink,
and then I'm also

00:44:12.538 --> 00:44:13.860
not going to drink at nights.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.810
That doesn't seem to change.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:17.185
Now, there's a
second explanation

00:44:17.185 --> 00:44:19.393
that's also in the paper
and discussed in more detail

00:44:19.393 --> 00:44:21.180
that I can't really
necessarily rule out.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.648
There are actually some benefits
of reducing people's drinking.

00:44:24.648 --> 00:44:26.190
These are all kind
of small benefits,

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:27.960
but they actually
sort of add up.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.302
So one part of that is savings.

00:44:29.302 --> 00:44:30.510
People save a lot more money.

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:32.010
They get more
interest from saving.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.490
That's actually quite a bit of
money that they make from that,

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.540
so they potentially
make better decisions.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.200
Second, they have like-- so
while it's not significant,

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.360
people have somewhat
higher earnings.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.890
People also have
somewhat reduced

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.967
costs of drinking and so on.

00:44:45.967 --> 00:44:47.550
So there's some,
essentially, evidence

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.820
of several benefits in the
order of magnitude of like 5,

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.180
10 rupees per day.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.120
So when you have somewhat
increased earnings,

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.500
somewhat reduce expenditures
on alcohol, increased savings--

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.250
and then on top of
that, people would also

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.680
tell you they like to be what
they say, like a sober man.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.430
These are all men.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.950
They like to be a sober man,
and so they have some value of,

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.357
actually, sobriety
during the day.

00:45:07.357 --> 00:45:08.440
So I think it's a mixture.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.410
My guess is-- when we've had
to best explain the evidence

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.420
that we have, it's a
mixture of there actually

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:16.560
being some evidence of benefits
of being sober that you

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.140
can weigh against like 30
rupees forgone benefits

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.770
from the study.

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.790
And there is also some naivete
in a sense of people desires,

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:32.280
people's beliefs about
wanting to drink glass also

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.910
in the evening, and that's just
not necessarily working out.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.890
I want to say another
comment to this,

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.350
which is when you see
people choosing commitment

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:44.250
devices that fail, you
can't necessarily rule out

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:46.770
that people are
reasonably sophisticated,

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:47.760
the reason being--

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.320
for example, if I
were a smoker that

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.200
smoked a lot and the value
of me stopping to smoke

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.110
is really high-- suppose I think
if I just could stop smoking

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.610
I would live like
five years longer.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.160
That's a huge value in
terms of the benefits.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.440
If somebody came to
me and said, there's

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.840
a commitment device with a
1% chance it's going to work.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.710
Would you like to buy it?

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:07.200
And it costs $100.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.500
I might actually choose
this commitment device

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.750
because the expected
value of that

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:16.110
is actually higher, even
if 99% of the cases I'm

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.500
actually going to fail.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.230
So then you're
looking at the data.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:21.272
You might say, look, these
people are essentially

00:46:21.272 --> 00:46:22.483
making a bunch of mistakes.

00:46:22.483 --> 00:46:23.900
But I think from
their perspective

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.790
it's rather-- they have
been drinking for so long.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:27.165
They struggle with
this, and they

00:46:27.165 --> 00:46:28.430
try to reduce their drinking.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:30.263
There is a chance that
maybe this will work.

00:46:30.263 --> 00:46:31.050
Maybe it will not.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.500
So let me really try
and do this and see.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.440
Unfortunately, as it turns out,
it's, in fact, not successful,

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.740
at least when it comes to
their drinking overall.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.220
Second, speaking of
smoking, as a second paper

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.850
on commitment devices related
to sort of addictive products,

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:53.200
this is a voluntary commitment
product for smoking cessation.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.630
Smokers are offered a
nonstandard savings account.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:59.170
This is the same setting
as in the Philippines

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:01.960
where these are
clients of a bank.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.080
These are smokers selecting
on actually somebody

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.220
being a smoker.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.190
And they are offered the
following commitment device.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.920
You can deposit
funds for six months,

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.490
and then you can take a urine
test for nicotine and cotinine,

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:16.990
which apparently tests pretty
well, whether you haven't been

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.990
drinking-- sorry, not been
smoking for the last week

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.640
or so or a bit longer.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.130
If you pass, you get the money
back that's in your account.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:27.483
If you fail, the money
is gone, essentially.

00:47:27.483 --> 00:47:29.650
Now, do we think this is a
good commitment contract?

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:30.820
Or do we like this or not?

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.903
Or how do we think about
this commitment contract?

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.073
Yes?

00:47:41.073 --> 00:47:49.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:50.367
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah.

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.200
Exactly, you could lose
quite a bit of money

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:57.122
and make people quite
unhappy, but do we think--

00:47:57.122 --> 00:47:58.830
actually, suppose you
were sophisticated.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:03.756
Would you sign up, or
how would you behave?

00:48:03.756 --> 00:48:05.560
Like suppose I offer
you the contract.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.520
You have it now.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.505
What would you do?

00:48:09.505 --> 00:48:12.012
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:12.012 --> 00:48:12.970
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.930
So you put money in it, but
I think the one key part here

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:19.710
is that the actual
quitting only occurs

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.330
in like six months from now.

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:24.300
It's to say, it's sort of a
little bit of a funny thing

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.100
in the sense of saying,
look, you really

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.160
want to quit smoking.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.340
It's like, in six
months from now,

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.870
you already have lots of
long-run benefits-- sorry,

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.910
lots of long-run
costs of smoking,

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.660
which is lung cancer, health
issues, and so on and so forth.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.110
Now I'm sort of adding
long-run incentives

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.590
in like six months from now,
which is a little bit far away.

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.960
So what it sort of needs is--

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.525
in a way, you would not start
quitting to smoke right away.

00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:50.400
You would say, well, in
five months from now,

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.810
I can sort of stop.

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.570
And now, of course, you can
then build your own commitment

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.700
device by putting
in a lot of money

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.185
and then really ramping
up these incentives.

00:48:59.185 --> 00:49:01.810
But in some sense, what you kind
of want is a commitment device

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:02.070
that--

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:02.970
I sign up for it.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:04.860
I'm like really excited
to stop smoking,

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.500
and now you want to provide
incentives almost right away

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.775
to get people going.

00:49:08.775 --> 00:49:10.650
But instead, it's this
commitment device that

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:12.840
requires quite a bit of
sophistication, in a sense,

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.510
of saying, now, I know that
in like six months from now

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:16.470
I want to stop smoking.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.428
I kind of don't want to
stop smoking right now.

00:49:18.428 --> 00:49:20.920
I can always do it tomorrow,
because people like to delay,

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.310
depending on how naive
they are and so on.

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:25.967
And so I can see lots
of people then saying,

00:49:25.967 --> 00:49:28.050
yeah, in three months from
now I'm going to do it.

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.300
And then they're going to
put in some money and so on,

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.520
but they end up not
doing it eventually.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.340
It turns out, empirically,
it works reasonably well

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:35.910
in a sense.

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.410
There's like 10% of take-up.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:39.810
Like 10% of people
actually put in some money.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:44.790
There is also like an impact on
smoking of 3 percentage points.

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:47.490
That sounds kind of
small, but that's actually

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:49.200
pretty sizable in
terms of getting people

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.240
to stop smoking is pretty hard.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.880
Also, these effects
persist in surprise tests

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.983
like 12 months later.

00:49:54.983 --> 00:49:57.400
So when you sort of surprise
people later and sort of say,

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.380
hey, surprise,
here's a test, you

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.100
get some money for
doing it, turns out

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:07.890
that people who offered this
commitment, smoking a contract

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:11.040
or product are, in fact,
less likely to smoke.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.700
Now, a second question
related to that is to say,

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:22.160
if people are unhappy about
their smoking in the future,

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.180
if people would like to
reduce their future smoking,

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.040
there's some
arguments that taxes

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.380
can be some form of not
quite commitment devices

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.513
but ways in which you
could reduce your smoking.

00:50:35.513 --> 00:50:37.680
So the rickshaw drivers in
Chennai would of tell me,

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.080
I would love for
alcohol prices to be

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.595
more expensive
because that would

00:50:41.595 --> 00:50:42.720
help me reduce my drinking.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.570
So if they could set prices,
quite a few people would say,

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:47.610
I would set prices really
high, so that would

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.180
help me reduce my drinking.

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.148
So if people could
choose their own prices

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:53.190
and if they would set high
prices, that would be,

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:54.648
essentially, a form
of a commitment

00:50:54.648 --> 00:50:58.140
device to reduce your
smoking or drinking.

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.960
So when you look
at smokers, there's

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.750
lots of people who say
they would like to quit.

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:06.930
About eight out of 10
US smokers say that.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.880
If you have friends
who smoke, you

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.870
will get this common patterns.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:12.900
So lots of people say,
I would love to quit,

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.510
lots of quit attempts that
often are not successful.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:18.570
Now, one way you can
sort of reduce smoking

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.690
potentially or accomplish
your goal is to say,

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:22.950
prices might be higher.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.290
Again, higher
prices-- essentially,

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:27.390
that's the law of demand.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:30.000
Like if prices go up,
people smoke less,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.050
and that's true for
smoking, drinking as well.

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:35.580
And so that might help curb
people's self-control problems.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:38.685
Now, one simple question
that John Gruber, who

00:51:38.685 --> 00:51:42.300
was in the economics department,
and Sendhil Mullainathan we're

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.780
asking is like, well,
once we increase taxes,

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.030
now smokers are
actually happier.

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:53.402
And so if it's true that people
have self-control problems,

00:51:53.402 --> 00:51:55.860
people might be happier because
it helps them, essentially,

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:56.910
reduce their smoking.

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.790
It helps them deal with
their self-control problems.

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:02.927
You could even say, once prices
become infinitely expensive,

00:52:02.927 --> 00:52:05.010
as long as people can't
substitute in certain ways

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:08.368
or get around these
rules, they might even

00:52:08.368 --> 00:52:10.410
be happy about banning
smoking because that would

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:12.785
be the simplest way of getting
rid of their smoking habit

00:52:12.785 --> 00:52:14.670
if they really want to do so.

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:17.820
Now, Gruber and Mullainathan
have an empirical test

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:21.250
of this in the US and
Canada, and in fact,

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:22.930
when you look at
variation over time,

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:26.250
higher cigarette
taxes are associated

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:28.140
with higher
self-reported well-being,

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:31.830
in particular among those
who are likely smokers.

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:34.260
Now, you could also say,
well, other people are happier

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.593
as well, but that's not that
interesting because there's

00:52:36.593 --> 00:52:37.990
externalities from smoking.

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:39.780
And if you are not
a smoker, you should

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.072
be happy about smoking
taxes because, A, they're

00:52:42.072 --> 00:52:43.530
going to reduce
your externalities.

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:45.363
People are going to
smoke less in your face,

00:52:45.363 --> 00:52:46.980
and you might sort of like that.

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.110
Second, there's going to
be revenues from taxation.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:51.360
You're also going to be very
happy if other people pay

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.955
higher taxes.

00:52:52.955 --> 00:52:54.330
But what they do
is they look at,

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.670
essentially,
households particularly

00:52:56.670 --> 00:53:00.810
that are likely smokers, and
that helps then identify--

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.720
or that's much more interesting
a result than households

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.070
who are non-smokers.

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:07.380
There's some caveat that
some of the respondents

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.953
might be spouses of
the actual smokers.

00:53:09.953 --> 00:53:11.370
Again, that's, in
some sense, less

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.580
interesting from the
beta-delta perspective

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.310
because if the husband or
wife wants to get their spouse

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:19.710
to smoke less, they might
be quite happy about it,

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.550
but it's more like because the
spouse thinks their husband

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.460
or wife have a self-control
problem as opposed to they

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.980
have one themselves.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.570
Or it could be even-- like for
lack of self-control problems,

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:33.510
it could just be the
husband likes smoking,

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:34.950
the wife does not.

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:38.580
If prices go up, the husband
might still smoke less,

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:41.170
and the wife might be happier
or the other way around

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:43.003
and nothing to do with
self-control problem.

00:53:43.003 --> 00:53:47.400
Just like if prices go up
people, consume stuff less.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.080
To be clear, such
effects are not

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:54.720
possible and not consistent
with exponential discounting

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.700
because if you're an
exponential discounter,

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.370
you would either smoke
because you like smoking

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:00.690
or you would not smoke.

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:02.760
There's no scenario in
which you are smoking

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:04.880
but you really
would like to quit.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.380
If you would like to quit and
if it's worth for you to quit,

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.440
you would actually do
that, so you would not

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.720
be happier about higher
prices the same way

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.810
as you would not be happy
about higher prices for apples

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:16.747
and bananas.

00:54:16.747 --> 00:54:19.080
People don't like high prices
because, essentially, they

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:23.250
have to pay more, and that
sort of reduces their budget.

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:26.360
Any questions on this?

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.209
Yes?

00:54:27.209 --> 00:54:39.175
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:40.050
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:44.280
So I think you're bringing up a
very good point, which is often

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.700
a big discussion for
so-called "sin taxes," which

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.920
is essentially taxes on
either cigarettes, on alcohol,

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.650
on sodas, and so on.

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:59.040
So there's different
objectives often.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.440
One is essentially helping
people who potentially

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.950
have self-control problems.

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:07.260
Second, there is sort of
redistribution as a goal

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:09.070
or a problem in some sense.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:12.040
And that's the same case
in India, in some sense.

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.700
If you increased the alcohol
prices in India, on the one

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:18.870
hand, people would drink less,
but the elasticity of drinking

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:23.070
tends to be fairly low,
meaning that if you increase

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:25.890
the price of alcohol, or
cigarettes, or the like by 1%,

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.873
usually the consumption only
reduces by less than 1%,

00:55:29.873 --> 00:55:32.040
which means that overall
expenditures-- while people

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.490
actually drink or smoke less,
overall expenditures actually

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:36.463
go up.

00:55:36.463 --> 00:55:38.130
And so if you're
worried about the poor,

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:40.140
then, in particular,
A, they tend

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:42.660
to consume these
types of goods more

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:45.120
when it comes to smoking,
drinking, but also sodas,

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.580
in particular in the US--

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.312
when you're worried, then,
about increasing taxes and then

00:55:51.312 --> 00:55:52.770
expenditures and
then, essentially,

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:56.130
having a particular high
burden among the poor--

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.640
So then there's questions
on how to deal with that.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:04.620
So one potential "why did you do
this" would be, in some sense,

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.600
to refund, then, the
taxes that are actually

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.900
incurred, in particular, then
in some form of transfers.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.730
That's often not
necessarily feasible,

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:13.920
but that's exactly the
problem when you think

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.960
about, for example, soda taxes.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.202
There's a very nice paper
by Dmitry Taubinsky,

00:56:18.202 --> 00:56:19.410
and Hunt Allcott, and so on--

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.630
I can add this to the slides--

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:24.210
that essentially looking
at exactly that in the US.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:26.070
When you think about
soda taxes, how

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.870
do you deal with two
different objectives?

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:31.680
One is helping people to consume
less sodas if they desire

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.010
to do so and second,
redistribution

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:36.570
dealing with the
fact that the burden

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:38.580
is particularly high
among the poor in terms

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.345
of how much money to pay.

00:56:41.345 --> 00:56:42.970
You kind of want it
to be the opposite.

00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:46.650
You want the rich to pay more
taxes rather than the poor,

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:48.420
and some of these
taxes do the opposite.

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.590
And then there's
a question of, how

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:50.940
do you weigh these
two objectives,

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.920
and how you can maybe
undo some of the effects

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.800
that you're doing?

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.612
Yes?

00:56:56.612 --> 00:56:57.968
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:02.722 --> 00:57:06.080
FRANK SCHILBACH: I
think these are simple--

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:09.680
these are just simple surveys
about people's happiness

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.730
and so on and so forth.

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:11.896
Is that your question?

00:57:11.896 --> 00:57:13.294
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:16.192 --> 00:57:17.900
FRANK SCHILBACH: Oh,
I think this is just

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:23.390
trying to predict it
using the demographics.

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:25.970
So I think one of the key--

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:28.640
the key weakness of the
study is two things.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.010
They just do not
have data on like,

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:34.460
does the respondent actually
smoke, so they only know,

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.292
essentially, household
characteristics, how

00:57:36.292 --> 00:57:38.000
rich are they are,
and so on and so forth

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.310
from, essentially, a
bunch of survey questions.

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:44.370
But there's no actual question
of, do you smoke or not?

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:46.220
And so that's why,
in part, this paper,

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:49.190
in fact, is not published
in a top journal, the reason

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.080
being that exactly
that's the issue.

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.050
A, you don't actually know
whether the person smokes.

00:57:54.050 --> 00:57:57.562
B, it could be that it's a
spouse of a smoker that's

00:57:57.562 --> 00:57:58.520
answering the question.

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:01.010
So we kind of know that the
propensity of that household

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:03.980
to smoke from other data sets
when we try to just predict

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:07.280
smoking using these
demographics is high,

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.290
but we don't actually
know in the specific cases

00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:10.730
are people smoking,
which makes it

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:16.170
sort of vulnerable to these
kinds of concerns, yeah.

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:16.830
OK.

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:20.400
Let me talk briefly
about a fertilizer

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.100
and then summarize a little
bit the evidence that we saw.

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.820
So this is a paper by Esther
Duflo and Michael Kremer,

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.390
who recently won a Nobel
Prize in economics.

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:33.220
Esther Duflo is in the Economics
Department at MIT as well,

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.020
and Michael Kremer
is at Harvard.

00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:40.230
It's a paper with John
Robinson from 2011 in the AR.

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:41.970
What this paper looks
at is fertilizer

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:44.250
used in Western
Kenya, and this is

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:46.597
one of these technologies
in developing countries

00:58:46.597 --> 00:58:48.180
where there's quite
a bit of evidence,

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:51.630
and people think the returns
to using fertilizer are high.

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:53.550
That's a thing that
farmers could use.

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:54.780
Essentially, it would
increase your yields.

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:57.030
The returns are on the order
of magnitude of like 50%,

00:58:57.030 --> 00:59:01.210
100% often over the course
of like a few months.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:05.230
So it's a really highly
profitable type of investment.

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:07.140
It's also like a
divisible investment.

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:09.510
It's not like a cow, or
like a tractor, or something

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:11.910
where you have to save a lot
of money to actually buy it.

00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:14.130
This is a thing where you
can buy like a kilo or 5

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:15.360
kilos of fertilizer.

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:21.853
You can lose very small amounts
of money and then start saving.

00:59:21.853 --> 00:59:23.520
And if the returns
are really that high,

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:27.140
people are just using it and
then become richer over time.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.573
Now, there's a
persistent finding

00:59:29.573 --> 00:59:30.990
that fertilizer
use, in particular

00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:32.880
in sub-Saharan Africa,
tends to be low,

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:36.360
including in Western Kenya
and the area of this study.

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.880
Now, one explanation
that people often say

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.345
is that farmers would like
to purchase fertilizer.

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:44.220
When you ask them around
the time of harvest,

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:45.390
which is when they
have a lot of money--

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:47.040
so there are these
harvest cycles.

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.777
Farmers farm maize in this area.

00:59:49.777 --> 00:59:51.610
When you ask them around
the time of harvest

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:53.970
when people have lots of money
and ask them about their plans

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:55.560
to purchase fertilizer,
they would say, oh, yeah,

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.393
I'd love to put this
fertilizer, it's great,

00:59:57.393 --> 00:59:58.600
and so on and so forth.

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.480
But then lots of stuff comes up.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.610
Lots of expenses
pile up, school fees,

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:06.090
and friends ask for
money, and other festivals

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:07.352
and so on and so forth.

01:00:07.352 --> 01:00:09.060
So then when the actual
new season comes,

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.018
when the planting time
or the top dressing time

01:00:11.018 --> 01:00:12.810
comes when the maize
is a little bit higher

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.060
and you're supposed to add
fertilizer to your maize,

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.670
then people don't
have any money left.

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:20.468
Now, one way to
overcome this issue

01:00:20.468 --> 01:00:23.010
was-- essentially, the best kind
of commitment and some sense

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:25.930
is to just do the thing
that you're planning to do,

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:28.690
and that's exactly what they're
doing in this experiment.

01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:31.380
So what they're doing is they
vary the timing of the purchase

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.290
decision and offer people
time-limited discounts

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:36.030
around the time of harvest.

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:38.880
So around the time of harvest,
they give a very small discount

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.490
and say, you can
essentially buy fertilizer,

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.230
and that's going to
be delivered to you

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:45.480
around the time of harvest.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.250
But you have to
buy it right now.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:50.610
And they get these different
forms of discounts,

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:52.695
but essentially, the
discounts tend to be small.

01:00:52.695 --> 01:00:54.570
And the key part here
is that these discounts

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:56.370
are time-limited,
as in like it's only

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.980
around the time of harvest, so
you can only do it right now.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.770
You cannot procrastinate it in
any way and say, oh, next week,

01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:04.390
or in two weeks, or three weeks
from now, I'm going to do it.

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:06.390
And so that's essentially
a form of a commitment

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:07.990
device in the sense
of, in some ways,

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:10.260
the best commitment device
of, when you want something

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.260
to get done, you can just
do it, and then you're

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.020
essentially done.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:16.650
So people do these early
purchases of fertilizer,

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:18.833
and nobody resells
it or the like.

01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:20.250
That's just not a
thing people do.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:22.042
In principle, they
could obviously do that,

01:01:22.042 --> 01:01:24.510
but that tends to
be not the case.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.070
And what they find,
in a sense-- they

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:29.820
find very large effects of
this type of commitment device

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.470
or the early purchase option.

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:34.350
Even when the discount is
very small, very minor-- often

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:36.330
it's just like delivery
to people's homes

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:38.902
from the fertilizer store,
which is not very hard to do.

01:01:38.902 --> 01:01:40.860
So even when this discount
is relatively small,

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.770
there's large effects on
people fertilizer use.

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.920
And the effects are much larger
than like offering people

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.840
discounts around the
time of planting.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.340
So they have another
condition where

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.990
they say, around the
time of planting,

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:55.510
when the time comes to
actually use fertilizer,

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:57.648
they have a 50% discount
around that time.

01:01:57.648 --> 01:01:59.190
But essentially,
that discount almost

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:01.080
does nothing, the
reason being that, when

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.747
people have run out
of money, it doesn't

01:02:02.747 --> 01:02:03.930
matter what the price is.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:07.230
You can't buy any fertilizer
because you're cash-constrained

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:08.640
and can't buy it.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.820
Now, that's a very interesting
finding, in part for policy,

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.040
because there's also
quite a bit of concerns

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.620
about over-adoption, about
fertilizer subsidies being

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.790
very expensive, and
so on and so forth.

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:21.330
And now, when you provide
time-limited discounts

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:23.670
around the time of harvest
that are very small,

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.140
you can potentially,
essentially,

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.480
not spend a lot of money,
have large increases

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.010
in fertilizer use
among the people

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:31.177
who have self-control
problems, among the people who

01:02:31.177 --> 01:02:33.090
would actually like
to use fertilizer.

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:38.970
If instead you provide discounts
around the time of planting

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:41.820
of 50% or higher, A, that's
really expensive to do,

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.660
and governments, in particular
in Kenya or sub-Saharan Africa

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.640
in general, tend to not
have a lot of money.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.620
So it's a very
expensive thing to do.

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.020
Plus, you're also distorting
a lot of decisions

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.760
among exponential discounters.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.510
What you're doing is,
now I'm giving you--

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:57.493
I'm making fertilizer
much cheaper for you.

01:02:57.493 --> 01:02:59.160
If you don't have a
self-control problem

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.950
to start with, you're going to
overuse fertilizer because now,

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:05.020
essentially, fertilizer is like
artificially cheap for you,

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:05.520
essentially.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.770
So you push some people
to overuse fertilizer

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:11.160
using an actual discount
around the time of planting.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.110
Instead, what this policy
does-- essentially,

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:15.690
it gives very small discounts
that are very cheap,

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:20.167
and it mostly affects people
with self-control problems.

01:03:20.167 --> 01:03:21.750
Those are the people
who, essentially,

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:23.710
would procrastinate
buying fertilizer.

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:24.840
They buy it right now.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.372
They don't spend a
lot of money on it,

01:03:27.372 --> 01:03:29.580
and you could have potentially
large effects, as they

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.460
have shown in this paper.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.840
Any questions on this?

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.660
Yeah?

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.758
AUDIENCE: Did they
do a part where

01:03:37.758 --> 01:03:40.535
they show that farmers
become more sophisticated?

01:03:40.535 --> 01:03:41.920
FRANK SCHILBACH:
No, they do not.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.010
They have, essentially,
one-shot decisions for farmers,

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:48.700
and they sort of have some
effects over the course

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.660
of several seasons.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:54.560
But it's essentially not
the same choices and so on.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.610
So this is, in some sense, an
early paper that doesn't quite

01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:58.480
look into that.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.910
Some of their work on
sophistication and naivete

01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:03.130
comes a little later.

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:05.770
So let me briefly summarize and
talk a little bit about people

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:08.570
feeling when it comes to
using commitment devices.

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.330
So I've shown you
several examples

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:12.040
and there are quite
a few more examples

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.700
of demand for commitment in
different research studies.

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.450
These are all research
studies that people

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:18.610
have done one way or the other.

01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:20.290
Often, there's a
significant share

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.877
of people who demand commitment
one way or the other.

01:04:22.877 --> 01:04:25.210
That's [INAUDIBLE] there's a
significant share of people

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:28.330
who struggle with self-control
problems in some way,

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:30.940
and they also are at least
partially sophisticated

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.730
because they sort of understand
it and demand commitment.

01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:37.810
Now, there's also like a very
high variation in the fraction

01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:39.280
of people demanding commitment.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.470
In some places, it's very
high, as I showed you

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:44.680
in the alcohol examples
and in some other examples

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.450
that I haven't
necessarily shown you.

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:49.010
In other examples, like, for
example, in the smoking example

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.052
and so on, the demand for
commitment tends to be,

01:04:51.052 --> 01:04:52.940
actually, quite low.

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:53.860
So why is that?

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.500
Well, we don't actually
know necessarily.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.155
There's a few explanations
that people have.

01:05:00.155 --> 01:05:01.280
One of them is uncertainty.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.380
People might be really
worried about the risk.

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.110
So if you have lots of
uncertainty in your life,

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.910
if you don't know
whether next month you're

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:09.805
going to be smoking or not, or
you might have a really-- you

01:05:09.805 --> 01:05:11.770
might have a really
stressful month next month

01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:12.810
and you don't probably
know whether that's

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:14.590
going be stressful
or not, you might not

01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:16.548
want to choose a commitment
device because it's

01:05:16.548 --> 01:05:17.988
very costly for
you, potentially,

01:05:17.988 --> 01:05:19.780
because you might start
smoking again or do

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.930
other things for reasons that
are not necessarily related

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:23.860
to self-control.

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.450
It's just out of your control.

01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:28.042
Similarly, for example,
in the data entry example

01:05:28.042 --> 01:05:29.500
that I showed you,
people might not

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.470
choose to have a positive
target because they're really

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.960
worried about risk,
and in particular,

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.520
one characteristic
that was very much

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.310
predictive of whether people
choose these commitment

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.290
devices, whether
they have kids--

01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:43.390
the reason being that the kids--

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.290
they might be sick.

01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:46.970
They might have really bad
nights and so on and so forth,

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:49.345
and so that's an
increase-- that's

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:53.630
the risk of data entry
productivity in the future.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:55.450
So one part is uncertainty.

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:56.800
A second part is naivete.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.180
Partial naivete can get people
to not purchase or demand

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.850
certain commitment devices,
and naivete might vary it

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:05.380
quite a bit across settings.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.920
It might be that
you might just be

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.590
like a first-time customer
or a first-time user

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:13.572
of either payday
loans or of drinking,

01:06:13.572 --> 01:06:14.530
and smoking, and so on.

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:15.970
You might be quite naive.

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:18.430
In contrast, in my
setting in Chennai

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.483
when I looked at
drinkers, there people

01:06:20.483 --> 01:06:22.150
have been drinking
for many, many years.

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:24.760
In some sense, they're not as
naive about their drinking,

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.370
at least overall.

01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:29.742
Another aspect is experience
with commitment devices,

01:06:29.742 --> 01:06:31.450
and this is what your
question was about.

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.450
Like when you provide
people commitment devices,

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:35.485
maybe it requires some
learning over time.

01:06:35.485 --> 01:06:37.360
And again, if you look
at different settings,

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.550
people have different
types of experience.

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:41.950
Overall, we don't know the
answer to these questions.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.992
In a sense, we don't
actually know exactly what's

01:06:43.992 --> 01:06:46.060
going on why is demand
for commitment quite

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.720
different across settings.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.332
A second question that we don't
really know is like, well,

01:06:50.332 --> 01:06:51.790
so there are these
research studies

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.975
that look at commitment
device and say, OK,

01:06:53.975 --> 01:06:55.600
commitment devices,
at least in theory,

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.180
should help some people.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.090
But we see actually very
few real-world examples

01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:03.478
that actually help.

01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:05.020
Yesterday, you
mentioned some of them

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.490
that seem to be at least
helpful for some of you.

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.475
By the way, if you
would email me those,

01:07:09.475 --> 01:07:11.590
I'd like to collect
them and report back

01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:16.090
to David Laibson who says
uncertainty is the issue.

01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:18.560
But we don't have it really
figured out in some sense.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.443
If commitment devices
were really that great,

01:07:20.443 --> 01:07:22.360
you would think that it
really would take off.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.318
There would be a company
that would really make

01:07:24.318 --> 01:07:25.610
a lot of money with using them.

01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:27.693
There are some companies
that we see in the world,

01:07:27.693 --> 01:07:29.290
but it's not really--
it can't really

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:31.330
say it has really
fully taken off,

01:07:31.330 --> 01:07:33.730
perhaps some companies
related to cell phone

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:35.740
usage, or computer
usage, and so on,

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:39.430
but it's not as prevalent and
widely used as we might expect,

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.400
given the theory
literature that we have.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.250
Now, one important
part that's really

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:49.840
another potential contributor
to [INAUDIBLE] demand

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.040
for commitment is that
people might not only

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.200
be naive in a sense that
they might not understand

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.140
the value of commitment devices
and then that might prevent

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:02.410
them from taking them up,
but even conditional demand

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:04.540
commitments they might fail.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.460
And there's a couple
of examples here.

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:12.310
For example, in the Philippines
savings accounts example

01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:15.760
that I showed you, the SEED
commitment savings account--

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.279
and John has a very nice
paper that shows that.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:22.000
In fact, when you look
at the same setting,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.149
a similar experiment, offering
people this commitment contract

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:27.100
has positive effects
on people's savings.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.020
So people do actually
save more on average

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.680
compared to a control group.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.560
However, there's also
a pretty large fraction

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.819
of people who fail in
reaching their goals,

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:40.060
and then often they have to pay
some penalty for doing that.

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.643
Now, that's really bad
marketing for your product.

01:08:42.643 --> 01:08:44.310
If you think about
selling this product,

01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:47.460
if half of your customers
are really unhappy about it,

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.182
that's going to be
very tricky to do.

01:08:49.182 --> 01:08:51.390
So there's lots of questions
about how to best design

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:54.180
commitment devices, how
can we perhaps target

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:57.310
customers who might not fail and
perhaps design them differently

01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:59.310
for different people, but
we haven't necessarily

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:01.290
figured out how to do that.

01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:04.200
Liang Bai and Gautam
Rao and co-authors

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.490
have a similar example of
a health commitment product

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:10.229
in India where,
essentially, they're

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:14.590
trying to incentivize people to
go to hypertension doctor visit

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:17.473
to get checkups for
their hypertension.

01:09:17.473 --> 01:09:19.140
Lots of people say
they would like to go

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.370
and so on and so forth.

01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:22.260
You offer them
commitment devices

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:25.649
to essentially provide
themselves incentives to go.

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:28.540
Pretty few people actually
sign up in the first place,

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.729
which is also consistent
with some form of naivete

01:09:30.729 --> 01:09:34.050
and so on and so forth, but even
among the people who sign up,

01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:35.910
lots of people actually fail.

01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:38.729
So you end up having people
who essentially set themselves

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:40.029
incentives to go to the doctor.

01:09:40.029 --> 01:09:42.390
They're willing to pay
for going in the future

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:43.979
or setting themselves
incentives to go

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:46.423
to the doctor in the
future, and then they

01:09:46.423 --> 01:09:47.340
have these incentives.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.507
And then the incentives are
actually not successful,

01:09:49.507 --> 01:09:50.790
and they end up not going.

01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:54.870
Again, that's very
much consistent

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:57.330
with naivete or at
least partial naivete

01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:00.510
or partial sophistication.

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:02.700
And there's many
questions now about,

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.000
if that's the case, how do
we design better commitment

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.040
devices that work
for more people that

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.960
are more successful for
people, and how do we

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.270
avoid that some people
sign up for them when they,

01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:14.730
in fact, are doing worse
because, again, that's really

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:16.260
bad marketing for your product.

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:18.757
And of course, it's bad for
the people who are doing worse.

01:10:18.757 --> 01:10:21.090
They would be, essentially,
better off if they had never

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:27.510
been offered this
device, at least ex post.

01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:30.810
Any questions on this?

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.158
So then, very briefly,
there's a second view

01:10:33.158 --> 01:10:35.700
that you might have is to say,
well, maybe commitment devices

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:36.810
are just not that helpful.

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.060
In some sense, we have not
figured out how to do this.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.610
Companies have had lots of
time to figure this out.

01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:43.223
Researchers have
not figured this out

01:10:43.223 --> 01:10:44.640
in a sense of
like-- well, we have

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.380
lots of evidence of
demand for commitment

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.795
in terms of people wanting
commitment devices.

01:10:48.795 --> 01:10:51.420
We have, actually, not that much
evidence of commitment devices

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:55.770
being useful in the real world
in the sense of persistently

01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:58.188
showing that they
make things better.

01:10:58.188 --> 01:10:59.730
There are some
examples, to be clear.

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:01.920
For example, the
data entry example

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.200
does show that people are
more productive at work,

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.618
and probably employers
should do that.

01:11:06.618 --> 01:11:08.160
But another view
would be like, well,

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.290
if commitment devices
are not really helping--

01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:13.230
so think of commitment devices
as a way of providing people

01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:16.080
some choice options for given
self-control problems or given

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.280
naivete.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.750
Now, there's different
things you could do.

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:21.240
You could do some
things in terms

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.153
of trying to address
people's naivete,

01:11:23.153 --> 01:11:25.570
and the problems ask you a
little bit to think about that.

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:28.740
How do you actually
get people to be

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.920
less naive if that depresses
demand for commitment?

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.890
Another way to say is you
could try to essentially try

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.540
to reduce people's
present bias or get

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.923
at the sources of people's
present bias overall.

01:11:38.923 --> 01:11:40.590
There's different
ways, and we have only

01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:42.720
started thinking
about or coming up

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.240
with some potential
explanations,

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.380
but for example, a paper
that we have on sleep

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.240
finds that when
people are napping

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.260
in the afternoon, which some
of you do also in my class--

01:11:55.260 --> 01:12:00.180
that reduces your present bias
and [INAUDIBLE] task and also

01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.020
savings.

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.900
So that's to say, perhaps sleep,
perhaps alcohol consumption,

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:06.540
perhaps other sort
of factors might

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:09.540
affect people's present bias,
so if you could understand

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.300
these underlying factors and
if you could tackle them,

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.120
that would be another way of
getting around, potentially,

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.280
self-control problems
causing trouble

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.400
by getting at the root
of this particular issue

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.690
if you think that's
an issue overall.

01:12:22.690 --> 01:12:25.480
There's some other research
that I find quite interesting,

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:31.530
which is the idea that present
bias is very much related

01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:33.150
to attention in the
sense that people

01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:36.333
pay too much attention to the
present compared to the future.

01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:38.250
So now, if you could
sort make the future more

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.750
salient in certain ways, if you
could make people think more

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:42.750
about the future, how
things will be like,

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.880
they might behave
more patiently.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.760
So Hal Hershfield has
a series of papers,

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.030
and Hal Hershfield is the guy on
the left, the picture that you

01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:56.893
see, who used computer software
to make people look older.

01:12:56.893 --> 01:12:58.310
So on the right
of the screen, you

01:12:58.310 --> 01:13:01.680
see Hal Hershfield like another
40 years old or something,

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:04.050
and so what they did is
they tried to show people,

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:06.360
essentially, pictures
of their old ourselves.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.910
And this is how you're going
to look like in 40, 50 years

01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:11.370
from now, and then
think about how

01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:14.320
things might be like
in terms of your health

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.297
and so on and so forth.

01:13:15.297 --> 01:13:17.130
And then get people to
make savings choices.

01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:18.630
And there's some
evidence, at least,

01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:21.330
that increasing people's focus
and attention to the future

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:24.020
might actually make
them more patient,

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.860
and there's quite a
bit of work of people

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.080
trying to do that right now.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.880
So just to give you
a brief summary--

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.090
I think I said already almost
everything that's to be said--

01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:36.240
exponential discounting
is like a workhorse model

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.230
of modern economics.

01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:38.490
It's extremely important.

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:41.070
And just to be clear, it's
helpful for many applications,

01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:42.828
and it's been a very
successful model.

01:13:42.828 --> 01:13:45.120
There's some limitations and
some things that we cannot

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.270
explain, so quasi-hyperbolic
discounting or some forms

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:51.690
of different discounting
models might be able to improve

01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:55.163
the predictability
of our models.

01:13:55.163 --> 01:13:56.580
Commitment devices,
in particular,

01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:59.118
may help improve outcomes,
but we haven't quite

01:13:59.118 --> 01:14:00.660
figured out how to
make them actually

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.980
most useful for the world.

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:05.740
There's lots of research
going on in this area.

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:08.230
Next week, we're going to
talk about risk preferences.

01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:10.260
In particular, I'd like
you to read the paper

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.360
by Rabin and Thaler, 2001.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.160
In recitation this
week, there will be more

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.230
on time preferences,
in particular related

01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:19.380
to the next problem
set, and then

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.390
sort of an introduction
to risk preferences.

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:24.270
If you don't remember
what risk preferences are,

01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:26.280
you should very much come
to recitation and get

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.490
a refresher of that.

01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:29.480
Thank you very much.

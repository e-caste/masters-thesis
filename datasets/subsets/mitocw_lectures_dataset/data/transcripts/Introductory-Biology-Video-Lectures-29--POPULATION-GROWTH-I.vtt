WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And, we're going to make a major
shift.  You're going to feel like

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
this is a whole different class
compared to what we were talking

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about last time,
because were jumping from the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
biogeochemical cycles,
or looking at the biosphere as

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
essentially a large biochemical
machine, to studying individual

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
populations of organisms,
and the communities that they make

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
up when they come together.
So, before we were really talking

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
about organisms as they function in
the biosphere.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Mentally, we're grinding them all
up and thinking of them as a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
collective biochemistry basically.
And now we are going to stop

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
grinding them up,
mentally, and think of them as

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
individual organisms.
So, the next series of lectures,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we're going to talk about population
ecology.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If you remember the first lecture I
gave we talked about the hierarchy

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
of organization within ecological
systems, and then we are going to

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
talk about competition between
organisms with a population,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and between organisms of different
species, and were going to talk

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
about predation, and mutualism.
These are all interactions between

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
organisms that affect the fitness of
organisms.  And then we'll,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
at the end, talk about community
structure.  So this is sort of the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
outline for the rest of my lectures,
not for this lecture.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So, today we are going to talk about
properties of populations.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We're going to analyze how we
measure growth rate,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.000
growth and death in populations,
and this will include populations

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that have an age structure,
and populations that don't.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And this is all in preparation for
the next lecture where we will talk

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
about human population growth.
So, in this field of population

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
ecology, which is as I told you in
the first lecture,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and some universities you could take
three courses in population ecology,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and you could get a Ph.D. in
population ecology.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I mean, this is a whole field that
we're going to cover in two lectures.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But what population ecologists
worry about fundamentally,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
well, they don't worry about it.
This is what they study, is what

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
regulates the density of populations?
Obviously, it's a function of how

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
fast they're growing,
the birth rate, and how fast they're

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
dying, the death rate.
But what are the factors that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
actually influence those rates?
Is it competition with other

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
organisms?  Is it the entire
structure of the community?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Is it the availability of food?
Is it the various abiotic

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
properties of the environment:
temperature, etc.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So, they analyze these and
basically try to model the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
population growth as a function of
these various parameters.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
The other questions they ask,
is how are populations distributed

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in the environment?
Are they clustered?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Are they evenly distributed?
This has specific meanings about

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
their ecology.
And, the other thing that people

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are really fascinated by,
which is a really tough question,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
is why are some species' populations
extremely abundant, while

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
others are rare?
And one of the discussions we always

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
have in my lab,
we work on an organism that's

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
extremely abundant,
this prochlorococcus,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which I told you briefly about,
is the most abundant photosynthetic

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
cell on the planet.
So, my students tend to keep saying

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
why is it so successful?
And I keep saying, it's successful

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but there are thousands of other
species who are also successful.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Abundance does not equal success.
Endurance equals success.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you're here in the next
generation, you're successful.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
If you're not, if your species is
disappearing, then you're not

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
successful.  So,
speaking of abundance,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
let's talk about how we measure
abundance, population ecologists.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And this is just one example.
Obviously, for microorganisms,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
or some microorganisms it's really
easy because they're tiny relative

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
to their habitats.
So for the prochlorococcus that we

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
work on, there are 10^5 cells per
milliliter.  So,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
we can go take a milliliter of water
and measure how many cells there.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But for some organisms, larger ones,
that are widely distributed,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
it's not that easy.  So, one method
is mark and recapture.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
That's used a lot for things like
birds and butterflies.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
For a bird, the mark would be
putting a band on the bird.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
For a butterfly, they often take a
magic marker and put a mark on the

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
wing.  Well, that's largely what
they do.  You try to mark

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
individuals in some way that would
not influence their survivorship

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
rate.
So, if N equals the population size,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that is, that's our unknown, what
we're going to do is capture,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
say, for butterflies or moths,
you use a butterfly net, or moths

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
you can use a light to track them;
for birds, you put up these big mist

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
nets.  They fly into them; they get
tangled up a little bit but they

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
don't get hurt.
Then you band them,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and that we let them go.
That's the way you mark them.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So, we're going to say n1 equals the
total number of marked individuals

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000
released.  So you capture them,
you mark them, you release them.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:24.000
n2 is equal to, and then you go out
sometime later and you recapture as

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
many individuals as you can find,
and this would be the total number

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000
[SIREN] that doesn't sound like a
fire drill, does it?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I assume we're good to go here.
So, n2 is the total number of

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:00.000
recaptured.  And we're going to say
m2 is equal to the numbers

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.000
recaptured that are marked.
OK, and then we assume that the

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000
fraction of the recaptured that are
marked represent the fraction in the

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000
total population that was marked.
So, we say m2 over  n2 is equal to

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
n1 over N.
And the number that we're looking

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
for, population size,
is equal to n1, n2 divided by m2.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So, of course, this assumes that
there's no effect of the marking of

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the individuals.
It assumes that there's no bias in

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
the trapping for the marked or not
marked individuals.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There's all kinds of assumptions
that underlie this.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's a start for assessing the
population size.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
OK, so how do we measure population
growth?  We're going to first start

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
with looking at populations that
have age structure.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Now, I hope you printed out the
slides that were on the Web,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
because I'm depending on these
overheads a lot for this lecture

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
because we wouldn't get through any
of it if I wrote all this

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
stuff on the board.
So, we're going to talk about

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.000
populations that have an age
structure.  And the data I'm going

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to show you here is for
human populations.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But this applies to any population
that has differential birth and

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.000
death rates as a function of the age
of the organism,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:30.000
OK?  So, in these populations if
birth rate and death rate are high,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the population is dominated by young
people.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And, we'll look at this in a minute.
And, if B and D are low,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
dominated by old people,
or older I should say, since I now

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
fit into the old category.
OK, so here's a typical population

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
age distribution for developed
countries, where each slice here,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
these are females on the right,
males on the left,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and each slice is an age category:
zero to 10 years, 10 to 20.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And you can see that in these kinds
of populations,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
you have a fairly even age
distribution.  Long periods of no

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
net growth in a population lead to
this.  In these developed countries,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and we're going to examine why this
is, there's basically an even

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
replacement rate of children for
adults.  And one of the things we

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
worry about when you see this kind
of age distribution,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
although it's good in terms of
population growth,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
is when you have few young people
and a lot of older people,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
who's going to take care of them,
which is what's behind the Social

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Security crisis.
But we won't get into that.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Since you're the young people and
I'm the old people,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I don't want to dwell on that.
OK, so what demographers do for

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
human populations is project what
the population will look like in the

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
future based on the reproductive
rates of the present.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And you can see for the US here,
it's reasonably stable if you look

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
at these three snapshots.
We're going to go backwards

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
starting with 1950,
and show you what the population has

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
been doing since 1950.
And I'm just going to walk through

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
this.  You only have one in your
handouts, but I'll show you how it's

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
moving along.
Moving along, you can think of this

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
as generations moving through the
population.  And this is the date up

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
here.  So, this is 1950,
1955, you can see this red cohort.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
A cohort is a group of individuals
that were born at roughly the same

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
time.  So, you can see that red
cohort there.  And we are going

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
along, 1965.  This lip here,
that we can now see, is the postwar

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
baby boom.
That's what I'm a member of.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
If you can see it in this bulge in
this population.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And now were marching along.
Here's my cohort, and I just put

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
these lines on to keep you oriented.
And here comes you guys.  I think

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
those are you guys,
1985.  That's roughly right,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
because I never know when I've last
updated these slides.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So, and here you go.
See, here's the big bulge of all of

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
these baby boomers that you guys are
going to have to take care of.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And now, we can actually see an
echo.  This is what's called the

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
baby boom echo.
These are the kids of the baby

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
boomers, which is you guys.
But you can only see that as we

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
march through it.
So, here we are at 2020.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But you get the impression that
it's a fairly stable,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
now, even age distribution in the US
and these developed countries.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Oops, here we go a little but more.
Sorry.  2035, 2045, OK.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Now, in less developed countries,
the birth rate's high and the death

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
rate's low.  We see a much different
age distribution.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And here's Uganda,
with a very high reproductive rate

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
showing the projections to 2050.
And here, we can march through from

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
1970.  You can see that this huge
expansion, do you know what that

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
noise is?  OK.
Does anybody have a hypothesis for

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
what that noise is that
we could test?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Oh, OK, I guess we can't do anything
about that.  OK,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
so here's Uganda.
And you can see the dramatic

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
difference in a population where
there is large birthrates,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and reducing death rates.  And we're
going to get into analyzing that in

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
the next lecture.
I just want to show you this here

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
so you have a feeling for what we
are talking about in age

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
structured populations.
So, let's now look at how are going

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
to analyze these populations to try
to quantify growth rates or

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
replacement rates.
And to do this, we set up life

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
tables.  And this is basically what
insurance agencies do for human

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
populations.  But we do the same
thing for populations of ecological

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
interests.  We use the
same techniques.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
In this lecture,
going to use a unicorn is my example,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
because I can make up the numbers
because they don't exist.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
But in a textbook there are
examples for real organisms like

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
lizards and things like that.
OK, so we need to define an age

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
interval, X, and then this is the
number of intervals in the original

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
cohort.  Again,
a cohort is a group of individuals

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
that are born within a
defined age interval.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I mean, I think of you guys as a
cohort.  DX is the number dying

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
during that interval.
All of this is on the Web.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
These slides are on the Web.
So, you don't need to write it down,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
but you can.  And,
NX is that number of individuals

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
surviving to age X.
LX is the portion of individuals

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
surviving to age X.
So, that's just equal to NX divided

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
by N0. And, we're going to look at a
table that shows this in a minute.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And MX is something that's
measured.  It's the per capita

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
births during age interval X to X
plus one.  And this is also called

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
age-specific fecundity.
And you can think of it as the

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
number of female offspring produced
per female in a particular

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000
age category.
OK, is everybody comfortable with

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:21.000
that?  So, with these definitions,
we're going to build a life table

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:31.000
that will allow us to actually
calculate some things of interest.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
And, what do we want to calculate?
We want to calculate the

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:50.000
survivorship probability,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:02.000
LX. We want to calculate the net
replacement rate.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000
No it's not really a rate,
net replacement of population per

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:19.000
generation, which we are calling R0.
It's basically the number of

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:27.000
children people have to replace
who's there per generation.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And then, for now, this is what we
are going to look at.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And to do that,
we are going to generate what's

00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:00.000
called a cohort life table.
And to do this, we follow a cohort

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:11.000
of individuals throughout lifetime.
Or, we can also generate a static

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.000
life table because it's not that
easy sometimes to have a group of

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.000
organisms that are born at the same
time to follow them throughout their

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000
entire lifetime.
So there is a static life table of

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
taking a snapshot at one time of the
population, and calculating the age

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
structure.  So,
you take a snapshot,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
and we look at the age structure.
And, we are going to do this in a

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000
second so it will make more sense.
OK, so we've defined our terms.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And now, we are going to start by
calculating LX.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000
So, this is a cohort life table for
unicorns.  We're going to start out

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
with a hundred baby unicorns that we
have in our imaginary unicorn pen.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
So, this is a cohort size of 100.
And, we find that after a year there

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000
are 50 of them left.
50 of them die in the first year.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:42.000
So, the probability here, the
proportion surviving is 0.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:50.000
, NX over N0,  and then a year later,
.4, .3, and then by four years older,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:58.000
no unicorns left.
They don't live very long.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:06.000
All right, so this is what's called
the survivorship probability,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
and what we can do is look at there.
Different types of organisms have

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
different, what we call,
survivorship curves.  And this is

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
discussed in your textbook.
We'll just describe the extremes.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
These are just theoretical
survivorship curves.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
But some organisms have a very high
probability of survival as a

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
function of age until they
reach an old age.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
And then, they have a very low
probability of survival.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
There are other organisms whose
survivorship probability drops very

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
fast, right after they're born.
But if they make it through that

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
interval, they're pretty good to go.
And then there are some that have a

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:08.000
steady probability of dying.
So, where are humans,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:20.000
do you think, on this?
Two?  No, but that's OK.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Let me ask you the other way; where
our frogs, do you think?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Yeah, OK, so you got that image.
Tons of frogs' eggs: everybody eats

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
them.  Or for that matter,
the video I showed towards the end

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
of the last class where there were
all those eggs of,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
what was that?  Remember all those
eggs that everybody was eating?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Herring, thank you.  So, any
organism that puts out just tons of

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
fertilized eggs,
and knowing that most of them will

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
be eaten, but some of them will
survive, falls here.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And, humans actually fall here.
Any organism that has a high

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
investment in the care of offspring,
they have few offspring but they

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
invest a lot into the care of those
offspring, would fall here.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And then this, actually birds and
things fall here.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
So, here's some real but idealized
survivorship curves.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
These are humans.  And males and
females are different.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
I'm not sure whether we understand
that completely yet.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Does anybody know whether that's
socially constructed?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Now that there's more women
experiencing equal stress in the

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
workplace as there are men that will
probably even out.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
But, I think there are more women
born, or girl babies.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Anyway, there's some interesting
biology behind this,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
but I don't know.
I don't remember.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
And, here's grass,
of course grass spew out all these

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
seeds everywhere,
and very few of them survive,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
also these frogs, etc. and birds are
commonly like this,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
where they're somewhere in between.
Why do we care so much about

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
survivorship curves?
Who cares?  Well, I mean they're

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
inherently interesting to population
ecologists, but there are

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
also uses for them.
For example, if you want to conserve

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
a species, if you're worried about a
species going extinct,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
you want to figure out whether it's
better to conserve the young ones or

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
the old ones.  For example,
turtle species, you would pick a

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
certain age group where the
probability of survival is high,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
and decide to target the
conservation of that age group.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
So, let's continue with,
we are building our life table here.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
So, we have the survivorship
probability, but what we really want

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
to get at is understanding whether
or not the population that we are

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
describing is replacing itself with
each generation.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
So, maybe we should define,
when R0 is equal to one, that meets

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
the population is exactly
replacing itself.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:45.000
So, this is replacing,
so the actual growth rate of the

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:55.000
population would be steady.
If R0 is less than one, the number

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
of individuals is declining.
And R0 of greater than one,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
it's increasing.  So, we want to
know for our unicorns what that is.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
And to get to that, we have to know
something about the birth rates.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
So, MX is the average offspring per
female of age X.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
So, this is called the age-specific
fecundity.  And that's something

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
that's a known property
of the population.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Whoops, oh, my,
my, my, my, I'm missing a slide.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Oh, there we go.  They're out of
order.  OK, so we have MX.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:00.000
So, how do we calculate R0?
Well, R0 is the sum of LX MX.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:17.000
With the sum of the survivorship

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:25.000
times the age-specific fecundity,
and in this case, it sums up to

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000
three.  So, what's happening to our
unicorn population?  It's growing.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Yeah, we are getting three unicorns
in each generation for every one

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000
that existed before.
So, in our imaginary unit of our

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000
population, we're going to be knee
deep in unicorns pretty fast.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000
OK, so I forgot my watch, so I have
to look at my computer.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
What if we can't follow cohort?
Oh, thank you.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
How do we create the same kind of
analysis for a population that we

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
can't follow through time,
but can only look at as a snapshot?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
OK, this is where we go to the
slide.  If you don't have it in your

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
handout, it doesn't matter.
I just got off the web this morning.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I couldn't find a skeleton of the

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
unicorn because,
of course, that's totally imaginary,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
but I found a mastodon.  So, just
imagine that this is a unicorn,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
and I couldn't find a unicorn horn,
so this is a sheep's.  But, all

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
these principles apply.
I just discovered Images in Google,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
which is really exciting.  So,
you're going to get subjected

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
to this for awhile.
So, OK, so what you can do,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
and this has actually been done with
mountain sheep,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
is you go out you find dead sheep,
you find skeletons of sheep that

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
have died for whatever causes.
And you go out, and you sample

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
until you have,
say, 100 skeletons.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And that's your cohort that you're
looking at, at one point in time.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
And from their horn, you can
actually tell how old they

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
were when they died.
You can count the number of rings,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
so that's what's here, annual horn
rings.  This is for a dall mountain

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
sheep.  So, you can say well now it
died when it was two.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
That one died when it was 10.
That one died when it was whatever

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
age.  And then you can create the
same kind of life table,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
a static life table, where you have
a hundred skeletons.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
That is your cohort.
You look at the number dying of age

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
zero to one, the number of one year
olds, the number that died when they

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
were one year old,
the number that died when they were

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
a two-year-old etc.
And so, from these data,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
these are the data that you
collected, you can calculate this

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
column, NX, so NX is DX,
or NX minus DX equals NX plus one.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Does that make sense?  I can never
tell whether.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
I know if I write this on the board
it might be easier,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
but it's so obvious isn't it?
We are just saying that this is the

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
number that died at the age.
This is the number you started with,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
so that's how many are going to have
that age, that age,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
and that age.  And then,
once you have this column,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
your proportion surviving LX,
you can calculate LX.  LX equals NX

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
divided by N0, OK?
So, we are doing exactly the same

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
thing as we did before.
It's just that we're getting the NX

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
column instead of getting it by
following the cohort.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
We're getting it by calculating it
based on how old dead organisms were

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
when they died.
And in my ecology class that I

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
teach, some years we actually go out
to the Mount Auburn Cemetery.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000
And you can do this from human
gravestones.  You can go to the

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
cemetery, and pick out a number of
gravestones, and see the age at

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
which humans died.
You create yourself a cohort,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
and you can create a life table.
And you can do that for different

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:06.000
eras, and see how replacements
have changed.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.000
OK, now so that's the analysis for
populations that have an age

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.000
structure.  Now we are going to go
more into simpler type of population,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:29.000
and that is a population with a
stable age distribution.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And to do this,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
you're going to help me,
and we're going to use your calculus

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
that you've all been studying.
So, instead of the unicorn now,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
have your imaginary population be a
population of microbes

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
that divide in half.
They multiplied by dividing in half.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
So, each one of these is a microbe
that's dividing in half.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
This is your mental image.
This is what's called exponential

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000
growth.  It's obvious how that
happens.  And we're going to model

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
this population,
we're going to first assume

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:42.000
unlimited resources.
OK, so we're going to say that the

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:56.000
rate of population increase is equal
to the average birth rate minus the

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:11.000
average death rate times
the number of cells.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.000
OK, so we are going to now turn this
into math, and that is to say the

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:28.000
dN/dt, the increase in population
where N is the population number is

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:36.000
equal to the birth rate minus the
death rate times N which is the

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:46.000
number of cells, OK?
And then, we're going to let B minus

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:58.000
D, the birth rate minus the death
rate, be what we call r.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:08.000
And, this is what's called the
intrinsic rate of increase of a

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:19.000
population.  OK,
what are the units of r?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:30.000
One over time, exactly, time to the
minus one.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
So, let's look at that more
carefully.  And also,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000
it's a little misleading to say it's
the rate of increase because r can

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
be positive or negative,
however it turns out.  It can be

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000
positive or negative,
but that's what it's called.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
So, we have the dN/dt equals rN.
We're substituting r in this

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.000
equation for one over N
times dN/dt equals r.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000
OK, so ours has the unit time to the
minus one.  And so,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
let's ask a question.
Given N0  I give you the population

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000
density at some time which we're
going to call T equals zero.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Given a population growing
according to this,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
which is exponential growth,
what if we want to know the

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
population, what N
is at any time T?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
We want an equation that will give
us, given N0 what would the

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
population density be at some time,
T?  What do you have to do to this

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
to get that?  Yeah,
so who wants to do that for me?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Come on.  You guys did this freshman
year.  It's the easiest thing there

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.000
is, right?  Every class I've had has
had somebody who was willing to come

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:24.000
up and do this.
OK, so we'll just add a T there.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000
So, N at sometime T is equally to
N0 e to the rT.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And so,   We could say,
then, r equals natural log of NT

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
minus natural log of N0 divided by T.
And I like to write it that way

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000
because then, we know what this
looks like, right?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Let's plot that.  This is N and
this is T.  What does

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000
that look like?
I know this is really rudimentary

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000
but remember we're modeling
population growth.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
So here, if we plot the log of N,
and this is what we do with cultures

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
of microorganisms.
That's a flask.  Those are a lot of

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
microbes in there.
And what we do is we sample it at

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000
various points in time,
and if you take the log we get a

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.000
nice straight line that we can draw
a regression through.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:53.000
And what's the slope of that line
equal to?  r.  Exactly.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000
The growth rate in the units: N to
the minus one.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:12.000
OK, what's the Y intercept?
N0.  OK, now suppose we want to

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:25.000
calculate the doubling time of the
population, the time it

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:37.000
takes to double.
How would we do that?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Let's first define it.
It's the time, T, that it takes for

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:59.000
NT to equal to N0,
right?  If we start with N0 the

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:10.000
population doubles.
Then, that's the time at NT.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:22.000
So, we want to solve for that T for
the time it takes for the

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:33.000
population to double.
Since natural log of NT over N0

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:45.000
equals rT, then the natural log of,
sorry, 2N0 over N0 equals rT, and T

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:57.000
equals the natural log of two
divided by r equals our

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.000
doubling time.
Does that make sense?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
I'll put this out there so you can
see it better.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
What's the natural log of two?
0.69, thank you, always a handy

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
thing to have in our repertoire.
So, that's just the way, it's

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
easier to think about the time it
takes for a population to double

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
often, then the instantaneous
growth rate.

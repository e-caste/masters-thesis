00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.570
ADAM MARTIN: All right, so
today, I'm trying something

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.430
different this semester.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.300
I wanted to tell you
guys about one way

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.900
that you can discover
things in biology.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.380
And this is going to fall in the
genetics cluster of lectures.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.580
I want to show you how you
can go from being interested

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.580
in some property of an
organism, or even its behavior--

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.100
how would you go from
there to identifying

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.150
genes and mechanisms that
are responsible for that type

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.950
of behavior or appearance?

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.280
OK, so today, we're going to
go from some type of phenotype,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.510
or process that you're
interested in, such as maybe

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.240
the appearance of an organism.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.500
But we're even going
to go more abstract

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.110
than that because
at the end, I'm

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.740
going to tell you if you're
interested in behavior,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.710
you can try to figure out
the genes and mechanisms that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.870
are involved in determining
the behavior of an organism.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.410
So the question is, how
do you go from something

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.590
you're interested in learning
about an organism to actually

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.260
identifying genes and mechanisms
that are important for that?

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.440
And on my title slide
here, I have three fruit

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.370
fly mutant phenotypes
that you can see,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.330
and each of these
mutants defined

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.790
genes that were subsequently
found to be present--

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.270
or homologous genes
were present in humans

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.850
and were shown to play important
roles in human biology.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.130
So later on in the
lecture, hall kind

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.610
explain what each of
these phenotypes is.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.040
But first, I want
to just highlight

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.590
the importance of
model organisms

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.380
and their use in biology.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.990
You've been seeing them already.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.580
I've talked a bit
about flies, we

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.550
talked about
Mendel's pea plants.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.460
I just now have a compendium
of model organisms

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.100
that I'm going to throw
up to tell you about.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.510
So we've talked about bacteria
and the importance of bacteria

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.930
in elucidating the flow
of information from DNA

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.630
to RNA to protein.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.070
Bacteria we're also extremely
important for elucidating

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.230
the initial mechanisms
of gene regulation.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.470
I mentioned yeast a little
bit in the last lecture when

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.970
I mentioned tetrad analysis,
but we'll talk about yeast a lot

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.710
more later, when
we start talking

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.970
about the regulation of cell
division and the cell cycle,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.350
because yeast played a
pivotal role in identifying

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.190
the gene that's critical for
this decision of a cell whether

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.400
or not to divide.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.030
Also, one terrific
model organism in plants

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.520
is a Arabidopsis Thaliana.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.130
And Arabidopsis has also
played an important role

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.610
in elucidating mechanisms
of development, but also,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.170
in making advances in
scientific research that

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.050
relate to agriculture, such as
disease resistance and pathogen

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.160
interactions.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.830
So the two heroes
of today's lecture

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.600
will be the roundworm,
Caenorhabditis elegans,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.930
and the fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.800
But before getting into
study is in those organisms,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.100
I wanted to highlight a couple
important vertebrate-model

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.150
organisms--

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.420
the zebrafish and the mouse.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.140
And so you can see the
mouse is our lab mascot,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.660
but it's also an
important genetic model.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.820
In particular, there
are many models

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.190
in mice that mimic cancer.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.430
And so these have been
useful for elucidating

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.680
mechanisms of cancer.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.180
So it's really
unethical for us to do

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.270
a lot of different types
of experiments on humans,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.330
but I will mention that
there are human cell

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.060
lines, such as the
HeLa cell line,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.020
and these also play an important
role in biology research.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.960
But these cell lines are
taken out of context.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.950
They're not functioning in the
context of an entire organism.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.060
So human cell lines
are important,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.750
but you have to
understand that they're

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.270
sort of an in-vitro
system, that they're out

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.560
of the context of a
functioning organism.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.160
OK, so why is it that we
research these model organisms?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.400
So there are some
practical reasons.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.250
Most of them are fairly
small, and they're

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.760
easy to house large
numbers of them in a lab.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.310
They're often cheap to house
in the lab and work with.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.670
Also, they develop fast.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.550
And especially when
we consider genetics,

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.340
the rate-limiting step
in genetics research

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.610
is the time it takes
from the conception

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.370
of an organism to the time
that that organism can

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.800
reproduce sexually.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.870
So these model organisms--

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.670
most of them reproduce
very quickly,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.160
and so that accelerates
the pace of research.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.220
But maybe most
importantly is the fact

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.940
that we are related to each
of these model organisms

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.550
through evolution because we all
arose from a common ancestor.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.180
And just to highlight this
example, using the fruit fly,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.070
the fruit fly has 17,000 genes
when compared to our 20,000

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.520
genes, so we have roughly the
same order of magnitude number

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.870
of genes as the fruit fly.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.880
And so let's think
about important genes.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.980
Let's think about
just genes that are

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.320
associated with human diseases.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.860
If we just consider
human-disease causing genes,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.060
75% of the human-disease
causing genes

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.540
have a homologous
gene in the fruit fly.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.020
So we're similar to these model
organisms, such as the fruit

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.700
fly, in particular, genes that
are important for understanding

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.315
human disease.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.050
So I came across this quote
when preparing for the lecture,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.860
and I liked it.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.550
It's from John Rinn, who
is a contemporary of ours.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.160
And John Rinn said,
"Genetic approaches

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.270
are as fundamental to biology
as math is to physics."

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.950
And I think this is an apt quote
because both genetics and math

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.920
themselves are
scientific disciplines,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.780
but they can be leveraged to
learn things about biology

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.710
and physics respectively.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.820
So genetics really plays a
fundamental role in biology

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.520
and the discovery of new
biological mechanisms.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.180
OK, so now, I want to just
briefly take you through,

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.140
how is it that we discover
things using genetics?

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.780
And I'm going to take you
through a type of approach

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.880
that's called a "forward
genetic screen."

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.800
And I'll get to the
orchestra in just a minute,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.990
but I briefly just
want to define what

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.630
a forward genetic screen is.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.500
So a forward genetic
screen is type of approach

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.230
you would do if you
don't know the genes that

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.180
are involved in a
specific process,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.340
but you want to identify them.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.520
So in a forward
genetic screen, you

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.880
don't know the genes
and mechanisms involved.

00:08:17.415 --> 00:08:19.040
So you don't know
what these genes are.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.110
You might not even have a
genome sequence of the organism.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.900
You don't need a genome
sequence in order

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.800
to do a forward genetic
screen because you don't know

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.970
the genes, but you're interested
in a particular aspect

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.919
of development, or of
organismal function,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.750
and you want to
identify the genes that

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.520
are important for that.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.059
So when starting a forward
genetic screen, you have to,

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.600
then, infer what a possible
phenotype would look

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.190
like if you broke genes that
were involved in that process.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.580
So the mantra of
geneticists is that we

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.020
are going to break genes
and then look at the result

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.740
and see if it gives the
phenotype we're interested in.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:15.080
So in a forward genetic screen,
you're looking for a phenotype

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:22.550
that you would expect if you
affected a certain process,

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:29.720
if you disrupt a process.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.830
So think about this
orchestra up here.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.870
Let's say you are
interested in what

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.940
regulates each of these
sections in the orchestra.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.700
What is the master regulator
of this orchestra, if you will?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.290
And so conceptually, what a
genetic screen would involve

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.660
is taking hundreds,
maybe thousands,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.050
of orchestras like this
one, and just shooting

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.660
an individual in this
orchestra, and removing them

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.820
from the orchestra.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.500
And so let's say you remove--

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.710
let's say you remove
this guy right here,

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.150
then maybe nothing really
happens because they are, like,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.130
30 or 40 other
violinists, and that's

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.250
not the major control circuit.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.730
So then you would infer
that this gene is not

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.430
important for the
regulation of the orchestra.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.340
But let's say you
took out Bernstein,

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.520
and then you listen
to the orchestra

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.270
and find that the sections
are uncoordinated,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.840
the bassists start doing
crazy things on their own.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.910
So then the logic of
Drosophila genetics,

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.550
you would then name
that gene uncoordinated

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.760
and infer that that gene
has some important role

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:56.030
in coordinating the different
sections of the orchestra.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:01.010
So the goal in genetics is
to identify a mutation that

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.160
alters a gene function
that gives you a phenotype

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.120
that you're interested in.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.240
And rather than taking
a gun and shooting

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.570
members of the
orchestra, in genetics,

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.340
you try to identify mutations.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.360
So you try to induce mutations.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.070
So we're looking for mutations.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.720
And these mutations could
be spontaneous mutations,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.860
meaning you didn't do
anything to induce it,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.850
but they just appear as a
variant in the population.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.520
And so we've talked
about Thomas Hunt

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.260
Morgan and the white
mutant, and the white gene.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.830
So the white mutant was
a spontaneous mutation.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.900
Morgan's lab didn't
do anything special.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.600
They just looked at lots of
flies, and over the decades,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.760
they identified this
one special male

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.090
fly that they could work on.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:01.400
But nowadays, researchers have a
way to accelerate this process.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.610
And so we can induce mutations.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.300
In the way we can
induce mutations is

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.360
by using some type of mutagen.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.350
So for example, you could have
some sort of chemical mutagen

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.420
that increases the error
rate in DNA replication,

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.920
or you could use radiation
to induce DNA damage,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.710
and that essentially
accelerates the frequency

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.280
of mutations that occur in
the genome of an organism.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.960
And so the process of
mutagenizing an organism

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.640
isn't specific to genes.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.800
You're just inducing
random mutations

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.140
across the genome
of the individual.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.990
Let's say this piece I'm drawing
here is part of a chromosome,

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.840
and these boxes are genes.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.630
You're inducing
random mutations,

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.020
and maybe one mutation
hits this gene.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.660
So that's a mutation
that might affect

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.060
the function of an organism.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.350
You might have other mutations
that are outside genes

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.130
and may have no
effect, or you could

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.380
have a different kind
of mutation which

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.390
isn't in the coding
region of the gene,

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:30.600
but maybe affects the regulation
of this blue gene over here.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.340
So this is a random process.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.690
If you're feeding an organism
some chemical mutagen,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.260
you're inducing random
mutations in different places,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.060
and you don't know which are
the ones that you want until you

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.065
look at their phenotypes
and try to find

00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:48.190
the needle in the haystack.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.080
So let me show
you some examples.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.440
So let's say we were
interested in our body pattern.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.000
We all have a body.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.710
Our head is in
our head position,

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.810
our ass is in our
ass position, we

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.760
have arms that are
in a right position,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.890
our legs are in
the right position.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.230
Let's say we're
interested in figuring out

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.380
what genes were responsible
for that body pattern.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.540
What kind of a mutant
might you look for?

00:14:19.761 --> 00:14:20.340
Anyone?

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:20.840
Rachel.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.738
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:22.738 --> 00:14:23.780
ADAM MARTIN: What's that?

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.050
A mutant with his body
parts in the wrong place.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.280
Maybe you have like a leg where
your arm should be coming out,

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.800
or maybe you have two heads,
or something like that.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.740
So you look for
some sort of defect

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.480
in the pattern formation.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.150
And so this would be, obviously,
unethical to do in humans,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.120
but in model organisms,
we can actually

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.370
find these types of mutations.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.650
I'm just going to
highlight a couple mutants.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.910
This one's an obvious one.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.760
So this fly has two wings.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.970
You can see them folded
over each other right here.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.130
But there's a specific
class of mutant

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.810
that was called "wingless"--

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.600
where the flies have
fewer than two wings.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.320
This particular fly
has only one wing.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.560
And this wingless
mutant defined a gene

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.760
that became known as
wingless, and it's

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.550
a gene that has a
homologous gene in humans.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:25.220
And this particular gene defines
an entire signaling pathway,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.660
which--

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.650
whoops, sorry-- which is
important in stem-cell biology

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.010
and is also over
activated in cancer.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.840
But obviously, we
don't have wings,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.810
so this gene didn't get
discovered in humans.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.940
It was discovered
in flies, and then

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.460
only later on, it
was inferred-- or it

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.010
was discovered that there
is a related gene in humans.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.150
OK, so that's one example.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.960
One of the other phenotypes I
showed you is called "notch."

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.380
Normally, a fly wing has
a nice, smooth margin.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.880
But notch mutants have wings
that have this chunk taken out

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.340
of them at the end.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.760
So again, the gene became known
as "notch" because of this fly

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.410
phenotype.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.430
But again, there's
a human notch,

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.580
and human notch, again, is
involved in human diseases,

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.230
such as cancer.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.780
OK, so that's two examples.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.810
But now, I want to talk to
you about how one might find

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.160
the needle in the haystack.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.340
How can you have
a concerted effort

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:31.388
to identify genes that have that
function in a given process?

00:16:31.388 --> 00:16:32.930
I'm going to tell
you about work done

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.530
by Eric Wieschaus and
Christiane Nusslein-Volhard

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.530
because they did one of the
more famous genetic screens that

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.400
had been done, and they won the
Nobel Prize for their results

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.860
in 1995.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.710
So I mean I take you through
this classic genetic screen.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.950
In this screen, they're
going to induce mutations.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.780
So I'm going to take
a parental generation.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.650
And this screen was
done using fruit flies.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.579
And they took male fruit
flies and treated the males

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.940
with a mutagen to
induce mutations

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.470
in the gametes these male
flies that would then be passed

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.040
to subsequent generations.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:22.430
And they mated the
mutagenized males to females,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.650
and then they went
on to look at--

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.710
to isolate individual
F1 progeny.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.290
So we're going to
look at individual F1

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.400
progeny in this generation.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.990
So in the F1 progeny
have the potential

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.860
to get one mutagenized
chromosome from their father

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.630
and will get a normal
chromosome from the mother.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.020
So I'll just drawn
this like this,

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.290
where independent mutations are
going to be different colors.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:02.870
So that has maybe a mutation
on one of its chromosomes.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.120
Another fly, because
this is random,

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.840
might have a different
mutation on the same

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.070
or a different chromosome.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.820
I'll draw a couple more.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.240
And maybe one of these
flies doesn't have

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.640
a mutation that's been induced.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.550
And then I'll draw just
one independent mutation

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.320
right there.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.650
So again, this is random.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.930
So to see random mutations, you
have to take individual flies.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.420
Now, are you're going to
see a phenotype in this F1

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.110
generation?

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.140
So Miles-- is it
the Malik or Miles?

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.640
Sorry.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.150
AUDIENCE: Miles.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.480
ADAM MARTIN: Miles.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:41.980
Good.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.565
OK.

00:18:42.565 --> 00:18:47.610
AUDIENCE: Most likely
not because any mutation

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.142
[INAUDIBLE] spontaneous
would be overshadowed

00:18:52.142 --> 00:18:56.545
by the direct gene, the female.

00:18:56.545 --> 00:18:57.420
ADAM MARTIN: Exactly.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.840
So what Miles just
said is that--

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.910
basically, he said
that these mutations

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.460
if their loss-of-function
mutations are going to be

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.720
recessive--

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.940
because they're going
to be overshadowed

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.530
by a normal functioning gene
on the other chromosome.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.980
So if you're looking for a
loss-of-function mutation,

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.380
that's likely going
to be recessive,

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.980
and you would not see
it in the F1 generation.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.420
So in order to
look for organisms

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.600
that have incorrect
body patterning,

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.510
you need to get
a situation where

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:38.760
each of the mutated chromosomes
is homozygous recessive.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.605
And to do that, you
have to do more crosses.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.700
So what the researchers
did was to take

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:53.180
independent individual
organisms, and cross them all,

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.170
again, to non-mutated flies.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.830
And remember, flies
don't self-cross.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.080
So they need a male
and a female that

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.590
has the same mutated
chromosome mating to each other

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.190
in order to see a
recessive phenotype.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.800
So because you only
have an individual fly

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.010
for each of these, you need
to get more than one fly

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.500
with the same mutation.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:24.980
So they mate to a normal fly.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.370
But now, you can get an F2--

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:35.480
multiple F2 males
and females that

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.980
will have the same
mutated chromosome.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.540
So here, let's draw these.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.810
They're still heterozygous.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.200
At this point.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.420
But at this point, you just
generated multiple organisms,

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.990
male and female, that have
the same chromosome that

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.972
arose from, essentially, the
same chromosome and the father,

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:10.150
or the male gamete and
the parental generation.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.280
Oh, I did green.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.780
OK.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:23.600
OK, so now we have males
and females, both of which

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.700
are heterozygous.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.490
And I'm skipping some of
the details of this cross.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.240
You'll want to take
my word for the fact

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.920
that they can keep track of
which chromosome is which.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.190
And I'm not going to tell you
how they did that because it's

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.932
fly genetics, and it's
not terribly important

00:21:42.932 --> 00:21:43.640
that you know it.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.600
So now, you have
males and females.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.940
And now you can look an F3.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.980
And from each of these lines--

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.130
each of these lines, you're
going to cross siblings

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.730
to each other.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:03.980
So you're doing a sibling-cross.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.250
What fraction of the progeny for
each of these sibling crosses

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.873
should be homozygous for
the mutant chromosome?

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.770
Yes, Steven.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.805
AUDIENCE: One-fourth.

00:22:17.805 --> 00:22:19.430
ADAM MARTIN: One-fourth,
exactly right.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.890
So Steven's exactly right.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.540
A quarter of the progeny
should get two copies

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.610
of the mutated chromosome.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:34.070
So 25% should be
homozygous recessive.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.170
And so you can screen
this F3 progeny

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.330
for each of these
independent lines,

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:48.350
and look for flies at some
stage of development that

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.222
are defective in patterning.

00:22:51.222 --> 00:22:53.840
And so I'll show you how--

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.970
where'd my clicker go?

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.867
All right, so they're looking
for incorrect body pattern.

00:23:01.867 --> 00:23:03.700
Yes, your question--
what's your name again?

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.420
AUDIENCE: Georgia.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.130
ADAM MARTIN: Georgia, yeah.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.838
AUDIENCE: Would there
be some [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:06.838 --> 00:23:11.490
in the F2 [INAUDIBLE] normal?

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.200
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.040
ADAM MARTIN: Yes.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.480
So they're able to select for
the mutated chromosome, yeah.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.740
And I'm skipping over how
they did that because it's

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.192
kind of esoteric.

00:23:23.192 --> 00:23:23.900
But you're right.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.400
Some would be normal.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.280
But I'm just telling you
they're able to figure out

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.650
the ones that have
the mutant chromosome,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.040
and they made sure to keep
those in the next generation.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.750
Good question, Georgia.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:40.880
All right, so they can
screen F3 for a phenotype.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.660
It turns out all
of the mutations

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.400
they're interested
in are lethal,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.450
so they have to look at the
larval stages for ones that

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.370
have a defect in patterning.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.140
So this is what a Drosophila
larvae looks like.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.520
And you can see it has a
segmental pattern here.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.610
This is the head of the
larvae, the tail of the larvae.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.770
But you see there are
these segments that

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.150
alternate between smooth
cuticle and hairy cuticle.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.350
They have things
called "denticles,"

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.650
which are these hairlike
projections, which

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.490
are essentially, what the
maggot uses for traction so it

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.100
can crawl around.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.170
So they're basically just
looking at maggots here

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:23.180
and looking at the pattern
of segments in the maggots.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.260
But what they found is a mutant.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.140
And here's a mutant
here which just

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.260
has these hairlike projections
all across the cuticle

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:35.570
without these intervening
regions of naked cuticle.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.570
And because there's a lot
of hairlike projections

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.900
here, it reminded the
researchers of a hedgehog,

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.050
and so this mutant became
known as "hedgehog."

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:49.220
And the hedgehog gene
was the founding member

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.100
of an entire signaling
pathway, known as the "hedgehog

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.600
pathway," that plays important
roles in human development

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.190
and also, human cancer.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.510
So the human gene
for a hedgehog,

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.490
or one of the most
important ones in humans,

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.500
is known as sonic hedgehog.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:12.680
So you see that geneticists have
kind of an odd sense of humor.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.940
But the sonic-hedgehog gene
is important in cancer.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.160
And actually, there
are now a number

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.930
of drugs that are
being developed

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.600
to target the hedgehog pathway.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.500
And one was approved
back in 2012 for use

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.900
in treating
basal-cell carcinoma.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.850
And there's currently
another drug

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.940
that's in phase-II clinical
trials for treating

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.460
some forms of leukemia.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.700
So this is a story that
goes from identifying

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.600
this weird fly mutant all
the way to clinical trials,

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.010
developing drugs,
whose purpose is

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.340
to inhibit this signaling
pathway, which hedgehog

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.070
is the signal--

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.150
the extracellular ligand for.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.240
OK, so now, I'm going to
switch gears and tell you

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.340
about another story.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:10.010
It's a bit like this one, except
this one has an MIT connection.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:17.920
So I'm going to tell you about
work done at MIT in the worm

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.620
Caenorhabditis elegans.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.470
And this work was
done in the lab

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:33.260
of Robert Horvitz, who is
a member of our biology

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.610
department.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.970
And Robert Horvitz,
for his work,

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.560
won the Nobel Prize,
along with John Sulston

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.240
and Sydney Brenner
for their work

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.590
on how cells decide what
fates they give rise to.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:53.690
And one thing that the
Horvitz Lab has done

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:58.160
is to elucidate the mechanisms
that determine whether or not

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.680
a cell lives or dies
during development.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.940
So if we think about the
development of an organism,

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.310
we all start from a single cell.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.990
And the cell divides
into different cells,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.210
but different cells
in our body give rise

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.150
to different cell fates.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.330
So if we consider just a
generic cell division here,

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.060
you have a parent
cell, A. It might

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.780
divide into cell B and cell C.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.420
And maybe cell B might
have a particular fate.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.290
It might go on to develop
into a neuron, or a muscle

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.700
cell, whatever.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.290
It doesn't matter.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:46.310
But one fate that Horvitz,
Sulston, and Brenner saw

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.110
is that sometimes, cells--

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.810
their fate was to just die.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.700
And this was very stereotypical.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.600
You get a death.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.200
And this was defined as
"programmed cell death"

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.020
because it followed a very
stereotypic pattern, where

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.820
the same cell, each time,
would undergo cell death,

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.440
so it seems like there's
a program for it.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.140
This also is called "apoptosis."

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:27.060
So what really enabled this work
is the biology of C. elegans.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.810
And, here, I'm showing you
C. elegans development.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.190
This is the C. elegans zygote.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.920
This cell divides into two
cells that are different.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.390
One is called AB,
one is called P1.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.660
And we know exactly what the
fates for the descendants

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.980
of both these cells are based
on the work of Sulston, Brenner,

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.570
and Horvitz.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.940
Now, you get a
four-cell stage where

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.600
AB divides into two cells,
and P1 divides into two cells.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.370
And again, we know the
fates of all these cells.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.010
And what C. elegans
researchers have

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:07.300
done, because C. elegans is a
relatively simple organism--

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:12.390
there are only 947 cells
in every individual worm,

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.405
so there are 947 somatic cells.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.220
And this is stereotypic.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.330
Every worm has these 947 cells.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:25.670
How many cells do you have?

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.960
More than or less than 1,000?

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.210
You have more than
1,000 cells, right?

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:38.240
That makes you much
more complicated.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.420
So really, the practical
aspect of C. elegans

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:45.620
is it has a much
simpler composition,

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.920
and they can track what
happens to every single one

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.420
of these cells.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.490
They know when
every cell divides

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.000
and what the daughter cells of
that division will turn into.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.530
In other words, they know the
entire lineage of this animal.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.240
So this is a picture
of the lineage.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.360
That's showing you what
happens to every single cell

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.230
in the development
of an adult worm.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:14.960
And so what particularly
interested Robert Horvitz

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.300
is 131 cells, during the
development of this animal,

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.950
underwent programmed cell death.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.350
And this is not
random cell death.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.630
It's the same cells every time.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.570
They know what happens to every
single cell in the development

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.600
of this organism, so they
know when there's a division,

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.700
and one specific cell dies
every time in the organism.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.590
So it's really a
unique scenario,

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:48.020
where you can really see what
becomes of every cell that

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.320
is present in the organism.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:56.330
OK, so now, let's talk a little
bit about the death process.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:59.990
So I'll make the
cell-death process simple.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.990
You start with a live cell.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.340
So you have a live cell.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.810
That live cell dies such that
you then have a dead cell.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.510
And then after the cell dies--

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.900
after the cell dies, the
remnants of that dead cell

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.940
are engulfed by
neighboring cells, such

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.480
that you no longer
see that cell.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.645
So the last step in this
process is engulfment.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.290
Now, a key aspect of
one of Horvitz's screens

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:47.630
is that other researchers had
identified a mutation that

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.480
affected cell death that
specifically blocked

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.695
this engulfment process.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.070
And this gene is called ced-1.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.640
There's the first cell-death
mutant that was identified.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:12.990
"Ced" stands for
"Cell Death abnormal"

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.770
so C-E-D is short for "ced."

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.760
So researchers in
the C. elegans field

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.480
started isolating these
cell-death-abnormal mutants,

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.870
where something happened in
the cell-death process that

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.360
was abnormal.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.110
And I'll tell you how this was
leveraged by the Horvitz lab

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.410
to identify, basically,
a pathway of genes

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:39.930
that were involved
in cell death.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.320
So this is now a worm.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.700
And what you see
in this worm are

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.470
these bubble-like
structures that

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.400
are cells that are dead
but haven't been engulfed.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.420
So these dead cells, because
they're not engulfed,

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.700
are visible in the adult worm.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.060
And so you can basically
just look at adult worms,

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.180
and see whether or not these
bubble-like structures are

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.150
present in a ced- mutant.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.340
In a wild-type worm,
you don't see this,

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.260
and so it's harder to see.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.250
But this provided a
visual assay to look

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:17.510
for mutations that block
the cell-death process

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:22.070
because if you block the
process upstream of ced-1

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.140
in an engulfment, you
no longer will see

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.740
these bubble-like structures.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.760
And so that is what
the Horvitz Lab did.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.380
They started with
ced-1 mutant worms.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.350
So they're starting
with the ced-1 mutants.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:45.540
And they then mutagenized
these ced-1 mutants.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.770
Sorry-- mutagenized.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.500
And so they're essentially,
looking for second mutants

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.010
in this animal that will
affect the death process.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:06.240
OK, I'll take you through
the logic of this.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.540
So for the remainder
of the generations

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.180
I'm going to tell you about,
they're all ced-1 mutant.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:19.429
Ced-1 is homozygous,
in this case.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:23.150
And the worms are
hermaphrodites,

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.030
meaning they are both male
and female sex organs.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.449
And therefore, they
can self-fertilize.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:29.830
So this is a self-cross.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.429
And so ced-1 remains
homozygous mutant

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:39.880
throughout all these crosses.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:45.100
Now similar to the fly screen,
they can look for individual--

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.206
or you get individual
worms here.

00:34:49.206 --> 00:34:54.727
Let's get some colors so we can
compare different chromosomes.

00:34:54.727 --> 00:34:58.280
All right, so this chromosome
might have one mutant,

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.030
this chromosome could
have another mutant,

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.420
and this chromosome could
have another mutant,

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.210
and maybe this one
doesn't have a mutant.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:11.560
OK, but again, these are
heterozygous animals,

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.920
so if you're looking for
a loss-of-function mutant,

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.600
you would not see the
phenotype at this stage.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.590
So what was done in this screen
is, because these are worms

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.620
and they're hermaphrodites,
they basically

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:31.810
allowed each of these
worms to self-cross.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.090
So now, were talking
just about a self-cross.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:44.350
And because a single worm has
just one of these chromosomes,

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:48.580
when it undergoes a self-cross,
a quarter of the progeny

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.670
will be homozygous
recessive for the mutation.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:58.160
OK, so here, we have
the F1 generation.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.470
And now, they can just
look at the F2 generation,

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:06.430
and they're looking for some
fraction of the worms resulting

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:10.570
from each individual
that has a phenotype that

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:14.080
looks like a cell-death
mutant phenotype.

00:36:20.655 --> 00:36:22.030
And so they're
essentially, going

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.270
to screen through
the F2 generation,

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.360
and look for worms
that fail to have

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:33.130
these bubble-like structures
in the adult world.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:37.780
So they're looking for a loss
of these refractile structures.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.640
And they got one.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.650
This is now a double mutant
between ced-1 and ced-3,

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.690
and you see how
you no longer have

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:49.180
these big bubble-like
structures in the worm.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:56.440
So they identified a
mutant, and thus, a gene,

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:02.680
that's called "ced-3," which
basically causes a failure

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.290
of the cells to
undergo cell death.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:09.130
Now given what I've given
what I've shown you,

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:13.060
is this necessarily a mutant
that's involved in cell death?

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.130
Can you think of an
alternative explanation

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:24.060
for why you would lose these
sort of bubble-like structures?

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.890
What else could be happening?

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.810
When you do a screen
like this, and when

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.523
you do science in
general, you have

00:37:30.523 --> 00:37:32.190
to think through all
the different types

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:33.270
of possibilities.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:34.303
Yes, Georgia.

00:37:34.303 --> 00:37:37.622
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:38.580
ADAM MARTIN: Excellent.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.540
Georgia said you could
have re-mutated ced-1.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.760
So one possibility is that you
isolated a ced-1 revertant,

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.590
which means you changed its
DNA sequence so that now,

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.470
the ced-1 gene is functional.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.170
So one scenario
here is you could

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:03.420
have some type of revertant,
or you could have a suppressor

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.080
mutation.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.970
Maybe you have a
mutation that bypasses

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:12.870
the function of ced-1
such that now, the cells

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.840
can engulf the dead cell.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.052
So you could also
have a suppressor.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.940
Or the alternative scenario,
the one that we want,

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.340
is that we've affected
the cell-death process

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:32.730
and identified something that is
a bona-fide cell-death mutant.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.860
How would you differentiate
between these two?

00:38:39.185 --> 00:38:39.685
Any ideas?

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.650
Should this have an extra cell?

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:49.960
No.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.370
Stevens says no.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:52.450
I agree.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:57.280
There should be
no extra cell here

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.020
because if you restore
the phagocytic process,

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.020
then the cell should die,
it should be engulfed,

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.640
and there shouldn't
be an extra cell.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.500
But if this is a bona-fide
cell-death mutant,

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:12.010
then you should
have extra cells.

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:15.250
And it turns out the
ced-3 mutant blocks

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:20.890
all 131 of these cell deaths so
that you have 131 extra cells.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:25.090
Because they know the entire
cell lineage of this worm

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.240
and can see whether or not
cells are present or not,

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.650
they can tell if there
are extra cells or not.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.130
And therefore, that
allowed them to infer

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.560
that they had an
actual mutant that

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:41.230
was affecting the mechanism
that promotes the cell to die.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:45.180
And this shows that
the cell death--

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.640
it shows the cell death
is an active process.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.710
It's not just some random
event that's happening.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:57.010
It's an active process that
is controlled by genes.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.860
So there's an active mechanism
involved in the cell death.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:07.180
Any questions about how these
screens go in the crosses

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.080
before I move on?

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.210
OK, so I have one more
story to tell you about,

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:18.005
and this relates to behavior.

00:40:18.005 --> 00:40:19.755
So now, I want to tell
you about behavior.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:27.880
We all behave, some of
us better than others.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.490
So how is it we can
go from something

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:35.230
as abstract as behavior to
specific genes and mechanisms

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:38.000
that control this?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.410
And I'm going to tell you about
work that was awarded the Nobel

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.480
Prize last year.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.700
Two of these researchers--

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.400
their careers are at Brandeis.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.290
And so what they discovered
is the mechanism that controls

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.380
circadian rhythm in organisms--

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.350
so circadian rhythm.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.860
So circadian rhythm
is a behavior.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.450
We are awake during
certain parts of the day

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.685
and are asleep at night.

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:15.910
If you're hidden from
the light-dark cycle,

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:19.870
you continue this cycle
for some amount of time.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.540
So there's something
intrinsic in our system

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:29.170
such that we want to exist on
this 24-hour wake-sleep cycle.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:30.820
That's why it's
a pain in the ass

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.270
to travel to the other
side of the world.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.240
So we want to identify what
controls this behavior.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.520
What, then, might be a
phenotype you might look for?

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.850
What would happen if you
break circadian rhythm?

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.250
Yeah, Rachel.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:03.070
ADAM MARTIN: It wouldn't have
a nice, clear wake-sleep cycle.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.980
Exactly.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.860
So this screen--
what they did is

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.820
to look for flies
where they didn't have

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.330
this robust wake-sleep cycle.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:19.860
So you basically look for
flies that are awake at night,

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:27.100
and identify the mutations
that cause this to happen.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.390
OK, I'll show you an example
of what the data looks like.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:34.500
So what each of these
lines is each tick mark

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.040
is a measurement
of fly activity.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.490
So what you see are flies
asleep, they're awake,

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:44.110
they're asleep, they're awake.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:47.190
And researchers
identified mutants that

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.870
didn't show this 24-hour cycle.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.350
So some are just
totally arrhythmic.

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:55.040
Other mutants alter the
period of this cycle

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.440
so that it's either
longer or shorter.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.690
So this is a really
elegant way to look

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.335
for genes that are important
for circadian rhythm.

00:43:04.335 --> 00:43:06.225
And I'll take you through
the genetic screen.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:15.465
This was done by
Konopka and Benzer.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.880
And they did a nice screen.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:26.440
It involves a genetic
trick which I'll show you.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.660
There's a type of chromosome
called "attached-X" in flies,

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.120
where two X chromosomes
are fused to each other--

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.370
so two X chromosomes fused.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.240
And if a fly has two X
chromosomes, it's female.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.030
If it just has one X
chromosome, it's male.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:57.035
So that's determines fly gender.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.010
So then these researchers took
males and mutagenized them.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.420
And they crossed these
males to attached X females.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:17.670
And when you cross males
to attached X females,

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:21.090
you do something clever,
which is half of the progeny

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:23.280
dies because you
need an X chromosome

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.130
and you can't have
three X chromosomes.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:30.690
But your females
are all attached XY.

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:33.060
So the females actually
get their X chromosomes

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.820
from their mom, which is the
opposite of the way it normally

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.050
works.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.650
And males get their
X chromosome from dad

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:45.060
because the attached X
strain has a Y chromosome.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.520
So this is a little
bit of a genetic trick.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.760
And the fly-- the reason it
was done, in this case, is they

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.130
wanted to mutate
the X chromosome

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:56.670
and then have the fathers
pass on their X chromosome

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.940
to their sons because there's
only one copy of the X

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.550
chromosome.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:03.360
So if you get a
mutation on X, you

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.120
don't have to homozygous
it because there's

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.310
only one copy of it.

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.290
So it's a little bit of
a genetic trick that,

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.210
in this case, served
the researchers

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:15.350
a generation on their screen.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:21.240
OK, so you take this, and
then you identify males now

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.120
that have a mutated
X chromosome,

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.860
and they have only
one X chromosomes

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:30.120
so you should be able to
observe the behavior even here.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.870
But to establish a line of
flies that have this mutation,

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:41.280
they then took these
F1 mutated males,

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.270
and crossed them, again,
to attached X flies.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.880
And again, in doing this,
all the males from this cross

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.260
are mutant.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.160
So now, you have multiple
males, all of which are mutant.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:02.730
So you can start with
a single male F1.

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:07.050
And by crossing it
to this strain here,

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:10.560
you get a lot of males now that
have the mutant chromosome,

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.600
and you can look
at their behavior

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:17.400
to determine whether you've
affected circadian rhythm.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.150
Does everyone understand how
the attached X works here?

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:22.980
It's kind of a little
bit of a trick,

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.000
but flies have these
tools that you can use

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.990
to save your time in the lab.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:37.770
OK, so these mutants that
the Benzer Lab identified had

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:40.530
altered period of
the sleep-wake cycle,

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:44.100
and therefore, the gene
was named "period."

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:50.340
So this screen identified
a gene called "period."

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.310
This is a gene.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:56.655
And there's a hammer log of
the period gene in humans.

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.770
And the gene in
humans is associated

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.920
with familial advanced
sleep-phase syndrome.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.410
So defects in the genes
that were identified

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:12.720
in Drosophila actually are
relevant to human sleep

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.410
disorders.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.240
All right, I'm all set.

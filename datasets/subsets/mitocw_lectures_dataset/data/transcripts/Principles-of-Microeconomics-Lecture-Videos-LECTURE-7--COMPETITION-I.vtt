[CLICKING]

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.230
JONATHAN GRUBER: Why
don't we get started.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.410
We're going to start
by finishing up

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.150
our lecture on costs,
with a concept I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.070
didn't get to cover last time.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.590
Then we'll move on to
talking about competition.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.350
So I want to start by talking
about one concept on costs

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.150
we didn't get the
cover last time,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.630
which is fixed
versus sunk costs.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.180
And sunk costs are an
important term in economics,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.010
so I want to make sure people
understand what they are.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.920
Sunk costs are essentially
costs that cannot be changed,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.980
no matter what action you
take from this date forward.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.580
So in some sense, some costs
are long-run fixed costs.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.820
I know we said in the
long run, nothing's fixed.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.870
But a sunk cost is the idea of
an investment that once made,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.165
can never, ever be changed.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.510
So the thing is, if we think
about it in the short run,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.560
let's imagine you're a doctor.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.750
In the short run,
your variable costs

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.810
are how many hours you work,
or the nurses you employ,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.300
or the physician
assistants you employ.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.430
In the long run,
your fixed costs

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.060
or how big your office is.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.950
You can get a bigger
office or smaller office.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.917
But your sunk cost is
having gone to med school.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.750
You can ever undo having
gone to med school.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.550
Having paid that
cost, it is sunk.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.660
It is gone.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.620
You're never going to--

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.030
you could go to more med school.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.572
You could take
supplementary classes,

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:35.767
but you can never undo
having gone to med school.

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.100
So that's the sense in which
some things are sunk costs.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.550
They're investments that
are made that can never,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.760
essentially, be undone.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.430
And essentially, we can think of
these as long-run fixed costs,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.680
which I know is really
confusing, because the long run

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.540
is when costs aren't fixed.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.480
But that's essentially
what they amount to.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.170
Now, sunk costs turn out to
have a very important place

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.430
in economic lore, because
the thing about sunk costs

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.560
is it's hard to
think about them.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.800
It's hard to remember the rule
that sunk costs are always

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.210
sunk.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.670
So let me give you one example--
it's in one of my videos

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.550
for the 1401X videos that
supplement this course.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.080
But if you've seen
it, I apologize.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.170
We'll go through it again,
which is literally a case where

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.380
I got this wrong two years ago.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.740
So about two and
a half years ago,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.570
I made the decision
that I take my wife

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.000
to go see the band Journey.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.430
So I went and I bought
tickets, and the tickets

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.130
were $240 for the pair--

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.460
pretty good tickets at a big
stadium, $240 for the pair.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.065
Then about a month
before the show,

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:41.940
I was looking, and
realized I didn't actually

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.710
like Journey that much.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.398
I like-- I love a
couple of their songs.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.440
I looked at the set list.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.910
I'm like, I don't really like
that many of their songs.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.640
There's a couple I love, but
I don't want to sit there.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.810
It's a couple
hours to get there.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.268
I don't want to
sit there all night

00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:54.360
for two songs that I like.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.110
I want to sell them.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.890
So you can sell
tickets through StubHub

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.023
or other secondary
mechanisms, but you

00:03:00.023 --> 00:03:01.940
have to decide what price
you're going to ask.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.000
And I said, I gotta at
least make back my $240.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.680
That's my goal.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.240
And then I realized
I was thinking

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.420
about it completely wrong.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.920
I didn't realize immediately,
but I was [INAUDIBLE] about it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.840
completely wrong--

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.990
that the $240 was already gone.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.080
The fact I spent $240, given
that I'd already spent it,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.560
is irrelevant.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.390
How should I think about it?

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.510
I should only ask
how much am I still

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.648
willing to pay to see Journey?

00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:34.190
And as long as someone else is
willing to pay more than that,

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.080
I should sell them my tickets.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.000
And if they're not, I should go.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.700
So let's say, for
example, I decided,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.040
I'd still pay $100 for my
wife and I to go see Journey.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.540
Then I should say, as long as
the tickets sell for more than

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.920
$100, I'll sell them, but if
it's less than $100, I won't.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.230
And the fact I paid
$240 is irrelevant--

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.460
that's gone.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.560
That is a sunk cost.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.898
So a common [INAUDIBLE]
is the sunk cost fallacy--

00:04:00.898 --> 00:04:02.440
the notion we pay
attention to things

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.580
that don't matter anymore.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.960
Having spent that
money was irrelevant.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.040
All that mattered was the
decision looking forward,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.430
which was, do I want to go or
do I want to sell the tickets?

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.418
And that decision simply
depends on how much

00:04:14.418 --> 00:04:15.460
I was willing to pay now.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.160
Now that's confusing.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.373
I've explained this.

00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:22.040
If you guys get it,
you're a rare breed.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.570
I've tried this story on many
people, and they're, like, no,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.195
of course it matters
how much you paid.

00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:28.165
It doesn't.

00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:29.790
AUDIENCE: Does this
kind of [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.020
apply to the housing
market crash,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.290
and homeowners are trying to
sell their houses for way more

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.920
than they're worth, because
they're trying to get

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.720
some of their money back?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.928
JONATHAN GRUBER: The sunk
cost fallacy finds its name

00:04:37.928 --> 00:04:39.990
very much in the housing market.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.780
Many homeowners
set as a benchmark

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.377
what they paid for their house.

00:04:44.377 --> 00:04:46.710
They'll say, I don't want to
sell less than what I paid.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.610
That's silly.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.050
Doesn't matter what you paid.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.688
What matters is how much you can
sell it for and whether or not

00:04:51.688 --> 00:04:52.980
you want to sell at that price.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.490
And what you paid is irrelevant.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.335
Now, it might matter because
there are borrowing constraints

00:04:57.335 --> 00:04:57.960
we'll get into.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.710
You might have a mortgage
you have to pay back,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.168
and you can't afford
to pay it back

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.803
unless you sell for
a certain price.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.220
But aside from
that, let's imagine

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.678
you just bought
your house outright

00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:07.680
without a mortgage
for $1 million.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.180
Then that's irrelevant.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.040
Whether you sell your
house for $900,000

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.740
just depends on whether
it's worth $900,000 for you

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.820
to stay there or not.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.672
The million you
paid is irrelevant,

00:05:16.672 --> 00:05:18.880
except if you have a mortgage
and you've borrowed it.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.330
That can make it complicated.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.340
So basically, sunk
costs are sunk.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.510
Now, I ended up selling the
tickets for $220, so I did OK.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.400
But if I thought
about it incorrectly,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.850
I would've said that's a bummer.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.415
I lost $20.

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:33.040
And in the big picture,
it is a bummer.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.550
I never should have bought
them in the first place.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.982
But having made that
decision to buy them,

00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:40.440
the fact I was only willing to
pay about $100 at that point

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.060
to go and sold for $220
meant I did well, not badly.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.978
Questions about that?

00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:48.020
It's a confusing example.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.580
None of your friends
understand this.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.420
You could totally mess
with your friends' minds

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.545
by explaining this to them.

00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:53.109
Yeah.

00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:58.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] more
I might make [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.200
JONATHAN GRUBER: What I
mean is, think of them--

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.030
I have a set of Journey tickets.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.060
I have a choice--

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.670
I can sell them or go.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.380
So the only question
is, how much is it

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.190
worth to me to go to Journey?

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.682
I decided it was worth
$100 to go to Journey.

00:06:13.682 --> 00:06:15.390
So I simply put them
on StubHub, and said

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.730
if they sell for more
than $100, I won't go.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.620
If they sell for less
than $100, I'll go.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.630
The fact that I paid
$240 is irrelevant.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.320
Yeah.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.060
AUDIENCE: So, basically
you've lost [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.467
You've lost overall you've--

00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:28.300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.270
JONATHAN GRUBER: I lost $20.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.080
AUDIENCE: --by making the
mistake of buying them.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.455
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, ex
ante, there was a mistake made.

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:37.100
But having made the
mistake, that's irrelevant.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.010
So that's an important concept
to keep in mind, is sunk cost.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.220
Let's go on now and move
on to the next topic, which

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.440
is the focus of the
next two lectures,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.230
which is perfect competition.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.830
Perfect competition.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.560
Now, stepping back,
as we highlighted,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.050
a lot of what we did
for producer theory

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.210
is the same as what we
did for consumer theory.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.030
We have isoquants and isocosts
instead of indifference curves

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.390
and budget constraints,
but the same damn exercise,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.520
same math, same graphics.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.230
The difference was we have
a series of tangencies

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.330
between the isocosts
and isoquants,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.150
and we didn't know which one
was the right one to choose.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.490
With consumer theory, we
pin that down by the fact

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.470
our parents gave us a
certain amount of money.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.897
For producer theory, there
was nothing pinning down q.

00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:33.730
There's nothing pinning
down our total costs

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.010
we can afford to spend.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.890
What pins that down is
an additional constraint

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.485
we bring into the system,
which is the market.

00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:46.110
So now, we're going to take that
next step of actually deciding

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.700
what a firm produces.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.010
What a firm produces partly
comes from all the math

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.120
we do before developing
the cost curve.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.350
But it also comes from the fact
that firm exists in a market.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.300
And we focused on the cost side.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.048
Now, we turn to
the revenue side.

00:07:59.048 --> 00:08:00.840
The markets can determine
what the firm can

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.750
make from selling that
good, and that's and that's

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.180
going to pin down how
much they produce.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.390
Now, we're getting set of three
different market settings.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.910
Today, we'll talk about
perfect competition, which

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.790
is the market with many,
many firms competing

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.680
to sell a homogeneous good.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.440
I'll talk about it
more precisely later.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.210
Then, we're going to talk--

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.667
that's one extreme.

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:24.750
That's the extreme of
markets that economists sort

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.450
of dream about is a
perfectly competitive market.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.900
The other extreme
is monopoly, where

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.515
there's one firm, only one
firm that sells the good.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.390
And then in between, we
have my favorite word

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.280
in economics-- oligopoly,
which is when there's

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.190
several firms competing to sell
a good, not as many as perfect

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.140
competition, but more than one.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.070
That turns out to be
super complicated.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.070
So what we do is we start
with the two extremes,

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.020
develop a set of
intuitions and rules,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.420
and then we sort of hand-wave
a bit around oligopoly.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.045
And that's where I
introduce the notion

00:08:54.045 --> 00:08:55.850
of game theory, which
we'll talk about some

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.085
in a couple of lectures.

00:08:58.085 --> 00:08:59.710
So today, we're going
to start with one

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.350
extreme-- perfect competition.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.300
What is perfect competition?

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.370
Basically, the
technical definition

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.440
of a perfectly
competitive market

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.510
is where producers
are price takers.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.040
A perfectly
competitive market is

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.230
one where a producer
doesn't have

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.770
any influence over the price
that they sell their good at.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.910
They are price takers.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.020
So I can't actually,
as one-producer market,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.290
can't actually affect
the market price.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.680
The market price is given to me.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.630
When will this be true?

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:43.150
This will be true when the
demand for a firm's output

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:49.800
is perfectly elastic, when
the demand for a given firm's

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.350
output-- little q, not
the market elasticity,

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.760
but the firm elasticity--
when you have

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.248
an infinitely elastic little q.

00:10:00.248 --> 00:10:01.540
So let's think about that case.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.560
Let's turn to the first figure.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.908
So we have little q2 and--

00:10:05.908 --> 00:10:08.450
so we basically have little q,
because it's the firm's output

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.810
on the x-axis.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.500
The y-axis is the market price.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.690
The firm faces a perfectly
elastic demand curve.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.190
That means that they can't
change the market price that's

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.090
charged.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.450
So what does that mean?

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.280
That means that no matter
what their cost function

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.120
is, whether their supply
curve 1 or supply curve 2,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.610
they always sell at price p.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.700
So shifts in the cost function--
that is shifts in the supply

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.510
curve--

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:40.810
only affect how much you
sell, not the price you get.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:46.140
That would be true in a
perfectly competitive market.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.970
So what conditions make a
perfectly competitive market?

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.080
There's basically
three conditions.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.515
The first is identical products.

00:11:01.058 --> 00:11:02.850
A market will only be
perfectly competitive

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.828
if all the firms are selling at
least what consumers perceive

00:11:05.828 --> 00:11:06.870
to be identical products.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.210
They don't have to be
technologically identical.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.920
But from a consumer's
perspective,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.360
they have to be
viewed as identical.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:20.730
The second condition is there's
full information about prices.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.330
That is, consumers know
what every firm is charging.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.210
So I go to market, and I know
what every firm is charging.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.750
I have full information.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:45.480
And the third condition is that
there's low transaction costs,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.100
or what you might
call "search costs,"

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.180
that it's very costless for me
to search across opportunities.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.580
It's very costly
for me to care--

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.763
everybody's price
is perfectly posted,

00:11:57.763 --> 00:11:59.930
and it's very costless for
me to search across them.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.680
Sort of two and three
are kind of related.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.577
So this is obviously
never true, much

00:12:08.577 --> 00:12:10.410
like many of our
assumptions are never true.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:15.290
But it's a useful benchmark for
thinking about a lot of what

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.500
we're going to think about.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.140
So you want to think
about markets like this--

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.930
so for example, the classic
case you might think of is eBay.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.590
If you go on eBay
and you search--

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:32.550
I just bought a pair of
72-inch red shoelaces.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.550
There's 72-inch red
shoelace or [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.700
It turns out not quite--
some are flat, some are oval.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.920
But within oval
72-inch red shoelaces,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.570
there's literally no variation.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.210
They're 72-inch, red shoelaces.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.650
Now, they could be
of different quality,

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.160
and that might be unobservable.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.140
That's why it's not perfect, but
it's pretty close to identical.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.293
I go on eBay, and all the
prices are listed there.

00:12:54.293 --> 00:12:55.960
So I have full
information on my prices,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.670
and they're easy to compare.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.480
Now, it's not perfect
because, a, there

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.820
could be unobserved
quality differences.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.200
Some shoelaces may be made
by cheaper manufacturers.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.190
Others are easier
to break or fray.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.980
And the second reason is that I
might not have full information

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.840
about prices, because at
least in the old days--

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.600
eBay's changed this--

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.290
they can price compare on
the non-shipping cost price.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.350
Now eBay's fixed this.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.812
You get the price
including shipping costs.

00:13:23.812 --> 00:13:25.270
So in the old days,
you could shop,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.140
and think you had
the cheapest deal,

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.900
but it turned out when you
add shipping costs, it wasn't.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.520
So even eBay, which is sort of
the economist's dream platform,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.140
doesn't quite meet
these conditions,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.830
but it's about as
close as you can come.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.410
Now, the other example
I like to point to

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:44.640
is like buying little
knickknacks in a tourist area.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.000
That basically, if you've
ever gone to a tourist area

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.820
and tried to buy a little
knickknack like a replica

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.250
of the Eiffel Tower
around the Eiffel Tower,

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.580
there's a bunch of guys with
blankets, out selling them.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.580
And it's pretty easy to get see
they're all the same replicas.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.288
And it's pretty easy
to ask the guy, what

00:14:01.288 --> 00:14:04.308
do you want for your
Eiffel tower replica?

00:14:04.308 --> 00:14:05.350
So that's another market.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.600
Now, I taught this
as a casual example.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.640
Someone watched this video from
when I did this four years ago,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.130
and went to the Eiffel Tower--

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.630
some guy in France--

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.570
and actually did the exercise
of marching from blanket

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.890
to blanket.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.505
And he found that when you got
further from the Eiffel Tower,

00:14:24.505 --> 00:14:26.380
they're more expensive,
because there weren't

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.833
many people selling them.

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:30.250
But once you got close to the
Eiffel Tower, all these guys

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.600
selling them, he
found that everyone

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.350
charged the identical price.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.808
And he sent me a little package
of 24 little Eiffel towers.

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:37.600
It was really cute.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.840
So that was sort of this
exercise in reality.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.490
Now, the important thing
to remember, though,

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.700
is this is a perfectly
elastic, firm demand.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.080
So I want to talk for
a second about demand

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.200
for a firm's good versus
demand for a market's good, so

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.550
firm versus market demand.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.080
These are two different things.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.450
And the way to think about
this, think about the concept

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.310
of residual demand.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.560
So you could think
about the demand

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.230
for a market, demand
function for a market,

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.325
as being some Q of p.

00:15:18.325 --> 00:15:19.950
That's a demand
function of the market.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.408
That's this demand
curve we've been

00:15:21.408 --> 00:15:23.070
looking at since lecture one.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:28.200
It's a downward-sloping
function of the price.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:34.120
And we can then think of any
given firm, little q's demand,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:44.340
q of p, as equal to big Q of
p minus S0 of p, where S0 of p

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.245
we call "residual demand."

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.340
S super 0 of p is
residual demand.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.970
It's what everyone
else is supplying.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.552
So the demand to my firm--

00:15:55.552 --> 00:15:57.010
once again, under
these conditions,

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.730
perfectly competitive market--

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.780
the demand to my firm is simply
the total market demand minus

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.055
what everyone else is selling.

00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:06.930
So if I'm going to set
up my little tchotchke

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:11.130
blanket by the Eiffel
Tower, my demand

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.160
is going to be the total demand
for little Eiffel towers minus

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.230
what everyone else is
selling at on their blanket.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.510
The key point is, even with
fairly inelastic, big Q,

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.910
you can get really
elastic little q.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.330
So let's do an example.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.570
Let's first differentiate this.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:34.560
If you do dq dp,
what do you get?

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:41.120
You get d big Q
dp minus d S0 dp.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.330
Now, the first term is negative,
because demand is downward

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.100
sloping.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.430
This term is positive, dS0 dp.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.290
The higher the price,
the more suppliers

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.660
are going to be in the market.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.250
So it's a positive
minus a negative.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.310
So already, we see
d little q dp is

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.339
going to be bigger in absolute
value than d big Q dp,

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.310
because dS0 dp is positive,
and you're subtracting it.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.579
But we can actually
go further if we

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:13.579
assume firms are identical.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.270
Let's assume firms
are identical,

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.839
so that little q equals
big Q over N. Assume

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.190
there's N identical firms.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:32.010
And what that means
is that S0 equals

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.770
N minus 1 times little q.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.230
The supply of everyone
else is the number of firms

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.390
in the market--
that's an N, big N--

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.220
number of firms in
the market minus 1,

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.080
because that's your
firm, minus little q,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.290
because you're all identical.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.800
Then we can rewrite this-- you
can do the math at home-- we

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.290
can rewrite this equation
as-- under these conditions,

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.030
we can rewrite this as
the elasticity of demand

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:02.460
facing firm i is equal
to the number of firms

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:08.440
times the market
elasticity minus N

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:13.040
minus 1 times the market
supply elasticity.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.260
Nu is the market
supply elasticity.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.440
eta is the market
demand elasticity.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.380
eta i is the firm
demand elasticity.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.588
So the firm demand
elasticity is equal to N--

00:18:25.588 --> 00:18:27.380
I keep mixing my little
n's and my big N's.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.660
It's all the same thing.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:34.120
N times e-- so firm
demand elasticity

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.300
is equal to number of
firms times market demand

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.580
elasticity minus number of
firms minus 1 times the market

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.238
supply elasticity.

00:18:43.238 --> 00:18:44.280
We know this is positive.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.490
Supply curves slope up.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.000
We know this is negative.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.770
So we know it's a
negative number.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.150
What's good about
this formula is

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.500
it gives us examples showing how
much bigger firm elasticity can

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.750
be than the market elasticity.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.860
So for example, suppose,
as a simple example,

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.930
suppose N equals
100 suppose it's

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.060
100 people selling Eiffel
towers on their blankets

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.090
around the Eiffel Tower.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.275
And suppose that the market
elasticity is minus 1--

00:19:13.275 --> 00:19:15.600
that is, it's an
elastically demanded good.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.100
It's not super
elastically demanded.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.160
Basically, we call that an
elastically demanded good,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.110
minus 1.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.170
So it's sort of a 45-degree line
demand curve, a 45-degree line

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.700
demand curve sloping down.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.810
And let's also imagine that
the elasticity of supply is 1.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.870
That's a 45-degree line,
upward-sloping supply curve.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.730
These are pretty
standard assumptions.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.960
It's what I drew in lecture
1, a 45-degree demand

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.830
curve, a 45-degree supply
curve, with 100 firms.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:48.420
That gives you that the
firm specific elasticity

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.470
is minus 199.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.745
That is virtually flat.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.600
That is approximately
negative infinity,

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.040
as far as these things go.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.910
So basically, even with
just a regular-looking,

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.070
downward-sloping
demand curve, if it's

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.670
100 firms of
independent marketing,

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.430
you get a virtually flat
firm specific demand curve.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.920
So it's not crazy that firms
in a really competitive market

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.933
would face essentially
perfectly elastic demand.

00:20:18.933 --> 00:20:20.600
And that's the key
thing that's going on

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.280
in a perfectly
competitive market,

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.160
is firms themselves-- not
the market demand, the market

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.940
demand can be sensible-- but
firms themselves face virtually

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.350
perfectly elastic demand.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.780
If you're all selling
little Eiffel towers next

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.930
to each other, then if you
try to raise your price by one

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.025
euro, you're gone.

00:20:38.025 --> 00:20:38.900
No one buys from you.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.240
If you lower it by one euro,
everyone buys from you.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.165
That sort of makes sense.

00:20:44.165 --> 00:20:45.040
Questions about that?

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.060
Yeah.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.435
AUDIENCE: What
was the difference

00:20:47.435 --> 00:20:49.080
between big Q and little q?

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.495
JONATHAN GRUBER: Little q is the
firm and big Q is the market--

00:20:52.495 --> 00:20:53.620
very important to remember.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.382
Always remember.

00:20:54.382 --> 00:20:55.840
That's a middle of
the night thing.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.757
When I wake you up in
the middle of the night,

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:59.375
you have to know that one.

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:00.250
Little q is the firm.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.787
Big Q is the market.

00:21:02.787 --> 00:21:04.370
Now, I'm not
guaranteeing I always get

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:05.937
that right on the board.

00:21:05.937 --> 00:21:08.270
But I am guaranteeing if I
get it wrong, one of you guys

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.860
will correct me.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.300
So armed with this--

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.550
any other question about this?

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:22.620
Armed with this, we now turn
to how firms maximize profits,

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.600
short-run profit maximization.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.510
This is what we've
been heading for.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.690
With consumers, our
goal was to model how

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.700
they maximize their utility.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:38.430
With firms, our goal is to
model how they maximize profit.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:42.130
Now, what is the key
thing in the short run?

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.900
The fact is that
short run means we're

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.525
going to make-- we
talk about short run

00:21:45.525 --> 00:21:47.380
being capital is
fixed, but there's

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.650
one other assumption we're going
to make about the short run.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:56.730
We're going to assume
no firm entry or exit.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.010
It's sort of a complement
of capital being fixed.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.630
Firms are you're in.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.800
You make your capital
investment and you're in.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.480
You could stop producing,
but you still already made

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.680
your capital investment.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.180
Or in other words,
in the short run,

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.210
capital is a sunk
cost in the short run.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.910
You're in.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.352
And once the market starts,
no one new is coming in.

00:22:18.352 --> 00:22:19.810
So you sort of roll
in this market.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.102
People have announced to begin.

00:22:21.102 --> 00:22:23.270
They've set up their blankets.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.160
No one else has come
to set up a blanket

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.368
and no one's rolling up
their blanket and going home.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:37.350
So now, let's ask first
question-- what is profit?

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.290
Well, that seems sort of easy.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.825
Profit, as I wrote down earlier,
is just revenue minus costs.

00:22:44.825 --> 00:22:47.200
And if you're taking one of
those goddamn boring counting

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.070
courses in course 15,
that's where you'd stop.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.100
But you're not.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.330
You're take an interesting
course 14 course instead,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.320
where we tell you
that while this

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.490
may be the correct definition
of accounting profits,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.850
accountants simply say,
you add up the revenues

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:09.040
you make minus the costs you
incur, and that's the profit.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.230
But economists say,
wait a second--

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.860
that's not right,
because we also

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.970
have to account for opportunity
costs, as well as cash costs.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.430
Let's do a simple example.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.670
Let's say you're going
to start a website design

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.380
firm when you graduate.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.790
And all the firm's
going to be is

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.570
you, some slave
programmer you're

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.965
going to hire for
$40,000, and the computer

00:23:33.965 --> 00:23:34.840
they're going to use.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.480
And moreover, let's
say you already

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.860
have a computer sitting around.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.735
That's your computer.

00:23:43.735 --> 00:23:45.450
It's in pretty good shape.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:50.120
So you could just have the
slave work on that computer.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.690
And you can just
basically say, look,

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.390
I'll pay this guy $40,000.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.970
I'll think up all the
ideas and supervise them.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.220
And then that's the way
the firm's going to work.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.920
Let's say you do that, and
at the end of the first year,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.250
you have sales of $60,000.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.690
Then your accounting
profits are the $60,000

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.260
that you earned minus the
$40,000 you paid your employee.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.920
So you've made a $20,000
accounting profit.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.640
Why does that make no sense.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.820
In fact, why are
economic profits,

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.070
the true profits from this
enterprise once you account

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:26.050
for opportunity cost negative.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:28.570
What do the accountants
miss that economists get?

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.195
Yeah.

00:24:29.195 --> 00:24:30.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
something better.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.400
JONATHAN GRUBER: The
opportunity cost of your time.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.870
You just spent a
year doing this.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.970
You could have been off
making a zillion dollars,

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.370
like you guys all will.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:44.005
So we missed the opportunity
cost of your time.

00:24:44.005 --> 00:24:45.880
Let's say you could have
graduated and gotten

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.200
a job at $80,000 a year.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.725
Well then, actually,
the cost of the year

00:24:51.725 --> 00:24:53.730
is not just the $40,000
you paid the programmer.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.240
It's the $80,000 that
you forgoed by working

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.180
that year on your company.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:00.680
What else?

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.780
What's the other
opportunity cost?

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.450
Much smaller, but
still relevant.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.576
What could you've done
with the computer?

00:25:07.576 --> 00:25:09.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.340
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
you could have done what?

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.480
AUDIENCE: You
could have sold it.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.880
JONATHAN GRUBER: You could
have sold the computer, right.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.690
Now, used computers
aren't worth that much,

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.470
but let's say you could
have gotten a grand for it.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.810
Well, that's an
opportunity cost.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.923
If you would just gone
on and used your--

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:26.340
now, you might get
all the utility

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.210
from the computer, whatever.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.000
Let's put that aside.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:28.890
But you just gave
it to this guy.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.810
You never touched it,
literally got rid of it.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.813
It was like you didn't have
the computer that year.

00:25:33.813 --> 00:25:34.980
Then you could have sold it.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.890
Let's say you could have
sold it for another $1,000.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.220
So now, you've paid him $40,000.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.310
You've given up $80,000
of earnings and $1,000

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:49.590
on the computer, so your true
costs are actually $121,000.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.020
So actually, you
haven't made $20,000.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.460
You've lost $61,000.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.980
And that's why we don't care
about accounting profits.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.620
We care about economic
profits, the difference

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.740
being economic profits account
for opportunity costs--

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:07.670
very important to remember.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.080
Yeah.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.870
AUDIENCE: The profits,
economic profits

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.450
will be higher than
financial profit or typically

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.710
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.510
JONATHAN GRUBER:
It all depends on--

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.260
it depends on there's
no way to assign it.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.313
yeah.

00:26:23.313 --> 00:26:25.230
AUDIENCE: You've been
talking about sunk costs

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.500
and opportunity costs.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.110
Is it like [INAUDIBLE]
economics to consider time

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.050
to be a sunk cost,
like if you spend

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.030
a lot of time on something?

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.430
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, no, it's not.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.680
I mean, in some sense, a sunk--

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.240
basically, sunk costs is sort
of an irreversible fixed cost.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.115
If you spend time on
it, yeah, in that sense,

00:26:44.115 --> 00:26:45.770
from today's
perspective, it's sunk.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.200
But the point is, the
more important concept

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.740
is that time is money, that
if you spent your time running

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.470
this business, that's
time you could've

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.450
spent doing something else.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.220
Now, one thing we'll
come to in a couple

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.870
lectures, you might
say, well, hey,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:02.260
I would've taken the year
off and screwed around.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.233
So in fact, there
was no $80,000 cost.

00:27:04.233 --> 00:27:05.900
What if instead of
running this company,

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.317
the only thing I want to do
in my life is run the company.

00:27:08.317 --> 00:27:10.850
My second choice is watching TV.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.350
So then there's no
opportunity cost.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.290
That's wrong.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.040
And we'll teach you
why in a few lectures.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.580
I don't want you
to tell me why now.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.230
I want you to think about
why, even if you would have

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.220
spent the year watching TV.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:19.720
No, I don't.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.360
I said, no.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.945
Put your hand down.

00:27:21.945 --> 00:27:22.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.410
JONATHAN GRUBER: I knew
you're going to try.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.490
I love, I love that
willingness in this class

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.030
to answer questions.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.520
This one I want you
to just think about,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.978
because we're going to come
back to this in a few lectures.

00:27:30.978 --> 00:27:34.025
Now, let's go on and talk
about maximizing profits.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.670
Maximizing profits-- now that
we defined what profits are,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.920
how do you maximize them?

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.020
We know how to
maximize a function.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:54.073
If pi equals R minus C,
then the maximum d pi dq--

00:27:54.073 --> 00:27:55.240
you can't control the price.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.650
All you can control is
how much you produce.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.890
Your only control
variable is q, little q.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:08.670
So d pi dq equals dR d
little q minus dC d little q.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.957
Know what dC d little q is.

00:28:09.957 --> 00:28:11.040
We defined that last time.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.660
What's that?

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.790
What do we call that, the
change in costs with respect

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.720
to an increment in quantity?

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720
AUDIENCE: Marginal cost.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.012
JONATHAN GRUBER: Marginal cost.

00:28:21.012 --> 00:28:23.960
So we know this is
the marginal cost,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:29.690
but for a competitive firm,
what is marginal revenue?

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.490
So that's marginal
revenue, the amount you

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.860
work on the next unit you sell.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.830
For a competitive firm, what
is their marginal revenue?

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.193
What is the amount?

00:28:40.193 --> 00:28:40.860
AUDIENCE: Price.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.818
JONATHAN GRUBER: Price,
which is given to them,

00:28:42.818 --> 00:28:45.720
because they're a price taker.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.178
Firms, they don't have to think
about a complicated concept

00:28:48.178 --> 00:28:48.678
here.

00:28:48.678 --> 00:28:50.530
This is all complicated,
with tons of math.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.570
I hated that last
lecture, all the math.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.200
This is hard.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.470
This is easy.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.750
It's price.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.000
You're given-- if
you're a price taker,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.913
you're given a
price by the market.

00:29:00.913 --> 00:29:03.080
So marginal revenue for a
perfectly competitive firm

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.190
is just price.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:14.060
So you maximize profits when
price equals marginal cost is

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.300
the profit maximizing point.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.560
Profits are maximized when
price equals marginal cost.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.530
That is, you want to
produce until what

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:26.410
you get from the next
unit equals what you

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.440
spend to make the next unit.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.140
Yeah.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.530
AUDIENCE: What if you make--

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.650
what if you move it
to cost a bit less

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.740
and you sell it for
below the market.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.630
JONATHAN GRUBER: Let's
go to an example.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:42.160
So let's go to figure 7.2.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.940
Here we have the cost function
that we derived last time.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.610
C of q equals 10
plus 5q squared.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:54.160
You remember that
from last time.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.100
And then we have a
revenue function,

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.417
and I assume the
price per unit--

00:29:59.417 --> 00:30:00.917
we have a revenue
function where I'm

00:30:00.917 --> 00:30:02.890
going to assume the
price per unit is 30.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.970
For our example, I'm going
to assume P equals 30.

00:30:08.232 --> 00:30:09.190
I've just made that up.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.960
Once again, that comes from God
in these perfectly competitive

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.460
firms.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.127
They have no idea
where this comes from.

00:30:14.127 --> 00:30:15.220
It's just a price.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.300
We'll talk later
where it comes from,

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.890
but for now, it's
just a given thing.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.510
Let's say it's 30.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.630
So the firm's cost
function is of the form--

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.872
is graphed on the
left-hand side here.

00:30:24.872 --> 00:30:26.830
The revenue function is
simply a straight line,

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.103
which is 30 times q.

00:30:28.103 --> 00:30:29.770
So if they sell one,
revenue is 30, two,

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.720
revenue is 60, et cetera.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.490
And the profits are
simply the difference.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:41.140
So when we maximize, how
do we maximize profits?

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.460
Well we want to graph--

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.470
what we want to do
is graph the profit

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.500
for each additional unit sold.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.960
So for example, when
you go from selling

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:59.060
no units to selling one unit,
at no units, your cost is what?

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.197
If you sell no units,
what's your cost?

00:31:02.197 --> 00:31:03.780
Somebody raise their
hand and tell me.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.335
Yeah.

00:31:04.335 --> 00:31:04.720
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.370
JONATHAN GRUBER: 10,
not 0, because you

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.655
have the fixed costs.

00:31:07.655 --> 00:31:08.905
Those are paid no matter what.

00:31:08.905 --> 00:31:10.110
Remember, those are
fixed in the short run.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.777
We'll come back.

00:31:10.777 --> 00:31:11.960
This is very important.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.630
So if you zero, your costs are
10, your revenues are what?

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.000
0, so your profits
are negative 10.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.680
If you produce one
unit, what's your cost?

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.360
15.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.990
What's your revenues?

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.560
30.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.820
So you make a profit of 15.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.140
If you go from one unit,
now you're producing one.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.660
You want to know, should
I produce the second unit?

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.090
What's the marginal
cost of the second unit?

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.720
Well, we know what marginal
cost is with this function.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.460
Marginal cost, we just
differentiate this with respect

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.640
to q and we get 10q
is marginal cost.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.930
So we know the marginal cost
of the second unit is what?

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.632
20.

00:31:51.632 --> 00:31:53.340
What's the revenues
from the second unit?

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.173
Well, that's linear.

00:31:54.173 --> 00:31:55.530
It's 30.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:32:02.120
So you're still making--
you're making a profit of 10

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:02.720
on that unit.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.340
Now, we go to the third unit.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:16.613
So right, now after two units,
you are still making profit.

00:32:16.613 --> 00:32:17.780
Now we go to the third unit.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.322
It's hard, because
we're discretizing

00:32:19.322 --> 00:32:21.910
a continuous example, but
let's go to the third unit.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.080
The third unit, what's the cost?

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.420
What's the marginal cost?

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.470
30.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.430
What's the marginal revenue?

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:32.260
30.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.160
So you're at the profit
maximizing point.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.450
You have climbed the hill.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:41.860
You have maximized your profits.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.350
What's your total
profits at that point?

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:50.650
Well, your total profits is 3
times 30, which is 90, minus 10

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:55.090
plus 5 times 3 squared.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.100
Minus 10 plus 45 is 55.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.780
So your total profits are 45.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.740
That's your maximum profits.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.877
That's the most
you're going to earn.

00:33:05.877 --> 00:33:08.210
Now, coming to the question
that was asked a minute ago,

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.180
or a related version--

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.710
wait a second, if I
sell one more unit,

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.140
I still have positive profits.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.070
So my profits were 45
selling three units.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.450
The next unit, I'm
still in the black.

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.260
Why not sell more?

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.030
Why not sell one more unit?

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.805
Why not sell that fourth unit?

00:33:31.805 --> 00:33:32.800
Yeah.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.490
AUDIENCE: Because it's
going to cost you more

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.240
than it's going to give you.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.198
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:33:35.198 --> 00:33:39.030
Because we always make marginal
decisions in economics.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.250
We always ask what's the
next step I should take.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.940
And the next step
is a losing step,

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.450
because the fourth unit,
what's your marginal cost?

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:49.427
40.

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:50.260
What's your revenue?

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.330
30.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:54.000
So the fourth unit has
a negative 10 profit,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.310
so you don't want to make it.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:01.860
So profit maximization is
a hill-climbing exercise.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.025
I like to think of it, and
I describe in my videos,

00:34:04.025 --> 00:34:05.400
I think of it as
it's like you're

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.060
climbing a hill blindfolded.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.860
All you know is whether you're
stepping up or stepping down.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.570
And you need to figure out
when you get to the peak.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.880
If you step up, if your
next step is upward,

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.568
you must be short of the peak.

00:34:20.568 --> 00:34:23.110
If your next step is downward,
you must have passed the peak.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.693
It's just keep going till your
next step leads to a flat part.

00:34:25.693 --> 00:34:28.060
Your next steps, right
in front of the other.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.190
That's what profit
maximization is.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.605
The key thing is you can--

00:34:31.605 --> 00:34:32.980
the key thing
about the blindfold

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.688
is you don't need to
see the big picture.

00:34:34.688 --> 00:34:37.810
All you need to know is, is my
next step increasing my profits

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:38.920
or decreasing my profits?

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.840
If it's increasing,
I'm doing it.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.659
If it's decreasing,
I'm going backwards.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.159
That's all you need to know,
is just think about putting one

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.284
foot in front of the other.

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:49.060
Does that next unit make
me money or lose me money?

00:34:51.582 --> 00:34:53.540
So that is how we think
of profit maximization.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.040
Yeah.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.259
AUDIENCE: So what's
the next [INAUDIBLE]??

00:34:56.259 --> 00:34:57.680
You just stop it or--

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.110
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, that
is the optimal production.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.020
That's pinning down how
much you want to produce.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.150
Remember I said at
the biggest lecture,

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.520
the problem with
producer theory is

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.057
we have some set of
relationships between how

00:35:10.057 --> 00:35:11.140
much we produce and costs.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.260
It doesn't tell you how
much you should produce.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.940
This tells you how
much to produce.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.360
You have now solved
the firm's problem.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.880
This one extra-- this imposition
of the perfect competition

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:25.010
constraint has allowed us to
finally solve the problem.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.630
We have now solved
it, and we've said

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.150
that the firm, given
this cost function

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.540
and given a price of 30, a firm
should produce three units.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.500
Done.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.990
Just like before, we said,
we had this many pizzas

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.770
and cookies.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.540
Now we're pinning down q.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.170
Once we pin down q,
we can, of course,

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.845
go back and pin down l
and k, because l and k are

00:35:43.845 --> 00:35:45.960
a function of q.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.000
But this is where
it's one step harder.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.440
So this extra step
we have to take

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.450
is we have to impose
the market condition

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.720
to get to the little
q we want to produce.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.870
And in this case, that's 3.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.480
Questions about that?

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.208
Yeah.

00:36:01.208 --> 00:36:03.000
AUDIENCE: So you know
how in the beginning,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.888
you said that in a perfectly
competitive market,

00:36:05.888 --> 00:36:07.430
the producers are
price [INAUDIBLE]??

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:09.920
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.560
AUDIENCE: So I'm having
trouble understanding

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.010
why all of the guys who
are selling Eiffel towers

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.217
wouldn't get together
and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:17.217 --> 00:36:19.550
Let's just make all of the
Eiffel towers more expensive.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.060
JONATHAN GRUBER: Great.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:20.750
Great point.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:24.142
That's exactly-- we call that
a monopoly or an oligopoly,

00:36:24.142 --> 00:36:25.850
depending how you want
to think about it.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.250
They essentially
could monopolize.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.320
And we're assuming that
doesn't happen here.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.820
And I'll talk later
about why that's

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.220
way harder than you think.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.260
So we're starting-- once
again, in economics,

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.700
we always start with
simplifying assumptions

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.720
to draw general lessons.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.680
Then we'll make some
more, and then we'll

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.790
come back to the
more complicated,

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:41.780
real-world examples.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.430
But it turns out
virtually everything

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:46.600
we learn here is
still going to hold.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.860
Yeah.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.470
AUDIENCE: So if--

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.940
JONATHAN GRUBER: We
can go back to it.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:59.060
So now let's ask, how
big is the firm's profit?

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.090
How do we measure the
size of the profit?

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:09.230
Profit, if we think
about profits per unit,

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.680
profits equals
revenue minus costs.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.550
So profits per
unit, profits per q,

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:20.840
equals revenues per
q minus costs per q.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.300
What is this term, cost
divided by quantity?

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.390
What do we call that?

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:26.860
Average costs.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.900
And how much do
you get per unit?

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.400
You just get the price.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.180
So dR dq and R over
q are the same.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.980
In a competitive
market, marginal price

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.272
and average price are the same.

00:37:37.272 --> 00:37:38.660
It's the price.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.820
So this just says
profits are equal--

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:46.140
profits for q are equal to
price minus average cost.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.300
So your per-unit profits is
price minus average cost.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:58.190
And we can see
that in figure 7.3.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:02.760
Figure 7.3 shows our cost curves
for this 10 plus 5q squared

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.290
function we derived before.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.930
And you can see we have
an average total cost

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.630
curve, which first declines
and then increases.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.580
We have a marginal cost curve.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.310
And then we have an average
cost curve, average total cost

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.810
curve.

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.977
And then we have average
variable and average fixed.

00:38:18.977 --> 00:38:23.020
Now, we already announced
that the optimal production

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:28.070
level was three, where
price hit marginal cost.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.540
What's our profit at three?

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.080
Our profit is the difference
between that price

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.360
and the average
cost of three units

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.860
over all the units we produce.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.130
So the profit is actually 30.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.200
So there's a discreteness
problem here.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.430
I have to work this out.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:46.290
The problem, I said 45 before--

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.460
it's 45 mathematically.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.212
It's 30 in this because
of the continuity

00:38:49.212 --> 00:38:50.670
problem of the sort
of discreteness

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.930
between two and three.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.870
So the bottom line is,
in a continuous example,

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:56.030
this would be the same.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:57.750
And the bottom
line is the profit,

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:03.150
is the difference between the
price and the average cost

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.560
times the number of units sold.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.850
That's going to be the
bottom line profit.

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:16.455
Average cost here
is 10 over 3 is 3.

00:39:16.455 --> 00:39:18.830
Let's see, let's make sure
we've got the math right here.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:22.430
Average cost is 10
plus 5q squared.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:26.600
So average cost is
10 over q plus 5q.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:36.080
q is 3, so it's 3.33
plus 15, which is 18.33.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.860
Yeah, no, my math
was right with 45.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.060
This graph is wrong.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.570
So our average cost is 18.33.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.630
What's the revenue
at that point?

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.490
It's 30.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:53.880
30 minus 18.33 times 3 is 45.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.150
So it is 45.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.140
Is that right?

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.980
30 minus 18, 12 point--

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.060
no, that's wrong.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.070
No, 30, no, I got that wrong.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.930
You're right.

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:08.510
It's 35.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.220
So it all comes
from the discrete--

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.860
it's all about the problem
of a very discrete function

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.960
versus a continuous function.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.475
The bottom line is this--

00:40:16.475 --> 00:40:18.820
did I get right?

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:23.120
Yeah, 11.67 times 3 is 35.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:28.150
So the bottom line is, we got
45 from a hill-climbing exercise

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.518
and 35 from this
graph is basically

00:40:30.518 --> 00:40:32.310
a discreteness problem,
that in some sense,

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.910
in this continuous function,
they give you the same thing.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:36.743
The bottom line is
the profit is equal

00:40:36.743 --> 00:40:39.160
to-- we'll be clear on this
in the problem sets and exams,

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.360
what we're looking for.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.360
The bottom line is the
profit is the difference.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.800
The profit per unit
is the difference

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.040
between the average
costs, and the price

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.650
that you get for that unit.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.215
Now, with that in
mind, let me ask you

00:40:53.215 --> 00:40:55.140
the following question--

00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:01.200
what if I imposed a
tax of $1 per unit?

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:09.550
What if I imposed a
tax of $10 per unit?

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.820
What if I imposed a
tax of $10 per unit?

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:18.730
A $10 per unit tax, what would
that do to the cost curve?

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.980
Somebody, without looking
at the handout and cheating,

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.980
somebody tell me what's
the new cost curve

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.050
if I impose a $10 per unit tax?

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.870
What's the new cost curve?

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.220
What was the old cost curve?

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.970
The old cost curve was
10 plus 5q squared.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.260
What's the new cost curve?

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.313
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:38.313 --> 00:41:39.730
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's the answer

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.470
that almost everyone always
gives the first time,

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:42.390
but it's not right.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.230
JONATHAN GRUBER: 10 plus
5q squared plus 10q,

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.910
because I said per
unit I charge $10.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.660
If I'd said a fixed tax of
$10, you would've been right.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.160
It would've been
20 plus 5q squared,

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.490
but it's not, because it's
a per unit tax of $10.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:58.136
Yeah.

00:41:58.136 --> 00:42:01.527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:01.527 --> 00:42:03.360
JONATHAN GRUBER: We'll
see that in a second.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.890
It's just an easy
way to explain it.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:06.850
So that's the new--

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:11.500
with a tax of $10 per
unit, the new cost function

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:15.010
is 10 plus 5q squared plus 10q.

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:16.690
Oh, good, we didn't
show that in 7.4.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.680
So what does that do?

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.140
Well, we can go to
Figure 7.4 and see that.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:27.330
Here, the marginal cost
and the average cost

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:29.790
have both risen by 10.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:33.720
The old marginal cost was 10q.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.010
Now, it's 10q plus 10.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:41.050
So marginal cost
is now 10q plus 10.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:47.140
Average cost used to
be 10 over q plus 5q.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:53.180
Now it's 10 over
q plus 5q plus 10.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.370
So the bottom line is both
marginal and average cost

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.307
have shifted up by 10.

00:42:58.307 --> 00:42:59.140
What does that mean?

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.430
Well, first of all, it
changes optimal production.

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:06.630
If marginal cost is 10q plus
10, and our optimization

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.120
is set price equals
the marginal cost,

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.800
now we're setting 30
equals 10q plus 10.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.660
30 equals 10q plus 10, which
says the optimal q drops to 2.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:26.030
Subtract 10 from 30, divide
by 10, you get the optimal q.

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:31.370
Now that falls to 2, so now, you
only want to produce two units,

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.920
because the marginal
cost is higher

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.540
but the price is the same.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.490
You're going to produce less.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.920
So now, you're only going
to produce two units.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.080
And you could see
that in the graph,

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.967
that your marginal cost hits
the price now at two units,

00:43:44.967 --> 00:43:46.550
rather than hitting
it at three units.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.100
You see that in Figure 7.4.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.080
Your average cost
is also higher,

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.770
so you're going to make
less profits per unit.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:58.550
So you're producing
fewer units and making

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.030
less profit per unit.

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.780
So the entire
rectangle is shrunk.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:09.085
The rectangle has shrunk.

00:44:09.085 --> 00:44:10.460
Yes, the entire
rectangle shrunk.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.380
It shrunk because you're
selling fewer units.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.710
And it shrunk because
you're getting

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.715
less surplus per-- you're
getting less profit per unit.

00:44:18.715 --> 00:44:23.000
Remember, profit
per unit is price

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.760
minus average cost over quantity
or price minus average cost.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.670
Since average cost
is higher, you're

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:29.900
getting less profit per unit.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.570
You're selling fewer units
at less profit per unit.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:37.190
So that tax has significantly
lowered your profit.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.428
Questions about that?

00:44:39.428 --> 00:44:40.470
Doesn't have to be a tax.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.630
If I'd said suddenly,
whatever you're producing,

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.090
there was a change in
what it costs to produce,

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.710
any change in what
something costs

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:51.450
to produce in the
production function

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:54.040
can ultimately affect how
much you sell and you profit.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.760
So one excise you can
show yourself at home,

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:01.622
imagine that I had said
there was a fixed tax of 10.

00:45:01.622 --> 00:45:04.080
Actually, let me ask you this
question-- imagine I had said

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.862
there was a fixed tax of 10.

00:45:06.862 --> 00:45:08.570
How would that have
affected your profit?

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:11.860
How would that affect the
amount you sell and your profit?

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.312
It's a fixed tax of
10, not 10 per unit.

00:45:14.312 --> 00:45:16.270
How would that affect
how many units you'd sell

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:17.080
and what your profit is?

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:17.690
Yeah.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:19.310
AUDIENCE: Both [INAUDIBLE]
would have less profit.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:20.040
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.810
You'd sell-- why would
you sell the same amount?

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.030
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
affect your MC.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.490
JONATHAN GRUBER: It wouldn't
affect your marginal cost.

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:27.200
Remember, profit
maximization is where

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.270
marginal cost equals price.

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.980
If I have a fixed tax, that's
an effective marginal cost,

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.147
but it does lower your
profits, because you've still

00:45:34.147 --> 00:45:35.560
got to pay that extra tax.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.080
So here, your profits
get doubly hit.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.720
You sell less, and you
make less per unit.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:44.392
With a flat tax, you would
sell the same amount,

00:45:44.392 --> 00:45:45.600
but you'd make less per unit.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.933
That's an important distinction.

00:45:46.933 --> 00:45:48.630
I think I'll add
that for next year.

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.640
Now, one other important point--

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.320
the firm has one other
decision to make here

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.730
that we haven't covered
yet, which is that it has

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.010
to decide whether to shut down.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.592
Now, remember I said
there's no entry and exit.

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:04.050
That means you can't literally
leave and go somewhere else,

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:06.307
but you can just walk away.

00:46:06.307 --> 00:46:08.640
You can just literally say,
look, I'm not in this market

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.520
anymore.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.850
I'm not going to go set
up shop somewhere else,

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.850
but I'm not in this
market anymore.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.757
So the question is,
when would you do so?

00:46:18.757 --> 00:46:19.840
So I'm going to get to it.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.910
Hold on.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:22.045
Is it a question or answer?

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.670
If it's an answer,
I don't want it yet.

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.520
If it's a question,
I'll take it.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.540
So basically, suppose the price
in this market fell to $10.

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:37.210
Should you continue to
participate in the market?

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:41.190
Well, if the price
falls to $10, what

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.784
is the optimal
level of production?

00:46:43.784 --> 00:46:44.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:46.400
JONATHAN GRUBER: Zero.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.280
So does that mean
you should walk away?

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.480
No.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.710
What are your profits?

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:58.410
If you sell zero,
what are your profits?

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:02.270
Negative 10.

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:06.950
If you shut down and walk
away, what are your profits?

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.840
Negative 15.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.500
What's profits?

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.580
Profits is revenues minus costs.

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:12.550
Costs at zero--

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.140
I'm sorry, you
don't produce zero.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:22.640
That's bad.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.570
You produce one unit.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:24.830
I got the answer wrong.

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:26.745
If price equals
marginal cost-- yeah.

00:47:26.745 --> 00:47:29.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] with
the tax imposed, or are we--

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:30.410
JONATHAN GRUBER:
No, without the tax.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:31.070
I'm sorry.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:32.090
That's what I confused.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.640
We're back to without the tax.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.580
The price in the
market drops to $10,

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.407
so you produce one
unit, not zero.

00:47:39.407 --> 00:47:40.490
I shouldn't listen to you.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.350
I should look at my notes.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:43.820
One unit, not zero.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.990
You produce one unit.

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:53.180
At that point, what are your
revenues producing one unit?

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.860
You get 30.

00:47:59.557 --> 00:48:00.890
Yeah, this example is messed up.

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:02.515
I'm going to have to
come back to this.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.528
We made this-- this
example is wrong.

00:48:07.528 --> 00:48:09.320
I'm going to have to
come back to this one.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:14.420
So the key point with the
shutdown is basically,

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:16.760
you only want to shut
down if you're actually

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.322
going to lose more money
by staying in the market

00:48:19.322 --> 00:48:20.780
than you get by
exiting the market.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:21.600
So let me stop there.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.280
I'll come back and fix this.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:22.970
I made an error on this.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:24.680
I'll come back to fix it at the
beginning of the next lecture.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.020
And then we'll talk about
finishing up short-run profit

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:27.990
maximization.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.250
So let's pause
there and come back.

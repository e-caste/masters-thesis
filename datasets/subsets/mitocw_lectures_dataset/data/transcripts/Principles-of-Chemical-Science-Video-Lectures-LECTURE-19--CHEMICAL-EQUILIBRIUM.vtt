00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:24.560
PROFESSOR: We're pretty much
ready to get started.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:43.190
Let's settle down and take a
look at the clicker question.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:59.070
So take 10 more seconds.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.740
Very good.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.170
Most people had this right, and
the trick here is just to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.750
think about the sign of delta
g, whether it's negative and

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.840
positive, and think about the
equation and the influence of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.340
temperature on that equation.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.050
So whether it's going to make
delta s a bigger factor or a

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.710
smaller factor and how
that will play out.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.310
So you can look at the equation
and figure out what

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.430
the signs have to be and then
the influence of temperature.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.550
All right, so let's move to the
first slide that I have

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.190
today, which is welcome to the
middle of the semester.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.760
So I'm Kathy Drennan and this
is lecture 19 of 36, which

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.170
means that you are halfway
through the course.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.240
And so what you heard on Monday
before the exam was

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.620
about thermodynamics, and if you
don't have all your delta

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.270
g's and delta h's and if you
don't have entropy full in

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.330
mind, that's OK, we are not
really leaving thermodynamics,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.220
we're going into chemical
equilibrium, which is all

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.380
about thermodynamics.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.100
So you're going to hear a lot
more about delta g, delta h,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.660
temperature, and about our
friend, entropy as we go along

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.550
in the second half.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.480
So it's the middle
of the semester.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.500
That means that you've had two
of the sort of four hour exams

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.450
-- remember the fourth hour exam
is actually combined with

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.880
the final exam.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.900
So the final exam is 200 points
of cumulative material,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.440
and 100 points of new material,
so you've done two

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.620
now of those four sort
of hour exams.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.610
Just to remind you of some of
the topics you have seen and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.200
the topics coming ahead, this is
on the syllabus, and we're

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.730
actually where we're supposed
to be on the syllabus, so if

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.390
you want to take a look at that
ever to see where we're

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.990
going, we're actually
on track.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.330
So the first half of the course
are a lot of basic

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.910
principles, and we're moving
today into chemical

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.800
equilibrium, so a lot
more delta g's,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.340
delta h's coming on.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.150
And then we're going to move
into acid base, which is acid

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.650
base equilibrium.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.530
So we're not going to be
leaving equilibrium or

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.760
thermodynamics.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.320
Then we're going to go into
oxidation reduction, which is

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.030
also about equilibrium, and then
transition metals, and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.940
end with kenetics.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.020
And so, these altogether
represent the fundamentals

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.940
needed for the study of
biochemistry, organic

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.850
chemistry, any kind of
chemistry, biology, the life

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.180
sciences, many things -- so
you're getting all the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.770
fundamental principles of
chemistry in this class.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.030
So along those lines, I just
thought I would share

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.280
something that happened to me on
Wednesday when I was riding

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.710
the T, the Silver Line,
in particular.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.550
So I don't know if any of you
have had this kind of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.850
experience yet where you're on
public transportation and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.050
someone next to you says, "So,
are you a student?" Maybe you

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.880
have a notebook out or a
book out or something.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.030
And you say, "Yes," and they
said, "Oh, what are you

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.630
studying?" And then you say
"Well, you know, chemistry,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.270
math, physics." And they're like
"Oh." And then they go

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.120
busy themselves doing
something else.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.450
Or they tell you "I didn't
really like those subjects in

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.040
school." And then they
stop talking to you.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.890
So how many people have had that
experience so far, that

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.560
you scare the person next to
you by what you study?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.530
OK, a few people.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.700
If I ask that question four
years from now, I think it'll

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.550
be like half the class,
eight years from

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.840
now it'll be everybody.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.750
So this is kind of common.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.450
But what happened to me on the
Silver Line was actually

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.310
pretty exciting, because
I've had that other

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.690
experience many times.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.170
So, I was wearing my keys
around my neck, because

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.140
women's professional clothes, no
pockets, with a little MIT

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.600
cord, and the person next to
be on the Silver Line said

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:04.220
"So, do you go to the Georgia
Tech of the east?" And I said

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.790
"Well, I am a professor at MIT."
And he said "Well, I'm a

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.130
mechanical engineer and I went
to Georgia Tech." And so he

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.490
said, "So, what do you teach?"
I said, "Chemistry." And he

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.170
said, "Chemistry --

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.890
I really wish I had paid more
attention in chemistry." I

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.570
said, "Well, what do you do
now?" And he said "Well, I

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.840
work for the army, and I'm
part of a team that has

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.230
mechanical engineers, electrical
engineers, and

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.250
chemists, and we're trying to
figure out ways to detect

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.200
explosives." So I said, "Oh,
well have you heard of the

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.560
head of the Chemistry Department
at MIT, Tim Swager

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.890
who works in the area, and he
said, "Yes," he knew the name.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.840
And so he said that one of his
porblems on the team, and in

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.560
talking to the chemist, his
chemistry language is not

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.610
really good enough, and so he
was really struggling, and

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.650
that the best results of this
team effort would be if

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.530
everyone could really
talk to each other.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.720
So he wished that he had paid
more attention in his

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.070
chemistry class.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.980
And so I, of course, my
connection with chemistry was

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.260
by wanting to understand
biology, but for everyone it

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.790
might be a little
bit different.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.970
So, as I mentioned in the
beginning of the class, one

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.260
challenge that you have this
semester is figure out what

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.970
your connection to
chemistry is.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.910
What are you going to
use chemistry for?

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.260
How does this fit into
what you want to do?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.910
And maybe for some of you,
you're not going

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.940
to know that yet.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.120
Hopefully it won't take till you
have a job doing something

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.030
to realize that you're lacking
something in your education.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.540
And so, probably if you stay
in science and engineering,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.410
need chemistry, good to
learn it all now.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.480
And from exam 2, we see that
you are learning it now and

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.550
that's really great.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.660
So, some day maybe someone in
this room will be involved in

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.370
national security, and if you're
not a chemist, you'll

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.870
be able to talk to the chemists
and make really good

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.140
progress toward that work.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.130
So, chemistry -- it's important
in medicine,

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.140
national security, the economy,
energy initiatives, a

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.130
lot of the big things
going on now.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.150
It's a fundamental, and you will
get in this course, the

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.520
fundamentals.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.500
So if you have any good tea or
bus or airplane conversations,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.430
let me know --

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.220
I'll catalog those for
future reference.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.270
It's always a touch of how what
we do here connects with

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.790
the real world.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.700
All right, so we're not going
far from thermodynamics, we're

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.910
going into chemical
equilibrium.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.710
And we're going to be talking
a lot about delta g.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.370
So if delta g is not your friend
yet, don't worry, you

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.510
can still bond with delta g.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:53.030
All right, so chemical
reactions, chemical reactions

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.910
can go into a state
of equilibrium.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.700
And it's a dynamic equilibrium,
the reaction is

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.490
still happening, but if a
reaction is an equilibrium,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.480
the rate of the forward reaction
will equal the rate

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.570
of the reverse reaction, so
there'll be no net change in

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.290
composition.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:19.310
So let's take a look
at an example.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:27.220
So let's look at a reaction in
which we have nitrogen gas,

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:33.640
and we have hydrogen
gas, and they are

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:41.450
reacting to form ammonia.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.650
Suppose we just start with
nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.490
and we don't have any
ammonia left.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:56.210
So if we consider concentrations
versus time.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.290
So say we start with, we have
some nitrogen gas, some

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.580
concentration of nitrogen gas.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.170
As it reacts with hydrogen,
the concentration will

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:11.970
decrease and then level off.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.830
We'll start with some amount
of hydrogen gas, and its

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:22.730
concentration will also decrease
and level off.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.830
And in the beginning we won't
have any of the product, any

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.510
of the ammonia, so its
concentration will increase

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:36.230
and then level off.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.370
So when these reactions level
off, you're reaching

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.070
equilibrium.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.520
The reaction is still happening,
but the rate of the

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.370
forward reaction is equal to
the rate of the reverse

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.680
reaction, so there's
no net change.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.230
So the concentrations are
staying the same, but there's

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:56.390
still -- the reaction is
still going forward.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:01.290
So let's think about the case
when we have pure reactants

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.470
when we haven't formed enough
products yet to reach

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.050
equilibrium.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:15.690
So if we have pure reactants,
the reaction is going to be

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.490
spontaneous in the forward
direction.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:25.340
So we'll have a reaction
that is spontaneous

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:31.010
in the forward direction.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:36.590
And what will that mean about
our friend delta g?

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:42.380
Is it going to be greater
or less than zero?

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.540
So it'll be less than zero --
so delta g or the forward

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.370
reaction will be
less than zero.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.720
So when delta g is negative, the
reaction is spontaneous in

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.020
the forward direction.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:58.670
So what about when you have
pure products, then the

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.870
reaction should be spontaneous
in the reverse direction.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:13.690
So you have spontaneous in the
reverse direction, and what

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:19.750
does that mean about the
sign of delta g?

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.270
Greater or less than zero?

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:27.060
Greater, so it'll be positive.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.950
So, we can think about that
in terms of a plot.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:39.790
We can think about free
energy versus the

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.840
progress of the reaction.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:50.145
So, the progress of the
reaction is going this

00:11:50.145 --> 00:11:53.170
direction as you go along.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:12:02.810
So in the beginning if you have
pure reactants, delta g

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:07.200
is going to be less than zero.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.950
And you're going to proceed
along in the forward direction

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.550
spontaneously.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:20.690
If, on the other hand you have
pure products, delta g will be

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:26.880
positive, so you'll be
spontaneous in the reverse

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.880
direction, and the reaction
will go in the reverse

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:38.180
direction until what happens?

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.170
Till you reach equilibrium.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.810
And what would delta g
be at equilibrium?

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:49.440
Zero.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.530
So you see, there is a great
relationship between delta g

00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:03.830
and equilibrium, so we have
not left delta g behind.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:08.230
So, delta g is going to change
as the components of the

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.730
reaction change.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.500
As you have more products or
more reactants, you're going

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:19.250
to have a different delta g.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.600
So let's look at
some equations.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:28.330
So delta g is the change in free
energy, the difference in

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.460
free energy, at some point in
the reaction at any time with

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.100
amount of composition.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.930
We also have delta g nought,
which talks about delta g

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.360
under particular conditions, so
it's sort of the standard

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.330
free energy.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.940
We have a term called q, which
is the reaction quotient,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.420
which tells you about products
and reactants.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.700
We have our friend r, which is
the gas constant, and this

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.750
depends on temperature.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.040
So temperature is a term
involved here.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.350
So the delta g at any point in
the reaction is going to

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:10.240
depend on the delta g nought
for that reaction, and the

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.980
reaction quotient, products
and reactants, and we'll

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.390
define this in a minute, and
then the temperature as well.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.790
So we need to know more about
what q is, what this reaction

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.540
quotient is.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.760
So this slide looks a little bit
scary, but it's going to

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.760
be fine, because a lot of the
terms are going to cancel out.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.140
So we're going to talk about q,
this reaction quotient, and

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.650
we're going to have different
types of problems -- some

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.840
where we're talking about
gases, and others we're

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.510
talking about solutions.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.780
So you can see two different
kinds of q's, one that depends

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.300
on partial pressure of the gas,
and another that depends

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.870
on concentration.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.520
So here is our equation again
that we just saw -- delta g

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.730
equals delta g nought plus r t
natural log of q, and here

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.590
we've expanded the term for q.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:08.070
So p to the sub x is the
partial pressure of a

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.930
particular gas, and so in this
equation, we have a plus b

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.740
going to c plus d, the top of
the line or the products.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.660
So we have the partial pressure
of gas c, and this is

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.660
over a reference, partial
pressure, raised to the power

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.240
c, the coefficient, and then
also we have d, the partial

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.030
pressure of gas d, over a
reference raised to the

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.750
small letter d.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.890
On the bottom of the terms for
the reactants, partial

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.842
pressure of gas a over a
reference raised to the

00:15:38.842 --> 00:15:42.150
coefficient a, partial pressure
of gas b over the

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.020
reference raised to
the coefficient b.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.120
Now what's great is that the
partial pressure is one bar,

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.100
and so that basically cancels
out as far as we're concerned.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.260
And so the term for q
is much simplified.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.980
You won't see problems that have
the reference in them, so

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.200
you can just think about
q in terms of

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.200
products over reactants.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.810
And you just have to remember
that the coefficients in the

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.280
reactions do matter.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.110
If you're talking about
solutions, the only difference

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.550
is that we'll be talking about
molar, so we have one molar,

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.850
so the reference term here
also cancels out.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:26.720
When you see something in
brackets, like c in brackets,

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.820
here that telling you it's
a concentration term.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.990
So here, q is the concentration
of c raised to

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.530
its coefficiency.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.350
The concentration of
d raised to its

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.080
coefficient d over reactants.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.395
Concentration of a to
a, concentration

00:16:43.395 --> 00:16:45.210
of b raised to b.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:51.510
So the thing in x indicates
it's a concentration term.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.860
So q is just products over
reactants, considering the

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.310
stoichiometry of the particular
reaction.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.720
So what about the equilibrium
constant k?

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.580
So at equilibrium you told me
that delta g equals zero, and

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.100
at equilibrium q, the reaction
quotient equals k, the

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.730
equilibrium constant.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:22.360
So we can consider that in terms
of this expression, if

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.340
we're talking about this
expression at equilibrium,

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.230
delta g is going
to equal zero.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.040
And so, we just set this whole
term equal to zero.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.600
We can rearrange the equation
bringing delta g nought to the

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.570
other side.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.080
And so we have delta g at
nought equals minus r t

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:49.660
natural log of K, because at
equilibrium, k is equal to q.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.160
So now we have another term to
solve for delta g, and an

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.220
equation that relates delta
g nought to be equilibrium

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:04.560
constant k.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.220
So k, the equilibrium's constant
has the same form as

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.420
q, but we're only talking about
the concentrations or

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.500
the partial pressures of
things at equilibrium.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.580
So it's the same, it's product
over reactants, same

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.360
expressions as q, but in the
corner you say at equilibrium.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.570
So you're only talking about the
concentrations of things

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.380
at equilibrium if you're
solving for k.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.490
If you're solving for q, it's
the concentration or the

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:41.420
partial pressure at any time in
that particular reaction.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:46.780
Important thing, products
over reactants.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.630
All right, so, we can rewrite
the equation one more way.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.200
So I just told you that delta g
nought is equal to minus r t

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.460
natural log of K. So we can
substitute into the expression

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:05.950
minus r t natural log
of k, and now we can

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.470
rearrange this equation.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.290
And so, if we rearrange it, we
have delta g, the delta g at

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.400
any particular point in the
reaction equals r t natural

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.140
log of q over k.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.630
And this equation is helpful for
people if they're thinking

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:27.910
about what is the equilibrium
constant, what concentrations

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.870
do I have now -- we're not
at equilibrium, what

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.610
concentrations do I have now,
what is q now in the reaction,

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.560
how does that compare to k?

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.590
And when you know what those
values are, you'll know

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.740
something about the direction of
the reaction because you'll

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.690
know if delta g is positive
or negative.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.690
It'll to be spontaneous in the
forward direction or in the

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.930
reverse direction.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.400
So this is a handy equation
for thinking about the

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.320
relationship q k delta g.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.930
So let's think about that
relationship for a minute.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:08.980
If q is less than k, what
is the sign of delta g?

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:13.950
So it would be negative, which
means the forward direction of

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.360
the reaction will occur.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.200
So if you think about it, you
can think about in terms of

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.580
products and reactants.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:28.140
So at equilibrium then, if q is
less than k at equilibrium,

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.850
there are more products than
there are right now, so you

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.650
need to make more products.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.110
So you would have delta g would
be negative, you'll see

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.280
that mathematically, and you can
think about it in terms of

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.510
whether you're going
to make more

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.550
products or less products.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.280
If q is greater than
k, what is delta g?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.780
So it would be positive
and the reverse

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.040
direction would occur.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.230
So you think that at q, if it's
larger than k, it has

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.520
more products in its terms, and
at equilibrium there are

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.930
less products, so you need to
go in a direction that will

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.110
get rid of some of those
products so you'll reach

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.740
equilibrium again.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.630
So this equation is very helpful
in thinking about the

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.920
direction of the reaction --
which direction will it be

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.840
spontaneous.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.560
So let's look at an example.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.730
K is given in this example, and
then we have a bunch of

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.070
partial pressures.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.890
And we're asked which
direction the

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.710
reaction will go.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.090
So what do I need to do to
answer this question, what do

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.250
I need to calculate?

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:40.950
So if I'm given k, and a bunch
of partial pressures, what do

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.810
I first need to calculate?

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.010
Q, right.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.120
So let's calculate q.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.110
So q, we're going to talk about
products over reactants,

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:58.990
so we're going to talk about
be partial pressure of the

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:04.150
ammonia, and there are two
of them being formed.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.960
Our reactants, we want to talk
about the partial pressure of

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:13.690
the nitrogen, and the partial
pressure of the hydrogen gas,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:19.360
and again include the
stoichiometry, so we have

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.460
three there.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.740
So now I can plug in my values,
so I'm told I have 1 .

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:32.280
1 bar, and down here I have 5 .

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.170
5 and 2 .

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:41.590
2 to the 3, again, considering
the stoichiometry.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.290
And if you do the math,
you get 2 .

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.140
1 times 10 to the minus 2.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.550
That's your q value.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:54.480
Now given your k value, which
the problem states, and this q

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.860
value, let's do a clicker
question, tell me which

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:17.020
direction the reaction
will go.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:40.470
All right, 10 seconds.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.330
So, 77%, pretty good.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:48.640
So, q is greater than k here.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.910
And if q is greater than
k, what will be

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.580
true about delta g?

00:23:54.580 --> 00:24:09.540
I have another clicker question
for that -- yell out

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:14.950
the answer.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.310
What is it?

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.370
Positive, right.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:21.370
So you're going to shift towards
reactants, so you're

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.540
going to go in the reverse
direction.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.570
So you think about whether there
are more products or

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:32.340
less products at equilibrium,
and so there are more

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.790
products, so we have to think
about which direction it'll

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:52.290
go, and here, ammonium will
dissociate until equilibrium

00:24:52.290 --> 00:25:08.410
is reached again.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.280
OK.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:17.480
So let's think more about what
k is going to tell us.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.860
So k tells us about the mixture
of products and

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.240
reactants at equilibrium,
whether we can expect low or

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:32.570
high concentration of reactants
at equilibrium.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:42.800
So let's look at another
example.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:50.890
So when you have k that's
greater than one, so more

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.400
products than reactants at
equilibrium, you can think

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:02.560
about this in terms of higher
products at equilibrium.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:13.765
When you have k less than
one, we're going

00:26:13.765 --> 00:26:17.770
to have lower products.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:24.440
So again, think about k in
terms of products over

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:35.070
reactants at equilibrium.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.440
So if k is greater than
one, there are more

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.060
products than reactants.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.320
If it's less than one,
there will be less

00:26:41.320 --> 00:27:05.000
reactants than products.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.060
So let's look at an
example of that.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:13.850
Let's look at when k is
greater than one.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.025
And I have the equation
up there and I'll

00:27:16.025 --> 00:27:17.910
write it here as well.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:28.420
So we have 2 n o 2, and two
double arrows, and n 2 o 4.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:34.690
So we have a k value
here of 6 .

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:40.720
84, so that's greater
than one value.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.640
So let's think about
this reaction.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.920
So over here instead of
concentration, we're going to

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.000
talk about partial pressure
because we're talking about

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.400
gas, and we have time.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.250
So initially we have
a reactant.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.540
And the reactant starts at
some concentration and

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:12.160
decreases and then reaches a
straight line, so reaches

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.730
equilibrium.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:19.250
So we have our reactant here.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:24.250
Originally we have no product,
and so product is going to go

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:28.940
up and be formed and then it's
going to level off as you

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:35.350
reach equilibrium.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:42.380
So initially, what is
true about q and k?

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:57.260
So with no products, what
is true about q and k?

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.090
Q is less than k.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.760
And so what's true
about delta g?

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.060
Less than zero, it'll be
negative, so it'll be

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.540
spontaneous in the forward
direction.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.510
So you're going to be
spontaneous in the forward

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:15.190
direction and you're going
to make your product.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:21.630
So now let's calculate what the
concentrations are going

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.700
to be at equilibrium.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:37.680
So initially, so you have your
initial pressure for the

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:48.510
reaction, 2 n o 2 going to
n 2 o 2, and our initial

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:54.470
concentrations are
given as one bar,

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:59.910
and we have no product.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:07.290
Now we talk about the change as
we go toward equilibrium,

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:12.380
how much does the
reactant change?

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.400
What do I write here?

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.670
What change?

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.660
Minus x minus something x?

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.890
Minus 2 x.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.150
So again, we're considering
the stoichiometry,

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:27.680
and what's over here?

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:38.380
So just plus x, and then at
equilibrium we now have 1

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:46.980
minus 2 x and x.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.000
So we're talking about
equilibrium concentrations, so

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.690
we're talking about
k, so k equals 6 .

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:59.600
84, which is going to be equal
to the partial pressure of the

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.430
product over the partial
pressure of

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:07.980
the reactant squared.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:18.400
So it's going to be equal to
x over 1 minus 2 x squared.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:27.030
So x, if you calculate it out,
should equal point 381 bar.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:37.910
And then if we do 1 minus 2
times 0.381 bar, we get 0 .

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:43.450
238 bar.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:50.170
So if we go back over here, our
products at equilibrium --

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:57.440
oh, I guess I should write what
-- so x is our product

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.510
and this is our reactant.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:07.360
So the product we have 0 .

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.140
381, and our reactant
at equilibrium is

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:18.020
going to be 0.238 bar.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:23.760
So we have more product than
reactant at equilibrium, which

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.500
is consistent with the value of
k being greater than one.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.910
So, when you know something
about the equilibrium

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.620
constant, you know something
about the reaction and whether

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:44.690
you would expect more products
or reactants at equilibrium.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:50.900
So again, you can think about
this in terms of q and k.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.500
All right, so now we are
going to go toward our

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.410
next clicker question.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:01.460
So if we can rewrite the
expression for delta g equals

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.940
minus r t natural log of k, and
express it in terms of k,

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.960
and now we can think about
then what is that

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.940
relationship.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.110
If you have a large value for
k, what do you expect to be

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:36.870
true about delta g nought?

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:53.880
All right, let's give
that 10 seconds.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.770
OK, why don't you discuss for
a minute with your friends

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:17.740
whether you agree with
that 78% or not.

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:47.250
All right, now we're going to
re-poll, so click in again.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:53.850
Now give the right answer.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:57.400
Interesting.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.280
It actually usually goes the
other direction, that after

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.400
there's a discussion, more
people come to the same

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.560
conclusion.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.860
So I guess it's a matter of if
the professor asks that, you

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.510
assume that that must have
been the wrong answer.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:16.500
Was that people's logic?

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.230
So what are the points of doing
this, and we're going to

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.870
actually do this kind of thing
a few more times in class, is

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:27.670
that collectively, and I was
actually just at an education

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:31.510
meeting about science down at
the Howard Hughes Medical

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:35.870
Institute, that statistics show
that if you have a group

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.660
where everyone in the group
has the wrong answer and

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.360
they're allowed to discuss it,
there's a good chance they'll

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.000
come up with the right answer.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.520
So that it's not just about one
person in the group having

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.690
the right answer, convincing
everyone else that they're

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.300
right, that the act of
discussing often

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.300
leads to new answers.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.010
So now that you know that it's
not a trick on my part to tell

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.950
you you got it wrong, we'll see
next time whether this, in

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:06.430
fact, holds, that the act of
discussing helps give the

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.780
right answer.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:13.290
Anyway, so if k is large, it
is true that delta g nought

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.810
would tend to be negative and
more -- it would be negative

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.800
and more on the large side.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.080
So one can think about if
there's more products over

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.180
reactants, that's going to
indicate something about the

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.150
delta g nought for the reaction,
and the k -- the k,

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.935
if it's greater than 1, if it's
a big number, then there

00:36:32.935 --> 00:36:36.100
are more products than
reactants, and delta g nought

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.290
would be negative and would
tend to be a large number.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:45.430
All right, so this is more
actually kind of simple

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:50.840
bookkeeping involved that
if you know steps in the

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.780
reactions and you know
equilibrium constants, you can

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.350
calculate an overall
equilibrium

00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:59.660
constant for that reaction.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.650
So you can write a reaction
as the sum of different

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.060
components.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:11.080
And so up here, we are going to
try to add these first two

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.990
equations to get this
net equation.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:22.610
So we have 2 gas p 3 c l 2 going
to 2 p l c 3, and that's

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:23.960
equilibrium 1.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.010
And so then in the next
reaction, some of that is

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:31.670
being consumed reacting with
another c l 2, giving you p c

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:38.000
l 5, and the net reaction we're
interested in has 2 p 5

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.720
c l 2's going to 2 p c l 5.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.720
All right, what do I have to
do before I can add these

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:52.460
together effectively and
have things cancel out?

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.450
I need to multiply what?

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:59.150
Second equation by 2, yeah.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:06.870
So to get that to work I would
need to have 2's there, then

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:11.080
this is going to cancel out and
these will add up, so we

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.630
have 5 and then we have two
of the main products.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:20.680
So if I do that, and I have the
equilibrium constant for

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.120
one and for two, how am I
going to get equilibrium

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.970
constant for three?

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:36.710
I'm going to multiply
k 1 by k 2 and k 2.

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:40.160
So I'm going to have to multiply
k 2 in there twice,

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.050
because there's two of those
-- we'd multiply that up.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:48.460
So if you have different parts
of reactions and you can sum

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.390
them together, then you can
multiply out the individual

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.870
k's to get the new value of k.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.410
So that's something that's just
useful that you'll run

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:05.690
into in doing these
types of problems.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.510
All right.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.950
Now we're going to
think about how

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:16.510
equilibriums respond to stress.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.150
And I always feel like
I need to pause.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:24.500
MIT students, you guys are some
of the smartest, most

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.160
talented scientists
in the world.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.090
I don't know if you fully
appreciate how

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.140
smart you all are.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:39.300
But this concept is tough
for MIT students.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.340
So Le Chatelier's principle
says that a system in

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:49.260
equilibrium that is subjected to
with stress tends to react

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:57.570
in such a way to minimize
that stress.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:00.550
I have advisees coming to
my office saying, "I'm

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.620
double-majoring in this and
that and I'm taking five

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.880
classes and I have UROP and I
have this lab exercise --

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.730
I don't know what's going on,
so I've been thinking a lot

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:17.160
about it and I think I should
add a third major." Le

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.610
Chatelier would be very
unhappy with that.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:25.930
Le Chatelier would say that the
appropriate response is to

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:33.510
drop one of the majors, to
minimize the stress.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:37.160
So in doing these problems, what
I want to encourage you

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:42.480
to do is think the opposite
of what you would do.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.900
Minimize the stress.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.200
If you think about that
you'll be all set.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.040
All right.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:55.440
So Le Chatelier's principle
actually is very useful.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.480
If you think about minimizing
the stress, you'll be able to

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.030
predict the direction that
the reaction will shift.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:06.910
So the reaction's going to shift
in a way to minimize the

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.390
stress, so you can predict it.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.250
If you're thinking along these
lines, you say, oh, that

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:16.060
system was stressed, and then
you can think about how that

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.370
reaction or that system
is going to respond.

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:24.380
So let's give some examples.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:29.230
So, we have a system in
equilibrium -- we started out,

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.600
we had our nitrogen
and our hydrogen

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.110
and we had no product.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.080
We reacted the hydrogen and the
nitrogen, their forming

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.800
products, and eventually they
reach equilibrium, their delta

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.510
g equals zero there's still
the reaction going on, but

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.530
there's no net change.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:49.990
All right, now the system
is going to be stressed.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:54.670
So we're going to add
more of a reactant.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:59.720
How will the system react
to minimize that stress?

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.410
What is it going to do?

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:05.930
It now has too much of
one of the reactants.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:09.530
You'll form more products, and
that's going to use up some of

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.505
your other reactant, which will
go down, and you're going

00:42:12.505 --> 00:42:16.940
to form more product until
equilibrium is reached again.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.050
And one thing that I'll mention
that the ratio has to

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.660
be the same.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.000
The equilibrium constant is
a constant given the same

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.610
temperature, but you're not
necessarily always going to

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.060
have the same concentrations,
but you should have the same

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.710
ratios, the same value of k.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:37.200
All right, so what about if you
add more product, what's

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.120
going to happen?

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.940
What direction will the
reaction shift?

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.160
Right, it's going to shift
toward the reactants, so

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.150
you're going to make more of
each of the two reactants

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:54.920
until again, you find your
equilibrium again.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.830
And then the reaction's still
going but there's no net

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.490
change anymore.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.800
All right, so let's think about
this -- let's think

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.440
about this in terms of
the math as well.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.060
If you want to stick with the
math, that's OK, you can think

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.350
about calculating
delta g's here.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.840
So if you're a system in
equilibrium and you add more

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.490
hydrogen, the system
will respond to

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.390
minimize that increase.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:23.490
So it's going to make more
product that will minimize the

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.930
increase, it shifts
to the right.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:31.390
And this can be explained
in terms of q and k.

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.150
So, you can think about,
again, do you have more

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:39.130
products now or did you have
more products at equilibrium,

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:43.990
and if you're adding more
reactants, momentarily q will

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:47.740
become less than k.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.260
And so, you would get a negative
delta g, which would

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:56.640
make it spontaneous in the
forward direction.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:00.210
So some people like to think
about this in terms of delta g

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:03.100
equals r t natural
log of q over k.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:08.040
So you think about if q is less
than k, what sign you

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.780
have for delta g, and that's
tells you whether the reaction

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.310
is spontaneous in the forward
or the reverse direction.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:17.030
And let me just give you
one hint for taking

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.380
exams in this unit.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.340
That use of the arrow is really
good, or saying "toward

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.440
product" or "reactant." I can't
tell you how many people

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.500
write -- know what the answer
is and write left when mean

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.350
right, or write right
when they mean left.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:36.350
But if you draw an arrow you
never really get it wrong, and

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:39.640
when you say products or
reactants it's a lot harder to

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.610
make that mistake.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:44.610
So if you're not good with right
or left, which let me

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:48.040
tell you a large fraction of
people are not, hedge your

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.950
bets, you can write everything,
more products,

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:53.100
arrows, and then write if you
want, then you're pretty sure

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.930
that you have it all in there.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:56.810
OK.

00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:03.050
So again, we can explain this
in terms of q or k.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:04.990
All right.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:08.880
So let's just quickly talk about
adding more products.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.040
We did this already.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.260
If more products are added. then
q is going to be greater

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.730
than k momentarily, and you
would shift toward reactants,

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:25.480
shift toward the left, and
again, we saw that down there.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.250
So tell me a final clicker
question and then we're done.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:53.610
What happens if you remove
products and why?

00:45:53.610 --> 00:46:02.930
OK, 10 seconds.

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:07.540
See if we can get in the 90's.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.080
No, no 90's today, we'll have
to do it next time,

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.430
but we got 73 right.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:16.380
So we're going to make more
products as well.

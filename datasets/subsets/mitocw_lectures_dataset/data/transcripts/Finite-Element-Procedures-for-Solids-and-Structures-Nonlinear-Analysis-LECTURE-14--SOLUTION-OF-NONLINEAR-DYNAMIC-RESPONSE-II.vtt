00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.600
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.160
lecture on non-linear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.320
structures.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.300
In this lecture, I'd like to
continue with our discussion

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.530
of the methods of solution for
the finite element equations

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.670
that we are encountering in
non-linear dynamic analysis.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.640
In the previous lecture,
I pointed out that the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.100
techniques used for the solution
of these finite

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.590
element equations in non-linear
dynamic analysis

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.020
can be classified as data
integration techniques,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.410
methods of multiple position,
and substructuring.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.870
We talked in the previous
lecture about these types of

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.870
methods, and in particular,
we discussed in detail an

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.110
explicit integration method,
namely the central difference

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.570
method, and an implicit
integration method, namely the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.210
trapezoidal rule.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.720
We talked about how these
methods are applied, how time

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.210
steps might be selected, what
the restrictions of these

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.830
methods are, and so on.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.080
I'd like to now in this lecture
discuss with you the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.730
method of multiple position,
and also

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.380
substructuring technique.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.050
After the discussion off these
two techniques, I'd like to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.270
talk with you about
some examples.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.000
As a first example, we want
to consider the wave

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.320
propagation in a rod.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.650
As a second example, I'd like to
share with you experiences

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.000
regarding the response of a 3
degree of freedom system.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.830
As a third example, then, we
want to consider the analysis

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.360
of a 10-story tapered tower.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.300
Example 3 and example 1 are
really solutions of a linear

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.320
system, but we learn quite a
bit, even regarding non-linear

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.890
analysis, from these examples.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.860
As the fourth example, then,
I'd like to share with you

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.960
experiences obtained in the
analysis of a pendulum that

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.396
goes through very large
displacement.

00:02:21.396 --> 00:02:25.660
As a fifth example, then, we
consider the pipe whip

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.500
response solution.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.860
This is of much practical
interest.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.860
And after these examples,
which I've prepared view

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.220
graphs for, I'd like to consider
with you some slides.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.840
On these slides, we will have
the analysis of a control rod

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.860
drive housing with the response
of a spherical cap, a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.410
highly non-linear problem,
large displacement,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.940
elastoplastic response, and then
the analysis of a fluid

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.890
structure interaction problem,
a pipe test in which we are

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.030
comparing our computer's
results with

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.610
experimental results.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.970
I should point out right now
that the details regarding

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.650
these example solutions are
given in some papers that I

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.220
had also earlier.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.530
And please look at the study
guide, where the references to

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.560
these papers are given.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.580
Let me now walk over here to
the view graph that we have

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.310
prepared regarding
this lecture.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.940
And the first method of solution
that I wanted to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.080
discuss with you is the method
of multiple position.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.410
Quite a number of you probably
have used this technique

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.240
already in linear analysis.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.910
In fact, the word
"superposition" somehow

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.440
implies that you are dealing
with a linear analysis.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.670
However, we can extend that
method directly to non-linear

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.660
analysis if we recognize that
the mode shape vectors of the

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.160
system at a particular time
can be used as generalized

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.670
displacements, or basis vectors,
to express the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.100
response to any other
time, as well.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.370
The method is effective when,
in non-linear analysis, the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.410
response lies in only a few
vibration modes, just the same

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.670
way as we are applying multiple
position also in

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.840
linear analysis, namely, it's
only effective really when a

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.840
few vibration modes capture the
total dynamic response.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.080
The same holds here, of course,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.220
in non-linear analysis.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.420
And when the system has
possibly only local

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.350
non-linearities.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.550
Let's look at is equations
that we're using in this

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.250
multiple position technique.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.810
The basic starting point are
the equations that we have

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.310
seen before regarding
dynamic analysis.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.060
But notice in this particular
equation, I have assumed now

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.280
that the damping matrix is not
present, so we have no damping

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.240
in the system coming from
the damping matrix.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.110
There could, of course, be
damping due to the material

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.200
non-linearities, which
are captured in

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.450
the K and the F matrix.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.680
Well, this is the
set of equations

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.200
that we want to solve.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.230
And usually, we just iterate on
these equations until the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.940
right-hand side is 0, where of
course we also would bring

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.330
this one here onto the
right-hand side.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.210
So think of this one here as a
minus on the right-hand side,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.980
and if, then, this right-hand
side, with M on that

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.230
right-hand side is 0, meaning
the data UK is 0, no more

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.040
updating to the incremental
displacements, then we have

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.020
established equilibrium
configuration corresponding to

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.040
time t, of course, including
inertia effects.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.000
In multiple position, we don't
want to directly to deal with

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.210
these equations in this form.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.750
Instead, we want to transform
them into a new form, and into

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:08.670
a form such that we obtain less
unknowns to deal with.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.730
Let's assume for the moment that
tau is equal to 0 so that

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.610
we are dealing with the solution
of the equations

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.610
using the initial
stress method.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.270
We talked about initial stress
method in an earlier lecture.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.990
Then using this transformation
here, where phi R are the

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:37.150
eigenvectors of this problem
down here, And the xi are the

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.870
generalized displacements
corresponding to these

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.000
eigenvectors.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.350
Notice this equation is exactly
the same that we're

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.440
used to seeing in
linear analysis.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.080
Of course, in linear analysis,
we are usually not putting

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.500
this t plus delta t up there.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.710
It's understood that the time
dependency is in xi, but the

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.040
space dependency is in phi i.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.784
And notice we are summing
here from r to s.

00:07:05.784 --> 00:07:09.060
r would have to be selected
by the analyst,

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.580
and s the same way.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.010
Having introduced this
transformation with this

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:23.710
eigenvalue problem here, and
substituting for the U

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.880
displacements in the general
equilibrium equation, and

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.400
using the same approach as
we are used to in linear

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.990
analysis, we directly obtain
this set of equations.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:42.980
Now, notice here that in this
vector x double dot, and in

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.340
this vector x, delta meaning
increment, we have only the

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:53.760
components corresponding to the
r mode up to the s mode.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.530
These are the generalized
displacements corresponding to

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.540
phi r up to phi s.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.470
Here we have phi r to
phi s listed in this

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.800
matrix, capital phi.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.070
Lower-case phi for these here.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:13.980
These are the columns in this
matrix that is denoted as a

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.650
capital phi.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:21.890
Notice here we define an omega
squared matrix, 0 elements in

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.370
the off-diagonals.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.160
And on the diagonal, we have the
frequencies of the system,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.880
of the actually linear system,
because we use 0K in the

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.590
eigenvalue solution.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.750
These are the entries for
this equation up here.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.400
And notice that we have now here
much less equations than

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.650
the total number of finite
element degrees of freedom.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.330
Typically, r might be 1, s might
be 20, and then we would

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.330
have 20 equations here,
20 equations only.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:06.280
Of course, r could also be 25,
and s 30, in which case we

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.470
have here a multiple position
corresponding to the 25th up

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.240
to the 30th mode.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.050
In any case, in general, we will
have much less equations

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.830
then finite element degrees of
freedom that are listed, for

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.970
example, in this vector
here, R, I should say.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.920
The externally applied load
corresponding to these degrees

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.280
of freedom are listed in here.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.940
Of course, the F vector is the
vector of nodal point forces

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.480
corresponding to the element
stresses at time t plus delta

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.180
t, and at the end of iteration,
k minus 1.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:54.160
This matrix times that vector
gives us a vector which has

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.930
the same length as this vector
has and that vector has.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.930
So we are not dealing anymore
with all the degrees of

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:10.010
freedom that are listed for
which we have the forces here

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.440
in the solution of the equation,
but with much less

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.620
degrees of freedom, the degrees
of freedom being equal

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.660
to the number of mode shapes
that are being employed.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.760
An interesting and most
important point is that in

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.660
non-linear analysis, we have a
coupling, due to this vector

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.530
appearing in here, between
the different mode shape

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.390
equations, or modal equations.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:40.450
We cannot solve, as we usually
do in linear analysis, one

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.510
equation of the modes of a
position after the other.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.340
In linear analysis, you would
typically solve the dynamic

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.440
response equation in mode 1,
then the one in mode 2, then

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.700
the one in mode 3, and like
that, you'd sweep over all the

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.100
generalized degrees of freedom,
one after the other,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.260
for the total response from
time 0 to the end of the

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.030
response time that you're
interested in.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.260
In non-linear analysis, we have
to go step by step still

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:22.100
forward in time, solving all
equations, all modal equations

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.360
at time t, then all modal
equations at time t plus delta

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.670
t, then at time t plus 2 delta
t, and so on, because there is

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:36.620
this coupling, and because we
don't know f unless we have

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.015
all the information coming
from all the mode shapes.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.670
Well, a typical problem that you
might want to solve with

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.440
this approach is the
pipe whip problem.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.160
Here we have a very long,
slender pipe.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.980
There is here a restraint
that has a gap.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.580
And suddenly, this end of the
pipe is subjected to a very

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.780
large force.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.750
The pipe undergoes dynamic
motion, a wave travels along

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.520
here, goes plastic, hits
this stop, et cetera.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.470
It's a very complicated problem,
and this approach of

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.760
multiple position is it cheap
way of obtaining a solution to

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.380
this problem.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.210
Of course, the accuracy of the
solution depends on how many

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.570
mode shapes you include.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.340
If you only include a few mode
shapes, the solution is quite

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.610
inexpensive, but the accuracy
is not very high.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.500
If you include as many mode
shapes as there are finite

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.190
element degrees of freedom,
then of course you get the

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.130
exact response.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.250
All you have done is transformed
from one basis,

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.560
the finite element degrees of
freedom basis, to the mode

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.640
shape basis.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.030
But then, of course, the
solution is very expensive,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.160
and you don't want to
ever do is that.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.950
The point is that you want to
perform such analysis if you

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.750
only need to include
a few modes in

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.980
the response solution.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.120
We would actually look at this
problem, or such a problem, a

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.930
little later, when we discuss
example analyses.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.660
As a second technique that can
also be very useful in

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.750
non-linear dynamic analysis, I'd
like to discuss with you

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.130
the substructuring technique.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.810
This procedure is used is
implicit time integration, and

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:26.140
the important aspect is that
prior to the analysis, we are

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.310
setting u this effective
stiffness matrix corresponding

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.510
to the linear degrees of freedom
only, and we are

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.640
statically condensing out all
the degrees of freedom that

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.130
will remain linear throughout
the response solution.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.700
It is quite effective for
local non-linearities.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.140
Here, for example, we have a
tower structure, and the only

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.210
non-linearity that this
structure sees, say, is the

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.460
slip down here.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.360
This typically would mean that
we have a large number of

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.620
linear degrees of freedom that
we can deal with very

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.640
effectively, using the
substructuring approach.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.480
The non-linear degrees of
freedom here, of course,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.430
require iteration and updating
of matrices, and those we deal

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.000
with in the usual way.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.100
Let me show you in more detail
what I mean here.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.260
Let's look schematically
at an example.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.990
Here we have a 10-story
building, and that 10-story

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.740
building is discretized,
idealized, as shown here.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.340
We also want to include the
elasticity of the foundation,

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.100
and that is modeled very simply
here as an assemblage

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.320
of springs.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:45.700
We deal here with two
substructures, shown in red

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.390
for the substructure degrees
of freedom and in black for

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.660
the master degrees of freedom.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:57.710
This is also part of the master
degrees of freedom.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:03.080
Notice that here we have
one substructure--

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.650
in other words, this part here
is nothing else than that part

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:08.900
right here.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.905
That's what is one
substructure.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.750
And of course, you see here
another substructure.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.730
But we have a repetition here--
in other words, this

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.250
substructure here is identically
equal to that

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.370
substructure.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:31.570
This, of course, is the fact
because of the particular

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.440
design of this building.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.610
The upper stories look the same
way as the lower stories.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.870
That's the reason why we can
say, this is one substructure

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:44.980
model which can model this part
of the structure and that

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.420
part of the structure,
as well.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.850
If we look at the stiffness
matrix, or the effective

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.420
stiffness matrix of this
structure that he would

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.750
encounter in a direct
integration solution using

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.050
implicit time integration,

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.930
schematically, we see the following.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.490
Notice here we have the entries
coming from the

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.630
substructures, and here
we have entries

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.720
from the master structure.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.380
This coupling here corresponds
also to master degrees of

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.540
freedom, and similarly, this
coupling corresponds to master

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.700
degrees of freedom.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.440
Here we have the displacement
vector, the incremental

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.770
displacement vector.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:34.720
And let's see here that these
master degrees of freedom of

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.710
course correspond to these
element entries here.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.570
These master degrees of freedom
correspond to these

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.650
entries, and these master
degrees of freedom correspond

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.140
to these entries.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:51.230
Now what we can do is condense
out all the linear degrees of

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.360
freedom effects.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.220
And that is achieved
as follows.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.390
We recognize that the total
effective stiffness matrix

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:06.740
corresponding to time t is made
up of this part here,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:13.720
which is the linear stiffness
matrix plus

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.410
the total mass matrix.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.190
I should point out here that
this K matrix contains all the

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.790
linear contributions, where that
M matrix here corresponds

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.990
to all the contributions from
the masses at the master

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.440
degrees of freedom and the

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.360
substructure degrees of freedom.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.790
Because we're assuming here that
the total mass matrix is

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.170
linear, we can put all the mass
effects right in there.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:46.540
And then since this is not the
total effect of stiffness, we

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.060
add the effect of the
non-linear element

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.110
stiffnesses, right here.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.480
And in this particular analysis,
this might be, for

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.140
example, the non-linear
springs down there.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.510
The non-linear springs modelling
the foundation on

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.760
the structure.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:09.560
Well, this can be written
in this form.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:15.260
And if we perform static
condensation on this combined

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:21.020
matrix, we arrive at
this matrix here.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.810
Notice here we have a condensed
degree of freedom

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.360
vector carrying only the master
degrees of freedom, and

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.280
here we have the entries
corresponding to the master

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.720
degrees of freedom in
the tK hat matrix.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.750
We put a c on there,
meaning condensed.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.290
After static condensation,
this is a matrix

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.660
that has been reached.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:50.530
These black squares here
correspond to as the black

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.570
squares that you saw earlier.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:57.110
Of course, they have now been
changed a bit because of the

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.480
static condensation, because
the effect of the linear

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.900
degrees of freedom have
been carried into

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.150
these entries here.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.760
The major steps in the solution
are as follows.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.220
Prior to the step-by-step
solution, we establish the K

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:22.140
hat, the linear effective
stiffness matrix containing K

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.510
plus 4 over delta t squared m.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.400
And this K hat matrix is then
used to statically condense

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.310
out all internal substructure
degrees of freedom to obtain

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.810
this K hat c, c standing
for condensed matrix.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.390
We note that the actual
effective stiffness matrix

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.490
including the non-linear effects
is then obtained by

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.510
taking the linear effective
stiffness matrix and adding

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.940
the non-linear stiffness
effects to it.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.960
Notice, once again, this matrix
is obtained from this

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.770
matrix here, as I mentioned
earlier.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:06.590
We use this matrix to statically
condense out all

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.930
the linear degrees of freedom.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:15.950
The solution is then obtained in
each time step as follows.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.830
We update the condensed
matrix K hat c--

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.070
there should be no t here--

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.090
K hat c for non-linearities.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:30.440
That means we're adding the tK
matrix to it, corresponding to

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.520
the non-linearities that have
occurred in the system.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.670
We establish the complete load
vector for all degrees of

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.620
freedom, and condense out the
substructure internal degrees

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.190
of freedom.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:47.000
This is important
to recognize.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.920
We have to calculate the
complete load vector because

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:57.970
of the intertia effects on the
internal substructure degrees

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:58.710
of freedom.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.240
The intertia forces on the
internal substructure degrees

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.300
of freedom carry forces to the
master degrees of freedom that

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:10.660
we have to take into account in
each time step and in each

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.020
equilibrium iteration.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.810
We then solve for the master
degrees of freedom, using the

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:23.650
small system size, the tK
hat c, the velocities,

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.680
accelerations, and calculate all
the substructural degrees

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.650
of freedom--

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.450
velocities, displacements,
and accelerations.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:38.080
These are required here to
calculate the load vector

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.460
corresponding to all
degrees of freedom.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.460
Schematically, the solution
procedure, therefore, proceeds

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.620
as follows.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.690
For each time step and each
iteration, we start with the

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.320
displacement velocities and
accelerations at time t.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.090
We calculate the effective load
vector, corresponding to

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.170
time t plus delta t,
the way I've been

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.060
talking about it earlier.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.160
And then we condense that load
vector, as shown here, to the

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:11.800
condensed load vector, c
meaning condensation.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.080
We then, from this load vector,
calculate with the

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.270
effective tension stiffness
matrix, the t plus delta t Uc

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.810
vector, and this vector is
used to calculate the

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.750
displacement, velocity, and
accelerations of all the

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.860
degrees of freedom at
time t plus delta t.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.750
Of course here I'm showing
only the process for a

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.210
typical time step.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.990
If you iterate, as we usually do
in non-linear analysis, of

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.820
course, then you would have to
also introduce the iteration

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.150
counter here in these vectors.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:51.570
Notice that using this solution
procedure, we get the

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:57.190
same results as if we had not
performed the substructuring.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.210
In other words, there is no
additional assumption that

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.940
we're introducing into
the solution.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.280
You get the same results.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.890
However, the solution cost is
reduced, because we are

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:13.120
dealing with one substructure,
a typical substructure, only

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.630
once regarding the
factorization--

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.410
the LDL transpose factorization
and static

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.290
condensation that has
to be performed.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:25.780
Let us now look at some
example solutions.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.570
And the first example that I'd
like to consider with you is

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.360
the solution of the wave
propagation in a rod.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.560
Here we have a uniform freely
floating rod, and we apply to

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.100
the left end of that rod a force
that varies as shown

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:47.140
here as step load
of 1000 newtons.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.840
The material data for the
rod are given here.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.440
We want to perform a linear
elastic analysis, but although

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.050
this is a linear analysis, we
still will learn quite a bit

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.850
from it regarding non-linear
analysis.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.820
We want to consider the
compressive force at a point

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.980
at the center of the
rod, right there.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:16.120
And the exact solution for this
force at that point is

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.600
plotted here.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:24.030
You have, once again, apply 1000
newtons, and here we have

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.920
the time scale.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.320
Notice up to 1/2 t star, there's
no force at point a,

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.180
because the applied force
in fact has to

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.230
propagate through the rod.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:41.380
Then we have the full force up
to 3/2 t star, and then no

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.300
force again, where t star is the
time for the stress waves

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.460
to travel through the
complete rod.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.500
This is the analytical
solution, well-known,

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.290
well-established, and we want to
compare with this solution

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.330
when we perform our finite
element analysis.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.180
For the finite element analysis,
we use a mesh off

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:10.670
2-noded truss elements, as shown
here, and we measure the

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:14.560
force at the midpoint of the
total structure by the

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.230
compressive force
in this element.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:23.450
We use in this analysis first
essential difference method,

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.740
and recognize that the time
step that we use has to be

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.850
small or equal to the critical
time step, as we discussed in

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.450
the previous lecture.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.820
And that critical time step
is given by Le/c.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.270
Please refer to as the previous
lecture notes, and

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.860
you would see this formula
there, which is nothing else

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.460
than t star divided by the
number of elements.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.520
We recall that if delta t is
greater than delta t critical,

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.730
we would produce an
unstable solution.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.190
We also need to deal
with the initial

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.190
conditions for this problem.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:02.140
And we recognize that if the
initial displacements are 0

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.360
and R is given, then we can
calculate the initial

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.280
acceleration, as shown here.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:16.170
Using now a time step equal to
the critical time step, we

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.160
obtain the correct result, and
I pointed that out in the

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.360
earlier lecture already, that
we in fact obtain the exact

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.530
solution for any number
of finite elements

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.270
to model the rod.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.650
And here is a finite element
solution, compared with the

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.780
exact solution.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.860
A wonderful solution, right
on the exact solution.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.920
Using, however, now a
smaller time step--

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.480
and this is frequently
of surprise--

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:51.070
using a smaller time step, we
get a much worse result.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:55.230
Here we use a time step of
1/2 delta t critical.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.730
Half the time step that
we used before.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.150
And just solution looks actually
very bad right here.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.820
Frequently one sort of
intuitively thinks, well, if I

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.020
use a smaller time step, I
should get better results.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.880
My costs go up, and surely I
should get better results.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.250
Well, it turns out that using
the explicit time integration

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.930
scheme for this type of problem,
this wave propagation

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:28.490
problem, with a smaller time
step, more cost, higher cost,

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.410
you get worse results.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.580
That is really something
to keep in mind.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.482
Now let us consider the
trapezoidal rule.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:42.130
The trapezoidal rule-- we
discussed this method in the

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.020
earlier lecture.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.320
And I'd like to refer you
once again to the notes

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.410
corresponding to that lecture,
where we have identified that

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.810
a stable solution would
be obtained with any

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.440
choice of delta t.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.500
Remember, this is a linear
analysis, and the trapezoidal

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.170
rule is unconditionally
stable.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.790
We could use a consistent
or lumped mass matrix.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.560
And in this particular case, we
use a lumped mass matrix,

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.470
because we also like to compare
our results with those

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.610
that we obtained using the
central difference method.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:17.350
If we use the trapezoidal rule
with the time step that we

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.170
employ in the central
difference method--

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.420
in fact, the critical time
step that we used there--

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.880
and we also use the initial
conditions computed as shown

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.930
here, the way we did it for the
central difference method

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.820
solution, we find that the
solution is very inaccurate

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.660
when compared to the
exact solution.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:43.720
Here, of course, we also use
the 10-element mesh.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:50.590
If we use 0 initial conditions
for the trapezoidal rule, we

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.430
get this solution.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.390
Not much different, really, from
the solution that I just

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.620
showed you.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.120
So whether we use 0 initial
conditions or the initial

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.210
conditions corresponding to the
equation MU double dot is

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.420
equal to R, which we have seen
on the previous view graph,

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.390
makes very little difference
when using

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.570
the trapezoidal rule.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.480
It makes a lot of difference
using the explicit central

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.750
difference method.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.940
And for that reason, in fact,
we have to use the proper

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.540
initial conditions obtained from
MU double dot equals R at

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.640
time 0 when we use the central
difference method.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.370
Using now twice the time step of
what we just used, namely,

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:34.220
delta t equal to 2 times delta
t, critical of the central

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.360
difference method, this solution
is stable, but very

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.210
inaccurate.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.120
It is stable because we're
using an unconditionally

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.540
stable operator.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.450
We discussed it in the
previous lectures.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.790
Note that this is the solution
we're obtaining when compared

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.600
to the exact solution.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.130
Now we look at the solution
where we have half the time

00:29:55.130 --> 00:30:00.620
step off the critical size,
corresponding to the central

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.920
difference method.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.630
And you see here, the solution,
again, very

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:09.790
inaccurate when compared to
the exact solution, but of

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.300
course stable, because the
method is always stable for

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.980
any time step delta t.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.730
The question now could, of
course, be, and should be,

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.440
what happens if we take more
elements to discretize the

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.160
whole structure?

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.480
Here we use the 10-element
model.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.480
Why not use more elements?

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.060
And here we now look at the
solution obtained with the

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.870
essential difference method when
we use 100 elements to

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.170
model the total bar.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:43.670
Here the exact solution in red,
and that exact solution

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:48.040
is reached if you integrate the
equilibrium equations with

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.400
this time step.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.790
We discussed that earlier.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:54.460
That exact solution is always
obtained for any number of

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.030
elements that you use to
discretize a structure,

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.950
provided you use delta t equals
delta t critical.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:06.180
If you then use a smaller time
step, in fact, delta t equals

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:11.120
1/2 delta t critical was used
here, we obtain a solution

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.700
that is not the exact solution,
but as you can see

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.490
here, it oscillates for this
time step this amount about

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.700
the exact solution.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:27.060
So we have much the same
observations that we have seen

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.780
already earlier, namely, when
the time step is decreased in

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.515
the central difference
method solution--

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.850
from the critical time step,
here we see a decrease--

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:43.220
the solution that one might
expect to be better actually

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.010
deteriorates.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.060
Of course, it couldn't
be better

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.240
than the exact solution.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.140
But we see here a deterioration,
and a quite

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.620
significant one.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.170
If you use the trapezoidal rule,
this is the solution

00:31:55.170 --> 00:32:00.190
that you obtain with the time
step equal to the critical

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.550
time step of the central
difference method.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:06.980
Again, here, we're using
the 100-element mesh.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.250
The solution is certainly better
than what we have seen

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:14.300
for the 10-element mesh,
but it does not give

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.080
us the exact solution--

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.060
in other words, a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] wavefront as

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.850
we would like to obtain.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.630
Of course, this is a very
difficult problem to solve,

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.960
because we have infinitely steep
wave fronts here and

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.230
there, basically, to model.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.940
And an overshoot would obviously
obtain it, but we

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.570
would like to have said
overshoot and undershoot, with

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.590
this oscillation here as small
as possible, of course, with

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.060
the solution scheme
that we employ.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.400
There is one more important
consideration that I'd like to

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.470
bring to your attention.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:56.030
Here we use a 2-dimensional
element mesh to model the bar.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:01.440
Notice these are 4-node
elements, plane stress

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.640
elements here to
model the bar.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.180
And in this particular
case, we use the

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.500
central difference methods.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.440
The thickness is given
here, the material

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.690
data are given here.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:21.350
For this solution, notice that
this distance here is half the

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:25.480
distance that we have here.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.490
And that is something that leads
to a phenomenon that one

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.810
has to be aware of.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.660
Notice our the critical time
step that we identified for

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.720
the one-dimensional wave
propagation here would, of

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.650
course, be calculated depending
on this length.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.900
However, we have to allow for
the fact that there is also a

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.170
possibility of wave propagation
this way, and the

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:54.970
actual critical time step that
we have to use in this problem

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:58.560
is given by this length, by the
shortest element distance.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.590
Please refer to the previous
lecture, in which I discussed

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:03.440
this already.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:08.940
You have to use the shortest
distance between nodal points

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:15.880
within an element to determine
the critical time step.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:21.639
So this relationship here does
not hold anymore, because this

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.699
distance is less than that.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:28.560
And if you were to use delta
t equal to t star over 10

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.139
elements, which was a critical
time step that we used when we

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:38.080
solved the truss element model,
then we would find that

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.560
the solution diverges.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.510
In fact, in element 5, which was
the element that we always

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.420
used to measure our stress, we
find that tau zz, the absolute

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.280
value of tau zz, is greater than
1000 newtons divided by

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.440
the area at this time.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.550
Notice that it was 1000 newton
that we applied.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:04.490
So a stress that should be 0,
really, because tau zz should

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.210
really be 0, it's the stress in
the transverse direction,

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:12.010
the wave travels this way, and
tau zz is acting that way.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.260
This stress should be 0.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.790
We find, actually, that it
grows, and it grows because we

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:21.720
are using a time step that is
larger than the critical time

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:28.180
step that should be used
for this problem.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.460
Let us now look at another
example, a second example from

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.390
which we can also learn
quite a bit.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:38.500
Here we have a very simple 3
degree of freedom system.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.540
These are the degrees of
freedom, x1, x2, x3.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.730
Notice we have masses m here,
and we have a linear spring

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.660
connecting these masses, a
non-linear spring connecting

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.460
these masses, and a linear
spring connecting this mass to

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.400
the rigid support.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:02.640
For this problem, the linear
spring has is distance here,

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.050
and the non-linear spring is
characterized by this force

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.420
displacement relationship.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.660
Notice there's a kink
going from 1 to 100.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:18.000
So the spring gets suddenly, at
a particular distance, or

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.870
rather deformations,
I should say--

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.110
displacement x2 minus x3--

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:27.170
at a particular deformation, the
spring becomes 100 times

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:31.940
as stiff as prior
to that point.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:37.050
Well, we can calculate a
critical time step based on

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:42.770
this spring stiffness here, the
linear part, or rather,

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.960
this spring stiffness for
small displacements.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.710
And that critical time step for
this problem is given as

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.740
1.11 seconds.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:59.830
As long as the response of this
system is such that we

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:03.250
would, in this non-linear
spring, never go around this

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.990
kink, we would deal with a
linear system, and this would

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:10.250
be the proper critical
time step to use.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:14.860
However, as soon as we are going
around this kink here,

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.640
due to the fact that the forces
that I applied, or the

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.310
initial conditions that we are
applying to these degrees of

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.370
freedom, are large enough, as
soon as we go around this

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:28.700
kink, our new critical time step
is based on this spring

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:33.600
stiffness, and if this given
right down here.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.560
This is a new critical
time step.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.750
So if we now perform essential
difference method solutions of

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:45.590
this problem, and if the
solution brings us into this

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:50.510
regime, it is very important
to use, as a critical time

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:54.080
step, 0.14 seconds.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.480
It is very important, even if
we're only in this regime for

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.800
just a few steps.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.120
You see, what might happen in
the response is that most of

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.310
the time, you're
in this regime.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:10.350
But then all of a sudden, for
just a few steps, you're

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.870
getting into this regime,
and because of this high

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:16.260
stiffness, you're thrown
back into this regime.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.470
If your time step that you use
in the time integration is

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:28.960
then larger than that value, you
are having an instability

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.090
for just these few time steps,
and that introduces an error

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:36.505
in the solution which, if you
don't have a comparison with

00:38:36.505 --> 00:38:40.430
an exact analytical solution,
will of course be an error

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.770
that you not necessarily
will see, directly.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.620
And that's one of the
important points.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.410
You see, in linear analysis,
when you use the essential

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.630
difference method in linear
analysis with a time step that

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.680
is larger than the critical time
step, you will, after a

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.320
few time step integrations, see
that the response becomes

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.930
very large, and the instability
is obvious.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.230
The instability is really
obvious when you apply the

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.850
central difference method with
a time step that is larger

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:14.730
than the critical time step to
the solution of the system.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.400
However, in non-linear analysis,
as I mentioned in

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.990
the earlier lectures, and you
are now well aware of it, in

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:26.260
non-linear analysis, the
frequencies change.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:30.230
The critical frequency being the
largest frequency in the

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.220
system changes.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.580
The smallest period of the
system changes, as we are

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.160
seeing here in this
view graph, also.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:44.770
And it is important that your
time step is always smaller

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.540
than the critical time step
based on the highest frequency

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.560
that you can ever encounter
in the solution.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.150
If that is not the case, then
you might have only an

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:57.820
instability for a few time
steps, and the solution may

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:02.390
not have time to blow up,
or give you very large

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:03.500
displacements.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.590
So the instability will
not be obvious.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.680
Instead, the instability over
these few time steps only

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:15.220
introduces an error in the
solution, an error of which

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.140
you really don't know
the magnitude.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.390
And after these few steps have
been completed, you're using

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.890
now a time step that
is again stable,

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:25.410
giving a stable solution.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.400
That error which we have
accumulated, of course, is

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.110
carried forward, but
you have not seen a

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.670
blow-up of the solution.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:35.560
And that's one important
consideration when you apply

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.210
the central difference method
in non-linear analysis.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:45.420
Of course, the important point,
the sort of ground rule

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:49.780
that you have to observe, is
that delta t must always be

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.520
smaller than the critical time
step of the mesh where that

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.020
critical time step changes
throughout the solution.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.690
Let's look at this
example here.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:05.080
What happens if we violate
that condition?

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.850
I show you here the solution
with delta t equals 0.15

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:12.740
seconds, compared to
the solution with

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.230
delta t 0.05 seconds.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:22.330
Notice that the response of the
right math here for both

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:27.860
of these time steps is slightly
different, but we can

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.720
say that for this time step,
we don't get displacements

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.760
that are very much different
than we obtain

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.650
with this time step.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:41.380
If we look at the response of
the center mass, there are

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.920
more differences in
displacements.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:50.650
And if we look at the response
of the left mass, in fact, we

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:52.550
have even larger differences.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:58.000
But the important point is that
if you only have this

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.510
solution here corresponding to
the time step 0.15 seconds,

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.750
which is larger than the
critical time step, you would

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:12.730
certainly not expect that this
solution was unstable.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:16.585
It in fact was only unstable
for a very few time steps.

00:42:16.585 --> 00:42:19.960
There is an error accumulation,

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.190
fairly large here.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.130
In fact, very large.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.880
You can see that these
displacements are only about

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.170
50% of those displacements.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:34.860
But you cannot see directly an
instability here if you don't

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.110
know this solution.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:43.460
Let's look at the force
in the center truss.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:48.130
Here we list the time, here we
list the solution for delta t,

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:51.230
0.05 seconds.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:55.940
And here we list the solution
for delta t 0.15 seconds.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.380
And you can see here that at
the beginning, the forces

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:02.480
compare quite well,
and then the error

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.790
becomes larger and larger.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.480
In fact, here we have an
opposite sign in the force.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.230
This being here, say, the
accurate solution with a small

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:14.280
enough time step, and this
being, of course, a grossly

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.310
inaccurate solution.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:20.350
But it is not evident that this
is a grossly inaccurate

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.670
solution if you don't
know this solution.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.170
And that's the point I wanted
to make with this example.

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:31.790
The next example that I like
to discuss with you Is the

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.260
analysis of a tower.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.770
The tower is shown here,
subjected to a pressure that

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.970
is induced by a blast.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.550
Here we have some geometric
and material data

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.510
regarding the tower.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:51.670
The applied load on the
tower is shown here.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:56.970
Notice it's a load that we
assume to be instantaneously

00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:01.570
there, and then to decay,
as shown here, over 200

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:03.920
milliseconds.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.280
The purpose of the analysis is
to determine the displacement

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.150
and velocities at the top off
the tower, to determine the

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.960
moments at the base
of the tower.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.180
And in this particular
analysis, we use the

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:22.000
trapezoidal rule and the lumped
mass matrix to solve

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.010
the problem.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:27.030
We must make a number of
decisions here, and two

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:29.610
decisions are most important.

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:34.760
We must choose a mesh that is,
in other words, we have to

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.560
establish an appropriate finite
element discretization

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.370
for the tower, and we have to
choose a time step for the

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.570
time integration.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:48.330
The choice of mesh and the
choice of the time step are

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:53.670
two very closely related items,
and that's what I would

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:58.050
like to discuss with you in this
example in more depth.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.610
Of course, the time step and the
mesh must both depend on

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:02.860
the loading that is supplied.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.720
Let's look at some
observations.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.330
The point is that the choice
of mesh will determines the

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:16.370
highest natural frequency, and
of course, the corresponding

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:21.520
mode shape, that is properly,
accurately represented in the

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.960
finite element analysis.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:30.430
The more elements you use, just
as a rule of thumb, the

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:34.590
higher the frequency that can be
properly represented, that

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.530
can be accurately picked
up, with the choice

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:39.440
of mesh we're using.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:44.200
The time step that you're using
will of course determine

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:49.030
how high a frequency you're
integrating accurately.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:54.760
In other words, you want to use
really enough elements to

00:45:54.760 --> 00:46:00.440
have a mesh that is accurate,
and you want to use is small

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:05.430
enough time step to integrate
the frequency of the mesh that

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:08.530
you need to integrate in order
to have an accurate response

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:09.510
prediction.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.810
I used the word "accurate," and
we have to now of course

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.160
look closely at what
I mean by that.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.430
It is most effective, really,
to choose the mesh and the

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:24.320
time step such that the highest
frequency, accurately

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.180
integrated, is equal to the
highest frequency accurately

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.790
represented by the mesh.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.500
To choose the mesh and the
time step, we look at the

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.700
applied loading, in other words,
the physics of the

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:45.340
problem, and we represent
this applied loading

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.570
as a Fourier series.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:51.360
If we do so, that Fourier
series will display the

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:55.430
important frequencies that are
to be accurately represented

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:58.210
by the mesh.

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:01.670
Here for this particular loading
that we're looking at,

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:07.530
we did a Fourier analysis, and
you can see that with this

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:12.930
Fourier analysis, we include
terms now in our first

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:19.320
analysis, in case one, up to fn
17 hertz, and in case two,

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.700
in our second analysis, up
fn equal to 30 hertz.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:30.860
If we truncate our Fourier
representation of the loading

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:38.960
at 17 hertz, we obtain this
approximation here to the

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.560
actual applied noting.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:47.520
If we truncate our Fourier
representation at 30 hertz, we

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.390
obtain this Fourier
approximation

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:53.280
to the actual loading.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.650
As you can see, surely, as
expected, if you include more

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:01.790
terms in the Fourier
approximation, your

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:07.060
approximation to the actual
loading becomes better.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.940
Now having identified that we
want to perform the analysis

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.370
with two meshes, first there's
a mesh that gives us

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:18.280
frequencies accurate up to 17
hertz, and then with a mesh

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.640
that is accurate up to 30 hertz,
we have to look for

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.810
those meshes.

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:26.900
And we do so by establishing
three meshes

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.410
that are shown here.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.480
Here we have a 30-element
mesh.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.590
Notice that one element spans
from the bottom of a floor to

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:37.020
the top off the floor,
and across from one

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.210
column to the other.

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:44.000
A 60-element mesh, in which we
simply have subdivided each

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.510
element here in this more coarse
mesh into two elements,

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.700
and a 120-element mesh, in which
we again have taken one

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.970
element here and represent
it as two elements.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:02.100
We use these meshes here to
calculate frequencies.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:06.750
And on this view graph here,
you see the frequencies

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.750
calculated for the 30-element
mesh and the 60-element mesh.

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:13.840
Notice mode numbers
in this column.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.970
30-element mesh results here,
60-element mesh results here,

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:19.770
in each case, hertz.

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:26.550
We notice that up to this red
line, the difference between

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:32.210
the frequencies is less
than 1 hertz.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:34.250
In other words, the difference
between the frequencies

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:38.050
obtained from the 30-element
mesh and the 60-element mesh

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:41.820
is less than 1 hertz, and
that is also right at

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.830
the 17 hertz level.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.520
So we can say that the
30-element mesh really

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:55.090
represents the frequencies up to
17 hertz quite accurately.

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.980
You should also remember,
please, that since we are

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:02.280
using a lumped mass matrix in
the analysis, there's no

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:07.150
bounding theorem saying that
the frequencies of the

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:13.030
60-element mesh must always be
below the frequencies of the

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.540
30-element mesh.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:20.170
For a larger mesh, we can
actually have frequencies that

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:27.370
are smaller or larger than
for the more coarse mesh.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:30.530
That of course also applies
for when we compare the

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.280
60-element mesh result with
the 120-element mesh

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.980
result later on.

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:37.520
So we say that for the
30-element mesh, we have

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:42.240
accurately represented now the
frequencies up to 17 hertz,

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.830
and therefore, there
is the mesh to use.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:51.480
We calculate the time step via
is this relationship here as

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:57.990
being 0.033 seconds, being the
cutoff frequency, and delta t

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:04.130
then is given here as
0.0017 seconds.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:09.420
This mesh now should be
integrated with this time

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:17.440
step, and then we can say is
that the mesh up to 17 hertz

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:22.110
represents the frequencies quite
accurately, and we have

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:26.620
integrated the frequencies up to
17 hertz quite accurately,

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.490
and therefore, we have an
accurate solution of the

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:33.210
problem up to 17 hertz--

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.750
and what I mean by this "up to
17 hertz" is that also in the

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:41.310
Fourier representation, we in
effect only have represented

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.600
the load by the Fourier
representation up to

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.050
17 hertz, in effect.

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:50.540
Of course, in the actual
step-by-step solution, we also

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:54.540
will carry terms
above 17 hertz.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:52:00.070
But these terms are assumed not
to contribute to very much

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:04.180
to the response, because we are
not picking them up very

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.100
well in the mesh and in the
time step selection.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:16.140
If we proceed now with the same
ideas to also look at the

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.960
60-element mesh, then we
perform there also the

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.610
frequency analysis for the
60-element mesh and the

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:34.190
120-element mesh, and we find
that up to 30 hertz in the

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:39.680
60-element mesh, we gain
represent all the frequencies

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.710
accurately.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:49.300
Notice that above the red line,
below these frequencies

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.820
here, the difference between
these frequencies

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.560
is less than 1 hertz.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.350
Above this line, the difference
between the

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:03.320
frequencies is larger than
1 hertz, and that

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.500
is our cutoff line.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:09.090
Well, if we want to perform
now the direct time

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:12.630
integration of the 60-element
mesh, we proceed as for the

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:13.790
30-element mesh.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:17.770
We calculate our cut-off
frequency, our delta t, the

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:23.680
proper time step, 20 steps for
the highest frequency or the

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.100
smallest period that we want
to integrate accurately.

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.600
That's the rule of thumb
we're using.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.760
And with this time step, we
perform the analysis.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.410
Notice a smaller time step would
be accurately integrate

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:39.740
frequencies which are
not accurately

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.130
represented by the mesh.

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:45.120
Therefore, there is no point
choosing a smaller time step.

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.840
A larger time step would not
accurately integrate all

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.750
frequencies which
are accurately

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:53.810
represented by the mesh.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:57.540
It is not good to choose a
larger time step, because your

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:03.930
mesh is chosen to represent the
frequencies up to 30 hertz

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:08.480
quite accurately, and to get all
of what you can get out of

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:12.890
the mesh, so to say, you want to
take a time step that is in

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:16.060
accordance selected
with the mesh.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.790
And that times step selection
gives you this result here,

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:22.240
0.003 seconds.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.210
Let's look now at the actual
response that is calculated.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:29.350
Considering the horizontal
displacement at the top of the

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:35.780
tower, denoted as u, here,
we find that in fact the

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:39.160
30-element mesh and the
60-element mesh give virtually

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.410
the same response.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:47.470
If we look at the horizontal
velocity at the top off the

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:53.620
tower, we find that there are
some small differences between

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.330
the 30-element and
60-element mesh.

00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:59.640
If we were to look at the
accelerations, these

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:03.480
differences would of course
be even larger.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.570
But the purpose of this analysis
was to calculate the

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:12.890
displacement and velocities
at the top of the tower.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:16.270
Let's look at the moment, which
was also one requirement

00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:19.990
for our analysis, the moment
right down here at the bottom

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:21.810
off the tower.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:26.280
And here we see that the
30-element mesh gives the

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.380
smooth result.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:32.950
The 60-element mesh gives
the zig-zagged result.

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:37.220
But overall, really, basically
a good response prediction

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.370
already with the 30-element
mesh.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:46.160
If we look at the displacements
of the tower, we

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.510
have amplified these
displacements here.

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:52.740
The 30-element mesh at 200
millisecond looks like that.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.100
The 60-element mesh.

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:57.380
looks like that.

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.770
At 400 milliseconds,
the 30-element mesh

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:02.390
looks as shown here.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:05.061
The 60-element mesh looks
as shown there.

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:10.840
Regarding these analyses,
we now can

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.950
summarize some comments.

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:16.820
We saw some high-frequency
oscillations when we looked at

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:21.360
the moment reaction response
of the 60-element mesh.

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:25.570
However, this high-frequency
response, which actually can

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:30.310
be identified to be 110 hertz,
is probably inaccurate,

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:34.030
because our mesh did not
represent frequencies

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:38.100
accurately up to that level.

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:42.160
The obtained solutions for the
horizontal displacement and

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:46.380
the velocity at the top off the
tower are really virtually

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:49.210
identical for the 30- and
60- element mesh.

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.970
Let us now look at
another example.

00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:59.090
This is the example
of a pendulum.

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:03.660
A large displacement analysis of
this pendulum is performed,

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:08.280
and basically what we're looking
at here is, if I can

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.990
just have your attention here,
is at the pendulum that

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:16.460
originally is horizontal,
it's pinned right here.

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:21.000
And we let this pendulum go
through very large motions,

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.170
and pendle around
as shown here.

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:27.630
If always should come back to
the horizontal position,

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.720
unless we have damping
in the system.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.190
Since we don't have damping in
the system, the pendulum

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:36.470
should just keep on
going forever.

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:39.690
We have a frictionless hinge
right here, and this is

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:42.240
pictorially represented here
on the view graph, a

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.960
frictionless hinge
right there.

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:52.050
The pendulum is modelled by a
truss element of stiffness EA.

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:55.350
The length is given here.

00:57:55.350 --> 00:58:00.000
The mass is concentrated
right there.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.100
So there's no distributed
mass here.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:06.460
All of the mass of the pendulum
is concentrated here,

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:10.400
half of it here, and
half of it there.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.240
The initial conditions of the
pendulum are listed here.

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:17.760
The initial angle is 90 degrees
theta, so the pendulum

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.110
is up here, as I explained
already.

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:23.480
And initially, it
has 0 velocity.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.530
And now we let the pendulum go,
and as I said, it should

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:31.260
spring up and down
here, of course,

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:32.510
under the gravity loading.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:41.510
The dynamic response that we
want to calculate is obtained

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:44.280
using the trapezoidal rule.

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:47.770
And we are using full Newton
iterations to establish the

00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:51.270
equilibrium during
every time step.

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:55.340
The convergence tolerance that
we use, and that I have to

00:58:55.340 --> 00:59:01.480
refer you now to our earlier
view graph regarding

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.970
convergence tolerances.

00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:05.720
The tolerance that we're using
here is ETOL equal to 10 to

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.660
the minus seventh.

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:11.686
We talked about what ETOL is
in an earlier lecture.

00:59:11.686 --> 00:59:15.110
In our first analysis, we chose
the time step to be

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.220
equal to 0.1 seconds.

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.200
And in that case, the following

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.850
response is obtained here.

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:28.120
We expect that solution is shown
as a solid line, and

00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:31.890
these circles here show
the calculated

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:35.510
finite element solution.

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:40.010
Notice 90 degrees theta here
minus 90 degrees here, and

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:41.505
then we return to 90 degrees.

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.670
The solution looks quite
fine, looks stable.

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.900
And in fact, if you look at the
textbook, you would find

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:53.280
that there I'm giving the
solution up to here.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.760
Everything looks good.

00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:59.580
However, if we plot the strain
in the truss, we find that at

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:06.130
larger times, the strain
oscillates very much, and in

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:09.890
fact, this oscillation grows.

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:13.760
This clearly signifies
an instability in

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.270
the solution process.

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:19.640
The instability is unchanged
when we tighten our

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:25.060
convergence tolerance or when we
use the BFGS method instead

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.880
of the full Newton method.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.390
We should recall here that the
trapezoidal rule is only

01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:34.920
unconditionally stable
in a linear analysis.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.490
Here we are talking about a
non-linear analysis, and you

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:44.320
cannot select any time step
magnitude delta t and expect a

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.420
stable solution.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:52.070
So what we have to do now is
to use a smaller time step,

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:57.210
and we choose delta t equal
to 0.025 seconds,

01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:59.850
and repeat the analysis.

01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:03.060
Theta degrees here as
a function of time.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:09.010
And once again, a very nice,
smooth response solution,

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:12.860
starting with 90 degrees, going
to minus 90 degrees,

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:16.930
coming back to 90 degrees,
and so on.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:20.330
Of course, even with a larger
time step, you got a smooth

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:24.100
solution for theta.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:28.090
What really told us about the
instability in the solution

01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:33.030
was our look at the strain
in the truss.

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:38.750
So we look now also at this
strain, and in this particular

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:42.070
case, with this time step,
we see a smooth

01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:44.460
solution for the strain.

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:49.990
You should please observe that
the scale on the strain is

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:54.020
here different from the strain
scale that we had in the

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.100
earlier view graph.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.230
If you refer back to the earlier
view graph, you see

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.711
that we had a different
scale there.

01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:04.450
But we have a smooth solution
here, in fact, a solution the

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:07.780
way we would expect it.

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:16.870
If we don't iterate, then we
obtain a solution that looks

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:20.430
as shown here.

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:23.150
In other words, instead of
getting this oscillatory

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:28.070
response that we would like to
obtain, we obtain really a

01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:31.440
highly damped solution
response.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.050
This, of course, shows the
importance of iteration.

01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:40.860
We have to iterate in the
solution of a dynamic problem.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.070
It's very important to
integrate in order to

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:48.640
establish equilibrium for every
time step, for every

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:52.050
discrete time that we're
considering.

01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:55.020
In this particular case, we see
that we obtained a highly

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.160
damped solution.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.700
In other cases, the solution
might blow up.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.670
So it is important to iterate
in the nonlinear dynamic

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:06.520
solutions when you
use an implicit

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.950
time integration scheme.

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:13.370
Although the solution obtained
with the equilibrium iteration

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:15.510
is highly inaccurate,
the solution

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:17.010
is, of course, stable.

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:22.020
And that is also seen when one
looks at the strain plot.

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.050
Notice here we're plotting
strains in the truss element

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.050
as a function of time.

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:31.740
No blow-up of that strain,
no violent oscillation.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.800
It is, in fact, going up here,
and then becoming this rather

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:40.260
small oscillating,
as shown here.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.040
So we don't have an unstable
solution, but a highly

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.140
inaccurate solution.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.500
Let's look at the next example
now, the analysis of a pipe

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.190
whip problem.

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:59.390
Here we have a long pipe,
dimension given here and here,

01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:01.700
that is subjected suddenly to a

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.570
concentrated load at its end.

01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:07.990
There is also, below the
pipe, a restraint.

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:12.750
That restraint is only active
once this gap is closed.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:16.310
Notice there is a 3-inch
gap here between the

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:19.040
pipe and the restraint.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.050
Of course, this restraint, in
an engineering design, is

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:25.850
installed to prevent violent
emotions of the

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:29.190
pipe at this point.

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:34.070
What our objective here is,
to determine the transient

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:37.580
response of this pipe.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:41.050
Notice that under this very
large load, the pipe very

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:44.590
rapidly becomes plastic.

01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:47.820
And the difficulty of this
problem really lies in that

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:52.520
the pipe going plastic becomes
very flexible here, but the

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.560
restraint suddenly hitting the
pipe, or the pipe hitting the

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.020
restraint, rather, means that
a very large difference is

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.730
suddenly introduced
at this end.

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:06.160
The finite element model
we used is shown here.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:12.020
6 summation beam elements that
of course can go plastic.

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.560
There's more of the
elastoplasticity

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.130
in the system properly.

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:18.640
And a truss element from
this node to that node.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.370
This truss element contains
a 3-inch gap.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:30.290
The material properties for
the pipes are listed here.

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:33.110
Notice the material property
corresponding to the

01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:34.430
elastoplasticity.

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:38.950
We assume no strain hardening
and for the restraint.

01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:42.090
Again, the restraint also
is modeled as an

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:45.480
elastoplastic material.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.280
The analysis performed, in this
particular case, using

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:53.580
multiple position with two
modes and direct time

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.180
integration.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.770
We want to compare the response
that we predict using

01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:01.960
the multiple position procedure,
which I discussed

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.150
earlier in this lecture, with
the response that we obtain

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:08.350
using a time integration
analysis.

01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:10.990
For the time integration
analysis, we use the

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:12.810
trapezoidal rule.

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:16.410
And in fact, even in the
multiple position, we also use

01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:18.870
the trapezoidal rule.

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:22.120
And for the mass representation,
we have chosen

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.440
a consistent mass matrix.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.690
In this particular case of
convergence tolerance, ETOL

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:30.140
was used with this
value down here.

01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:37.230
If we perform the eigenvalue
solution of the initial

01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:43.490
system, in other words, of the
elastic pipe in the initial

01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:49.240
state, we obtain these natural
frequencies, 8.5

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.960
hertz and 53 hertz.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.440
These are also the
mode shapes.

01:06:57.230 --> 01:07:02.350
And of course, these frequencies
will change as

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:05.920
time progresses in the
elastoplastic response, and

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.390
also the mode shapes will
change, particularly once

01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:11.090
their restraint is hit.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:18.510
However, what we are saying is
that we believe we can capture

01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:23.510
the elastoplastic response of
the pipe, approximately, by

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:28.380
using this mode shape and that
mode shape as generalized

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:32.300
displacement patterns
to represent

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.150
the total pipe response.

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:39.480
Of course, there are the heavy
approximations that we reduce

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.090
all of the pipe degrees
of freedom to adjust 2

01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:44.520
generalized degrees
of freedom.

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:51.670
To integrate a response, we have
to choose a time step.

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:58.280
And here we have delta t 1/20
of the cutoff period that we

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.000
want to use here.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.200
Notice that we have only two
modes in this problem that we

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.120
want to consider, with the
frequencies that I

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.440
showed you just now.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:12.850
And this equation gives
us, as a time

01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:16.140
step, 1/1000 of a second.

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:20.529
Of course, once again, this
estimate, or this choice of

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:25.510
time step, is based solely on
looking at the linear response

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:26.800
of the pipe.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.170
In other words, assuming that
the pipe remains elastic and

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:36.390
that the restraint is
not there either.

01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:39.330
If we look at the results
obtained from these two

01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:43.970
analyses, we find that the
multiple position response for

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:49.160
the displacements looks as shown
here, the direct time

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.569
integration response looks
as shown here.

01:08:53.569 --> 01:08:58.670
Notice that this is here the
distance of the gap, so at

01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:02.760
this particular time, the gap
is closed and the restraint

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.430
comes into action.

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:08.359
We note from this graph that the
multiple position solution

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:12.740
is really very close to the
direct integration solution

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:16.550
for the displacement at
the tip off the pipe.

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:19.850
Now let us look at
the moment at the

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:21.899
built-in end of the pipe.

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:25.990
And here we have the moment
response plotted as a function

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:30.770
of time for the direct
integration solution, as shown

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:34.890
here, and for the multiple
position

01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:38.170
solution, as shown here.

01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:43.990
We notice that the maximum
moment occurring at the

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:49.410
built-in end in the pipe is
almost the same when predicted

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:52.260
by the multiple position
solution and the direct

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:54.650
integration solution.

01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:57.150
There's some small difference,
but the difference is

01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:59.370
certainly not very large.

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:03.790
However, if we look at what
happened at earlier times, we

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:07.930
see that there is a large
difference between the results

01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:10.820
obtained using the multiple
position solution and the

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.300
direct integration solution.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.990
The reason is that the response
here at earlier times

01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:21.100
is very complex, and the
multiple position solution

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:26.680
cannot pick that complex
response up very well.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:31.610
However, it's one important
point you should keep in mind.

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:35.610
And that is, if we had used
more modes in the multiple

01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:39.920
position solution, we would come
closer to the response

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.760
obtained, predicted with the
direct integration solution.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.900
In fact, if the number of modes
used in the multiple

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.250
position solution is equal to
the number of degrees of

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:56.490
freedom in the finite element
mesh, then the multiple

01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:00.310
position solution gives you
the same response as you

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:03.220
calculate with the direct
integration solution.

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:06.120
I mentioned that earlier in the
lecture already, and the

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.300
reason, of course, is that in
that case, all you would have

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.620
done is a change of bases
from the finite element

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.580
displacements to the
mode shape bases.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:24.200
So if you use, even with this
initial stiffness matrix that

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.600
you have used to calculate the
mode shapes, even with that

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.890
initial stiffness matrix, if
use all the modes, as many

01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:35.650
modes as there are degrees of
freedom, in this multiple

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:38.620
position solution, you would
get the same response

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:41.340
prediction with the multiple
position solution as we're

01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:46.350
seeing here, with the direct
integration solution.

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:50.840
And that means we can be quite
assured that as we increase

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.500
the number of modes in the
multiple position solution, we

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:59.420
will get closer and closer to
this complex response that is

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.590
predicted using the direct
integration solution.

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:07.010
In general, one, of course, does
not know the error when

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:11.340
you use the multiple position
solution, and there must

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:15.490
always be a question of how
large is the error, for

01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:18.170
example, that we're
seeing here.

01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:22.510
And that can only be assessed
by a more accurate solution.

01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:25.360
However, I believe that's the
multiple position solution is

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.450
of much value in the initial
design analysis stages when

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:33.920
you want to obtain fairly
inexpensive solutions for the

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.850
response, and you want to just
understand how the system acts

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:41.120
that you are analyzing
and designing.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.700
The multiple position solution
really yields relatively

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:49.400
inexpensive response solutions
of the system which may be

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.920
very helpful in the initial
design stages of that

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.650
structural system.

01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:58.420
This completes, then, the
discussion of our examples for

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.360
which I have prepared
view graphs.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.360
I'd like to now share with you
some further experiences that

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.570
are summarized on this slide.

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:11.110
And let me go over here,
where I have

01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:16.560
the first slide projected.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.250
I should point out, before we
discuss the information on

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:22.800
these slides once more, that
we will go fairly rapidly

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.540
through these slides, and that
not all details pertaining to

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:30.110
the solutions that we are
looking at here are given on

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:32.180
these slides.

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:35.230
Please refer to the papers--

01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:37.530
the references are given in the
study guide-- in order to

01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:40.630
find all of the details
pertaining to the solutions

01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:43.850
that I'm now discussing
with the slides.

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:46.100
Here we consider now the
analysis of a control rod

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.310
drive housing, which is modelled
using four beam

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:52.290
elements and point masses.

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:56.740
Notice that the structure is
subjected to motion up here.

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.790
The non-linearity in the system
lies in the fact that

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:03.770
there's a gap between the tip
of that beam here and the

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:08.180
spring on the right-hand side
and on the left-hand side.

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:12.760
On the next slide, we see now
the solutions obtained.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.900
We obtain a solution using
direct integration, and using

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:21.720
a multiple position analysis,
including two modes.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.640
These two solutions are compared
with a solution that

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.000
was reported at some earlier
time by Peterson and myself.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.190
Here you see the comparison
of the results obtained.

01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:37.860
Notice there is a difference
here between the solution that

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.440
we reported earlier, that
Peterson and myself reported

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.610
earlier, and the solution
that we generated now.

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:48.520
But that difference is due to
the fact that Peterson and

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:53.220
myself used, at that time, a
different solution scheme.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.560
The response solution that we
obtained with the multiple

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.330
position analysis is very close
to the response solution

01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:02.700
that we calculated using
direct integration.

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:06.660
Now the next analysis that I'd
like to discuss this you

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:12.230
involves the analysis of a
spherical shell subjected to a

01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:13.710
uniform pressure.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:17.630
And that pressure is suddenly
applied as shown down here.

01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:22.260
Notice this is a step pressure
constant in time.

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.270
The material data of the
shell are given here.

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:30.230
We want to calculate the
elastoplastic response.

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:34.130
And some geometric data
are given here.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:37.150
Notice the shell was idealized
using 10 8-node

01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:38.920
axis-symmetric elements.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.290
It's a spherical shell, so we
use an axis-symmetric model to

01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:43.870
model the shell.

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.860
We use Newmark integration
with delta and

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.560
alpha as given here.

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:57.380
We chose these values because
Nagarajan and Popov had chosen

01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.920
these same values,
and we wanted to

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.460
compare with their solution.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.050
We used 2-by-2 Gauss integration
and a consistent

01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:07.340
mass matrix for the problem.

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:10.840
The time step was 10
microseconds, and we used the

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.810
total Lagrangian formulation
in the analysis.

01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:17.670
The next slide now shows the
response that we predicted.

01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:22.190
Here we see the ADINA solution,
a dashed line,

01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:27.990
compared with the solution by
Nagarajan and Popov given by

01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:29.870
the solid line.

01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:36.780
Notice we are plotting here the
apex displacement of the

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:41.280
shell as a function of time.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.060
Now in this particular case,
we use the consistent mass

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:47.750
matrix, 2-by-2 integration,
and specific solution

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:51.860
parameter, and we want to do now
change these parameters in

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:55.730
order to see the effect of
these parameters on the

01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:57.940
solution that is predicted.

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:02.400
The next slide now shows again
the apex displacement of the

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.420
shell as a function of time,
but using once a consistent

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:14.790
mass matrix, and once using
a lumped mass matrix.

01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:18.190
And in this particular case, we
use the trapezoidal rule,

01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:21.020
which corresponds to the Newmark
integration with delta

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:25.030
equals 0.5 and alpha
equals 1/4.

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:28.150
Notice that there are only slide
differences between the

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:31.020
lumped mass solution results
and the consistent mass

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.940
solution results.

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:37.690
Another parameter that one
might want to vary is the

01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:39.090
integration order.

01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:43.160
Here we have the response,
using 2-by-2 integration,

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.480
which we saw already earlier.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.150
Actually, we didn't quite see
this response earlier, because

01:17:48.150 --> 01:17:51.490
earlier we used different delta
and alpha parameters.

01:17:51.490 --> 01:17:54.920
Very close to these parameters,
however.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:59.070
Anyway, here we have the 2-by-2
integration results,

01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:01.870
and then we have the 3-by-3
integration results and the

01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:04.010
4-by-4 integration
results here.

01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:08.650
Very small differences between
these solutions, but it's

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:11.940
interesting to perform these
solutions, and really assure

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.220
oneself that there are
small differences.

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.150
We know that shells are rather
sensitive structures, and we

01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:21.730
want to make sure about the
modeling that we're using for

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:26.090
the representation of these
types of structures.

01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:32.670
The next slide now shows the
analysis of a problem for

01:18:32.670 --> 01:18:36.310
which we had experimental
results to compare with.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:42.130
Here we have a pipe, a very
rigid pipe, and a flexible

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:45.740
pipe, a nickel pipe here.

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:52.710
And these pipes, both being
straight, are totally filled

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:53.740
with water.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:58.850
At the end off this pipe here,
a pulse gun sets off a pulse,

01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:03.570
and that pulse travels through
the water, all the way along.

01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:07.160
And of course, there's an
interaction between the pipe

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.430
and the water.

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:12.670
In other words, it's a fluid
structure interaction problem.

01:19:12.670 --> 01:19:15.940
This pipe here is very rigid,
so that we model it as

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.620
infinitely rigid.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.810
You will see that just now
on the next slide.

01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:24.790
Notice here we have pressure
gauges indicated.

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:28.200
The pressures and the strains
in the pipe, in this nickel

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.720
pipe, the flexible pipe, were
measured by the Stanford

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.460
Research Institute.

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:38.480
Here we have the nickel
properties, we assume an

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:45.750
elastoplastic material, and
the water properties.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:50.720
On the next slide now, we see
the pressure pulse as a

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.510
function of time.

01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:58.690
Of course, this was given
to us for our analysis.

01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:00.650
And this slide now shows
the finite element

01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:01.810
model that we use.

01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:04.830
We used an axis-symmetric
model.

01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:08.050
The center line is right here.

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:11.980
And notice that the water here
in the rigid pipe was

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:14.840
represented by 81 elements.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:18.790
Notice the rigid pipe was
modelled as infinitely rigid,

01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:22.440
because these are rollers
on an infinitely rigid

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.200
surface, so to say.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:29.630
Notice here is a nickel pipe
representation, and here we

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:32.825
have water elements again,
and a thin layer of

01:20:32.825 --> 01:20:35.590
water elements here.

01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:38.800
On the next slide now, we see
the response predicted by

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.280
ADINA and the experimental
results, the ADINA response

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:47.970
shown as a solid line and the
experimental result shown as a

01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:48.610
dashed line.

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:50.740
Of course, the experimental
results reported by the

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.700
Stanford Research Institute.

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:56.470
Notice we are plotting here the
pressure as a function of

01:20:56.470 --> 01:21:00.560
time for one of the
pressure stations.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.100
And here you'll see the same
information for another

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:08.280
pressure station, and for
another pressure station, and

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.970
one more pressure station--

01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:13.970
the pressure stations that I
pointed out to you earlier.

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:18.010
Notice that here finally we
compare the hoop stress

01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:22.390
predicted by ADINA with the
experimentally observed hoop

01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:25.720
stress as a function of
time at one of the

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:29.450
stations within the pipe.

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:32.920
Notice that for the hoop stress
here, we have four

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.680
experimental results
corresponding to the

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.680
measurements that were taken at
the north pole, the south

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:43.000
pole, east pole, and west
pole on the pipe.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.620
In the ADINA solution,
of course, we use an

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:48.980
axis-symmetric model, and that
axis-symmetric model only

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:53.180
gives one hoop strain.

01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:57.190
And that hoop strain, as you
can see here, lies quite

01:21:57.190 --> 01:22:01.850
nicely within the experimental
results obtained by the

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.020
Stanford Research Institute.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:08.340
I should also point out that
the comparison of the ADINA

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.740
results with the experimental
results is really very good,

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:15.610
except that we don't pick
up these high-frequency

01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:20.410
oscillations that have been
observed in the experiment.

01:22:20.410 --> 01:22:24.040
Well, the ADINA finite element
mesh that we used in this

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.370
analysis is not able, really,
to represent these

01:22:27.370 --> 01:22:30.330
high-frequency oscillations,
and of course, that is

01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:33.660
certainly one of the reasons why
we could not hope to pick

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.690
these frequency oscillations
up.

01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:39.330
This, then, brings me to the
last slide that I wanted to

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:41.870
share with you in this lecture,
and also to the end

01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:42.740
of this lecture.

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.090
Thank you very much for
your attention.

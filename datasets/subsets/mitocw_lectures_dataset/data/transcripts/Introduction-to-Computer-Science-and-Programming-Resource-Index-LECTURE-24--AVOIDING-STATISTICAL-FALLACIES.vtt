00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.910
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.970
We'll back up and start again
since I just turned on my

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.220
microphone.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.090
I started with the observation
that for most of recorded

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.960
history people thought
qualitatively, not

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.900
quantitatively.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.020
They didn't know what
statistics were.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.590
They must have had some
intuitive sense, for example,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.030
that if you're old, you're
more likely to have bad

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.000
hearing than if you're young.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.040
If you're old you're
more likely to die

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.940
than if you're young.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.500
Things like that.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.890
But they were just anecdotes,
and they had no careful way to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.170
go from statements about
individuals to statements

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.050
about populations
or expectations.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.550
This changed in about the middle
of the 17th century,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.970
changed fairly dramatically,
when an Englishman named John

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.380
Graunt published something
called The Natural and

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.110
Political Observations Made Upon
the Bills of Mortality.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.990
This was the first work in
recorded history that actually

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.050
used statistics.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.540
And what he did is he looked
at the fairly comprehensive

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.180
statistics of when people died
in the city of London.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.070
And from that, attempted to
produce a model that could be

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.400
used to predict the spread
of the plague.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.800
And it turns out, he was
pretty good at it.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.530
And that just changed the way
people started to think.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.910
And since that time, people have
used statistics both to

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.304
inform and, unfortunately,
to mislead.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.840
Some have willfully used
statistics to mislead, others

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.430
have merely been incompetent.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.760
And that gets me to what I
want to talk about today,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.750
which is statistics.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.070
This is often attributed to Mark
Twain but, in fact, he

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.750
copied it from Benjamin
Disraeli, who said, "There are

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.760
three kinds of lies: lies,
damned lies, and statistics."

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.840
And there is, unfortunately,
a lot of truth in that.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.080
More recently, in the '50s
Darrell Huff wrote a wonderful

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.030
book, I recommend it, called
How to Lie with Statistics.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.290
Now here's a quote from the
book, "If you can't prove what

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.540
you want to prove, demonstrate
something else and pretend

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.360
that they're the same thing.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.530
In the daze that follows the
collision of statistics with

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.270
the human mind, hardly anyone
will notice the difference."

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.340
Alas, that seems to be true.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.900
So what I want to do today is
talk about a few ways in which

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.230
one can be fooled into drawing
inappropriate conclusions from

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.610
statistical data.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.100
Now I trust that you
will use this

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.750
information only for good.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.170
And it will make you a better
consumer and purveyor of data

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.980
rather than a better liar,
but that's up to you.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.810
All right.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.430
So let's start with the
first way out thing I

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.540
want to talk about.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.150
And it's important to always
remember that no matter how

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:08.690
good your statistics are,
statistical measures don't

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.940
tell the whole story.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.575
We've seen examples of this
already earlier in the term.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.290
There are an enormous set of
statistics that can be

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.670
extracted from a data set.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.480
And by carefully picking and
choosing among them, it's

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.450
possible to convey almost any
impression you want about the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.590
same data set.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.250
The best antidote, of course, is
to look at the data itself.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.320
In 1973, the statistician John
Anscombe published a paper

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.050
with this set of data.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.760
Four different examples where
he gave values for x and y,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.570
nothing very sophisticated.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.150
The interesting thing is that
in many ways, the statistics

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.085
for these four data sets
are very similar.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:18.980
They have the same mean, the
same median, the same variance

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.020
for x and y both, the same
correlation between x and y.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.520
And even if we use linear
regression to get a fit, we

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.210
get very similar things.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.070
So let's look at it.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.130
I actually wrote some
code to do that.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.520
So this just reads in the data
set that we just had up, and

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.810
then plots some things
with it.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.070
And so let's look at it.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.170
So what you can see is, you have
these in your hand out,

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.890
we have four graphs,
four plots.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.920
And I won't show you
them all because

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.080
they're all are identical.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.080
What they all give me is a mean
of 7.5 and a whole bunch

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.090
of things, same to 17 decimal
places or so, the same median

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:32.530
and the same linear fit,
y equals 0.5x plus 3.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.550
So I might write a paper in
which I would tell you that

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.180
well, from a statistical
sense, these data

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.940
sets are all the same.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.840
Every statistical result I
ran said these things are

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.850
indistinguishable.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.330
Well, is it true that
these data sets are

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.580
indistinguishable?

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:02.220
Well, one way to look at it is
to actually plot the points.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.100
So we can run it with true,
which says in addition to

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.580
plotting the data, put points
on them in addition to

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.750
plotting the statistics.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.120
And now we see something
fairly dramatic.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.160
So for example, figure (2) and
figure (1) don't look a lot

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.130
like each other, when we
actually look at the data.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.890
Figure (3) looks quite different
and figure (4) is

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.590
remarkably different.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.300
Compare figure (4) to,
say, figure (1).

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.900
Again, these are all
in your hand out.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.810
So the moral is pretty simple
here, and it's one we looked

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:51.820
at before, which is, don't
ever ignore the data.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.310
Don't just look at statistics
about the data, try and find a

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.455
way to look at the
data itself.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.610
Of course, it's easy enough to
look at the data, but how do

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.190
you look at it?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.390
And the next thing to
remember is that

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.990
pictures can be deceiving.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.740
There can be no doubt about the
utility of graphics for

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.740
quickly conveying information.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.919
However, when used carelessly or
maliciously, a plot can be

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.090
highly misleading.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:56.570
So let's look-- go back to the
PowerPoint, and look at this

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.090
plot of housing prices
in the Midwest.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:08.830
So we've got a plot here, and
we've got years 2006, 2007 and

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.400
then in 2008 and 9,
we have quarters.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.170
You may remember that there was
an event in the housing

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:21.000
market in 2008 precipitating the
global financial crisis.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.960
And if we look at this, what
impression do we get about

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.060
housing prices in the mid
west during this period?

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.450
Well I would get the impression
that they are

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.360
remarkably stable.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.220
You publish this and you say,
OK, look they really haven't

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.210
changed very much.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.180
Maybe they've gone down
a little, but

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.490
nothing very serious.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.560
If we compare that to this plot,
which is exactly the

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.980
same data, and now I ask
you about housing

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.240
prices in the Midwest.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.960
Well, what you might
tell me is it's--

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.630
they're remarkably unstable.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.440
And in fact, there was
clearly some sort of

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.460
horrible event here.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.140
Exactly the same data, two
plots both of which are

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:19.460
truthful, but which give a
radically different impression

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.710
about what happened.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.680
The chart on the right
was designed--

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.440
on the right in your handout--

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.660
was designed to show that they
were highly unstable.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.930
So what's the difference?

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.110
What trick did I use to produce
these two plots?

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.580
Yeah?

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.002
AUDIENCE: In the more
stable one, you used

00:10:39.002 --> 00:10:39.990
the logarithmic scale.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.942
And then here only has
selected numbers so--

00:10:43.942 --> 00:10:45.660
PROFESSOR: So that
was certainly one

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.310
trick that I performed.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.750
That in the first chart,
I plotted the y-axis

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.460
logarithmically, which always
make things look like they are

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.990
changing less than if
I plot it linearly.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.100
And in this chart, I
used a linear plot.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.850
Go ahead.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.870
AUDIENCE: You see a much
narrower scale

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.370
on the second plot.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.230
So that the magnitude of the
difference is much less

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.630
compared to the magnitude of the
whole graph of the scale.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.370
PROFESSOR: So that's the other
thing I did is, if you look at

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.480
it, I sort of cheated.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.200
I had full years here and
then I went to quarters.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.160
So in part of my chart, the
resolution on the x is pretty

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.750
wide is a whole year, and then
part of it's on a quarter.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.260
And, not surprisingly, since
we know that housing prices

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.020
change seasonally, they're
different in the spring than

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.040
in the winter, once I start
plotting quarters, even if

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.150
there had not been a crash, it
would have looked much less

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.430
stable in the out years,
because I changed the

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.270
resolution on the x-axis.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.600
I didn't lie.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.620
You can tell reading the
legend that I did that.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.810
But I sure could have
fooled a lot of

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.060
people with these charts.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.150
Here's another nice example
of statistics.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.950
So this plots--

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:18.670
this is from a paper by two
professors, I think from Yale,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.800
shows what you can do if you're
in the Ivy league, that

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.750
plots initials against GPA
for students at Yale.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.890
And so you can see that if your
first name starts with

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.860
the letter A, I think it was
first initials, your GPA is

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.410
considerably higher than if it
starts with C or D. And if

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.140
your parents weren't nice enough
to give you an A name,

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.930
you could hope they at least
gave you a B name.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.400
And you certainly don't
want them to give

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.630
you a C or a D name.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:58.520
So if you're Charlene or David
you could have a real problem.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.730
I have to say my first child
was named David.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.600
His GPA might have been
somewhere in there.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.670
All right --

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.170
clearly it matters.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.578
Well, what tricks did
I perform here?

00:13:12.578 --> 00:13:15.063
AUDIENCE: There is very
little disparity in x.

00:13:15.063 --> 00:13:19.715
You are going from 3.32 to--

00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:20.620
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.770
So what I did here is I made the
range on the y-axis very

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:32.500
small, ranging from 3.32 to
3.38, not a big difference.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.890
However, because that's the
whole thing, it looks like

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.140
it's a big difference.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.120
You will often see this when
you, say, look at things in

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.510
newspapers where, in fact,
someone has manipulated one of

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.880
the axes to make things
look big or small.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.430
If I had ranged this from a GPA
of 0.0 to a GPA of 4.0,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.210
the highest GPA at Yale,
this difference would

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.520
have looked very tiny.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.440
But I didn't --

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.060
actually it wasn't I. I actually
copied this from

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.170
their paper.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.150
This was the way they presented
it in their paper.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.880
Because they were trying to
argue in the paper that your

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.670
name had a big influence
on your life.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.870
And they used many statistics
including your grades.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.340
And so they actually formatted
it kind of like this to try

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.580
and give you this impression.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.770
Now later we'll see another
statistical sin they committed

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.070
in this paper, which, basically,
was designed to

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.890
show that in your name
was destiny.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.380
And they had many
other things.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.850
If you're a baseball player, and
your name starts with K,

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.650
you're more likely
to strike out.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.200
Because K is the symbol for
strikeouts in a baseball score

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.460
book, a lot of implausible
things.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.870
All right.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:05.850
Moving right along, probably
the most serious and common

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:10.150
statistical error is
the one known as

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.030
Garbage In Garbage Out.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.700
And it's so common that people
typically refer to it by its

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.880
acronym GIGO --

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.550
Garbage In Garbage Out.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.610
A classic example of this
occurred and, we could look at

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.680
more recent examples,
but I don't want to

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.930
offend any of you.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:45.670
In 1840, United states census
showed that insanity among

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:50.750
free blacks and mulattoes was
roughly 10 times more common

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:56.360
than insanity among enslaved
blacks or mulattoes.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.900
And the conclusion from this
was obvious, I guess.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.500
US Senator, former Vice
President, and later,

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.870
Secretary of State John C.
Calhoun concluded from the

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:13.040
census and I quote, "The data
on sanity revealed In this

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.500
census is unimpeachable.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.340
From it, our nation must
conclude that the abolition of

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.770
slavery would be to the African,
a curse." Because

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.960
after all, if you freed them
from slavery, they

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.210
would all go insane.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.550
That's what the statistics
reported, he said.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.310
Now never mind it was soon clear
that in fact that census

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.760
was riddled with errors.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.610
And John Quincy Adams, a former
Vice President and

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:47.350
Massachusetts resident responded
to Calhoun and said,

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.950
no that's a ridiculous
conclusion.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.660
The census is full of errors.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.680
Calhoun, being a very patient
person, explained to Adams the

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:03.900
following, "There were so many
errors, that they balanced one

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.520
another out, and led to the same
conclusion just as much

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.970
as if they were all correct."
There were just enough errors

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.800
that you could be OK.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.640
Well, what was he relying on?

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.950
What should he have said if he
wanted to make this statement

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.300
more mathematically precise?

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.910
What he was basically implying
is that the measurement errors

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:32.190
are unbiased and independent of
each other and, therefore,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:37.230
almost identically distributed
on either side of the mean.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.140
I see a typo, I might
as well fix it.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.720
Might as well make it big
enough to fix it.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.020
That's interesting.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.400
If he had made this much more
precise statement, then you

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.090
could have had an meaningful
discussion--

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.210
assuming it was possible to have
a meaningful discussion

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.940
with John Calhoun, which
is perhaps dubious--

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.910
about whether or not, in fact,
the errors are independent.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.600
Because if they're not, if, for
example, they represent

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.600
bias in the people compiling the
data, then you cannot rely

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.480
upon statistical methods
to say that they'll

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.030
balance each other out.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.080
You remember way back in Gauss'
time, Gauss talked

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.600
about this when he talked about
the normal distribution.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.130
And said, well, if we take
these astronomical

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.450
measurements and we assume our
errors are independent and

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:53.130
normally distributed, then we
can look at the mean and

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.425
assume that that's close
to the truth.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.890
Well, those are important
assumptions which in this case

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.490
turned out to be not correct.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.940
And, in fact, it was later shown
that the errors did not

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.570
balance each other out nicely.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:17.840
And in fact, today you can say
that no statistical conclusion

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.930
can be drawn from that.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.460
On the other hand recently,
the US National Research

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.180
Council, perhaps the most
prestigious academic

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.130
organization in the United
states, published a ranking of

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.920
all universities
in the country.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.590
And it was later shown that it
was full of garbagy input.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.810
And they did extensive
statistical analysis and

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:48.800
published it on data that turned
out to be just wrong.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.770
And it was very embarrassing.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.740
Now the good news is
MIT came out near

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.710
the top of this analysis.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.130
And the bad news is we can't
conclude that it actually

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.940
should have been near the top
because who knows about the

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.560
quality of the data, but
kind of embarrassing.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.760
All right.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:14.320
Moving right along, another very
common way to lie with

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:21.890
statistics is to exploit what's
called the cum hoc ergo

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:29.520
propter hoc fallacy.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.550
So anyone here study Latin?

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.240
Bunch of techy--

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:41.930
Oh OK.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:42.900
Well what does it mean?

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.546
AUDIENCE: With this therefore,
because of this?

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:48.410
PROFESSOR: Boy, your
Latin is good.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.120
Either that or you just
know statistics.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.940
But I have to say that was the
most fluent translation I've

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.040
had it all the years I've
asked this question.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.980
I hit the relay man-- the relay
woman on the throw.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.700
All right.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.660
Yes, with this, therefore
because of this.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.440
I don't know why but
statisticians, like physicians

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.160
and attorneys, like
to show off by

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.210
phrasing things in Latin.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:21.280
So for example, it is a
statistical fact that college

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.320
students, including MIT
students, who regularly attend

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.970
lectures have higher GPAs than
students who attend lectures

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.200
only sporadically.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.010
So that would tell us that those
of you in the room are

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.140
likely to have a higher GPA than
the various students in

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.180
6.00 who are not in this room.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.850
I hope it's true.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.030
Now if you're a professor who
gives these lectures, what you

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.260
want to believe it's because the
lectures are so incredibly

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.630
informative, that we make the
students who come much smarter

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.540
and, therefore, they
do better.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.170
And so we'd like to
assume causality.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.970
Because I give beautiful
lectures and you choose to

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.800
come, you will get a better
grade in 6.00.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.310
Well, yes, there's
a correlation.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:16.290
It's unquestionably true, but
causation is hard to jump to.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.700
For example, maybe it's the
point that students who bother

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.910
to come to lecture also bother
to do the problem sets, and

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.540
are just more conscientious.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.070
And whether they came to lecture
or not, the fact that

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.650
they're more conscientious would
give them better GPAs.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.650
There's no way I know to
separate those two things,

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.150
other than doing a controlled
experiment, right?

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.410
Maybe kicking half of you out of
lecture every day and just

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.020
see how it goes.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.140
But it's dangerous but again,
you can read things like the

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.300
faculty newsletter, which will
talk about how important it is

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.930
to come the lecture because
you'll do better.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.920
Because whoever wrote that
article for the faculty

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.390
newsletter didn't understand
this--

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.750
this fallacy, or was just
thinking wishfully.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.120
Another nice example, one that
was in the news not too long

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.185
ago, has to do with the flu.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.980
This was the cases of
flu in New York

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.400
State in recent years.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.140
And you'll notice that there was
a peak in 2009, and that

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.970
was the famous swine flu
epidemic, which I'm sure you

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.220
all remember.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.780
Now, if you look at this
carefully, or even not too

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.500
carefully, you'll notice a
correlation between when

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:48.480
schools are in session and
when the flu occurs.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.760
That in fact, during those
months when schools are in

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.810
session, there are more cases of
flu than in the months when

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:02.890
school is not in session, high
schools, colleges, whatever.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.070
Quite a strong correlation,
in fact.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.670
This led many to conclude that
going to school is an

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.350
important causative factor
in getting the flu.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.410
And so maybe you shouldn't
have come to the lectures

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.410
because you would have just
gotten the flu by doing so.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:26.430
And in fact because of this,
you had many parents not

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:30.190
sending their kids to school
during the swine flu epidemic.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.470
And in fact, you had many
schools closing in some

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.265
communities because of the
swine flu epidemic.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.720
Well, let's think about it.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.570
Just as you could use this
correlation to conclude that

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.380
going to school causes the swine
flu, you could have also

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.930
used it to prove that the flu
causes you to go to school.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.340
Because more people are in
school when the flu season is

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.440
at it's height.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.310
And therefore, it's the growth
of flu that causes people to

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.320
go to school.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.340
That's an equally valid
statistical

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.590
assumption from this data.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.250
Kind of a weird thing but
it's true, right?

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:19.150
Just as we could conclude that
having a high GPA causes

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.750
people to come to the lecture.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.790
You look at your GPA every
morning, and if it's high

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.890
enough, you come to lecture,
otherwise, you don't.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:29.880
You could draw that conclusion
from the data as well.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.630
The issue here that you have to
think about is whether or

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:42.920
not there is what's called a
lurking variable, some other

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:48.020
variable that's related to the
other two, and maybe that's

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.830
the causative one.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:55.520
So for example, a lurking
variable here is that the

00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:01.560
school season coincides with
or the non-school season,

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.920
maybe I should say, coincides
with the summer.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:14.860
And in fact, if you study the
flu virus in a lab, you will

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.900
discover that it survives longer
in cold weather than in

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.270
hot and humid weather.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:26.390
When it's cold and dry, the flu
virus will survive for a

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.120
longer time on a surface
than it will when

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.860
it's warm and humid.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.530
And so in fact, maybe it's the
weather, not the presence of

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:42.120
schools, that causes the flu
to be more virulent during

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.350
certain times of the year.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:48.950
In fact, it's probably
likely true.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.180
So there is a lurking variable
that we have to consider, and

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.870
maybe that's the causative
factor.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:03.060
Now, this can actually lead
to some really bad

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.230
decisions in the world.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:09.100
I'm particularly interested in
issues related to health care

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.390
and public health.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:18.470
In 2002, roughly 6 million
American women were taking

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:24.450
hormone replacement therapy, in
the belief that this would

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:30.310
substantially lower their risk
of cardiovascular disease.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:34.810
It was argued that women over a
certain age or of a certain

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.620
age, if you took extra hormones,
they were less

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.200
likely to have a heart attack.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:45.880
This belief was supported by
several published studies in

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.720
highly reputable journals in
which they showed a strong

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.780
correlation between being on
hormone replacement therapy

00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:00.930
and not having cardiovascular
disease.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.650
And this data had been around
a while and, as I said, by

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.190
2002 in the US, roughly
6 million women

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.470
were on this therapy.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.960
Later that year, the Journal
of the American Medical

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:19.440
Society published an article
asserting that in fact being

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.290
on this therapy increased
women's risk of

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.990
cardiovascular disease.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:29.616
It made you more likely to
have a heart attack.

00:28:29.616 --> 00:28:33.170
Well, how could this
have happened?

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.900
After the new study came out,
people went back and

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:43.600
reanalyzed the old study and
discovered that the women in

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.690
that study who'd been on hormone
replacement therapy

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:51.660
were more likely than the other
women in the group to

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:58.900
have also better diet and be on
a better exercise regimen.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.335
In fact, they were women who
were more health conscious.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.330
So there were the lurking
variables of diet and exercise

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:13.120
and other things that were, in
fact, probably the causative

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:18.030
factors in better health, not
the replacement therapy.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.540
But there was this lurking
variable that had not been

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.950
discovered in the initial
analysis of the data.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:30.350
So what we saw is that taking
hormone replacement therapy

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:35.010
and improved cardiac health were
coincident effects of a

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.565
common cause, that is to say
being health conscious.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.270
Kind of a strange thing but
a true and sad story.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.620
All right.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:57.520
Moving right along, another
thing to be cautious of is

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:07.370
non-response bias and
related problem of a

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.815
non-representative sample.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.010
You'll probably recall that when
I first started talking

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:27.510
about statistics and the use of
randomness, I said that all

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:32.400
statistical techniques are based
upon the assumption that

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.940
by sampling a subset of a
population, we can infer

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.205
things about the population
as a whole.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:50.970
And that's true, typically,
because if random sampling is

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:55.610
used, you can make assumptions
that the distribution of

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.730
results from the random sample,
if it's large enough,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.490
will be the same as a
distribution of results from

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.100
the whole population.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:09.290
And that's why we typically
want to sample randomly.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.190
And so for all the simulations
we looked at, we used random

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:18.120
sampling to try and ensure that
a small number of samples

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.740
would give us something
representative of the

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.530
population.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:24.500
And then we use statistical
techniques to answer the

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:29.120
question about how many random
samples we needed.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.620
But those techniques were only
valid if the samples were

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.350
indeed random.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:41.190
Otherwise, you can analyze it
to your heart's content and

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:47.060
any conclusions you've drawn are
likely to be fallacious.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.330
Unfortunately, many studies,
particularly in the social

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:56.730
sciences, are based on
what is often called

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.395
a convenience sampling.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.350
So for example, if you look
at psychological--

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.480
psychology journals, you'll find
that many psychological

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.570
studies use populations of

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.830
undergraduates for their studies.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.830
Why did they do this?

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.160
Is it because they believe
that undergraduates are

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.380
representative of the population
as a whole?

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:30.730
No.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.460
It's because they're captive.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.350
They have to agree to
participate, right?

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.300
It's a convenience if you happen
to be at a university

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.030
to do your experiments
on undergraduates.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.710
And so they do that and then
they say, well, the

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:50.290
undergraduates are just like
the population as a whole.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.300
You may have observed that at
least at this institution, the

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.070
undergraduates are probably
not representative of the

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.320
population as a whole.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.780
A well-known example of what you
can do with this occurred

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.160
during World War II.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.000
Whenever an allied plane would
return from a bombing run over

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.390
Germany, the plane would be
inspected to see where flak

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:17.970
had hit it.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:22.070
So the planes would fly over
to drop bombs, the Germans

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.320
would shoot flak at the planes
to try and knock

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.690
them out the air.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.590
They'd come back to England,
they'd get inspected, they'd

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:32.350
say, well the flak hit this part
of the plane more often

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.820
than that part of the
plane on average.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:39.020
And so they would reinforce the
skin of those parts of the

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.370
plane where they expected the
flak to hit, to try and make

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:47.230
the plane less likely to be
damaged in future runs, or the

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.500
planes in general.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.860
What's wrong with this?

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.200
Yeah?

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.030
AUDIENCE: They're not getting
the planes that dropped?

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.840
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.170
What they're not sampling is the
planes that never made it

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:04.020
back from the bombing, ooh, that
never made it back from

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:11.389
the bombing runs because they
weren't there to sample.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:15.150
And in fact maybe it's the case
that what they were doing

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.699
was reinforcing those parts of
the planes where it didn't

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.150
matter if you got hit by flak
because it wouldn't cause a

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.610
plane to crash, and not
reinforcing those parts of the

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.360
planes that were most
vulnerable to

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.100
being damaged by flak.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.080
They did a convenient
sampling, they drew

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.429
conclusions, and they probably
did exactly the wrong thing in

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:36.844
what they chose to reinforce
in the airplanes.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:46.659
This particular error is called
non-response bias where

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:51.010
you do some sort of survey, for
example, and some people

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:56.980
don't respond and, therefore,
you ignore what

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.230
they would have said.

00:35:00.635 --> 00:35:03.530
It's perhaps something we see
when we do the underground

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:05.610
guide to Course 6.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.830
In fact I should point out
that it's now online.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:12.460
And it would be good if each of
you would go and rate this

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.210
course, rate the lectures,
rate the TAs, et cetera.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.560
We actually do read them and it
makes a difference in how

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.300
we teach the course in
subsequent terms.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.650
But there's clearly a bias.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.090
You know, maybe only the
people who really feel

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.570
strongly about the course,
either positively or

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:31.720
negatively, bother to
fill out the survey.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.180
And we draw the conclusions
that there's a bimodal

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.570
distribution, and nobody thinks
it's kind of mediocre,

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.010
because they don't bother
responding.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:42.570
Or maybe only the people who
hate the course respond, and

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.520
we think everybody
hates the course.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.690
Who knows.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.590
It's a big problem.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.340
We see it, it's a big problem
today with telephone polls,

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.970
where you get more convenient
sampling and

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:58.830
non-representative samples,
where a lot of polls are done

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.970
using telephones.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:06.410
By law, these pollsters cannot
call cell phones, so they only

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:07.500
call land lines.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.060
How many of you have
a land line?

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.390
Let the record show, nobody.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:16.800
How many of your parents
have a land line?

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.290
Let the record show, pretty
much everybody.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.340
Well, that means your parents
are more likely to get sampled

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:27.220
than you when there's a poll
of, say, who should be

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.530
nominated for president.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.020
And so any of these polls
that are based on

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.740
telephones will be biased.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.910
And, unfortunately, their poll
may just say, a telephone

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.250
sample, and people may
not realize the

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.730
implication of that.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:46.880
That whole part of the
population is under sampled.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.370
There are lots of examples
of this.

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:50.620
All right.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:58.650
Moving along, another problem
we often see is data

00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:59.900
enhancement.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:12.650
It's easy to read much more
into data than it actually

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:16.070
implies, especially when
viewed out of context.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:23.090
So on April 29, 2009, CNN
reported that quote, "Mexican

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:27.320
health officials suspect that
the swine flu outbreak has

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:34.700
caused more than 159 deaths and
roughly 2,500 illnesses."

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.360
It was pretty scary stuff at the
time, and people got all

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.240
worried about the swine flu.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.730
On the other hand, how many
deaths a year do you think are

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.260
attributable to the
conventional

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.310
seasonal flu in the US?

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.650
Anyone want to hazard a guess?

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:58.550
36,000.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.750
So 36,000 people a year, on
average, will die from the

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:06.920
seasonal flu, which sort of puts
in prospective that 159

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.200
deaths from the swine flu
maybe shouldn't be so

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.950
terrifying.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:17.210
But again, people typically did
not report both of those.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:21.890
Another great statistic, and
accurate, is that most auto

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:26.030
accidents happen within
10 miles of home.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.880
I'm sure many of you
have heard that.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.290
So what does that mean?

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.750
Almost nothing.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:35.270
Most driving is done
with 10 miles--

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.780
within 10 miles of home.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.110
And besides that, what does
home mean in this context?

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.000
What home means is
the registration

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.570
address of the car.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:52.150
So if I were to choose to
register my car in Alaska,

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.500
does that mean I'm less likely
to have an accident driving

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.190
around MIT?

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:57.950
I don't think so.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.290
Again, it's a kind
of a meaningless.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.560
Another aspect of this
is people often

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.980
extrapolate from data.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.990
So we can look at an example
of internet usage.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.860
This is kind of a fun one too.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.860
So what I've plotted here is
the internet usage in the

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.966
United states as a percentage
of population.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.740
And I plotted of this from--

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.680
starting at 1994.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.820
And the green line, or actually,
the blue line there

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:48.730
are the points and the green
line is a linear fit.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.050
If you looked at my code, you'd
see I was using polyfit

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:56.860
with a 1 to get a line to fit,
and you can see it's a pretty

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.850
darn good fit.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:02.860
So people actually looked at
these things and used this to

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:08.860
extrapolate internet usage
going forward.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.110
So we can do that.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.810
Now, we'll run the same
code with the

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.400
extrapolation turned on.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.350
And so figure (1) is the same
figure (1) as before, same

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.120
data, same fit.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.140
And here's figure (2).

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:38.000
And you'll notice that as of
last year about 115% of the US

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.450
population was using the
internet, probably not true.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:48.550
It may be possible in sports
to give 110%, but in

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.800
statistics it's not.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.510
Again, you see this all the
time when people are doing

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:57.430
these projections.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:00.400
They'll say, fit some data,
they extrapolate into the

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.930
future without understanding
why maybe that isn't a good

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:05.410
thing to do.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.490
We saw that by when we were
modeling springs, right?

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:12.620
We could accurately project
linearly until we exceeded the

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.970
constant of elasticity at which
point our linear model

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.510
was totally broken.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.320
So you always need to have some
reason other than just

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.850
fitting the data to believe that
what you're doing makes

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.230
actual sense.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.800
All right.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:37.240
The final one I want to talk
about is what is typically

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:42.680
called in the literature the
Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.440
And this is a little bit tricky

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.170
to understand sometimes.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.530
Actually, is there anyone
here from Texas?

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:09.280
Oh good, so no one will
be offended by this.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.770
Well imagine that you're driving
down some country road

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:15.990
in Texas and that
you see a barn.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:20.510
And that barn has six targets
painted on it, and in the dead

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.650
center of each target, you
find a bullet hole.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.680
So you're driving, your pretty
impressed, and you stop.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.680
And you see the owner of the
barn and you say, you must be

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.010
a damn good shot.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.280
And he says, absolutely,
I never miss.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.990
At which point the farmer's
wife walks out and says,

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:43.370
that's right there ain't a man
in the state of Texas who is

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:46.510
more accurate with
a paint gun.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.400
What did he do?

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.840
He shot six bullets into
the barn, and he

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.790
was a terrible shot.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.390
They were all over the place.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.635
Then he went and painted a
target around each of them.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:03.000
And it looked like he
was a great shot.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.880
Now you might think that, well
that's silly, no one would do

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.500
that in practice.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:13.010
But in fact, it happens all
of the time in practice.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:17.500
A classic of this genre appeared
in the magazine New

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.550
Scientist, in 2001.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:23.875
And it reported that a research
team led by John

00:43:23.875 --> 00:43:27.930
Eagles of the Royal Cornhill
Hospital in Aberdeen, had

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:32.280
discovered that and I quote,
"Anorexic women are most

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.780
likely to have been born in
the spring or early summer

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.030
between March and June.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.480
In fact, there were
more than--

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.370
there were more than 13%--

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:49.680
there were 13% more anorexics
born on average in those

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:54.150
months, and 30% more anorexics,
on average, in

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.870
June."

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:01.100
Now, let's look at this
worrisome statistic.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.450
Are any of you women
here born in June?

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:04.760
All right.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.630
Well, I won't ask about
your health history.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:11.740
But maybe you should be
worried, or maybe not.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:14.470
So let's look at how they
did this study.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.920
You may wonder why so many of
these studies are all studies

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.300
about women's health.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.650
And then, perhaps, because
they're all

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:22.760
done by male doctors.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.890
Anyway, the team studied 446
women who had been diagnosed

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.140
as anorexic.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:36.030
So if you divide that by 12
what you've discovered is

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:42.660
that, on average, there should
have been 37 women born in

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:48.130
each of those months,
of the 446.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:56.790
And in fact, in June, there were
48 anorexic women born.

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:01.030
So they said, well, how likely
is this to have occurred

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.280
simply by chance?

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:09.960
Well as I am want to do in
such occasions, I checked

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.620
their analysis, and I
wrote a little piece

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.660
of code to do that.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:19.390
So trying to figure out what's
the probability of 48 women

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:23.870
being born in June, I ran
a simulation in which I

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:30.700
simulated 446 births and chose
a month at random, and looked

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.140
at the probability.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.900
And let's see what it
was when we run it.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.120
Oops, well we didn't
want these graphs.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:55.680
The probability of at least 48
births in June was 0.042.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.940
So in fact, pretty low.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.840
You might say, well, what's
the odds of this

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.060
happening by accident?

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.290
Pretty small.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.280
Therefore, maybe we are really
on to something.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.250
Maybe it has to do with the
conditions of the birth and

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:14.050
the weather or who knows what.

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:20.940
Well, what's wrong with
this analysis?

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:29.810
Well, one way to look at it is
this analysis would have been

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:37.290
perfectly valid if the
researchers had started with a

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:43.480
hypothesis that there are more
babies born in June than in

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.890
any other month-- more future
anorexics born in June than in

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:50.400
any other month, and then run
this experiment to test it,

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.760
and validated it.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:58.130
So if they had started with the
hypothesis, and then from

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:05.930
the hypothesis conducted what's
called a prospective

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:16.750
study then they would have,
perhaps, valid reason to

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:21.120
believe that the study supports
the hypothesis.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.790
But that's not what they did.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.440
Instead what they did is they
looked at the data and then

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:33.300
chose a hypothesis that matched
the data, the Texas

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.600
sharpshooter fallacy.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.600
Given that that was the
experiment they performed, the

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.070
right question to ask is not
what is the probability that

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:50.770
you had 48 future anorexics born
in June, but what was the

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:56.170
probability that you have 48
future anorexics born in at

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:59.400
least one of the 12 months?

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.020
Because that's what they were
really doing, right?

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:10.670
So therefore, we should really
have run this simulation.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:14.030
Similar to the previous one,
again, these are in your hand

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:22.750
out, but is there at least
one month in which

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:26.034
there were 48 births?

00:48:26.034 --> 00:48:33.100
And if we run that we'll see
that the probability is over

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:38.820
40%, not so impressive as 4%.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:43.560
So in fact, we see that we
probably shouldn't draw any

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.980
conclusion.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.600
The probability of this
happening by pure accident is

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.090
almost 50%.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:56.030
So why should we believe that
it's somehow meaningful.

00:48:56.030 --> 00:49:01.030
Again, an example of the Texas
sharpshooter fallacy that

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:04.400
appeared in the literature and
a lot of people fell for it.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.840
And if we had more time, I
would give you many more

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.970
examples, but we don't.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:13.980
I'll see you on Thursday,
on Tuesday, rather.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.140
Two more lectures to go.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:19.300
On Tuesday, I'm going to go over
some code that I'll be

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.900
asking you to look
at in preparation

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.860
for the final exam.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.510
And then on Thursday, we'll
wrap things up.

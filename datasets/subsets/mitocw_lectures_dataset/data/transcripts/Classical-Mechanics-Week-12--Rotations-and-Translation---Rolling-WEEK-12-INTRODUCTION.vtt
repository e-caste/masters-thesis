00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.660
We have previously studied
the translational motion

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.010
of rigid bodies by analyzing the
motion of their center of mass.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.350
We have also studied the
rotation of rigid bodies

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.150
about a fixed axis.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.030
This week, we will consider
more complicated examples

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.210
of rigid body motion, where
translation and rotation are

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.970
both occurring simultaneously.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.300
One example is, if I toss a
rigid body through the air

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.310
but give it a spin
at the same time

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.280
so that it tumbles
in space as it falls.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.350
A second example
is a wheel that is

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.300
rolling along a flat surface.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.060
Its location is translating,
but at the same time,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.000
it is also spinning
about its axis.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.200
A natural way to
analyze such motions

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.900
is to, once again,
take advantage

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.000
of [? Chasles' ?]
theorem, which states

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.830
that one possible
way of describing

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.020
the general motion
of a rigid body

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.180
is by a translation
of its center of mass

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.670
plus a rotation about
its center of mass.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.430
This separation of
the general case

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.320
into two distinct
type of motions

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.440
will greatly simplify
our analysis.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.920
One of the most common examples
of simultaneous translational

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.962
and rotational motion is
that of rolling objects,

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:11.430
and we will concentrate on
this particular application.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.100
We will see that an important
detail is whether or not

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.260
the object rolls
without slipping,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.960
and the role that friction
can play in each case.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.210
The special case of
rolling without slipping

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.340
amounts to a
constraint condition

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.460
that relates the translational
speed of the center of mass

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.110
to the radius and the
rotational angular velocity.

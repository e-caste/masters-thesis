WEBVTT

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good morning. So, I see we
have a lot of parents here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
How many parents
have we got here?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Welcome to the parents. How
many of the parents have done

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the reading for today? [LAUGHTER]
Good, because we'll call

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the parents too, right?
We'll see what happens.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
All right, so, where are we? We've
talked about this diagram that I

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
keep coming back
to. If you want to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
study biological function the two
traditional ways to do that were to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
look at genetics or to look
at biochemistry: genetics, the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
study of an organism with one broken
component, those components being

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
genes; biochemistry: the
study of the purification of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
individual components from an
organism away from the organism,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
particularly the most important
such components being proteins.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What do they have
to do to each other?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The unification in molecular
biology that occurred in the middle

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
of the century from the
1950s into the Â‘60s and really

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
up to 1970 or so, we came
to a conceptual understand

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that genes
encode proteins,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and therefore these two different
ways of looking at the organism:

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
organism minus a
component, components

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
minus an organism were
complementary points of view,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and in theory, you could go
from a gene sequence to a protein

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Sequence, a protein sequence
back to a gene sequence,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to go for a gene sequence
to its function, its function

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to a protein, except for one to
a tiny detail. This was all just

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
conceptual. Conceptually
we understood by about 1970

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that the DNA made the RNA made
the protein. The protein carried

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
out the function
but as of then,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you couldn't individually work with
or purify the DNA corresponding to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
any particular gene. All
of the inferences had been

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
indirect inferences: indirect
inferences from bacterial genetics,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
bacterial regulation or
Meselson-Stahl experiments,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and all sorts of
interesting indirect ways

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
working out the genetic code, but
it didn't let you read anything.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This was a problem.
Some people in the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
late 1960s said, great,
molecular biology is over.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We understand in principle how
life works. Now let's go understand

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
how the brain works. And
there was an exodus of some

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
people from molecular biology
into neurobiology to now go

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
nail the brain, figured
that would be worth another

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
ten years or so. But
in fact, remarkably,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
people began to focus
on how you could get to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
work with individual specific genes.
Now, what's so hard about that? I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
mean, it's not very
hard to crack open a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
red blood cell and purify different
proteins. You can purify hemoglobin.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You can purify different enzymes.
Biochemistry allows you to purify

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
different components from each other.
I want to purify an enzyme: let's

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
crack open a yeast
cell, separate the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
proteins over some column that
separates them based on their size

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
or their charge, and
I'll get purer and purer

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
fractions. I'll assay
each fraction to see

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
which one has the enzymatic
activity. But basically I use the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
physical chemical
properties of the proteins to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
separate them into different
buckets. Why not do that with,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
say, the human DNA and
purify out the gene for beta

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
globin, that encodes the
beta component of hemoglobin?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
What would be the problem of just
using physical chemical purification

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to purify one human gene from
another? Well, I mean, it's one

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
very big molecule. Well,
I could sheer it up.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Maybe I'll just break it up.
Now, let's purify the beta

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
globin containing part. It
all looks the same. It's just

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
DNA. It's one chemical polymer
with pretty boring properties,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and they're not
very different.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Any particular DNA sequence in any
other DNA sequence basically about

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the same molecular
weight, same charges,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
there's nothing to separate them
by. How are you going to purify beta

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
globin? That was the
problem. That's where

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
recombinant DNA came in was
recombinant DNA was a remarkable

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and totally different way
of purifying individual

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
components. And the basis of
it was this notion of cloning.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If I want to purify
out from the human

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
genome, how big is the human genome?
The human genome is about three

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
billion bases long. If I
want to purify a particular

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
gene, let's say beta
globin or some other gene,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000
typical gene, might be on the
order of 30,000 letters long.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This is one part in 105
purification I've got to achieve.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Any given gene is
only one part in

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
105 of the human genome. And
then, what about a typical

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
mutation? Maybe the
mutation that causes

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
sickle cell anemia by changing a
single nucleotide and beta globe,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
well, that's one base pair. So
that means I'm trying to identify

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
something that's on the order
of one part in 109 actually,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
a little less than one part
in 109 of the whole genome.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Carrying out purifications
like: really kind of hard

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to imagine. But the way it was done
was by the invention of cloning.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Let me briefly
overview of the idea

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of cloning, and then we'll dive
into the details. The idea of cloning

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
was, the way to purify
individual molecules would just be

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
to take the molecules and
just dilute them so that there

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
was only one of each
model. That's very pure,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
isn't it? The problem is it's
not very much, so you need

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
a way to take a single
copy of a molecule,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and then make many copies of it.
So purification's not hard. You

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
just dilute it down
so you work with

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
single molecules but then
you need to copy it back again

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and again and again, and
no biochemical technique

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
involves, say, fractionating
a cell and replicating

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
some enzyme, you know,
copying some enzyme.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
You can't copy enzymes, but
you can copy DNA, and that was

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the basis of it. So
here's the way it goes. The

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
basic overview we'll look at is
take your DNA and cut your DNA

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
of interest, maybe
the human genome,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
into pieces at defined sites
Then, paste your DNA, which is more

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
technically ligate,
the word we use.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Paste your DNA to some other
DNA called a vector. So,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
cut your DNA and paste your DNA.
Each piece of your, say, human DNA

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:06.000
gets stuck to some
piece of vector.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Insert this DNA into vectors
that can replicate in bacteria.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So, I'm going to actually
take my piece of human DNA

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and not just ligate
it to any piece of DNA.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I'm going to take my human DNA,
and I'm going to ligate it to a

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
vector that has all
of the machinery,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
all of the ability to be
copied in a bacteria. Then what

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I'm going to do is I'm going
to transform my DNA into a

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
host cell, a host bacterial cell.
Transform means introduce. When we

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
talk about
transforming DNA,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
we're not talking about changing
it. It's the word that's used for

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
taking my DNA,
stuck into a vector,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and introducing it into
bacterial cells. Ideally,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
each bacterial cell
would carry one such

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
DNA molecule, and then what I want
to do is I want to plate my cells,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and select those that carry
human DNA, my DNA; DNA I've put on

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
it. So, I'm going to put them on
a Petri plate and I want only the

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
bacteria that happen to have picked
an individual piece of human DNA

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to grow. So, that's the trick.
It's a very simple trick. Take

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
total human DNA, cut
it up into pieces, glue

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
it to a vector that's able to
be copied so that it's able to be

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
replicated in bacteria, put
the vectors into bacterial

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
cells; every bacterial cell
picks up no more than one vector.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
You plate it out, and you
simply arrange so that the

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
only cells that grow are those that
picked up the piece of human DNA.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And then, every one
of these colonies

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
is the descendent of a single
bacterial cell that picked up a

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
single human molecule,
but is obligingly

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
copying that molecule for you
again and again and again and again.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And thus, you
have what we refer

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
to; this whole collection here
is called a library of clones.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
This is called a
recombinant library because

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
every piece of the human
genome is somewhere in here.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
You know, this one here
probably is active, and maybe

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
this one here maybe is collagen-11
and that one there might,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
ah, there's beta
globin. OK, actually

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
when you look at the plate there's
no way to tell but in principle

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
they're all there. So, there
will be this question of,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
how do we look at a library
and pull out what the right one

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
is? But somewhere in
there should be a bacterial

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
colony that has pure beta globin
gene, the DNA for beta globin.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
The next lecture will be
about how you actually find it.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But today let's just
build this library. So our

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
goal is to be able to
build a library like this.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, we have to figure
out how to cut DNA,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
paste, DNA, vectors, etc.,
etc. So that's what our

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
subject will be today.
Let's dive in. First,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000
cutting DNA, how do you cut
DNA? Restriction enzymes,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:40.000
etc. It turns out that
the way you could cut

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
DNA at particular places is as
follows. Let me take a piece of DNA.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Here's a double-stranded
piece of DNA. We'll go A,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
G, C, T, A, G, A, A,
T, T, C, T, T, A, C, C,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
hydroxyl there, three
primad. Let's go back on the

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
other strand.
What do we have? G,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
G, T, A, A, G, A, A,
T, T, C, T, A, G, C, T,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
hydroxyl there, three
prime. There's my double

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
stranded piece of DNA. It
turns out that there exists an

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:29.000
enzyme that recognizes
that exact sequence: G, A,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:39.000
A, T, T, C. The enzyme
goes by the name Eco R1.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
This protein, this enzyme,
scans along the the DNA, and it

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
finds this sequence:
G, A, A, T, T, C.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Actually it's on this strand.
What about on the other strand does

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it say? Same thing. But
it's a reverse palindrome.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It's symmetric.
That's very good.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And it turns out most
restriction enzymes do that. OK,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
so what it does
when it finds that,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
with the benefit of colored
chalk that has just shown up here

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
is it cleaves the DNA
fragment like that.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And what it gives you then
is a broken double strand with

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
an overhang, T, T,
A, A, five prime,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
three prime, three prime,
five prime. This has a hydroxyl

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
here this. This has a phosphate
there. And then this other fragment

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:47.000
here is A, A, T, T, C,
T, T, A, C, C, G, G, T,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:57.000
A. So, what happens is,
and this has a hydroxyl five

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000
prime, three prime, three
prime, five prime I get into

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
two fragments of
DNA that have been

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
broken there and have it over.
The overhang is complementary.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Those two sequences match each other.
There's what's called a five prime

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
overhang and they're complementary
So, we have complementary,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that is matching, five prime over
X. This is called Eco R1 because it's

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
purified, this
particular enzyme,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
from E coli strain R and it's
the number one such enzyme that

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
was purified from it. So, it
is very simple nomenclature

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
here. Now, here's a question. Why
do bacteria have an enzyme like

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
this? There are some people
who feel that the reason

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
is that this enzyme is here
precisely to allow molecular

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
biologists to cut and paste
DNA, and this represents

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
impressions likely,
me among them.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
How did anybody find this stuff?
Well, shaggy dog story, I have to

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
tell you the following
shaggy dog story.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So, this is a fun shaggy dog story,
and it's an MIT shaggy dog story

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
because it comes from
the work of Salvador

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Luria, who is a very
famous biologist who worked

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
here at MIT. So, Salvador
Luria was studying

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
bacteriophage. Remember,
bacteriophage are the

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
viruses that infect bacteria.
So, he was studying bacteriophage,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and he took his bacteriophage
and used it to infect a strain of

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
bacteria, strain A, and he also
used it to infect a strain of

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
bacteria, strain B.
So when he did that,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
what you do is you plate
a lawn of bacterial cells.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You kind of have a slush
of bacterial cells that you

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
plate here with virus mixed
in, and wherever there's a

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
virus, the virus grows,
replicates, and either kills or

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
slows down the growth of the
cells so that bacterial cells grow

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
everywhere else, but where
a viral particle landed

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
there's an absence of bacterial
cells and that hole in the lawn,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
this whole thing
is called a lawn of

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
bacteria, and the holes in
the lawn are called plaques.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So, when he did this, he
found that when he did it on

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
strain A he got a bunch of
plaques and when he did it

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
on strain B, he didn't, no
plaques. So what what's the

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
simplest
explanation for this?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Strain B is different somehow.
It's resistant to the virus. I

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
don't know, the virus
has to come in and do

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
various things, and strain
b isn't compatible with

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
the virus or something like that.
No big deal. So it's a resistant

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
strain. But, occasionally
you'd get a plaque.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Very occasionally, you'd
have an occasional plaque.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So now, how would this
be? I said the strain was

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
resistant. How could there
be an occasional plaque?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Mutation in, could it be
imitation in the bacteria?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Sorry. Well, if it was a
mutation in the bacteria

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
there would be one bacteria
that had the mutation. It was now

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
susceptible, and it would
die. But, the lawn would

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
kind of grow because the cells
around it wouldn't have a mutation.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So it's probably not a
mutation in the bacteria

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
but what could be? Maybe a
mutation of the virus: what

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
if it was a mutation in the
virus that was able to overcome

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
the resistance?
Ah, so that's OK.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So, what this must be is
the existence of a resistant

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
virus that is a virus that
can overcome the resistance of

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
the bacteria. So far: perfectly
normal, no problem. Now, let's

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000
do the following experiment.
Let's take this resistant virus,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and grow it, again, on
strain A and grow it on

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
strain b. What do you think is
going to happen when I grow it on

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
strain A? It'll grow lots
of plaques. It still grows

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
on strain A, and now what's
going to happen when I grow

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
it on strain B? If this
was really a mutation that

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
made it able to grow on strain b
then it gets lots of plaques because

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
it's now gained the ability
to grow on strain B, and sure

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
enough, that's
what happens. So,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000
there's nothing funky yet.
But now, suppose I take one of

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
these resistant viruses that
I isolated here on strain B,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I grow it again here on strain A.
It grows. I grow it on strain B.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
It grows. If I take it
again from strain B and

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
I repeat this, it'll
still grow on strain A and

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
still grow on strain
B. Let's take one,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
though, from strain A. It's the
resistant one which we have just now

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.000
happened to have grown
on strain A. And now,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:19.000
let's grow it again on strain
A versus on strain B. And sure

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
enough, it continues to
grow on strain A, no problem.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And we grow it now on
strain B. And, what shall we

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
get? Well, it should grow on strain
B, right, because it was a mutant

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
virus, and it gained the
ability to grow on either.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
We passage it through B, it
grows. We passage it through A.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
But the answer was nothing,
no growth. How can that be?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
We had a virus. We agreed
that was a mutant virus that

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
had picked up the ability to grow
on strain B, and we demonstrated

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
it has now on
either A or B.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
We then reached in, and
grabbed a copy of it here from

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
strain A, having grown on strain
A, and we try it again and it now

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
won't grow on strain B.
If this was a mutation,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
I mean, maybe the
mutation reverted, right?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
It was a reversion of the mutation.
It mutated back. Is that plausible?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
No, come on. The chance that all
of the copies there would mutate

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
back, come on. I mean,
you could repeat this

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
several times and this
is always what happens.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
What does that tell you about
this mutation in the virus?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
It can't be a mutation
of the virus because

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
if it was a mutation, it
would be transmitted through.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
But, passing through
strain A makes it lose

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
its ability to grow on strain B.
But as long as you keep passing it

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
through strain B, it can
grow on strain B. This is

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
not your typical genetics.
So, Salvador Luria loved this.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And, he really worked out
what was going on. And somehow,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:12.000
well, so anyway, they
referred to this as strain B

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
having the ability to
restrict the growth of the

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
virus. Strain B can restrict
the growth of the virus.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
That's where this
word restriction enzyme

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
comes from. What's really, truly
going on here underneath the

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
shaggy dog story? It
took a long time before

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
the shaggy dog story that Salvador
Luria was the one to really

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
demonstrate is fully worked
out. But, what turns out to

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000
be the case is that strain
B has a restriction enzyme.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000
That's how it restricts
the growth. It has one of

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000
these enzymes that can cut
DNA at a specific place.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
When the virus comes into
strain B, it injects its DNA,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:25.000
and the enzyme comes along and
cuts the virus's DNA, protecting the

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
bacteria. It's got its own little
defense mechanism: pretty cool,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
pretty cool. So, any
DNA that's introduced,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
if it has the sequence here,
it'll take G, A, A, T, T, C, the

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
bacteria cuts
it. Wait a second,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
the bacteria has its own DNA.
Why doesn't it chop up its own

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
chromosome? Well, I mean, so
one simple possibility would be

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
that if this thing is looking
for the sequence, G, A, A, T, T, C

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
in the genome, maybe
it's the case that the

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
bacteria has arranged
that its own DNA

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
never has a G, A, A,
T, T, C. That would be a

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
simple solution, right?
But is it a plausible

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
solution? Why not?
But just statistically,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
how often do I expect to encounter
a G, A, A, T, T, C? What's

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
the frequency of any given six
letter word in a four letter

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
alphabet? It's about one in 46.
So, about one in 46 positions will

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
be a G, A, A, T, T, C,
and that's about 4,000

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
letters. So, every 4, 00
letters, I expect to encounter a

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
G, A, A, T, T, C. How
big is the E coli genome?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
4 million letters.
So, how many G, A, A,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
T, T, Cs will there
be? About 1,000

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
of them. It's just not plausible
to imagine that it doesn't have the

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
sites. So, your idea is
that if it has these sites,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
it's got to arrange to protect
its own sites. So, how is

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
it going to protect
its own sites?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Covers it or something. You
could imagine something covers

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
it or something, but you
want to alter your own,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
so it turns out you're exactly
right. What happens is there is

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
an enzyme that comes
along, and at this position,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000
attaches a methyl group.
It modifies the DNA

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
by attaching a methyl group. It
turns out that that methyl group

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
is enough to prevent the
restriction enzyme from binding.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000
So, this blocks the restriction
enzyme. So, that way the bacteria

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
is able to distinguish
between its own DNA,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
which is methylated, and the viral
DNA. So, wait a second, how does

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
that explain my virus that manage
to grow? How did my virus manage to

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
grow? It would need to have gotten
itself modified also to be protected.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Could that happen by chance?
What if the methylation enzyme,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:48.000
the methylase, which is
floating around in the cell,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Â“accidentallyÂ” methylated
the virus's DNA? What would

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
happen then? The virus
would become immune.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
So, suppose the bacteria
was pretty clever, and had a

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
lot more restriction enzyme, and
only a little bit of methylase?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Well, you'd imagine
that most of the

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
time the restriction enzyme
would cut up the viral DNA first.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
But every once in a
while, the methylase

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
would get there first and
protect the virus's DNA.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
That becomes an immune
virus because it can't

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
be cut by the enzyme anymore.
And, if I take that, and I grow it

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
again on strain B, it'll now
produce lots of plaques because

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
it was methylated.
And, if I grow it

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
again on strain B, it remains
methylated because once

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
it's methylated and comes
into the cell, it's not

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
cut. And so, its descendants
will get methylated.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
But, what happens if I ever
grow that methylated virus

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
on strain A? Strain A doesn't
have the restriction enzyme,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
and it doesn't have
the methylase. So, the

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
progeny phage that grew up
on strain A aren't methylated.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
They're no longer protected.
The protection that the

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
virus has is the protection that
comes from this methylation enzyme.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
It's not the sequence
of the DNA. It's

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
the attachment to these
methyl groups. And so,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
it turns out that if you ever
pass this virus through strain A,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:39.000
passage through strain A,
the resulting DNA loses is

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000
unmethylated. And
now, it can be cut.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And it can be cut. Well,
this explained the weird

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
results of Luria, that
somehow bacteria had a complex

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
defense mechanism of
a restriction enzyme

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
and a cognate methylase. The
restriction enzyme would cut

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
the sequence. The chromosome
would be protected by

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
methylating that site, and
usually it would work fine.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Occasionally the bacterial
virus would get methylated.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
It would be protected as long as it
continues to go through strains that

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
have this restricted methylation
system. That was it. Now, this

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
shaggy dog story took a
couple of decades to work out,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
and eventually led to Nobel
prizes for the discovery

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
of restriction enzymes. They're
extremely important because

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
although bacteria do this to
protect themselves, they have also

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
given us the perfect tool to
now cut DNA where we want to

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
cut DNA. Now, what if
you wanted to cut at a G,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
A, A, T, T, C?
You've got Eco R1.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
But what if you wanted to cut
it cut it in another sequence?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Well, it turns out that if you
want to cut it at G, G, A, T, C, C

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:09.000
there's an enzyme called Bam
H1. If you want to cut it at

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
A, A, G, C, T,
T or A, A, G, C,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
T, T, there's an enzyme
called Hmd 3. If you

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
want to cut it at just G,
A, T, C like this, C, T, A,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.000
G, an enzyme called Mbo 1.
And, there are enzymes that

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000
cut it this way, enzymes
that cut it this way,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
enzymes that cut it this way,
enzymes that recognize four bases,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
six bases. There are even enzymes
that recognize eight bases.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
It turns out that bacteria have
elaborated zillions of different

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
restriction enzymes that
recognize different sequences. This

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
perfect for molecular
biologists. Bacteria,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
of course, are much smarter than
we are, having been out this much

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
longer, have developed all of
these tools for engineering.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
All we have to do is borrow
them. So how do you get Eco R1?

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
We grow out that strain of
E coli; you purify Wco R1.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And how do you get
Hmd 3? You grow up

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
strain of haemophilus influenza.
You purify the enzyme. At least,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
that's how primitive molecular
biologists did it. If you

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
wanted to work with a restriction
enzyme, you'd grow up the bacteria.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
You'd purify the enzyme
yourself, and you would just use

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
it in your laboratory. Of
course today what does a modern

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
molecular biologist do if
he or she should want Hmd 3?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000
It's in the catalog. So the
catalog has 200 restriction

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000
enzymes. Yup, PSI-1 is new,
on sale, 500 units for $400.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Let's see what Eco
R1 is going for.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Eco R1: look at this, 50,000
units $200. That's a good

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
price for Eco R1 because
it's a very famous

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
enzyme here. So all you have to do
is you give them your credit card

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
number and you have it tomorrow
by FedEx. So that's how restriction

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
enzymes are obtained today.
So, next up, we can cut DNA any

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
place we want to. We now
need to glue DNA together.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Suppose I cut DNA,
human DNA, and I'm

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
going to cut it. I'll
just take human DNA,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
your DNA, which I've
purified, and I'm going to cut

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:46.000
it at all its Eco R1 sites. I
can take any other DNA I want.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
I don't know, I could take zebra
DNA. I could take anything and I could

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
also cut it at Eco R1 sites.
I could mix them together,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
and after mixing them together
the fragments will float around and

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000
remember this
down here has T, T,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000
A, A. This fragment over
here from some other piece

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
T, T, A, A, this could be human DNA.
This could be zebra DNA if you want

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000
to. It doesn't matter.
It could be bacterial DNA.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
These fragments overlap. They'll
hydrogen bond a little bit,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
but that of course won't
introduce a covalent bond here.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
I'd really like to make a covalent
bond. I would like to attach the

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
piece of DNA from one source
to the piece of DNA from the

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
other source by doing
the opposite of the

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
restriction enzyme. The
restriction enzyme cut at these

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
locations. I would
now like to catalyze

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
the rejoining of the sugar
phosphate backbone here.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
So I would like to rejoin the
sugar phosphate backbone. I

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
have a hydroxyl here.
I have a phosphate here,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
and I would like to
ligate them together. So

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
how I manage to ligate? What
kind of fancy chemistry do I

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
do to ligate these pieces of DNA
together? I don't do any fancy

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
chemistry. I again sit at the feet
of bacteria who have solved all

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
these problems before. And
I ask bacteria, how do you do

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
this? And they say, well,
we have an enzyme called

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
ligase. So, you purify
ligase from bacteria,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
you add that, and ligase ligates
the fragments together. Why

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
do bacteria have
an enzyme ligase?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
For a pair of their own DNA.
Things go wrong this is part of the

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
DNA maintenance scheme of
bacteria. They have an enzyme

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
ligase to appear their own
breaks in DNA and, obligingly, you

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
can purify DNA ligase.
So you add ligase, today,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
of course, if
you need a ligase,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
how do you get it?
It's in the catalog,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
absolutely. So, you can glue
together any of those things you

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
want. All right, next up,
what DNA do I want to stick

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
together? I mean, here
I made a silly example.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
I'm going to stick some
human DNA to some zebra

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
DNA. Why do that? I mean,
just to show you that I can

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
doing it, right? I'm just
demonstrating that I could stick any

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
DNA to any DNA.
Remember, once I've

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
got a piece of DNA it doesn't know
whether it came from a human or a

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
zebra. It's just the molecule. You
can stick the molecules together,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
right? But what do I really
want to attach my human DNA to?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:45.000
I want to attach it to attach
it to some other DNA that

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:59.000
has the ability to grow on its own
within bacteria. Vectors: I need

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000
to make, here's what I would
really like. I would like to have

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:13.000
a piece of DNA that has some
sequences that contain the

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:23.000
recognition sites for replication.
I'd like to have some replication

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:31.000
initiation sites here.
So, a piece of DNA that,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
remember, because the
bacterial chromosome itself,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
here's my bacteria,
bacteria'chromosome replicates

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
itself, and it has the ability to
start DNA replication at multiple

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000
sites called origins of
replication. But, what I

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
would really like is to be able
to construct in the laboratory a

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:07.000
synthetic piece of DNA that
also would function as an

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:19.000
origin of replication because then
what I could do is in vitro take

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
my piece of DNA, attach
it to this vector,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
and it would now have
the ability to grow

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
the bacteria. How am I
going to make a piece of DNA?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
What kind of engineering
tricks can we do to create

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
a small piece of DNA that has
all the machinery needed to

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
be able to be copied and
replicated just like bacterial

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
chromosomes? That's a pretty
fancy feat of engineering.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
How are you going to
do that? Sorry? OK,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
so who are you going to ask?
If you wanted to do this, you're

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
going to ask the experts. Who
are the experts? Viruses or

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
bacteria, or basically,
if you want to do anything,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
the place to ask is the
folks who have the most

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
experience. And, the
folks who have the most

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
experience are almost always
prokaryotic organisms because they

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
are by far the most
evolved things on

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
this planet. Anything that can
replicate itself and grow every 20

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
minutes or something like
that has had a lot more

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
generations of evolution
than you have. And therefore,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
they are much more optimized than
we are. And so you go ask and say,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
has any bacteria worked out how
to do this? Turns out bacteria have

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
worked out how to
do this just fine. In

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
fact, most bacteria,
at least many bacteria,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000
contain within them, in
addition to their own chromosome,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:57.000
small circles of DNA.
These are called episomes.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:06.000
This is the chromosome.
Epi means on top of

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
or in addition to. So in
addition to the chromosome,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
there's an episome. The episome is
in fact an autonomously replicating

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.000
piece of DNA that has an origin.
And it replicates. Why do bacteria

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
have episomes? It
turns out episomes

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
often contain genes. One
fo the genes they contain,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
or some of the types of genes
they contain, are resistance

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
genes. There might be, for
example, a penicillin resistance

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
gene contained on an episome, or
a streptomycin resistance gene.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
It turns out the
bacteria have these

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
episomes containing resistance genes,
and they're not in the chromosome.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
They're separate. Now,
why would they do that?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.000
It turns out when a bacterium
dies and a cell cracks open, the

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
DNA spills out. The next
door neibhored bacteria has

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
mechanismis to suck up DNA
from the environment. You never

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
know. It might find something
interesting out there.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
So, it turns out that bacteria
are rather promiscuously exchanging

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
pieces of DNA all
the time. And so,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
a bacteria that has an episome that
has a penicillin resistance gene

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
can spread it to other bacteria,
and it's very nice. It's compact.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
It's on its own little episome,
autonomously replicating

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
piece of DNA. This is great for
bacteria wanting to spread drug

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
resistance. It's not good
for human populations,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
for example, because this is how
drug resistance spread through

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
populations. This is
why we have spreads of

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
penicillin resistance. Now,
of course, wait a second,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
this whole mechanism of spreading
drug resistance, we've only had

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
antibiotics since the 1940s.
How did bacteria devise this so

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
quickly? Sorry? Many
generations since 1945?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
That would be
very impressive.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Yeah, but, I mean, why do they
have this episome mechanism, the

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
ability to spread DNA and
all that? That's an awful lot

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
to evolve in 50 years?
Yeah? Something natural like

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
penicillin. It
turns out, we didn't

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
think of penicillin. Who
thought of penicillin?

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Fungi. Right, again, we learn from
the lower organisms. Penicillin

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
comes from fungi.
Bacteria have been fighting

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
off penicillin for millions and
tens of millions of years. So,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
we may be very proud of
our penicillin and all that.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
But, they've been at
this for a very long time.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
This is about war between
bacteria and fungi.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
That's what this is, OK? So,
that's why these things are

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
here. They're here so that
bacteria can have these

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
resistance genes against fungi
and things like that that make

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
antibiotics. Antibiotics
are natural. We've made a few

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
new ones, but most of the
antibiotics have been made by nature.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
And so, if I wanted
to replicate DNA,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
if I wanted to attach my human
DNA to a piece of DNA that's

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
capable of autonomous replication,
autonomously replicating circles of

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000
DNA, these autonomously replicating
circles of DNA are also called

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
plasmids. And that's the word
we'll mostly use for them,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
plasmids. All I need to
do is purify a plasmid from

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
a bacteria. So, I find a
bacteria that has plasmids.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
I purify the plasmid, and
then I can cut open the plasmid

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
at the Eco R1 site, OK? So,
this plasmid will have an

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
ORI, an origin of
replication. I'll cut

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
it open at the Eco R1 sight.
I'll take human DNA fragments that

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
I've cut with Eco R1. I'll mix
them with plasmid DNA that has

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
been opened up, has an
origin. Ligase will come

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
along, join this up, and now
I have a circle of DNA that

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
has all the machinery to
autonomously replicate,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
plus my human DNA. Now, if I
wanted to get a vector, or an

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
honest to goodness plasmid,
I can go to a bacteria,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
grow it up, purify the plasmid,
and cut it. Or alternatively,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
if I needed the
plasmid, say, tomorrow,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
it's in the catalog. The next
section of the catalog has

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
a long list of
plasmids here. There's

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
a plasmid there, right?
It's a nice plasmid.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Oh yes, let's see, puck
is a very good plasmid.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
PBR 322 is a good plasmid. The
whole section, all this purple

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
stuff are the plasmids. So,
you can get the plasmids too.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
You place one order, you
get the restriction enzymes,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
you get the ligases,
you get the plasmids, no

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000
problem. So, I can then take
total human DNA, cut up, cut

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000
up, cut up, cut
up, add in plasmid,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
and I'm going to ligate together.
And then, having ligated my human

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:45.000
DNA to my plasmids,
I'm going to mix with

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:55.000
bacteria. I take some bacterial
cells. I add my mixture of these

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
plasmids containing human DNA.
And now all I have to do is

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
persuade the bacteria to suck up
my plasmids containin human DNA.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
How do I teach bacteria to
suck up DNA? They do that for

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
a living. That's what they do.
They're always spreading material.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
They have that ability. All
we're doing is we're using

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
their ability. So you get
the sense that the kind

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
of engineering that really works
in biology is engineering that

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
exploits what nature has been
doing for a very long time.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Rather than butting your head
up against the problem, usually

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
somebody has solved it,
and it's almost always

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
bacteria. So, you've
transformed the bacteria.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Now, there are a
few tricks you can

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
use to make them a
little more transformable.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
You can add calcium phosphate,
and blah, blah, blah,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
but you can sort of persuade
them to take up the DNA. And then

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
all you have to do is
plate them out on a plate.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Plate them out fairly dilutely so
there are a lot of single bacterial

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:03.000
cells that land on the plate,
and wait for them to grow up. Each

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000
one of these had a single
plasmid, a different plasmid than

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
the next guy over.
Wait a second, each one?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
How do I guarantee that
every bacteria in my test

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
tube took up a plasma?
Is that plausible? I mean,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I can't guarantee that every
bacteria is going to take up a

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
plasmid. Maybe I'll add so much
plasmid that every bacteria will

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
take one up. Oh,
but that's a bad idea

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
because why? Because then a lot
of them will take up more than one.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
You don't want to do
that. You really only

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
want to have at most one. So,
if you were going to arrange so

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
that at random you only
have about one, you've got to

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
have a lot that are zero.
So, this is a problem. I mean,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
it's a real waste. My library
is going to have large numbers of

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
bacteria that don't have any
plasmid. In fact, this transformation

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
process is not so efficient.
It's not so efficient. So, we

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
have a little bit
of a problem here is

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
that some of these guys
will have human DNA.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000
But, most of them won't. So,
what can I do to arrange that

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:26.000
any bacteria that did
not pick up a plasmid

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:34.000
was incapable of growing?
Add a resistance gene to the

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:42.000
plasmid. Suppose
I were so clever as

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
to add to that plasmid,
penicillin resistance. So,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
not just an origin of replication,
but suppose I also had a

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000
resistance gene here, say,
for penicillin resistance or

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000
streptomycin resistance, or
ampicillin tends to be a very big

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
favorite, ampicillin
resistance. Then,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
my plasmid would have ampicillin
resistance gene encoded on it,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
an enzyme that can, say,
break down ampicillin,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000
so on and one way to to my perch
you plate I just said ampa cell

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
and now i'll even though
most of the bacteria have not

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
picked up a plasmid, only
those bacteria that have picked

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
up a plasmid have
the ampicillin

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
resistance gene and can grow on
an ampicillin containing plate.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Now, how do I get a
plasmid with an ampicillin

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
resistance gene? It's
in the catalog. It's

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
all there, right? In fact,
these occur naturally.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
You can, with restriction enzymes,
move the ampicillin resistance

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
gene to your favorite plasmid. If
you don't like that, you can put

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
in kanamycin
resistance, etc., etc.,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000
etc. So, that's how you do it.
So, we've got the big picture here.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.000
We have now gotten a
library, the Library of Human

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Fragments contained in E coli.
The library is a big Petri plate or

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:28.000
many Petri plates, each
one of which is a colony.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Each colony has a single
vector with an origin,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
a resistance marker,
and a distinct piece of

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.000
human DNA. In this library lives
somewhere the gene for Huntington's

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.000
disease. Over here is a
gene for cystic fibrosis,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
over here a gene for
Duchenne muscular dystrophy,

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
over here a gene for
diastrophic dysplasia,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000
over here a gene for etc.
etc. The only detail, now,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.000
you've got a library.
You've managed to purify each

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
piece of human DNA away from
every other piece of human DNA.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
The only question now is
how do you use the library?

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
How do you go to the library
and withdraw the correct

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
volume from the shelf?
How do you find the one

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
you're looking for? So, we
have converted the problem

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
of purification, which in every
other form of biochemistry starts by

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
saying, I'm going to purify
something based on its distinctive

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
properties, to I'm going to
randomly purify everything.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Everything would be purified in its
own bacteria, and I've now converted

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
to the problem of finding
the one that I want in my

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
library. Next time, we'll
talk about how you go to the

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
library and find
what you want.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000
See you then.

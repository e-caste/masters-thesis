00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:22.610
PROFESSOR: So today,
the general theme

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.400
is going to be to
try to understand

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.910
how bacteria find food.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.350
And in particular, how do they
know which direction to swim?

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.880
How do they swim
given that they're

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.230
operating in this low
Reynolds number regime

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.770
that you read about
maybe last night?

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.920
What did you guys think of the
life in low Reynolds number?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.452
Yeah, it's kind of fun.

00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:47.160
You very much get the
impression that you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.460
are kind of there in that
lecture hall with him.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.111
They do say that some
essential arm waving was not

00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:56.110
reproduced or so, right?

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.189
But you kind of imagine his
arms waving as he talks,

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:01.980
even though you don't
get to hear him talk.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.340
So that's fun.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.260
And it's a surprising
number of typos

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.347
given that-- every time I
read that, I'm like, somehow

00:01:11.347 --> 00:01:13.430
this is still the best
version that I've been able

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.390
find of that talk.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.130
But I think it's just
a neat example of how

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.710
clearly a talented physicist
can kind of from a naive

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.270
perspective say interesting
things about the way

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.660
that life has to work.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.707
Now today, so we will
be talking indeed

00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:34.040
about how bacteria are swimming.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.160
But we want to
start by just making

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.060
sure we understand something
about how diffusion works,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.640
what life is like in this
low Reynolds number regime.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.970
And for these sorts of problems,
it's really very, very valuable

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.230
if you can just apply some
simple dimensional analysis

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.730
ideas.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.410
And so we're going to practice
that in a few different cases,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.490
that dimension analysis can
often tell you a great deal.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.387
In many cases, you can
discover new physical laws.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.220
You can figure out how
things have to scale.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.026
And in some cases, the
scalings are rather surprising.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.400
And given some of
the constraints

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.240
that microscopic life is facing
in this low Reynolds number

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.810
regime where diffusion is very
important, viscous forces are

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.130
dominating over these
inertial forces,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.060
it really constrains what
bacteria, for example,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.700
are able to do.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.080
And it really
constrains how they

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.630
have to go about solving
the challenges of life.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.940
So what I want to do
is start by thinking

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.590
about just a very kind of simple
situation, which is we have in,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.310
we'll say water, a
non-permeable membrane that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.420
is separating two compartments.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.670
Whereas over here, we have maybe
salt or something on the right.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.130
So this is a salty solution.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.575
And this is pure water.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.590
Now, this is a
non-permeable membrane.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.506
So it doesn't allow
the salt to cross.

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:16.880
But the question
is, what happens

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.770
if I puncture, and I put a
little hole in the membrane

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.660
of some radius a, let's say?

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.840
Now, the question is, what will
be the flow rate, the net flow,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.996
of salt, in this case,
from the right to the left?

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.190
All right, so first of all,
can somebody kind of answer

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.670
at least for a couple-- what
are possible things that

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.890
might be relevant if we're
going to try to figure this out?

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.772
What quantities will we
need to know or measure?

00:04:01.772 --> 00:04:02.990
AUDIENCE: Concentration.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.906
PROFESSOR: Concentration
seems relevant, yeah.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.850
And in this case, there's
only one concentration.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.170
Because well, this
conservation is

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.510
0 here, and some
concentration c over here.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.134
What else might we need to know?

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.649
AUDIENCE: Pore size.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.390
PROFESSOR: The
pore size, perfect.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.848
We'll use a as the
radius of the pore.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.246
And is that going to do it?

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.947
AUDIENCE: You need a
time for something.

00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:40.030
PROFESSOR: We need a time.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.150
Because what we want is
some number of molecules

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.010
per unit time that is going
to be crossing from the right

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.510
to the left.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.701
So we need something
that has a time.

00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:52.200
Yes.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.445
AUDIENCE: The diffusivity.

00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.060
PROFESSOR: All right,
the diffusivity.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.390
So D, so we'll say D, which
is the diffusion coefficient.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.594
How many S's?

00:05:07.594 --> 00:05:15.723
All right, now other things
that might be relevant?

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.140
AUDIENCE: Temperature

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.266
PROFESSOR: Temperature, OK.

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:24.598
AUDIENCE: I guess it's probably
going to be incorporated

00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:25.450
into the [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.710
PROFESSOR: Exactly, right,
so indeed the flow rate

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.050
will be dependent
upon the temperature.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.728
But the way that that manifests
is by doing what to D?

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.790
In general, if we go up
to higher temperature,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.512
how will D change?

00:05:41.512 --> 00:05:42.892
AUDIENCE: Should get bigger.

00:05:42.892 --> 00:05:44.350
PROFESSOR: Should
get bigger, yeah,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.700
so indeed, D will be typically
given by this Einstein

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.840
relation of kT over gamma.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.160
We'll talk more about
this in a little bit.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.537
But for now, let's just
say that D is something

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:55.370
that we've measured.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.824
Now, other things that may
enter into the expression?

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.850
All right, so this
is pretty simple.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.200
We have three things.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.510
Now, the question is, if we
double the size of the pore,

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.770
i.e. if we double a, how
does the flow rate change?

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.690
So we'll go ahead and do a
vote, since we like to do this.

00:06:35.617 --> 00:06:36.700
All right, so we double a.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.282
The flow goes up by what factor?

00:06:42.282 --> 00:06:44.164
All right, maybe not all.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.000
All right, and if you
think it's something else,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.500
you can splay your cards out.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.540
Now, the idea here is that
using dimensional analysis,

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.730
we should be able
to figure this out.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:16.208
Now, I'll give you just a minute
to try to think through this.

00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:31.665
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:31.665 --> 00:07:33.850
PROFESSOR: All right,
so you don't even

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.568
need to know this in principle.

00:07:35.568 --> 00:07:37.692
I'm going to give you
something else that may help.

00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:56.964
AUDIENCE: Will it be by x?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this is
the mean squared distance

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.825
that something will diffuse.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.456
So I wasn't
explaining, because I

00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:12.830
was sort of-- a
hint in the sense

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.760
that in case you might
remember something

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.023
like an equation like-- Yes.

00:08:17.023 --> 00:08:20.410
AUDIENCE: Are we doing this
at the very beginning of--

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.446
PROFESSOR: Yes,
right, OK, so there's

00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:27.320
going to be some question
of timescales here.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.180
OK, so it's really that
after you puncture the hole,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.570
very rapidly it's
going to assume

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.020
some kind of steady state.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.610
And then the flow rate will be
constant for some rather long

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.270
time.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.960
But then eventually the
concentration on this half

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.170
will decrease.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.120
So we're thinking
about the flow rate

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.200
after you've reached
that steady state,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.010
but before you've
equilibrated across the two

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.119
sides of the tube.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.690
All right, do you
need more time?

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.280
All right, let's go ahead
and see where we are.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.261
Ready-- three, two, one.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.720
All right, so we have a
pretty good agreement.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.167
It seems that it's D.
But didn't I tell you

00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:32.417
how to do the problem already?

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.250
OK, so it's not--

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.972
AUDIENCE: So the
naive thing, I guess,

00:09:48.972 --> 00:09:52.806
would be C. Because--
oh, sorry, never mind.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.644
Except for-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:58.644 --> 00:10:00.060
PROFESSOR: All
right, so I'm going

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.120
to give you another--
collaborate with a neighbor.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.540
And I'll tell you that
it's not D to nudge you

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.455
in the right direction.

00:10:11.455 --> 00:10:13.965
So spend a minute.

00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:16.790
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.105
PROFESSOR: All right, let's
go ahead and reconvene.

00:11:23.637 --> 00:11:25.710
All right, I just want
to see where we are now.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.350
So if you still believe it's
D despite my telling you

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.370
that I don't think it's
D, you can still vote D,

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.260
and then we can argue about it.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.135
And that's fine, too.

00:11:33.135 --> 00:11:35.400
All right, ready--
three, two, one.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.650
OK, so now there's maybe a
disagreement between A and C

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.420
now.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.418
All right, well,
nobody liked my root 2?

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.540
Maybe you saw me hesitate a
little bit before I wrote it.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.670
I was like, oh, let
me throw in a root.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:03.750
So indeed the flow rate
does not scale as the area.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.600
It only scales with a linear
dimension of this hole.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.264
This is weird, which is
why everybody says D.

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:12.930
And even after you've
done this problem,

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.320
you still think it's
D in your intuition.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.780
But you have to like pound
that intuition away from you.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.230
We'll try to understand
in multiple different ways

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.262
why this might be.

00:12:21.262 --> 00:12:22.720
But what I want to
do first is just

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.460
make sure that we understand
from dimensional analysis

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.970
why this has to be the case.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.730
Now, the first thing you need
to know for dimensional analysis

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.520
is the units of your answer.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.120
We're looking for
something that is

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.100
going to be units, some
number of molecules over time.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.080
Number-- there's no
units attached to that.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.400
So the answer is supposed
to be just 1 over time.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.210
Indeed, this is why
we needed something

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.390
that had some unit
of time somewhere

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.660
in order to get an answer
that could possibly do this.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.370
And indeed, we know that
the diffusion coefficient

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.130
has units of, for example,
microns squared per second.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.860
So it's a length
squared over time.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.942
Now, the one barrier
that people have

00:13:04.942 --> 00:13:06.650
to use dimensional
analysis is because we

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.760
have trouble remembering
what the units of things are.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.030
So if you don't
remember something

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.780
like the units of a
diffusion coefficient,

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.010
then what you have to do is
try to find some equation

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.100
in your brain where
that symbol is used.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.980
And of course it should be
the correct use of the symbol.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.590
So here this is
why I'm saying it.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.160
This is essentially
the definition

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.020
of this linear
diffusion coefficient.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.200
And from that,
you get the units.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.460
This is just very, very common.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.150
Something like viscosity,
impossible to remember what

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.390
the units of that thing are.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.550
But then you just have
equations in your brain

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.800
where the viscosity enters,
and you can figure it out.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.980
All right, so then
if you want to use

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.425
this dimensional analysis
study, just be very clear.

00:13:57.425 --> 00:13:59.050
Write down what all
the dimensions are.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.690
And then the answer just
comes screaming out at you

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.030
in general.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.100
Now, we see that we want
something 1 over time.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.790
There's only one
of these symbols

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.050
that has a time in there.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.050
So we know exactly how
the diffusion coefficient

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.710
has to enter.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.220
We know that the
flow is going to have

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.580
to be something
where we know that D

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.339
has to enter in there linearly.

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:23.880
Because if it was
any other way, then

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.910
the time would have
some weird units.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.875
It would be time
squared or square root

00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:30.020
of time or something.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:36.480
Now, it's true that we
could in principle dream up

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:44.300
something crazy between
concentration and the pore size

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.110
in the sense that
if we wanted to,

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:58.140
we could do c times-- we could
always add a c times a cubed

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.310
or something like that.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.790
But of course this is diffusion.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:06.100
What that means is that these
are non-interacting diffusing

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:06.660
molecules.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.690
That means that if we double
the number of the molecules

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.190
over on the right
hand side, we have

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.580
to double the flow rate in
this diffusion equation.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.266
And for diffusion,
these molecules

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:18.390
are not interacting at all.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.820
They don't see each other.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.945
And that means if you just
double the concentration

00:15:21.945 --> 00:15:25.360
on the right, you have
to double the flow rate.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.180
So that means we know that it
has to show up as a single c.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.620
And all we're left with is
going to be one unit of length

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.390
that we have to get rid of.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:43.540
Now, this is not, of course,
a rigorous definition.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.200
And does this have to be
actually an equal sign?

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.219
No, so what we can
actually say is that it

00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:50.510
has to be proportional to this.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.050
But actually just from
dimensional analysis

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.640
and this idea of,
say, superposition

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.050
of the concentrations,
you can get

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.830
something that's really kind
of a deep statement about how

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.110
diffusion is going to operate.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.531
Yes.

00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:11.530
AUDIENCE: It seems to me
that we can break that.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.093
There's this degeneracy.

00:16:13.093 --> 00:16:15.820
We can't quite sort out the
powers of c and a, right?

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.280
PROFESSOR: Right, so that's
what I was saying, that just

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:23.130
from the units alone, we could
always add a c times a cubed,

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.550
or to some power.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.790
And that's why I'm
saying that you

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.540
have to be able to invoke
this idea that if you

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.084
double the concentration
of the salt on the right,

00:16:34.084 --> 00:16:35.250
you'll double the flow rate.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.060
Because these are
non-interacting molecules.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.586
Because they're just
diffusing around in solution.

00:16:40.586 --> 00:16:43.574
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say that if we simply

00:16:43.574 --> 00:16:49.052
chose the measure of flow in
90 units of number of atoms,

00:16:49.052 --> 00:16:51.991
but in units of
mass per unit time,

00:16:51.991 --> 00:16:54.032
and concentration in units
of mass per unit time,

00:16:54.032 --> 00:17:00.008
then we would clearly see
what power of c it would be.

00:17:00.008 --> 00:17:02.498
And it would have to be 1.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.220
PROFESSOR: It's an
interesting-- I think

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.511
I'm going to disagree with you.

00:17:08.511 --> 00:17:15.170
But I want to make sure
that I-- so you want to say,

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.410
OK, you're entering.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:21.399
Yeah, the diffusion
coefficient is about what

00:17:21.399 --> 00:17:22.710
the molecule is doing.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.400
So I'm not sure how we're
going to-- if we measure

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.130
concentration in units
of, you're saying,

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:33.560
mgs per mil of some protein, or
so, then you're really saying

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.890
that there's some mass density.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:44.480
And I guess you can always
define diffusion coefficient,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.310
even from the standpoint
of-- because we don't even

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.570
need numbers.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.750
We can measure some
fluorescence or something

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.850
of how it diffuses across.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.995
So that doesn't require numbers.

00:17:56.995 --> 00:17:58.370
Yeah, I'm trying
to think if this

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.600
is going to end up being
different from the argument.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.368
I'd have to--

00:18:06.368 --> 00:18:08.422
AUDIENCE: If we put in
the number of molecules,

00:18:08.422 --> 00:18:10.880
then it's going to have to be
number of molecules per time.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.370
And then c has to be linear.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:18.780
Because c is number of
molecules per something, right?

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:24.770
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah, you could,
say, treat molecules as a unit.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.457
And then that also ends up
requiring that it's-- yeah, no,

00:18:28.457 --> 00:18:29.290
I think that's fair.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.750
But I'd have to think about
this, how it would play out

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.333
if you try to measure things in
terms of mass per unit volume.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.139
Of course, you should be able
to calculate this explicitly,

00:18:44.139 --> 00:18:46.680
and then also to figure out what
the proportionality constant

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.179
is.

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:50.130
But indeed, what you find
is that it scales linearly

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.429
with the radius instead
of as the area, which is,

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:53.470
I think, very surprising.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.320
Yes.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.422
AUDIENCE: We can also say D
scales with a squared times

00:18:59.422 --> 00:18:59.922
flow.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.160
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're saying
that maybe the concentration is

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.760
not relevant.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.080
AUDIENCE: If we look at it
that way, then the answer is D.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.730
PROFESSOR: OK,
what you're saying

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.899
is that maybe somehow
the flow is just equal

00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:38.690
to or proportional.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.530
It goes as D times a
squared in the sense

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:42.610
that you would say that--

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:43.800
AUDIENCE: Over.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.300
Over.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:54.698
PROFESSOR: Right, I think that
this non-interacting particle

00:19:54.698 --> 00:19:56.656
business really does tell
you that the flow has

00:19:56.656 --> 00:19:58.960
to be proportional
to the concentration.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.970
And yeah, I think that
is sufficient already.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.410
I agree that just from
units, you could do this.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:12.180
But I think, well, it's not
true, and it's nonsensical.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.226
And it's not proportional to c.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.160
Let's move on.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.447
But I think it's
important that it's

00:20:24.447 --> 00:20:26.280
possible to say something
that's a deep kind

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.050
of physical principle just
based on analysis of the units.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.580
And then, of
course, can somebody

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.310
offer the intuitive explanation
for why this might be?

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.168
Why is it that it goes as
a instead of a squared?

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.830
And this is a little bit weird
given the fact that we all

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.895
check our intuition,
we all say D.

00:20:49.895 --> 00:20:51.770
But the thing is, once
you know an answer,

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.240
you should still try to figure
out what the intuition might

00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:10.180
have been that you missed when
you originally said D. Yes.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.620
AUDIENCE: OK, this might
not make any sense.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.583
So say you would first think
it goes like a squared,

00:21:16.583 --> 00:21:18.124
because the area
goes like a squared.

00:21:18.124 --> 00:21:21.575
But then maybe the fact that
the perimeter grows like a,

00:21:21.575 --> 00:21:24.533
and the perimeter
adds drag, maybe that

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:28.491
would subtract from
or cancel out any--

00:21:28.491 --> 00:21:30.800
not necessarily make sense?

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:37.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well, OK,
so I don't think that's

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.087
the intuition that I would use.

00:21:39.087 --> 00:21:41.420
But then we have to figure
out, OK, what might be wrong?

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.520
Well first, I don't think
you can subtract an a.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:48.840
But also we haven't invoked
any actual drag in the sense

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.230
that there's no sense that the
perimeter should be-- right?

00:21:57.992 --> 00:21:59.450
All right, so this
is so mysterious

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:02.910
that we are-- that's fine.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.130
So the way that I like
to think about this

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:11.732
is that it's not that
we're shooting bullets

00:22:11.732 --> 00:22:12.440
at this membrane.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.100
If we were shooting
bullets, or if these

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.820
were raindrops
coming, then indeed

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.470
it would scale as the area.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.060
But because it's
diffusion, diffusion

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:27.500
operates on gradients
of concentration.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.380
And what's happening
here is that you

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.780
get a local depletion of the
concentration at the pore.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.699
So it's not the case that
you have concentration

00:22:37.699 --> 00:22:39.740
c all the way until you
get to the pore, and then

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.190
all of a sudden you have
a linear gradient of c

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.350
across that little pore,
but rather that you

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.590
have a depletion of
the concentration

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.510
as you approach the pore.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.070
And so as you grow
the pore, you're

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.450
somehow competing with yourself.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.110
Another way to
think about this is

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.151
to think about what happens
if we have two pores.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.560
For example, let's
imagine that we

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.320
have this poor here of size a.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.430
But now I'm going to add a
second pore over here far away,

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.960
same size.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:27.004
What should this do to the
total flow rate, A, B, C, D, E?

00:23:27.004 --> 00:23:29.170
I'll give you 10 seconds
to come up with an opinion.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.128
So I'm adding a
second pore far away.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.830
Ready?

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:47.470
Three, two, one-- all right,
so we're all agreeing.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.850
And this should be 2x, again.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.820
This is for two pores now.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.240
We also get 2x.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.630
This is because if the two pores
are far away from each other,

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.370
as relative to the
size of the pores,

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.610
then these are really
non-interacting in the sense

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.182
that there's none of
this depletion effect

00:24:11.182 --> 00:24:12.390
that I was telling you about.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.950
Whereas as we bring
these pores together,

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.010
then they start interfering
with each other.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:22.580
Because they each involve
some local depletion

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.560
of the concentration.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.290
And once that kind of depletion
area starts to overlap,

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.540
then the point is that
there is some molecule that

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.640
was diffusing.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.700
And if you have the pores
right next to each other,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.010
you're not going to
get twice the net flow.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.660
Because that molecule,
it might have

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.854
diffused through the other
pore even if it-- if one pore

00:24:43.854 --> 00:24:45.645
were not there, then
it might have diffused

00:24:45.645 --> 00:24:46.603
through the other pore.

00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:51.670
AUDIENCE: Can you
not think of it

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:55.630
as having to do with the fact
that under a random walk,

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.105
the displacement goes like
square root of the time?

00:24:58.105 --> 00:25:05.990
So if you increase the
number of molecules

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.715
going through by the
square of the perimeter,

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:12.060
then actually be like
total molecule displacement

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:17.300
through [INAUDIBLE]
will only go linearly

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.390
in that perimeter, which
would account for the fact

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.680
that molecule is
coming back across.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.170
PROFESSOR: Right, so it's true
that the molecules coming back

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.753
across you always
have to worry about.

00:25:25.753 --> 00:25:34.740
But I don't see this
argument actually necessarily

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.793
in my work.

00:25:35.793 --> 00:25:37.793
AUDIENCE: Maybe in the
case of, like [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:37.793 --> 00:25:38.740
which doubled in size.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.240
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.065
Yeah, I think that
it may be connected,

00:25:44.065 --> 00:25:47.220
although I'm not sure if
I'm sold on the argument.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.255
Yeah, I think it's a
little bit dangerous.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:25:59.950
Yeah.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.516
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned you appeal

00:26:01.516 --> 00:26:03.240
to some sort of
depletion with that.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.220
But if you just
punctured a hole in the--

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.530
PROFESSOR: OK, and
this is why there

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.210
is this question of timescale.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.970
Immediately after you
puncture the hole,

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.110
then the flow rate
will actually be

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.494
higher than it will be
at that steady state.

00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:21.830
AUDIENCE: So it's
going to be a squared.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right, I think
that the flow right after you

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:29.060
puncture it indeed will
scale as a squared.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.840
Because what you're
doing is you're

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.020
taking the number of
molecules across this area.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.730
And half of them are
going to come through.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.225
And there's just more
molecules in that area

00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:40.350
when you first puncture it.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:45.532
But that's going to equilibrate
in, whatever, a microsecond.

00:26:45.532 --> 00:26:46.490
That'll be really fast.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.650
Whereas in the steady
state flow rate,

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.020
that could go in
principle forever

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.445
if it's a large reservoir.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.210
OK, so I want to move on.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.640
But I want to make
sure that we understand

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.150
how this basic
principle allows us

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.930
to say some interesting things.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.380
For example, there's
a related problem,

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:15.468
which is, how much food
could a cell possibly eat?

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.410
And can somebody
say why there might

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.800
be an upper bound on this?

00:27:34.572 --> 00:27:35.988
AUDIENCE: There's
a point at which

00:27:35.988 --> 00:27:38.225
you get too many nutrients
inside of the cell.

00:27:38.225 --> 00:27:39.219
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:27:39.219 --> 00:27:40.875
AUDIENCE: There's
a point at which

00:27:40.875 --> 00:27:43.700
you get too many nutrients
inside of the cell.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.930
PROFESSOR: Oh no, this
is a super hungry cell.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:53.240
It can in principle be able to
use every glucose molecule that

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.292
came in.

00:27:54.292 --> 00:27:56.690
AUDIENCE: No, but I'm
saying that the osmosis

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.170
of the water coming in
would pop the membrane.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.150
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK, we're
talking about osmotic effects.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:08.630
OK, yeah, but we can
just say that it's

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.500
got a super tough cell wall.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.486
So it can take,
we'll say, infinite.

00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:16.360
I guess what I'm saying
is there's something.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.840
Even if I invoke such a
thing, there still is a limit.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.770
That's really what
I'm trying to say.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.356
AUDIENCE: The concentration
of the glucose inside the cell

00:28:25.356 --> 00:28:27.900
is a bit high.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.150
PROFESSOR: Well, the glucose
is going to get imported.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.150
And then it's going to
be immediately converted

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.060
into useful things.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.580
But then still there's a limit.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.513
There's a maximum.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:45.168
This is the maximum kind of
possible nutrient uptake.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.870
Yes.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.120
AUDIENCE: If the diffusion
is somewhat slow,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.110
or maybe there's
[INAUDIBLE] around the cell.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.240
PROFESSOR: OK,
right, so maybe it

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.370
could be somehow
diffusion limited.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.120
And what's the best that
a cell could possibly

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.390
do in this regard?

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.920
So here's a cell.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.810
And now maybe we will,
again, have it be radius a.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.200
So this is the cell of radius a.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.066
The best they can be,
how would you describe

00:29:23.066 --> 00:29:24.190
that relative to diffusion?

00:29:34.769 --> 00:29:38.203
AUDIENCE: Can you
be more specific?

00:29:38.203 --> 00:29:40.167
AUDIENCE: Everything
that [INAUDIBLE] membrane

00:29:40.167 --> 00:29:41.360
could be absorbed.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.360
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.630
So that's what I was-- so the
best that it could possibly be

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.995
is a perfect absorber.

00:29:47.995 --> 00:29:49.370
What we mean by
that is something

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:54.153
where the moment that a molecule
touches it, it gets imported.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.510
Now of course, a cell is
not a perfect absorber.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:06.110
But what's fascinating
is that even if it were,

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.860
then it does not
mean that it's going

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.286
to be consuming, say,
glucose at an infinite rate.

00:30:16.102 --> 00:30:17.920
And particularly,
we can ask, well,

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.720
if we have a situation
like this where

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.460
we have a cell, a sphere of
size a, it's a perfect absorber,

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:29.012
how will its uptake rate
scale with its size?

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.210
In particular, if
we double a, what

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.400
is it going to do for the flow?

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.212
All right, we're going to have
10 seconds to think about this.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.590
If we imagine a cell as a
perfect absorber, the moment

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:56.710
that this nutrient touches it,
it gets imported and chewed up.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.270
The question is, how does
that maximum uptake rate

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:05.909
change if I double the size of
the cell, double the radius?

00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:06.450
Are we ready?

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.515
OK, let's see where we are.

00:31:10.515 --> 00:31:11.015
Ready?

00:31:11.015 --> 00:31:14.700
Three, two, one.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:20.820
OK, so now it's a bit more of
a mixture of A's, C's, D's,

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.350
although it is a majority.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:28.900
We're getting a majority
C. And again, this

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.250
is, cell doubles size.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:37.020
And indeed, from the standpoint
of dimensional analysis,

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:42.230
this is the same problem as
that pore that we just did.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:45.436
Because again, it's diffusion.

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:46.569
We're interested in uptake.

00:31:46.569 --> 00:31:48.110
Now, it's not flow
across a membrane.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.370
But this is uptake
rate by the cell.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.100
It's going to be numbers
of molecules per unit time.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.880
Again, there's diffusion.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.440
The concentration
is still relevant.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.880
And so all the same
arguments apply.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:10.900
And indeed, this is, again,
proportional to the radius a.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:17.590
And remember, we're following
the convention of Purcell

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.610
and calling this a.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:24.700
Because Reynolds numbers is
an r, and then problems arise.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.930
Are there any questions about
why the argument is the same

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:29.935
here as it was there?

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:38.230
OK, now, there's something
interesting about this though,

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:46.350
which is that you can imagine
the fact that this only scales

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:50.240
as the radius of the cell
tells you that there's

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.490
some sense in
which we're wasting

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.040
an awful lot of
that surface area.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.040
Because we have this
large surface area.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.380
But it's not as good
as you would have

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.560
thought it would have been.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.220
And what that means
is in principle,

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:10.040
you could have a
smaller fraction

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:18.020
of the area covered by a bunch
of little pores or transporters

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.010
that are kind of analogous
to this situation

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.050
that we had before with the
salt crossing the membrane.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.810
And indeed, if you
just imagine that these

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:31.220
are each little absorbing
patches that are perhaps

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.640
one nanometer in
size, small, there's

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.400
an amusing calculation
you can do,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:42.930
which is you can ask, well, how
is it that the-- this is now

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:43.650
uptake rate.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.170
We want to know,
how is it that that

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:55.110
is going to change as a function
of the fraction of the surface

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:59.160
area that we have covered
with these transporters,

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.130
with these little perfectly
absorbing patches?

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:09.090
So we imagine the cell is
1 to 10 microns in size.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.670
Now we have a bunch
of these little pores

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.130
that we're going to go on.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:18.409
And of course, this is
going to saturate somewhere.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:20.000
And it's going to saturate.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.650
And as it turns out, this
goes as 4 pi D, I think.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.679
Yeah, so the uptake
rate is actually

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:31.679
equal to 4 pi cDa for a sphere.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.580
So this is the part that we
could not have figured out

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.710
from dimensional analysis.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.340
So indeed, the uptake rate,
once we get up to-- this

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.714
is a fraction that's covered.

00:34:40.714 --> 00:34:46.286
Once that's 1, indeed
it's going to be 4 pi cDa.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:56.130
Now, the question is, how
does it behave over here?

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.310
Now, you might have
thought that it would just

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:02.350
be some line like that.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:08.870
It's just the more of these
transporters that you have,

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.985
you just get a linear increase
in your total uptake rate.

00:35:13.985 --> 00:35:16.620
But it turns out
that that's not true.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.290
Because even at just
having, say, 1%,

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:25.500
roughly, of the surface
covered by this transporter,

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:32.441
you can get something like 50%
of the total maximal uptake

00:35:32.441 --> 00:35:32.940
rate.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.060
And that's because
these guys are not

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.605
competing with each other so
much, because they're far away.

00:35:37.605 --> 00:35:46.195
So this curve really looks
something like-- well, OK?

00:35:52.244 --> 00:35:54.160
Now, this is, I think,
especially interesting.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.820
Because a cell is not trying
to import just one thing.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.910
In principle, it's trying to
import many different things.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.290
So you need carbon sources.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.190
You need all sorts
of trace metals.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.247
You need nitrogen.

00:36:07.247 --> 00:36:09.330
So in principle, there are
many, many, many things

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.660
that a cell is trying to
get from the environment.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.512
And by simply having
different transporters

00:36:14.512 --> 00:36:16.220
specific to different
things-- all right,

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.870
so here are some squares
that uptake something else,

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:25.530
and little, I don't know,
triangles, whatever.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.480
So you can have many, many, many
of these different transporters

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.980
on the cell surface.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.460
And they're each
uptaking their own thing.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.420
And kind of
surprisingly, you can

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:39.530
get near optimal uptake rates
of many, many different things.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.210
I feel that I've lost you.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:49.310
Somebody ask a question.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:50.735
Yes.

00:36:50.735 --> 00:36:52.318
AUDIENCE: So this
[INAUDIBLE], is

00:36:52.318 --> 00:36:55.490
it really proportional to the
actual surface area covered?

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:57.690
PROFESSOR: Right, so
this initial thing,

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:01.130
this increases linearly
for small areas.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.860
Because just like
what we said before,

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.700
if you had these two little
holes in the membrane that

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.890
are far away from each other,
then they don't compete.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.019
What that means is that you do
get an initial linear increase

00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:13.519
here.

00:37:13.519 --> 00:37:15.475
AUDIENCE: But I guess
my question is sort of,

00:37:15.475 --> 00:37:18.409
how can we get that 50% of 1%?

00:37:18.409 --> 00:37:20.202
Is there a central
calculation that you can

00:37:20.202 --> 00:37:21.832
do to get that, or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.020
PROFESSOR: Oh no, we can do it.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:34.870
Because actually, I think that
the most straightforward way

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:39.650
to do this is to ask,
what is the absorbing rate

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:45.500
of a little patch, let's
say a circular patch?

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.905
And we already figured
out that when--

00:37:48.905 --> 00:37:50.560
so these are very
related problems,

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.070
as you can kind of see.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.860
I just don't remember
whether it's 2 pi

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.130
or if it's 4 pi for
that particular problem.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:12.590
Because this is some uptake
of a patch, we'll say.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:20.460
It's going to be either
1, 2 or 4 pi Dca.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:26.370
But there's some uptake
rate from each patch.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.726
But then that means just
that the uptake total

00:38:28.726 --> 00:38:31.465
for small numbers
is indeed just going

00:38:31.465 --> 00:38:33.780
to be equal to the
number of patches

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.440
or transporters times the
uptake rate of each one.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.910
Because they're just not
competing against each other.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:42.990
And the striking thing is that
because of this difference

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:45.670
in scaling between the
radius and the area,

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:50.040
this can give you a
lot of uptake rate

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.950
while only occupying a
small fraction of the area.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:39:01.620
This is a fraction
of area covered.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:09.620
Do you see why that
ends up being the case?

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.552
Yes.

00:39:10.552 --> 00:39:16.150
AUDIENCE: So that's also saying
that [INAUDIBLE] pretty soon.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:19.830
PROFESSOR: Well, it depends
on what you mean by soon.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.450
I mean, it's soon on the
scale of the amount of area.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.101
But it could be that you can
have 1,000 of them or so,

00:39:27.101 --> 00:39:27.600
right?

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.330
So the way I would
think about it

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:34.487
is that you don't
have to cover up

00:39:34.487 --> 00:39:36.070
very much of the
cell surface in order

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.864
to get really good
uptake kinetics.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.660
Now, these are some, say,
fundamental limits to the way

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.830
that bacteria, for
example, and other cells

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.810
can uptake food and
other nutrients.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:59.900
But from the
standpoint of trying

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.110
to find where the
nutrients are better,

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.000
what you need to
be able to do is

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.041
you need to be able to
measure the concentration.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:12.290
Now, the basic way that you
could, for example, measure

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:16.280
a concentration of something,
the best that you could do,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.170
is if you're a
perfect absorber, you

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:22.180
uptake molecules at this rate.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.720
And then you count the
number of molecules

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.790
that you uptake
over some time t.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:34.170
Indeed, the number that
you uptake over some time t

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.995
will just be given by this.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.405
What will be the distribution
of these numbers?

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.590
I should just have somewhere
up on the side always

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.410
a bunch of probability
distributions

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:04.172
that we can vote on.

00:41:04.172 --> 00:41:06.380
But think about it for a
moment, and then we'll vote.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.230
All right, ready?

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:22.630
Three, two, one.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.140
What is going to
be the probability

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:28.290
distribution of the number
of these things absorbed

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.057
over some time?

00:41:29.057 --> 00:41:30.890
Right, it's going to
be distributed Poisson.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.290
What is going to be the
distribution of times

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:44.180
between successive
absorption events?

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:44.680
Ready?

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.784
Three, two, one.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:55.307
All right, yeah, that is going
to end up being exponential.

00:41:55.307 --> 00:41:56.390
And this is all confusing.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.740
So this is a Poisson process.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.510
These things are occurring at
random times, at some rate.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.284
And if you have such a
process that's random,

00:42:04.284 --> 00:42:06.200
and you ask, how many
events over some time t,

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.230
that is the definition
of a Poisson.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:15.050
If this is a large number, then
the probability distribution

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.751
is going to look
like something else.

00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:18.000
What is it going to look like?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.555
Ready, three, two, one.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.410
Most people are
trying to find the D,

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:30.480
the central limit theorem there.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:35.120
What is going to determine the
resolution of that measurement

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.150
that we make?

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.920
So in some ways, what you
would like to know is, well,

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.600
what's the standard
deviation in your measurement

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:55.590
of the concentration divided
by the concentration?

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:57.565
So this is maybe
a fractional error

00:42:57.565 --> 00:42:59.273
in your measurement
of the concentration.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.960
Do you guys
understand why this is

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:15.590
the error in the measurement?

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:25.720
Well, this actually will go
as the standard deviation

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.150
in our measurement of the
number divided by the number

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:30.136
that we measure.

00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:35.216
What's going to be the standard
deviation of this number?

00:43:38.565 --> 00:43:39.642
AUDIENCE: The scale--

00:43:39.642 --> 00:43:40.600
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:44.110
PROFESSOR: The mean,
yeah, so it's close to--

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's the
square root of the mean number.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:52.120
What that means is that
this thing is going to be

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.510
the square root of a 4 pi cDaT.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:58.660
And this is just 4 pi cDaT.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.950
The number that
you measure here,

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.950
the number that you uptake
over some time period

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:24.908
t, that's going to be
distributed as a Poisson.

00:44:24.908 --> 00:44:26.340
And in a Poisson,
the variance is

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.380
equal to the mean, which means
the standard deviation, which

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.510
is the square root
of the variance.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:33.960
It's going to be this.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.758
Yes.

00:44:34.758 --> 00:44:36.924
AUDIENCE: I'm not understanding
the first step where

00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:39.080
you changed the c [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:45.170
PROFESSOR: Right, so from
the standpoint of the cell,

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:48.320
what the cell is doing is
it's counting the number

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.820
of these things that have come.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:56.350
And it's true that from
that number of, say,

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:59.770
molecules that are absorbed,
to get a concentration of units

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:04.400
of number per cubic
micron and whatnot,

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.630
the cell would need to
know kind of how big it

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:09.140
is, what the diffusion
coefficient is, and so forth.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.770
But in terms of the
fractional error,

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:15.700
those all end up disappearing.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.800
Because the fractional
error is telling us,

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.500
well, if this time I measure it,
and I get 10, and next time I

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:24.270
measure it I get 20,
then this is telling us

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:25.710
about how much error.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:27.870
This is indeed just
the fractional error

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:29.810
in our measurement
of the concentration,

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.747
and irrespective
of whether the cell

00:45:32.747 --> 00:45:35.960
is able to estimate
the concentration

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.010
units of a physical quantity.

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:46.000
Because that sort of error
would scale together.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.517
I'm worried that I'm
not helping you, though.

00:45:48.517 --> 00:45:50.767
AUDIENCE: So you're kind of
saying because c and n are

00:45:50.767 --> 00:45:53.175
linearly related, any
proportionality factors

00:45:53.175 --> 00:45:54.369
would cancel out.

00:45:54.369 --> 00:45:55.035
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:57.974 --> 00:45:59.432
AUDIENCE: Would I
be right to think

00:45:59.432 --> 00:46:04.736
that since n is distributed
as a Poisson, so is c?

00:46:04.736 --> 00:46:07.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
our estimate of c

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.960
would be-- because
ultimately, what the cell

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.970
would do is it would
measure some number.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.595
And then it would
say, all right, well,

00:46:14.595 --> 00:46:16.270
I multiply by all these things.

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:18.102
And then that
results in an error

00:46:18.102 --> 00:46:20.560
in c that is distributed in
the same way as the error in n.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.153
But they're kind of
proportional to each other.

00:46:23.153 --> 00:46:24.528
AUDIENCE: What
has me confused is

00:46:24.528 --> 00:46:28.610
I'm thinking that c is
Poisson distributed,

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:33.010
and then our original ratio
that we want, sigma of c over c,

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:41.446
should be 1 over square root of
c, because c is Poisson itself.

00:46:41.446 --> 00:46:43.340
But then that's different
from what we got.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.162
PROFESSOR: Sure, OK, I
think we have to be careful.

00:46:46.162 --> 00:46:48.850
So it's not that the c is
actually Poisson distributed.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:52.460
Because it's really that you
take a Poisson distribution

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.160
and multiply it by something
to get an estimate of c.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.050
But if you take a
Poisson distribution

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:00.459
and you multiply
the numbers by 10,

00:47:00.459 --> 00:47:02.250
then it's no longer a
Poisson distribution.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:05.130
Because the mean goes up
by 10, but the variance

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:06.500
goes up by 100.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.500
So then the variance no
longer equals the mean,

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.750
so it's not a Poisson anymore.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:13.130
So you can't just multiply a
number times a Poisson to get--

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.630
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:47:17.187 --> 00:47:18.770
PROFESSOR: And this
expression kind of

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:21.900
makes sense in that the
longer that the cell measures,

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.975
the less error there is.

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:26.560
If there's more
diffusion or higher

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.790
concentration-- less error.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:32.820
And this is really in
some ways some estimate

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.510
of the best the cell could do.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:38.490
And surprisingly, cells
can get close to this.

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:42.790
Now, this is a measurement
of the concentration

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:46.390
for a perfectly absorbing
sphere as a cell.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:50.960
Now, you might ask, well,
how would our error change

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.190
if instead of
absorbing the molecules

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.670
we simply had a detector?

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:59.280
So they just asked, OK, each
time that a molecule bounces

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.960
against my cell, I count one?

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.870
Do you understand
the difference?

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.335
So this is for a
perfect absorber.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:18.255
So what about a perfect monitor?

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.550
And the question there
is, does a perfect monitor

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:28.141
do better or worse than
a perfect detector?

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:39.030
So we'll say, better,
worse, or no change.

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:41.390
And it's of course
not possible for you

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:42.730
to actually do this calculation.

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:45.480
But it's useful to
imagine the situation

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:54.040
and make your best guess--
better, worse, and same.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.080
I'll give you 5, 10
seconds to think about it.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.280
Because it's interesting
to imagine the situation.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.686
All right, let's see where we
are-- ready, three, two, one.

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:25.425
Oh, we have a fair
range of answers.

00:49:25.425 --> 00:49:27.160
All right, I think
everybody agrees

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.480
it's going to do something.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.340
Because it would be
kind of a coincidence

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.860
if it didn't change things.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.810
Can I get somebody
to volunteer what

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.260
their neighbor is thinking?

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.468
I know you didn't actually
talk to your neighbor yet.

00:49:39.468 --> 00:49:41.012
But you can still invoke that.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.370
Yes.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:50.350
AUDIENCE: So I don't
know about this so much.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:53.132
But the first thing
I was thinking

00:49:53.132 --> 00:49:56.958
is that maybe this monitor
might be encountered on

00:49:56.958 --> 00:50:00.241
at a different rate
proportional to its area.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:07.364
It seemed like it wouldn't
change the concentration

00:50:07.364 --> 00:50:09.438
gradient, because it
wouldn't be subtracting any.

00:50:09.438 --> 00:50:11.188
And so then things
would bounce off of it,

00:50:11.188 --> 00:50:13.914
and that would be
proportional to its area.

00:50:13.914 --> 00:50:15.330
PROFESSOR: OK,
that's interesting.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:18.240
So you're arguing for
a different scaling.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.030
And then it would actually be
either-- depending on the area,

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:23.440
then it would be different.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.544
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so that
seemed weird to me,

00:50:25.544 --> 00:50:28.002
which is why I wanted to just
check where other people were

00:50:28.002 --> 00:50:29.005
on that.

00:50:29.005 --> 00:50:30.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
no, that's fair.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.210
That's fair.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:32.970
In the end, the
scaling is the same.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:36.880
Although this is very
complicated, confusing.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.661
Can I hear somebody else
argue for one or the other?

00:50:39.661 --> 00:50:41.160
Because he actually
argued for both.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.764
AUDIENCE: I just thought if it's
not taking up the molecules,

00:50:48.764 --> 00:50:52.033
then it could bounce against
the same molecule several times.

00:50:52.033 --> 00:50:54.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
therefore, so which

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.110
one are you arguing for?

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:56.949
AUDIENCE: For worse.

00:50:56.949 --> 00:50:58.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah, for worse, OK.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.517
Yeah, and indeed, it
does end up being worse.

00:51:00.517 --> 00:51:02.100
And it's actually
significantly worse.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:06.060
It's something like
10 times worse.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.660
And I think the intuitive
explanation is indeed

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:11.530
what you just said, that a
perfect monitor, that's great.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:13.707
Except for the fact that
it's counting every time

00:51:13.707 --> 00:51:14.540
that something hits.

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.640
But then it doesn't know if it
already counted that molecule

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.230
or not.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.510
So then there's
extra uncertainty

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:23.180
that results from that.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.810
Of course, ultimately, you have
to go and do the calculation

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:27.935
if you want to be convinced
of something like this.

00:51:27.935 --> 00:51:31.200
But indeed, the perfect
absorber is the best

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.430
that you can possibly do.

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:41.260
AUDIENCE: Unless it tagged
the molecule [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.270
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:44.150
Right, so that's equivalent
to being a perfect absorber,

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.650
right?

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:46.721
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:51:46.721 --> 00:51:48.729
Well, no, because then-- oh.

00:51:48.729 --> 00:51:51.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because these
are non-interacting molecules.

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:53.270
So if you tag it green,
then all that you

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.820
do is when the green
molecule comes back, you say,

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.950
I'm going to ignore that.

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:59.480
But then that's equivalent to
if you had just absorbed it.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.330
AUDIENCE: But there's
no local depletion.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there's
no local depletion.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.620
But because these are all
non-interacting particles,

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.610
then it can't make a difference.

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:12.290
And I agree that
this is confusing.

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:15.450
But I'm pretty confident
what I said is true.

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:17.200
Because since they're
all non-interacting,

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.610
there's just no more
information there.

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:20.345
Yeah.

00:52:20.345 --> 00:52:25.200
AUDIENCE: So what
exactly is the error?

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.146
PROFESSOR: Right,
OK, this is asking,

00:52:28.146 --> 00:52:30.520
over some period of time, I
count the number of molecules

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.720
that hit me or that I absorb,
and then I say, OK, well, I

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.215
think that I counted 20.

00:52:37.215 --> 00:52:38.590
And the question
is really, well,

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:44.100
if I did this again, how
close to 20 would I get?

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:49.820
Would I get, again, 20 or 21, or
would I next time get 10 or 50?

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.510
And that's the real question.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.640
How repeatable are
my measurements?

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:58.900
So if I plot a histogram
of a bunch of numbers

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:07.930
that I get over this time-- this
is the frequency that I observe

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:11.090
a particular number of molecules
over some period of time t.

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:12.410
I get some histogram.

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:14.170
And this is telling us about
the width of that histogram

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:15.044
relative to the mean.

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:23.450
Now let's imagine
that you're the cell,

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:25.900
and you calculated
the concentration

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.840
in a really wonderful way.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.670
Now, the question
is, do you know where

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:33.700
you should go to get more food?

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.200
No, right?

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.158
So you know the concentration
at your location.

00:53:36.158 --> 00:53:40.450
But what you need to know for
that purpose is a gradient.

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:42.920
And I'm trying to
remember, in this paper,

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.980
they maybe are
not very explicit.

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:48.320
Why is it that a
bacterial cell might

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.400
do this biased random walk
that's described in the paper

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.970
instead of just
measure the gradient?

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:57.574
Yeah.

00:53:57.574 --> 00:53:58.560
AUDIENCE: Because
cell size is so small.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
bacteria are just small,

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:03.380
I think this is the
argument that we often give.

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:07.530
And that's just saying that if
you want to measure a gradient,

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:10.930
then what you would do is, if
you have a sphere like this,

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:13.590
you might say, OK,
I'm going to count

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:16.007
the number of the molecules
that hit me over here,

00:54:16.007 --> 00:54:18.340
and I'm going to compare that
to the number of molecules

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.870
that hit me over there.

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:23.692
So you get two measurements
of concentration.

00:54:23.692 --> 00:54:26.650
But then in order to get a
gradient, what's relevant

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:30.630
is you have to look
at this distance.

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:33.740
And of course if you
have a bigger cell, then

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:35.810
a given gradient shows
up as a larger difference

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:37.970
in concentration, or
a large difference

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:40.430
in the number of molecules
that are going to hit the cell.

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:44.560
And does that scale linearly
or quadratically with a?

00:54:48.898 --> 00:54:49.870
AUDIENCE: Linearly?

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:53.540
PROFESSOR: Linearly--
difference in concentration

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:58.660
is going to be equal to the
size of the cell, maybe 2a,

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:01.810
times dc/dx.

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:04.450
So there's some gradient
that's out there.

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:08.680
And then so we get a linear
amplification of our signal

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.640
based on the size of the cell.

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.860
So if you look at
many eukaryotic cells,

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.930
for example Dicty and
others, they indeed

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:19.210
often do this direct
gradient measurement.

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:23.226
And then from that,
they decide where to go.

00:55:23.226 --> 00:55:24.600
Bacteria, on the
other hand, they

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.370
do this other thing that's
described in the paper where

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:29.800
they have a biased random walk.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.258
We're going to be talking much
more about this and the gene

00:55:32.258 --> 00:55:34.510
network that allows cells
to do it on Tuesday.

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:36.380
But the basic idea
is that the bacteria,

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:39.480
they're swimming in
some random direction.

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.800
And then instead of directly
measuring the concentration

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.860
as dc/dx, which you might
do as a eukaryotic cell,

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.950
instead what they measure is
the change in concentration

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:53.500
with respect to time.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.580
Because they are moving.

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:55.880
So they ask, are
things getting better?

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.060
Are they getting worse?

00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:59.350
If things are getting
better, you keep on going.

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:00.891
If things are getting
worse, then you

00:56:00.891 --> 00:56:04.120
randomize your direction,
and you try again.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.460
And this implements
a biased random walk.

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.070
We'll talk about the
decision making circuit

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:12.730
in the cell that allows
it to do that on Tuesday.

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:17.260
But that's the
basic notion there.

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:19.350
And can someone
remind us, how long

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:22.636
is a typical run for E. coli?

00:56:22.636 --> 00:56:25.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:28.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
maybe 30 microns.

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:42.420
So there's this idea
that a cell might

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.170
go like this for 30 microns.

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:47.740
And it takes about a
second for it to do that.

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.810
But then that's a run.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:53.730
But then it'll engage in
some random tumble that

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:56.840
leads it to go some
other direction, and then

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.730
another tumble, and then it kind
of goes a different direction,

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:02.210
and so forth.

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:04.345
So these are runs and tumbles.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:12.760
Now, the nice thing
here is that you

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.850
can see that to measure this
concentration over here,

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:19.880
the change of concentration
across the cell

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:22.860
went as a, which might only be
1 or 2 microns, whereas here

00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.910
now the E. coli can measure
a change in a concentration

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:28.170
over tens of microns.

00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:31.330
So it's in some ways like a
longer antenna that allows it

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:32.650
to pick up the signal better.

00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:40.580
There's a comment
about what happens here

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:45.790
in the sense that if you
imagine you have a cell,

00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:51.290
it's a few microns in size,
flagella is pushing it,

00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:56.140
it's going at 30
microns per second.

00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:59.420
The question is,
if at some time it

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:05.537
stops spinning its flagellum,
how far will it coast?

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.400
And this is after
stopping swimming.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:32.653
OK, so we'll do an approximate,
so 10 micron maybe.

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:55.146
How many microns does a cell
coast after it stops swimming?

00:58:55.146 --> 00:58:57.020
AUDIENCE: This is
a bacterial cell?

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.720
PROFESSOR: This is
a bacterial cell.

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:04.060
This is E. coli, and this is,
we'll say, 3 microns in size.

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:15.290
Ready-- three, two, one.

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:18.790
All right, OK, so everybody
says-- and is this actually the

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:19.619
right answer?

00:59:19.619 --> 00:59:20.160
AUDIENCE: No.

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.450
PROFESSOR: No, it's not.

00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:24.710
So this is the
closest, it's true.

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:26.450
But none of these
things are true.

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:28.546
So how far does it coast?

00:59:28.546 --> 00:59:30.300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:35.240
PROFESSOR: Right, yeah, so
it's some ridiculous-- I mean,

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.450
and this is really,
really weird.

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:41.660
This guy-- 30 microns a second.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.980
So this is 10 times its
body length every second.

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:47.710
It's really shooting along.

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:51.610
But the moment that it stops
swimming, it stops moving.

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:54.090
So it's none of these things.

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:57.350
It was 1 angstrom or
less than an angstrom?

00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:58.770
AUDIENCE: 0.1.

00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:04.180
PROFESSOR: OK, 0.1
angstroms, which this is

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.688
10 to the minus five microns.

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:13.800
OK, so it's orders
of magnitude smaller

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.590
than you would ever imagine.

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:19.600
And that's because our intuition
comes from kind of our length

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.090
scales where if I were
swimming this fast,

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:27.070
I would keep on drifting
after I stopped swimming.

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:30.410
But that's not the world
that bacteria live in.

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:32.846
And that's because of
the low Reynolds number.

01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:41.990
The Reynolds number is
much, much less than 1.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:43.900
So this thing is the
dimensionless number

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.410
that quantifies the relative
importance of inertial forces

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.400
to viscous forces.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.070
Now there was some
discussion of the Reynolds

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:56.830
number in your reading.

01:00:56.830 --> 01:01:00.780
I maybe won't get into
too much detail about it.

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.890
But what I'll say
is that if anybody

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:05.370
wants to talk about a way of
thinking about the Reynolds

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.310
number, maybe you can
ask me after class,

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:12.670
and I can explain to you why
this weird expression can

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:18.160
be thought of as the ratio of
the inertial to viscous forces.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.410
But I want to think
a little bit more

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:26.070
about the strategy that
these cells are following,

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:33.780
which is, why is it that a
run is of the length scale

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.300
that it is?

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.710
In particular, why
not go further?

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:44.110
We already said that its
ability to measure concentration

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:47.570
is somehow-- if you did
a direct measurement,

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.670
it would scale with
the size of the cell.

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:53.300
In this case, it sort of scales
like the length of the run.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.680
So why not run for
10 times longer,

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.930
100 times longer, so you can
get a really good measurement

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:02.430
of a gradient?

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:04.430
AUDIENCE: Because if
you're going the wrong way,

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.384
then you'd go 10 times longer.

01:02:06.384 --> 01:02:07.800
PROFESSOR: OK, so
it could be just

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.780
if you're going the wrong way.

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.154
Although then we
could maybe even

01:02:10.154 --> 01:02:12.462
be just more sensitive in that.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:14.170
Because what's striking
is that even when

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:17.460
it's going in the right
direction, it still tumbles.

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.170
The difference between
the run lengths

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.120
and the correct and incorrect
directions are kind of modest,

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:23.900
I guess.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.290
So maybe we could come up
with a different strategy

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:27.748
where we say, all
right, well, if I

01:02:27.748 --> 01:02:30.160
feel like things are getting
worse, I'll tumble quickly.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.910
But if I feel like
things are going great,

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:35.667
maybe then I'll go in
the same direction,

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:37.500
and I'll measure that
gradient really finely

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.522
so I can get precisely
the right direction.

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.680
So I guess the
question is, is there

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.690
anything that's going
to limit how useful it

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:51.680
is to go swimming, even in a
good direction, in principle?

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.648
Yeah.

01:02:52.648 --> 01:02:57.488
AUDIENCE: So it's so small that
collision with actual molecules

01:02:57.488 --> 01:02:59.908
can randomize its
direction as it goes along,

01:02:59.908 --> 01:03:02.640
and it sort of loses memory.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.730
PROFESSOR: And this is a weird
thing, that not only does

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:10.180
diffusion act kind of in a
linear sense on the center

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.540
of mass position of
an object, but it also

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:17.180
acts rotationally, which means
that the cell and other objects

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:22.910
in liquid lose their
orientational order.

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:24.730
What that means is that
if this cell starts

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.484
swimming in one
direction, it's actually

01:03:26.484 --> 01:03:27.900
the case that after
a few seconds,

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.200
it forgets where it was going.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.080
So you can't actually
collect information

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.670
about the gradient
in that direction,

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:36.920
because you're actually going
in a different direction

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.940
from what you were
a few seconds ago.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.900
This is actually a
pretty tough limitation

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.265
that these cells are facing.

01:03:43.265 --> 01:03:45.390
On the one hand, they're
small, so it's really hard

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:46.360
to measure gradients.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.580
On the other hand,
every few seconds,

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.520
they get turned around.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.330
And if you imagine
trying to navigate

01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:55.460
in that kind of situation,
it would be pretty hard.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.440
Now, I want to make sure that
we understand how to figure out

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.815
what the timescale is that this
orientational order is lost in.

01:04:04.815 --> 01:04:06.940
And again, we're going to
use dimensional analysis,

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:08.520
because I love it.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.230
And I can tell that you
guys are big fans as well.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:21.749
OK, so I will tell you
something that hopefully--

01:04:21.749 --> 01:04:23.040
how much do I want to tell you?

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.580
What I'll tell you is
this, that the diffusion

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:42.220
coefficient for
angular fluctuations

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.380
is defined just the way it
is for diffusion coefficient

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.956
for the center of mass.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.680
Given that, the question is,
if I have a sphere-- again,

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:06.560
size a-- now I want to know,
how does the typical correlation

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:17.900
time, the time to randomize,
randomize orientation,

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.610
how does it scale
with the radius?

01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:34.180
So it could be that
this timescale tau

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.452
could go a to the 0.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.121
And you should be
starting to think.

01:06:36.346 --> 01:06:38.268
All right, do you
need more time?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.480
All right, why don't we go
and see where the group is.

01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:32.570
And it's OK if you've
not figured it out.

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.960
Make your best guess.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.840
Ready-- three, two, one.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:47.020
OK, so I'd say it might
be a slight majority B.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:51.860
But then actually there are
fair numbers spread around.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.960
Yeah, there's A, B,
C's, D's, and E's.

01:07:57.645 --> 01:08:00.750
All right, maybe I'll
give you a minute

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:01.810
to talk to your neighbor.

01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:06.030
And I'm just going to give
you an extra hint, which

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:09.310
is it's good to look at
the units of the diffusion

01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:13.167
coefficient, which is why
I wrote this equation.

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:20.350
Yes, no?

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:21.147
You did that.

01:08:21.147 --> 01:08:24.712
You're like, that's what we did.

01:08:24.712 --> 01:08:26.170
Well, I'll give
you another minute.

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:29.290
Because I think that it's
important to work through this

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:31.568
at least some way mentally.

01:08:31.568 --> 01:08:34.600
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:09:57.154 --> 01:09:59.570
PROFESSOR: All right, why don't
we go ahead and reconvene.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:04.910
I know that you may not have had
time to fully converge on this.

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:09.560
But it turns out that this
actually goes as a cubed.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.480
AUDIENCE: Oh, no one
would have guessed that.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.379
Come on.

01:10:13.379 --> 01:10:16.340
PROFESSOR: He's so upset.

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.260
It's the first sphere, yeah.

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.610
It's a sphere.

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:22.296
AUDIENCE: So it's not a ball.

[LAUGHING]

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.783
PROFESSOR: I don't
know what to say.

01:10:27.783 --> 01:10:28.908
AUDIENCE: Where's the mass?

01:10:28.908 --> 01:10:31.830
Is the mass on the surface,
or is the mass in the middle?

01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:34.270
Does it make a difference?

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:35.570
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:42.480
We're in the low
Reynolds number regime.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.460
So what that means
is that this is all

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.570
dominated by the interactions
between the object

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:50.030
and the fluid.

01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:55.380
So it actually doesn't
enter into-- yeah,

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.630
mass is irrelevant.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.230
So it doesn't scale.

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:02.430
That would've been a
fine question as well.

01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:07.600
So a cubed, all
right, this is weird.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.842
Now, of course you
can think about things

01:11:09.842 --> 01:11:10.800
in many different ways.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.240
But the thing that
you can see maybe

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:21.236
is that before, for the sort of
linear diffusion, so D linear

01:11:21.236 --> 01:11:22.610
with respect to
time, you can see

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:25.240
that the difference in units
between these two diffusion

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:30.410
coefficients is a
factor of-- there's

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:34.210
a length squared difference
between those two.

01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:38.070
And it's that length
squared that turns

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:42.720
this linear dependence of a
for normal linear diffusion

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.520
up to an a cubed.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.550
Now, of course there
are other things

01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:49.290
we can write down
that may be useful.

01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:52.530
So remember this
D linear, Einstein

01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:56.960
told us this is kT
over gamma linear.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.770
So this is if we try to move it.

01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:01.460
This tells us how
hard we have to push

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:02.770
to get something to move.

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:08.600
So this is if you apply force,
then gamma linear tells you

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:15.140
how fast it will move in this
low Reynolds number regime.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:18.220
Now, there's a similar set of
things that we can say here.

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:20.675
I'm going to erase this.

01:12:20.675 --> 01:12:22.050
So we can still
say it's actually

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:23.810
Einstein is just always right.

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:27.320
So the D rotational
again is going to be kT.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.860
Now this is a gamma rotational.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:33.059
But instead of thinking about
forces, now this is torques.

01:12:33.059 --> 01:12:35.350
So what's relevant is that
if you apply-- oh, I already

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:38.470
used a tau.

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:40.640
OK, I'll just say, torque.

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.540
So if you apply torque, on,
say, a sphere, or this object,

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:48.860
then this will cause
an angular velocity,

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:52.663
so gamma rotational times
some omega around it.

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:06.740
Now, for concreteness,
if you have a sphere,

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:13.050
Stokes' drag tells us
this is 6 pi eta a times

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:16.170
v. So this thing tells
us how hard we have

01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:18.670
to push an object in
order to make it move

01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:20.046
some velocity if it's a sphere.

01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:30.360
Whereas the gamma
rotational here,

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:37.430
this ends up being 8
pi eta a cubed omega.

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:39.925
So the gamma rotational
ends up being that.

01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:50.000
So you can see that in terms
of rotational diffusion,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.340
rotational order, objects
scale-- what do I want to say?

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.090
The scaling is slower than
you would expect somehow.

01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:02.410
Well, the scaling here is
larger than you would expect,

01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:04.826
whereas the scaling here is
smaller than you would expect.

01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:10.219
Yes.

01:14:10.219 --> 01:14:11.760
AUDIENCE: Would this
be any different

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.530
for a bar-shaped bacteria?

01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:15.600
PROFESSOR: Yes, it's
always different,

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.790
but not by very much.

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:21.280
So for example, this
thing, the Stokes' drag,

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.190
is only true for a sphere.

01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:25.980
But this linear
dependence on a is

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:27.230
true for any of these objects.

01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:29.590
So it's really that a is
some typical length scale.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.560
And in particular, it's
actually the larger

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.890
of the two length scales.

01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:38.457
So for example, if you take
a long kind of cylinder,

01:14:38.457 --> 01:14:49.902
pipe, now you can ask, well,
now it's not isotropic anymore.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:52.110
So there's going to actually
be two different gammas.

01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:55.520
There's going to be a gamma
that we might call parallel

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.540
if you want to push
it in this direction,

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.146
and a gamma
perpendicular if you want

01:14:59.146 --> 01:15:01.570
to push it in this direction.

01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:05.130
What's fascinating is that if
this is something that's, say,

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:09.480
a nanometer in size
here but a micron here,

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.280
so an aspect ratio
of 1,000 to 1.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.400
Still the difference between
gamma parallel and gamma

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:19.700
perpendicular is still
just a factor of two or so.

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:22.070
Because in both cases, it's
dominated by the longest

01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:23.360
linear dimension.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:30.210
So what's relevant is
this big thing, length.

01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:34.750
So this is, again, an aspect
of the surprising nature

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:36.890
of the low Reynolds
number regime.

01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:42.070
This is not true if you were a
skydiver or something, right?

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:45.120
But the reason is that this
longest dimension kind of

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.470
tells you how much water you're
going to be pulling with you.

01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:50.950
What's relevant is not
the cross sectional area

01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:52.140
that you're kind of pushing.

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:54.510
But rather it's
telling you how much

01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:58.138
fluid are you kind of disturbing
along the whole length.

01:16:04.536 --> 01:16:07.430
Are there any questions
about what I mean by this?

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:12.659
Yes.

01:16:12.659 --> 01:16:16.491
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
[INAUDIBLE] because the flow

01:16:16.491 --> 01:16:19.844
is one different time.

01:16:19.844 --> 01:16:22.240
So you're asking
about the time--

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.910
PROFESSOR: OK, so you're
wondering how I actually

01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:26.246
get to a time from this.

01:16:26.246 --> 01:16:28.120
Yeah, OK, sorry, I should
have finished this.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.180
So let me just show
you what I meant.

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.980
So one way to
think about this is

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:37.950
we know that this
is where we start.

01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:40.560
And what you could say
is, well, the typical time

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.290
to randomize, that's when
we've gone to enough time

01:16:43.290 --> 01:16:47.420
so that change of theta squared
is, say, of order radian

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.390
squared.

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:49.910
So it's enough
that that's sort of

01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:51.867
a characteristic reorientation.

01:16:51.867 --> 01:16:53.450
So you just say, OK,
well, we're going

01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:55.060
to set this equal to around 1.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:17:01.095
So 2Dr times this reorientation
time tau will be around 1.

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:07.070
So that gives us that
the reorientation time

01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:11.600
is going to be around-- so we
have 1/2, and then D rotation.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:21.480
Now we have 8 pi
eta a cubed over kT.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:26.880
Is that kT, yeah?

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.836
And actually in units-- so I
grew up in the single molecule

01:17:29.836 --> 01:17:31.960
world where everything was
in units of piconewtons,

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.290
nanometers, and seconds.

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:36.490
And in those units,
we could actually

01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:39.890
write, OK, we have a 4 pi.

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:43.160
kT is actually 4.1
piconewton nanometers.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.160
So it's around 4 in these units.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:49.520
And then eta is actually 10
to the minus 9 in those units.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:54.200
a, for a bacteria,
is around a micron.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.100
So it's 1,000.

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.490
But this is piconewton
nanometer second units.

01:17:57.490 --> 01:18:01.680
So we have to do
10 to the 3 cubed.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:05.240
Because a micron is 10
to the 3 nanometers.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.930
And conveniently, 10 to the 3
to the third, 10 to the minus 9,

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:10.250
we can just cross these out.

01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:11.975
We can cross the 4's out.

01:18:11.975 --> 01:18:13.912
All right, so we get pi seconds.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.870
Should we take the pi seriously?

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:22.310
No.

01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:26.482
But the point is that it's
of order 1 to 10 seconds.

01:18:26.482 --> 01:18:28.690
This is what you get from
such a back of the envelope

01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:29.330
calculation.

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.121
But this is saying that
from the standpoint

01:18:31.121 --> 01:18:33.714
of the bacterial
cell, it starts going.

01:18:33.714 --> 01:18:35.880
And it forgets which direction
it started going over

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.700
the timescale of a few seconds.

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:40.332
So it's not worth
it for the cell

01:18:40.332 --> 01:18:42.290
to actually have a run
that's longer than that.

01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:44.495
Because it will have
lost its way anyways.

01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:54.740
All right, what we're
going to do on Tuesday

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.760
is we're going to try
to understand something

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.440
about how bacteria use this
combination of runs and tumbles

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.040
in order to perform
these exquisitely

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.807
sensitive kind of travels
to find food sources.

01:19:06.807 --> 01:19:09.390
If you have any questions about
anything that we talked about,

01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:11.540
please come on up.

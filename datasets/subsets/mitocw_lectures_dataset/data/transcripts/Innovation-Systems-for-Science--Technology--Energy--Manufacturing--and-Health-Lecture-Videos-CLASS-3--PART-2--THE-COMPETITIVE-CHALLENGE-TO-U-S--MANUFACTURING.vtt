00:00:20.902 --> 00:00:23.110
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All
right, let's jump ahead here.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.259
Let me talk a little bit about
manufacturing in general,

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.990
and the competitive challenge
for US manufacturing.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.830
So the 1990s, manufacturing
was 30% of US economic growth.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.720
And it had manufacturing at
two times the productivity

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.040
level of the services sector.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.890
So manufacturing
almost invariably

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.800
has a much higher productivity
level than a services sector.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.060
US is 80% services.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.760
So if you really want a
high productivity growth,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.750
manufacturing is a
way of scaling goods

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.623
and affect product quickly.

00:01:06.623 --> 00:01:09.040
Service sector scale much more
slowly because they're more

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.440
face-to-face.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.780
So you probably want a
significant component

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.730
of your economy in something
that scales and it introduces

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.170
productivity effectively.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.910
And that tends to
be manufacturing.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.040
So manufacturing is also
traditionally higher

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.510
paying jobs.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.380
In 2001, they were 23% higher
than the services sector.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.660
The ratio is not all
that different today.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.520
Manufacturing is an important
part of the US economy.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:49.605
It's about 12% of GDP, and it
funds 2/3 of industrial R&D.

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:53.420
It funds 3/4 of industrial
research and development,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.090
and about 2/3 of overall US R&D.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.330
And manufacturing firms account
for a greater percentage

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.509
of real GDP than all these
other kinds of sectors.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.810
So it remains a very
significant player,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.440
but it's also a big enabler
for the other sectors.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.780
So manufacturing jobs--
and there's a lot of debate

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.240
as to what the multiplier is--

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.020
differs from sector to sector,
but it is the biggest job

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.430
multiplier in our economy.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.710
In other words, a
manufacturing job

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.888
tends to create
additional employment

00:02:28.888 --> 00:02:30.430
in the kind of value
chains that it's

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.220
connected with in the
services sector, and supplier

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.790
sector, and resource sectors.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:46.120
So the US has been running
frightening trade deficits

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.660
in manufactured goods for a
significant period of time.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.560
And it began under
President Nixon,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.915
and has continued
to grow since then.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:04.780
The most problematic
number is the trade deficit

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.750
the US has in advanced
manufacturing goods--

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.590
in other words, complex
high-value goods.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.070
The US is running $100 billion
trade deficit in those goods.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.780
So the theory that we'd
seed low-end production

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.862
but make it up by retaining
high-end production,

00:03:22.862 --> 00:03:23.570
it's not working.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.480
And manufacturing job loss
has a pretty painful history.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.060
2.7 million jobs were lost in
that 2000 and 2003 recession--

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.290
5.8 million jobs
between 2000 and 2010,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.890
the majority of those focused
on that 2008 recession.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.790
In that 2000 to
2010 timetable, we

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.950
shut down about
62,000 factories net.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.600
The US has been moving its
percentage of manufacturing

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.310
employment ever downward.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.220
So we're at about
8% of US employment

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.080
is in the manufacturing sector.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.640
Other countries don't do that.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.020
So Germany employs about 20% of
its workforce in manufacturing,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.089
Italy 19%, Japan
22%, South Korea 31%.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.790
In other words, manufacturing
is a source of higher wages

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.670
and it's a job multiplier.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.453
You can see some of the
potential competitive

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:28.620
advantages for retaining a
substantial manufacturing

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.625
sector.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:32.250
So those are kind of
background points.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.660
Let me do a couple
of pieces now.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.210
I'll do Glenn Fong
and Linsu Kim.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.700
So Glenn teaches at
Thunderbird in Arizona,

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.855
which is a very fine school
for international business.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.840
And he wrote a
piece in '98 about

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.610
what was happening in
Japan in that time period.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.210
So Japan is on a complete
take-off as a leading world

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.930
economy until the 1990
frame, and then it

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.610
misses the IT innovation
wave, as we discussed earlier.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.670
And it starts to have to
reorganize and rethink

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.740
its innovation system.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.280
So Glenn argues that
there are essentially

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.780
three historical stages to
Japan's competitive pattern.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.720
So first, it was the
pursuer after the pioneer--

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.040
the US being the
innovation pioneer--

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.900
then it's a follower right
at the frontier with US,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.420
and then it becomes a
world-class competitor.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.600
And he argues that,
as Japan became

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.780
a world-class competitor,
it had to rethink

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.300
its more centralized
organization

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.920
of its innovations.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.680
So the old thesis about
Japan, Glenn argues,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.360
is that it was focused on
national industrial performance

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.420
and a corresponding competitive
balance between nations

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.180
based on national
industrial performance.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.510
And it was set by political
economies really operating

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.880
at the national scale, but
at the governmental scale

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.330
with a strong governmental role.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.910
But then a more pragmatic
approach has to evolve.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.900
So MITI, which I
mentioned earlier,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.270
was the key
organizing institution

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.250
around getting collaboration
between government

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.080
and industry, and setting
industry agendas in Japan.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.980
In its older period, it would
set technology initiatives

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.030
that were selected by
high-level governmental leaders,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.550
including at MITI.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.910
And then in a more
recent period,

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.820
it's had to move towards
technology initiatives that are

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.830
really selected by industry.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.720
In other words, at the
frontier, the ability

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.130
of government to pick
the technology menu

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.780
becomes more problematic.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.550
You've got to get that down to
industry decision makers that

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.050
are much closer to markets and
much closer to the innovation

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.470
system itself.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.960
And that has evolved in Japan,
that high officials just

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.690
can't keep an eye on the rapidly
evolving complex technologies.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.180
So that's technology
initiatives.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.830
Then there was
technology targeting.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.210
In the old period, there was
direct government targeting

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.220
of one or two
specific technologies

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.100
that we're going to be
pursued by the government.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.650
And the funding was at the
late development stages.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.700
Government funding was focused
really on advanced prototyping

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.930
and engineering development.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.070
That's where the government
support was going.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.540
In the newer period,
Japan shifted

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:05.070
towards more fundamental
research funding, along

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.910
with it's applied, to put a
broader range of technology

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.670
alternatives onto the table.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.590
As Glenn characterized
it, it moved

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:19.370
to a kind of shotgun approach,
not a more narrow rifle shot

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.640
approach.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.150
And then finally,
industry targeting.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.460
In the older period,
MITI would actually

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.220
pick winning companies.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.500
It would decide who's
going to win, designating

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.080
specific companies for funding.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.830
And it would attempt to
influence corporate mergers

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.230
and consolidations to
develop strong companies.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.970
So it's intervening
at the company

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.520
stage pretty systematically
at critical areas.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.490
In the newer period, MITI
became much more collaborative.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.570
And it's funding a
range of companies

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.550
and a range of
collaboration models,

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.630
not attempting to target
particular surviving firms that

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.370
are winners.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.170
So in the computing
area, for example,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.740
MITI goes from funding three
firms over a 30-year period

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.700
to 25 firms at the
end of that period.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.430
So it's moving
towards a system that

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:23.340
is less centralized
and more reflective

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.990
of the industry
leadership, and away

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.740
from an interventionist
government role.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.990
So that's kind of interesting.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:37.803
Japan gets to the
innovation frontier

00:09:37.803 --> 00:09:39.470
through a significant
governmental role.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.590
But when it's at the
frontier and it's truly

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.730
a world-class
competitor, it's got

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.370
to develop a much more
decentralized approach that

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.790
allows ideas to rise
up from that system.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.590
So that may be an important
organizational model for us

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.248
to consider.

00:09:55.248 --> 00:09:56.790
That organizational
model, of course,

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.560
is more like what the US had on.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.700
Now, let me put Linsu
Kim into this mix too.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.500
And his book Imitation
to Innovation

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:15.950
is a classic in looking
at the amazing evolution

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.042
of Korean economy.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.690
The thing to understand
about the Korean economy

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:33.150
is that the country was just
totally destroyed and ruined

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.010
by the Korean War.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.070
And every inch of
that nation was

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:43.500
fought over a multi-year period,
and nothing was left standing.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.280
It's a complete tragedy,
and the population

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.450
is completely disrupted.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:53.430
It's forced to move
all about the country.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.840
Families are disrupted.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.240
Communities and villages
are completely disrupted.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:04.350
It's all thrown together,
and it's truly tragic.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.170
And yet out of
that tragedy is one

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:12.900
of the most remarkable
stories of industry scale up

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.050
and growth, and growth
of the country that--

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.330
it's an amazing story.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.640
And essentially, in
a 30-year period,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.000
to construct an economy out
of literally nothing that's

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.960
right at the frontier,
it's pretty amazing.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.540
So what's behind this?

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.380
So in the 1960s
period, Linsu Kim

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.230
argues that Korean
firms are on a-- what he

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.540
calls a leadership trajectory.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:45.090
And the government is on a model
of what he calls forced march

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.170
industrialization.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.690
The government is supplying
education through college.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.250
On the demand
side, it's creating

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.140
chebols, which are somewhat
akin to the keiretsu model we

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.916
were talking about in Japan.

00:11:54.916 --> 00:11:58.930
In other words, these are
major industry leaders.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:05.040
And the difficulty in this mix,
in the government of the time,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.380
was its corruption.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.160
And this is--

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.180
Korea's is still in the hands of
a dictatorship with corruption

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.230
problems.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.670
And problem with
corruption is it

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.310
creates tremendous
uncertainty in your business.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.340
That was kind of a
difficult factor,

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.680
but nonetheless, the government
was playing a key role

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.130
in pushing these major
companies on a march

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.670
to a strong international role.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.170
AUDIENCE: Could you
clarify what you

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.050
mean by corruption creates
tremendous business

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.503
uncertainty?

00:12:43.503 --> 00:12:45.170
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
You're not competing

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:49.190
with other firms based
upon your superior products

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.430
and your superior
ability to manufacture.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.610
Suddenly, a wild card
is thrown into the mix

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.870
and you've got to cope
with the government,

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.910
and buying off the government,
and buying government support,

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.560
if you want to stay ahead.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.060
So it creates a whole new
variable that's much less--

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.090
that can't be managed by your
business processes and systems.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:20.360
So that's why when we read
the World Economic Report,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.980
that's why corruption
was actually

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.710
one of the factors
that was considered

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.870
in the strength of your
economy because it can

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.620
be so disruptive of the ability
to have a reasonable and fair

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.240
competition system.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.080
So the chebols, to go back to
our discussion-- that chebols

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.170
were key to building
and capturing

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.300
these large-scale industries.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.130
Now, Korea, when creates
these major companies that

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.550
dominate industrial
sectors, they

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.080
tend to block entry by small
and medium-sized enterprises.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.880
So Korea, at the
same time, is not

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.980
creating a system of strong,
small, and midsized firms.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.790
It's really focused on
creating these big chebols that

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.930
can really function in
international marketplaces.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.970
But that, in turn, can
create inefficiencies,

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.330
as well, Kim argues.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.465
In education, Korea hit on a
model of widespread education,

00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:20.360
and that has been--
it's a dramatic story.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.050
The college completion
rate there is breathtaking.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:30.240
And the focus is to get a very
highly educated population,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.830
which they have achieved.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.930
And then that highly
educated population

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.810
is able to staff ever more
sophisticated industries.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.970
That's the model.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.450
And it works.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.470
The one thing they don't
do is move their colleges

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.980
into research universities,
which Kim argues is still

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.830
a part of the model that
needs to be achieved.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.040
There's a very strong
export strategy in Korea.

00:14:59.622 --> 00:15:00.330
Martin, go ahead.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
research institutions,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.270
do they just send
their people to study

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.690
at research institutions then?

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.060
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
they have governmentally

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.030
supported research institutions,
and I'll get to a little more

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.790
on that in a second.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.780
The wisdom of the US model is
that you combine the education

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.585
system with the research system.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.460
And therefore, you create
a tremendous amount

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.650
of learning by doing.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.480
It seems to work pretty well.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.640
If you're just supporting
research institutions

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.740
as separate research
entities, you

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:35.370
miss the dynamics of that
education connection tie.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.900
Doesn't work as smoothly.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.775
AUDIENCE: I ask because
I think it might just

00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:41.317
be a way for them to cut costs,
because research institutions

00:15:41.317 --> 00:15:42.300
might be more complex.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.633
So they focus on making a
really good college education,

00:15:44.633 --> 00:15:47.700
then exporting people to do
research in other countries,

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.408
then they might--

00:15:48.408 --> 00:15:50.742
it just might be something
to make it more efficient for

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:51.275
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:51.275 --> 00:15:52.900
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, I think there

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.060
are certainly arguments
there, Martin.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.340
One thing that the
Korean government did do

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.360
was it forced its big companies
into international competition.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.880
So they've got a fairly
mercantilist model

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.560
of not allowing--

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.840
of protecting a domestic
market their companies.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.080
But it's not that big
a domestic market.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.940
They've got to force
their companies out

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.430
into international
competition, and they do it.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.140
And that builds tremendous
competitive strength

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.112
in these firms.

00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:25.070
We look around and see
the strong Korean firms.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.900
It's a pretty remarkable story.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.090
In terms of tech
transfer policy,

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:34.680
the policy was initially
largely a reverse engineering

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.010
of technologies
brought in from abroad.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.650
But critical
capabilities are being

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.130
developed as part of this
reverse engineering effort.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:48.690
R&D policy-- it's focused,
as I mentioned before,

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.700
on these government
research institutions.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.270
The GRIs provide more of a--

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.570
rather than influencing
industry R&D as much,

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.140
it's more of a talent
base and support base--

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.010
as you were, indeed,
suggesting, Martine--

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.329
for companies.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.960
Kim also has this very
interesting discussion

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.740
of Korean culture
here and what's

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.599
going on that
matches the evolution

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.450
of this remarkable
economic growth.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:29.010
So he argues that in Korea,
this interesting blend

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:33.975
of an Asian Confucian
culture of family

00:17:33.975 --> 00:17:40.020
and collective support and
a collective orientation

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.660
gets merged with a pretty high
level of-- quite high level

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.960
of Christianity and its
individualism for a very

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.480
interesting combination.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.590
It affects strengths on
both ends-- strengths

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.380
on the collectivity side,
but also the strengths

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.710
on the individuals side.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.770
Some of you may have
thoughts about that.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.050
Also the Korean War
itself, as we discussed,

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:09.510
left the country destroyed,
and ended village culture,

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:15.900
but amalgamated the
population in a way that

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.030
created a certain
kind of flexibility,

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:23.280
as the old social and cultural
barriers were swept away.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.970
So that it wasn't
all bad, I guess

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.850
would be Kim's conclusion.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.880
And then because
it's a country that

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.230
has constant threat of
war with North Korea,

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:42.480
the universal military service
provides a huge training

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:48.450
opportunity for a
management class, in effect.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.760
And since militaries,
to be effective,

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.790
has to be pretty meritocratic.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.540
It introduces a whole
meritocracy system

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.460
into Korean society
and culture, replacing

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.940
an older village, more
class-oriented kind of culture.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.700
There's a series
of forces here that

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.010
tend to create a certain
amount of social mobility

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.060
and elimination of historic
social classes going on here,

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:23.320
which is part of the
story that enables,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.100
Kim argues, Korea to thrive.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.270
That military service is
an interesting feature.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.180
Our military, back in the days--

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.630
which I can remember and you
can't-- when there was a draft,

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.860
the US military was actually a
very important integrated force

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.810
in this society.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:49.400
That was a very
critical step in the US

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.990
to promote racial
integration, when

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:57.150
you had integrated military
units at the height of threats

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.340
of warfare and combat.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.170
It really changed a lot
of thinking in society.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.620
So there's just an
interesting side note

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:09.600
there about what that kind
of social organization

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.130
can mean in a social context.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.150
But Kim argues that
it's important in Korea.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:20.730
So Korea develops, he argues,
a learning technology culture.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.690
So the firms go from what
he calls poaching and kind

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.200
of reverse engineering, and
then to reverse engineering,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.220
then to R&D, and then
to true innovation.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.530
So Korea's certainly right
at the technology frontier

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.060
in a whole series of areas.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.180
And they've moved through a
series of steps to get there.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.890
And Kim argues that
these are steps.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.140
And you tend to
frown on poaching

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:51.690
and reverse engineering,
but let me remind us

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:59.480
that the first textile
industry in the US

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.330
was set up in
Pawtucket, Rhode Island

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:06.200
by an English immigrant
named Samuel Slater.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:13.280
And Samuel Slater is working in
the British textile factories.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.990
And the British
textile factories

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.720
realized they've got a
monopoly on textile production

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.490
efficiency worldwide,
and they don't

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.320
want anybody else to have it.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.330
So you're subjected
to a body search

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.030
to make sure you're not walking
out with plans, if you're

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.020
an employee in these factories.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.280
And Slater's searched every
time he leaves the factory.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.110
What his British
employers didn't realize

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:37.010
is that he had a
photographic memory.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.770
So he worked with his
textile equipment,

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.770
goes to the United
States, sets up

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.520
the same stuff in
Pawtucket, Rhode Island,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.700
and brings a textile industry.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.927
So talk about poaching--
that's straight poaching.

00:21:49.927 --> 00:21:51.760
So the textile industry
in the United States

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.730
is organized essentially
through the same model,

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.095
and arguably, the same
stages we went through.

00:21:57.095 --> 00:21:58.970
When Lawrence and Lowell
are established here

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.330
in Massachusetts,
we're definitely

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.090
into technological
advances at the frontier

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.370
of textile production
at the time.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.990
So in a way, we went
through similar stages.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:15.460
R&D investment-- so there's
very heavy R&D in the industry

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.990
chebols, but the issue Kim
raises is that there's not

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.860
enough SMEs--

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.570
small and midsize enterprises--
to provide out-of-the-box ideas

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.340
in thinking in the mix, and that
that's a problem in the system.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.620
And he argues that
needs to be changed.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.100
But Korea, overall, has got a
very high R&D to GDP ratio--

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.990
higher than the US.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:41.580
So the problems are
limited university R&D,

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.325
the need for a larger
SME entrepreneurial base.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.350
He argues that a more
liberalized economy

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:55.920
away from the kind of
elite chebol control

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.900
is an important step.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.990
But there's a lot of
lessons here from Korea--

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.260
the role of a strong
governmental leadership

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.650
in creating strong
firms, but in effect,

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:13.620
forcing them into
international competition.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.870
It's Darwinian.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.560
And the government
education programs

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.810
that facilitate very, very
strong talent base country

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.230
are clearly key.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:32.660
And the government use
crisis to force its firms--

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.660
it would, in effect, force
its firms into a crisis

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.940
kind of circumstance, so
that they would really learn

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.740
how to compete and survive.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.590
So those are all interesting
lessons from Korea.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.865
So who's got Linsu Kim,
and who's got Glenn Fong?

00:23:47.865 --> 00:23:49.200
AUDIENCE: I have the Kim.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: OK,
and you've got Glenn Fong.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.186
So why don't we start
with you, Matthew?

00:23:53.186 --> 00:23:54.570
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.530
So I think besides
[INAUDIBLE] covering

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:04.100
a lot of his main points I think
really interesting is Glenn

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.340
Fong, he turns this
argument on its head--

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.210
where most people think
about political structures

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.330
determining how
competitive an economy is.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.580
But he looks at
the competitiveness

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.460
of the economy, internationally
competitive-- competitiveness

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:25.280
driving the imperative of
the political structure,

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.530
and how involved it becomes
as the country moves

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:34.020
from pursuer after the pioneer
to a follower at the frontier.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.950
And he gives the
example of Japan.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.960
One theme that I saw
throughout the question

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.720
is how much of that process
is a conscious decision,

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.570
or how much of it kind
of happens naturally?

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:51.080
Is there a certain point when
the government says, hey, we

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.160
are approaching your frontier
now, we should be hands-off?

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.740
How does that end up
happening in practice?

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.830
AUDIENCE: I think the
approach is probably

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:11.350
the most difficult
part of the process,

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:17.850
just because you have
to set up and protect--

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.460
the chebols and
systems have to be

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.980
put in place that borrowed on
these sort of cultural values.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.410
You mentioned the strong
military service at this point.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:31.510
And a lot of other things
have to come together.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:36.270
And so I would peg the approach
as sort of the hardest part.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:39.600
But I think once you
have your system set up

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.830
and you're looking to
compete internationally,

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:48.120
I think that's the point
where you have to let go.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.980
But I think you need to
reach some sort of maturity.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.800
And I think it's
pretty easy to say, OK,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.460
we've copied everything that
we've been able to copy.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.370
What's next?

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:58.920
And if you don't
have anything next,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:04.920
it might be tough to
diversify and let things go.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.225
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
Rasheed just to used

00:26:07.225 --> 00:26:10.272
Glenn Fong's terms-- and correct
me if I've got this, Matthew--

00:26:10.272 --> 00:26:18.320
but when you move from pursuer
of the pioneer to right

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.582
at the technological
frontier, that's

00:26:20.582 --> 00:26:22.040
the moment where
you ought to think

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.990
about your organizational model.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.450
Because to get to that
world-class leadership

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.240
on a continuing
basis may require

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.800
you to decentralize and
change your government role,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.050
to build a more
collaborative model

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:37.810
and rely on a large
number of players

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.770
to be able to contribute ideas.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.160
Would you agree, Matt?

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:42.930
Is that right?

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.590
Well, the way that
you said it almost

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.750
implies that there's
a conscious decision

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.985
about how much the government's
going to be involved.

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:53.610
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I think, for Japan,

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:58.410
what happened was they realized
they missed the IT revolution

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:03.470
that was led by US companies.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.180
And we'll read about DARPA
and the IT revolution

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.340
in a later class, but you'll
see where that comes from.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.800
And by having an R&D
system that was pretty

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.560
focused on applied
work with industry,

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.250
as opposed to
university research,

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:22.030
you get very good at the
incremental advances,

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.550
but you may miss
fundamental breakthroughs.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.850
And so I think Japan
is waking up, in 1998,

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.610
to these realities, and trying
to think about its innovation

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:37.470
organization to open up larger
menu of innovation practices.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.680
That would be my guess.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.480
But I think that's right.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.290
AUDIENCE: And the
other thing I had was--

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.460
use this, Japan as an example--

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.460
looking at Korea, it does
seem to fit the model.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.130
But to what extent does this
model actually generalize?

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:00.263
Off the the top of my head, I
think of the US space program

00:28:00.263 --> 00:28:01.930
or something like the
Manhattan Project,

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:06.210
where it's very much at
the competitive frontier,

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:10.530
but strong government
involvement and basically

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:16.040
targeting technologies
did lead to major advances

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.968
in research and development.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.350
Do we think that it--

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.170
that the model actually
works all the time?

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.050
Or is it necessarily even
the best thing to be doing?

00:28:49.914 --> 00:28:51.706
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Help out Matthew, team.

00:28:51.706 --> 00:28:53.240
Give him a hand here.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.950
He's got a lifeline out there.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.492
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm
curious as to why

00:28:56.492 --> 00:28:58.670
we, in the general
discourse of innovation,

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.610
only pay attention take
East Asian countries,

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.380
or largely pay attention
to East Asian countries.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.500
Because you never hear about
United States and innovations

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.810
here being juxtaposed
to, say, innovations

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:14.000
in central or South America,
or even Eastern Europe.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.640
And perhaps
technological advances

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:23.870
are not as impressive there,
or the breadth of their impact

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.760
is not as extensive.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.680
And at the same
time, I think there

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.600
has to be innovation
occurring in other parts

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.640
of the world that are not
South Korea, Germany, China,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.860
and Japan.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.280
So to what extent is that
premised on that kind

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.710
of American paranoia that was
highlighted in the Hughes'

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.240
piece against East Asia?

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.420
AUDIENCE: I think
a good follow-up

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.492
is we don't have a good--
enough counter examples for you,

00:29:49.492 --> 00:29:51.325
just because the breadth,
and the highlight,

00:29:51.325 --> 00:29:53.560
and the attention
hasn't been put there.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.910
And I would hope in
Central, South American

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.840
and these Eastern
European countries,

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:04.635
they're seeing the pervasiveness
of these different models.

00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:07.260
And there's no way that they're
not thinking about these things

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.370
or adapting their models
to these sort of things.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.350
AUDIENCE: I was at the
AAAS meeting last week,

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.690
and some of the people who
were coming in from Russia

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:19.170
were saying that they had found
that some of the advances that

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.940
were just being noticed
in North America

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.580
had been made in Russia
like a decade ago.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.800
And they had just
never transferred

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.960
to the international
scholastic community

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.150
because they were
Russian-centric.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.600
And I thought the that was a
really fascinating component

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.780
about knowledge transfer, as
well as knowledge sharing.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.300
Because if our focus
is only on competing

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:43.348
with East Asian countries
and Germany, to what extent

00:30:43.348 --> 00:30:45.390
are we missing opportunities
in the United States

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.020
by paying attention to
other countries that

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.440
might have interesting
innovation cycles or products

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.482
that we could learn from?

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.410
AUDIENCE: Just to add onto
that-- so I think the reason we

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.190
look into Asia a lot is
because they were economies

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.900
that weren't doing great, and
then they pretty much did a 180

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.418
in less 30 years.

00:31:09.418 --> 00:31:10.960
And there are a lot
of factors to it.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.500
A lot of it was having very
strong leaders coming from

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.960
periods of not doing too well--
so they were more unified--

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.063
and then having a
strong young population.

00:31:20.063 --> 00:31:21.730
So most of the countries
that did really

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.300
well during this period or
had a age pyramid like this.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.210
So it's a lot of young
people, very few old people.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.610
And they were able to move
very quickly, and especially

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.060
because they have
these strong leaders.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.820
These other countries, I
think a lot in Latin America,

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.652
they don't have these strong
leaders or these periods that

00:31:39.652 --> 00:31:41.110
come up beforehand,
so there hasn't

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.860
been rapid growth,
innovations-- even though there

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.235
has been a lot of innovation,
especially in manufacturing

00:31:46.235 --> 00:31:48.438
in Brazil, parts of Mexico.

00:31:48.438 --> 00:31:50.980
So I think it's just we haven't
paid too much attention to it

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.660
because it doesn't
seem like a threat.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.950
But these other
countries have moved

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.375
so quickly that
it does seem-- you

00:31:55.375 --> 00:31:56.625
can see it more than a threat.

00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:58.100
Because if you
look at Singapore,

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.100
it was a country that was
pretty much not there.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.080
They had a very
strong leader, was

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.200
able to make quick decisions
that are very strong,

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.670
and be very strong
in saying, this

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.878
is what I believe, this is
what I think we should do,

00:32:08.878 --> 00:32:10.980
and then going after it.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.170
And they were able to
completely 180 their economy.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.710
And I think we're also talking
about the role of government

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:21.100
in the US has committees making
decisions for innovation.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.840
But actually, Charlie
Munger, who-- everyone

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.630
knows Warren Buffett, right?

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:26.195
More or less?

00:32:26.195 --> 00:32:27.820
Charlie Munger's his
right-hand person.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.240
And he says, in the
past, in general,

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.450
countries do better when its
one very smart, talented leader,

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.330
because they can make
these hard decisions.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.420
And in the US, we do
have an executive,

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.120
but I think everybody
at this table

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.860
can agree that people
don't really say,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.870
he said that-- we should do it.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.340
So the benefit is these
are very credible leaders

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.050
that most of the
time, when they make

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.510
it that position from
a downturn period,

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.550
are very talented and skilled.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.580
And they do make bets.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.080
They can make these
[INAUDIBLE] say,

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.420
you know what, this
is an industry that's

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.590
going to grow very quickly.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:00.760
Let's put three people.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.480
There's like 3, 30, 40
companies that could do well,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.480
but I think these three
are really going to win,

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.080
and we're going to put all
our eggs in this basket,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.170
and we're going to do well.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.920
And that's something
that's very, I guess,

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.220
I would call un-American,
because we're very much--

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.450
everybody can go about it.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.600
We want to leave opportunity.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.458
But these countries do
have this capability,

00:33:17.458 --> 00:33:19.000
and they have already
shown that they

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.220
can grow so quickly, versus
as other countries, I think--

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.090
I think another thing too is
Latin America, Russia, we still

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.620
see a lot of corruption.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.690
These other countries were
able to get rid of it.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.703
Like Singapore, what Lee
Kuan Yew did was say,

00:33:31.703 --> 00:33:33.620
I'm going to pay everyone
about twice as much,

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.680
but if I find out that
you're being corrupt,

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.820
you guys are pretty much done.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.760
So I don't know if it
was a death penalty

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.830
or it was very severe
sanctions, but it was also

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:43.898
severe sanctions upon
them and their families.

00:33:43.898 --> 00:33:46.190
So that's a completely
different way of going about it.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.440
So I think just don't see
other countries as a threat,

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.280
even though they have
good capabilities.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.120
But these countries did do
amazing things in 30, 20 years

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.015
that can't be taken lightly.

00:33:57.015 --> 00:33:58.390
But you could also
debate that it

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.807
was because there was very
young populations, because also

00:34:00.807 --> 00:34:06.308
Japan and South Korea had
stagnation right after.

00:34:06.308 --> 00:34:06.850
Final point--

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.860
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So, Martin,
that's a very political economy

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.020
perspective.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:19.500
Going back to some of the points
that Matt was making earlier,

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.290
I think the central
Glenn Fong argument

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.920
is that that may get you a fair
distance for a period of time,

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.780
as you're getting
to the frontier.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.550
But then when you
get to the frontier,

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.850
you better figure
out a more bottom-up,

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:36.980
more collaborative kind of model
if you want to keep the ideas--

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.110
if you need that
big mix of ideas

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:43.409
that's going to enable you to go
to a series of the next things.

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:45.480
That's Fong's argument.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.960
And his point is
that Japan really

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.858
had to reorganize
its innovations away

00:34:51.858 --> 00:34:53.650
from the political
economy kind of approach

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.159
you were describing
before to really a very

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.220
different organization,
when it reached

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.883
that moment of [INAUDIBLE]
innovation and competition.

00:35:06.498 --> 00:35:10.482
[INAUDIBLE],, in response
to your question, in a way,

00:35:10.482 --> 00:35:12.190
I want to go back to
what we talked about

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.970
in the first class.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.570
For a long time, we thought
that this innovation system

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:24.440
stuff was the way in which
the rich countries got rich.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.620
It was just a way to
build further wealth

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.200
in a relatively modest
number of countries

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.170
that figured out how to dominate
and lead these innovation

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.550
systems.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:39.350
But then other things
started happening.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:44.120
Korea comes up from
being totally destroyed.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.610
Taiwan's somewhat similar.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.360
Economies like India,
which is obviously

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.880
one of the poorest
in the world, is

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.930
able to start building a very
significant middle class.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.850
And China's the latest
element in this story.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.540
In other words, an
innovation-based growth model

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:09.390
can be pervasive and work
in the developing world.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.300
Now, we've managed
to translate that

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:15.920
at pretty interesting
scale in parts of Asia.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.260
You're exactly right--
we haven't translated,

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.850
with the possible
exception of Brazil,

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.126
into a pervasive model in
Latin America, for example.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.010
One of the options for
doing a paper in this course

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:31.790
is to look at other national
innovation systems and dive

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:32.690
into them.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.670
And I really hope of
you will pursue this.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.930
We don't particularly focus
on this in this class,

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:45.120
although we could.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.330
But the Brazil story's
absolutely fascinating,

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.098
and a remarkable story.

00:36:50.098 --> 00:36:52.390
Obviously, they're in a fair
amount of economic trouble

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:55.320
from macro factors
at the moment.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.155
But nonetheless, it's a very
promising and encouraging story

00:36:59.155 --> 00:37:01.080
overall.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.580
But there are others, and there
are other parts of the world

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.870
too.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.662
AUDIENCE: So funny that
you mention Brazil,

00:37:06.662 --> 00:37:08.520
because while we were
talking about this,

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.778
I remembered that there's major
airplane companies or airplane

00:37:13.778 --> 00:37:15.320
manufacturers-- so
you think Boeing--

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.778
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I flew up
in one this morning, Embraer.

00:37:17.778 --> 00:37:19.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.175
And they're from Brazil.

00:37:21.175 --> 00:37:21.660
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.770
AUDIENCE: Based in Brazil.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:27.290
And they are really
important now,

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.040
and will be important
in the coming years,

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.410
because Boeing and Airbus
dominate these very large,

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:37.380
big airplanes-- like 787s, these
very large aircraft that only

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.200
tend to get bigger in scale.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.010
But Embraer is important because
they focus on shorter flight

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.735
distances with smaller
aircraft, and developing out

00:37:47.735 --> 00:37:48.360
of that market.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:53.580
But I just looked, and they
were actually, in the '90s,

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.190
this public private
partnership--

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.880
so came while Brazil was looking
at shorter distance flights

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.140
and doing that a lot better.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.892
But it does come--

00:38:02.892 --> 00:38:04.350
sort of this pursuer
after pioneer.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.740
And I think they're
now probably shifting

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.720
to build more aircraft--

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.040
instead of copying
smaller aircraft designs,

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.110
they're having to now
become the pioneers

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:20.190
and really start building
new smaller-scale aircraft,

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.540
and take that market.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.260
And Brazil's interesting,
just because they

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.900
were allowed to do that.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.960
And I don't know
what sort of factors

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.380
played into them being
allowed to initially start

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.160
that public private partnership
in around the '90s, when

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:34.835
Embraer started.

00:38:34.835 --> 00:38:36.210
But I think now,
they're probably

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:39.630
going to have to shift pretty
drastically and radically

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.650
in looking to do that.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:43.192
But that's a place I don't think
we've touched yet is Brazil.

00:38:43.192 --> 00:38:45.067
AUDIENCE: I think there
was a lot of pushback

00:38:45.067 --> 00:38:46.625
from their competitors for--

00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:49.080
that Embraer was
getting unfair treatment

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.030
from their government, in terms
of other trade agreements--

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.280
I don't remember specifically.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.998
But it does conflict rifts
with international relations.

00:38:57.998 --> 00:39:00.540
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So Chris,
I'm going to shift over to you,

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.600
and we're going to Linsu Kim.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.620
AUDIENCE: So I think Bill
really gave a good background

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.180
on the article, but--

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.597
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You don't
have to say that, that's OK.

00:39:11.597 --> 00:39:13.380
AUDIENCE: You did though.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:17.940
But to go into a bit more about
the process of how Korea came

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:22.350
up to speed on the forefront
of the innovation frontier

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.840
at that time, they really
went through this process

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.500
of imitating what was out
there, and then from that basis,

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.340
going on to innovate,
and do their own R&D,

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.610
and create more advancements
for those products.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.570
And this trend really supported
by those close intertwined

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.000
partnerships and
almost interdependence

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.780
between the government
and the chebols.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.520
And the chebols still exists.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.670
Even to this day, they're
really family-centric,

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.260
dynastic corporations.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:56.340
Like the Lee family has
controlled Samsung for however

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.610
long they've been in business.

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.240
And that centralist government
support and structure

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.320
has really allowed them to enter
really high capital industries

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.660
and really get to the
front really quickly,

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.400
as we've been discussing, has
been a factor also in Japan.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.420
So just focusing
on this right now,

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:22.590
we discussed how the
focus on the partnerships

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:24.900
between the chebol
and the government

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:30.480
has kind of stymied the ability
of SMEs and the smaller funds

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.560
to enter the space.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.890
So one question that
someone had was,

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:39.600
how can the country
catch up the economy

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.780
and foster both aspects of
the larger corporations,

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.700
as well as the
smaller businesses?

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.450
Do they have to partition funds,
have different initiatives

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:52.410
or approaches for both sectors?

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.450
How do you guys
think they should

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:55.680
approach that kind of growth?

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.490
Go ahead.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:07.250
AUDIENCE: It seems like
the chebols are focused

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.500
on specific industries
right now, like construction

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.652
and electronics.

00:41:10.652 --> 00:41:12.110
So it's probably
going to be harder

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:15.780
to get smaller firms to get a
footing in those industries.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.860
So in my opinion, it'd make
more sense to pick something new

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.735
and focus attention on
developing those industries,

00:41:21.735 --> 00:41:24.080
because I don't think there's
going to be a startup that

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.090
can compete with Hyundai.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:30.350
But maybe there's
something in energy or IT

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:33.230
that they have
room to grow more.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:38.540
AUDIENCE: Or maybe even focus
SMEs on more domestic affairs--

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.580
I don't know if agriculture
or some industries in Korea

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.290
might--

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:44.642
you could target
them potentially.

00:41:44.642 --> 00:41:46.100
AUDIENCE: And I
think you just need

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:50.180
to offer governmental support
and financial protection

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.570
probably a little bit
different than the chebols need

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.680
or don't need.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.740
But you just have to decide
what's the scale that you're

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.427
trying to look and build at.

00:41:59.427 --> 00:42:01.760
If you're trying to build and
serve smaller sectors that

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.460
might be underdeveloped, like
agriculture, for example,

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.820
you might just have to look a
little bit smaller than trying

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.940
to cater to one,
or two, or three

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.650
chebol companies off the bat.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.090
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Chris, you think that--

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:28.060
from your reading of Kim,
do you agree with him

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:34.898
that Korea needs to foster an
SME startup kind of community?

00:42:34.898 --> 00:42:36.940
AUDIENCE: You mean in the
context of present day?

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.200
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, present day.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.310
AUDIENCE: In present day.

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:40.685
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Is that going

00:42:40.685 --> 00:42:43.560
to be an enhancement to
Korea's innovation capability?

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.040
Do they really need to do this?

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.390
What do you think?

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.930
AUDIENCE: Personally, I think
their structure that really

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:53.500
focuses on the bigger
corporations and their impact

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.420
and their ability to
really compete globally

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.150
has been working.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:02.830
So I do think that
the corporation

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.500
push has been successful.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.490
Whether SMEs should be
supported from the government,

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:14.450
I think it's worth exploring.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:17.110
I do think that
finding them a niche

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.420
is really important
because there's

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.520
no point or kind of
redundant for them

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.000
to try to enter industries
that the corporations have

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:25.560
a hold on.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.890
AUDIENCE: I'd say it's
probably important,

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:33.230
just because [INAUDIBLE]
innovator's dilemma.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.500
Usually when you're big, you
focus on a specific technology.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.310
Like for Kodak, they invented
the first digital camera,

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:41.810
but because of the way their
supply chain and their current

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.390
business was, they couldn't--
they didn't want to manufacture

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.307
because it would ruin
their existing business.

00:43:46.307 --> 00:43:48.320
So the danger of
having too big a giant,

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.793
is, in order to innovate, it
takes so much effort on them

00:43:50.793 --> 00:43:51.710
that they won't do it.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.377
And if your economy
is based off of that

00:43:53.377 --> 00:43:56.180
and based on those
four giants, especially

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.210
with rapid technological
innovation,

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.170
you really don't want
to be in that position.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.340
So having that SME structure
would be beneficial.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:07.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I kind of
want to hit on both of those.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:14.540
So with the chebol versus
SME structure in Korea,

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:20.420
I'm wondering, are the
major, major legacy

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.335
corporations-- are
they profitable enough

00:44:23.335 --> 00:44:25.460
and large enough to be
self-sufficient-- they don't

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.710
really need the input
from the government,

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.900
as they did decades ago?

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.827
Could the government
focus more on SMEs,

00:44:31.827 --> 00:44:33.410
and would that be a
more strategic way

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:34.550
to go about things?

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.410
Or do they have a
situation in Korea--

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.600
I don't know, I haven't--

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.850
I've only been there once,
and it was only for about a

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.530
week, so I don't really know.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:44.960
Do they had a situation
similar to what I think we face

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.220
in the United States, where
yes, we have legacy technologies

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.160
and sectors that are probably
self-sufficient at this point

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.910
and highly profitable,
but we're so ingrained--

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:57.410
the government still
gives subsidies

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:01.100
to fossil fuel industries,
subsidizes their R&D indeed,

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.270
and that--

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:04.960
although they shouldn't
necessarily need that.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:10.013
It's like that, and they
have powers that they can

00:45:10.013 --> 00:45:11.180
continue to get those funds.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.480
So what is the
situation in Korea?

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.567
Are they ingrained and can't
really separate at this point?

00:45:18.567 --> 00:45:20.150
AUDIENCE: From what
I know, definitely

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:21.830
it's still very ingrained.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.070
A lot of the corporations have--

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:27.230
I don't think it's
corruption necessarily,

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:30.980
but close political ties
to the government in power.

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:35.210
So it might be difficult, I
think, to separate the two.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:39.440
And going back to the
point of whether SMEs could

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.440
be on the rise in the
future, I think it's also

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.150
a cultural difference.

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.880
Because in Korean
and Asian culture,

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.020
it's often more traditional,
in that it's very prestige

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:54.090
obviously to go into these
very developed and longstanding

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.180
companies.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.300
And there's not so much
an innovation drive,

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.110
like there is here.

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:03.560
That startup culture is
really attractive to a lot

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.120
of the young millennials.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.840
I don't think that exists so
much, let's say, in Korea.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.950
So whether it be a
job to go to an SME

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:15.710
or go to a big corporation, I
feel like that wouldn't even

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.360
be a decision.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.870
It'd be obvious to go
to a big corporation.

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:28.430
So I don't know if the cultural
stigmas and the standards

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:29.167
have guided--

00:46:29.167 --> 00:46:30.250
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.597
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Another
cultural point here that

00:46:33.597 --> 00:46:36.560
we're dealing with
about risk-taking,

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.770
which is a pretty key
element in the US failure--

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.270
pretty high tolerance
for failure.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.090
All right.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:46.100
Look, good summaries.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.228
To get through this, I'm going
to push one to our next--

00:46:49.228 --> 00:46:50.605
let me just do one chart.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.270
Just so what recessions
look like in the US

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:59.850
and what's been going on
and repeated sequences

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.620
of recession, here's
the 1981 recession--

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.510
dip, rise.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.150
And jobs come back
relatively quickly.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:12.630
Then 1990, it starts
stretching it out further.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:23.040
Then in 2001, the jobs recovery
is really remarkably slow.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:29.430
And then the 2008,
2009 recession,

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:33.060
even further out on the
level of job reductions.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.490
And a painful reality
is that you still never

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:37.320
recovered from
the 2001 recession

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:42.510
by the time the 2007, 2008,
2009 recession is on us.

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:48.330
So there may be an argument
that something fundamental

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:50.510
is going on structurally
in the economy,

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.440
when you see a chart like that.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:56.130
In each successive recession,
it's less of a business cycle.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:58.710
It's more structural.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:03.960
And it looks like there
are deep structural causes

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.530
in these manufacturing
employment declines, when you

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.240
start seeing a chart like this.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.640
We'll talk more
about it next week,

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.560
but here's declining
median income

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.920
for the US, which we'll talk
more about next week too.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:21.120
So particularly pay
attention to men, who were--

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.600
tend to historically have played
a larger role in manufacturing

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.780
industries in the US.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:33.210
So this is change in median
real earnings for men and women

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.850
from 1990 to 2013--

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:42.040
so an extended period
from '90 to '13.

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.890
No high school diploma, men--

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:48.877
median income declined in
that time period 20 points.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:57.912
High school diploma or some
college, 13-point decline.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:06.460
And then advanced
degrees, 21-point rise.

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.040
Bachelor's degrees,
16-point rise.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.430
This is a society
that's going like this,

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:14.800
and that's what
we're dealing with.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.020
And arguably, it's
related to this.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.495
Let me move to Suzanne Berger.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.150
You should get to know her,
because she's around here,

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.850
and she's really a
remarkable talent

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:43.660
and has been a great
teacher for me.

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:48.850
This is her 2005 book
called How We compete.

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:52.060
And her essential point is that
there are different varieties

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:52.780
of capitalism.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:56.350
We've been talking a
lot about that today.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:50:01.690
And the different approaches
emerged between the US

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:06.700
and Asian economies in
advanced technology goods

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:13.780
in this later part of the
1990s, early 2000s time period.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.070
So what's going on here?

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:21.490
IT is a driver,
and codeable specs

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:26.050
tied to computer-driven
equipment

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:34.270
is enabling a divorce between
production and design.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:41.790
So in the old time period,
in a prior time period,

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:47.440
Suzanne argues that
manufacturing companies,

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:52.020
production firms were a
lot like model airplanes.

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.590
And you all probably
don't remember the era

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:56.210
of plastic model airplanes.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.640
I do.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.710
But you'd get this
batch of plastic parts,

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:08.410
and they never quite fit.

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:11.450
You'd have to work them,
and you'd get glue all over,

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:15.318
and the glue would spill over,
and it would just be a mess.

00:51:15.318 --> 00:51:17.360
And you try and clean up
the glue with a Kleenex,

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.068
and the Kleenex would
stick to the model.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.170
And you'd put rubber bands
around it to try and get it

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:27.140
to lock in place, and you'd
break the damn thing trying

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.270
to get it fixed.

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:33.170
That's what manufacturing
used to be like, she argues.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:38.540
And to manage, that you needed a
very integrated vertical system

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.570
with all parts of that system
tied and connected together

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:45.230
to get around the difficulty
of the production process.

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:50.410
But with codeable IT-based specs
and computer-driven equipment,

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:53.560
he moved to an era of LEGOs.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.650
It's all computer-driven.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:57.470
You're going to be
producing LEGOs,

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:02.060
and they are always going
to snap perfectly in place.

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.940
That's how the production
system changed,

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:10.490
she argued, in these two--
from these two different eras.

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:12.520
And the classic
example is the iPod.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:25.910
Apple was able to pick a mix
of MP3 best technologies,

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:33.560
and they tied it to
a new software access

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:38.900
system for music in database
form, as you all know.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.430
Now it's video, as well.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:49.220
A classic Apple move, right?

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:53.030
The problem with MP3
players before Apple

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:56.330
was that you had to
commit a crime in order

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:57.560
to use the MP3 player.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.620
You were stealing
someone's music.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.620
And it was a criminal act.

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.800
What kind of product forced
you to commit a criminal act?

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.780
It's not a great product line.

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.660
So Apple invents an
entirely different way

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.790
of organizing the
music industry,

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:20.270
but it ties it to existing
MP3 player technology,

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:23.377
which it receives to perfect.

00:53:23.377 --> 00:53:24.460
How is it able to do this?

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.180
It was able to do this in
a remarkably short period

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:26.720
of time.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.090
It was a matter of months.

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:33.190
So he figures out what the
optimal MP3 player technologies

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:37.910
are, who is producing
them, and go to them

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:40.710
and enter into contracts
with all over the world--

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:43.820
particularly in China,
but elsewhere, as well.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:47.000
And it knows that they're
going to snap together

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:54.470
like LEGOs in the end, because
they are using codeable specs

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:56.960
on computer-driven equipment.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.800
So you can now distribute
your production model.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.610
So Apple doesn't-- can do
this in a matter of months.

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:11.360
It doesn't have to go buy green
space outside Wilmington, North

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.888
Carolina, or something,
and build a new factory,

00:54:13.888 --> 00:54:16.180
and get all the permitting,
and spend years doing this,

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:19.430
and raise a billion
dollars to do it.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:22.170
Instead, it quickly
enters into a deal--

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.920
a series of deals with
existing producers,

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.738
but it knows that it can
bring the product back,

00:54:28.738 --> 00:54:30.530
because it's going to
be LEGOs, and they're

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:33.240
going to snap into place.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.690
Amazing, absolutely amazing.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:45.580
And I was in Japan
in 2006, and--

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:46.600
in January.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.410
I spent a wonderful day as
it was snowing in Kyoto,

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:51.610
which was complete magical.

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:53.470
But it was mostly back in Tokyo.

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:59.020
And the headline in the leading
English language newspaper

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:09.010
in Tokyo was "Apple sells 14
million iPods in two weeks;

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:10.060
where is Sony!!"

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.300
It was just a reality
that Apple had

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.580
been able to spring to
this whole new product

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.950
line in a remarkably
short period of time

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:29.010
by using a digital dispersed
distributed production model.

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:34.380
And it's pretty
irresistible, because you--

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.680
that level of time
and investments

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.550
you have to assemble
ahead of time

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:40.330
makes this really
quite convenient.

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:43.180
So lots of US firms
moved to this model,

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:46.770
and they're technologically
enabled by these technological

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:48.830
advances to do so.

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:53.610
Now, Suzanne also goes on to
argue, hey, other people--

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.400
and she's looking a group of
Asian countries and firms--

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.230
are not necessarily doing this.

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:03.960
So in Korea, Samsung continues
to control the key components.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.370
It allows a certain amount
of assembly offshore.

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:10.740
In Japan, there's
a conscious effort

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:15.510
to keep integrated
innovation model,

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:18.490
and control all the
critical stages.

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:20.340
So the risk in
the Apple model is

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:22.950
that you're offshoring
your production capability,

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.080
and a certain amount of
the innovation capability's

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.360
going to follow.

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.770
That's the risk.

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:32.280
And to avoid that,
companies in Japan and Korea

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:37.020
are moving in a very different
organizational model.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:41.430
Both models, she
argues, may well work.

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:44.130
So these are varieties of
capitalism at play here.

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:46.830
But the important thing
I want you to understand

00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:50.830
is that you can now,
for the first time

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.950
historically, sever
production and design.

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:57.310
And it's pretty
irresistible to do so,

00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:00.070
because you significantly
reduce your risk, and exposure,

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:02.890
and your investment
levels upfront.

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:06.460
So that's why, she
would argue, US firms

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:09.430
tend to pursue this model.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:12.515
And we'll go to her
next book next week

00:57:12.515 --> 00:57:15.400
and discover why the model may
not necessarily be optimal.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.110
We'll hold that in
advance until next week.

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:21.750
So who's got Suzanne?

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:23.630
Let's go ahead then, Matthew.

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:26.937
AUDIENCE: So in How We
Compete, basically they

00:57:26.937 --> 00:57:28.770
look at a whole bunch
of different companies

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:33.090
in many different
industries and try

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:36.360
to find what it is that
makes companies competitive.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:40.350
So they find that there's
no single paradigm.

00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:42.540
And one of the
key lines there is

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.640
that there's no sunset
industries, just

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.570
sunset strategies.

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:48.603
So really, to be
competitive, what they found

00:57:48.603 --> 00:57:51.270
is that companies always need to
be questioning their processes,

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:54.050
looking for ways to innovate.

00:57:54.050 --> 00:57:57.030
And then what I got out
of it were primarily

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:58.220
two different balances.

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:03.870
One is this idea of
intelligent offshoring, where

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:09.450
maybe outsourcing all
of your manufacturing

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:13.860
is not the best idea because
there are other costs involved

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.850
with that, and can
create innovation

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:20.970
gaps within your own country.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:23.550
And then the other
balance being with IP,

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:29.700
and how do you create a
collaborative environment

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:36.850
where that's conducive to
growth and development, but also

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:39.322
protecting your IP,
so that you don't

00:58:39.322 --> 00:58:41.840
create your own competitor?

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.320
And so I have some
questions here.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.820
I think one of the
first things is

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:53.240
how do companies in
fiercely competitive sectors

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:58.390
actually set themselves up
to constantly be innovating?

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:01.050
It's a tough thing to do.

00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:04.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Let me
underscore the importance

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.170
of your question.

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:08.510
The number of companies that
are a hundred years old you

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:11.550
can probably
measure on one hand.

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:15.950
They go through disruption,
and they change, and they die.

00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:18.773
Long-lasting, long-enduring
companies are rare.

00:59:18.773 --> 00:59:20.940
And it's retaining this
innovation capability that's

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:23.273
so critical, so you're driving
at a really key question.

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:31.590
AUDIENCE: When you mentioned
innovative firms, firms

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:34.680
that keep staying at the head,
my first thought is Apple.

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:39.310
and I think Apple's, what,
like 30 years old now?

00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:43.770
It hasn't even proven that
it can withstay the trend.

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:46.740
So I'm trying to think of
something that is actually

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:50.010
more than 50 years old
that has been consistently

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:50.970
on top of things.

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:53.577
AUDIENCE: I think Coke is
probably my favorite example.

00:59:53.577 --> 00:59:55.660
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Coke's
one, and IBM's another.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:57.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and then IBM.

00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:02.100
I think IBM I know more about,
just because they developed

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.650
as sort of in f wave--

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:10.280
in the context of the US
was looking for answers

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.730
in the semiconductor realm.

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:14.700
But more importantly,
they had to deal

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.030
with the whole advent
of personal computing,

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.790
and then they shifted now
into more IT-based services.

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:25.090
And so they just contract
out and solve your problems.

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:28.020
And I think it's
like you have to be

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:33.370
sensitive to these big
technological disruptions,

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:37.110
and then ride the wave
or get out completely,

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:43.860
and being able to shut down
kind of large sections of--

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.200
it was previously
advantageous maybe for Kodak

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.627
to use disposable cameras, but
now we have digital cameras.

01:00:49.627 --> 01:00:51.210
And so you have to
be able to be like,

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:54.540
OK, we're going to
really radically change

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:58.050
the course of our company
in order to sustain

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:00.420
and stay alive.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.750
And that's a hard decision
to be able to make.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:09.360
And so I think the resistance
to change piece is probably

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:15.690
differentiates your Cokes from
maybe your less long-lasting

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:16.723
companies.

01:01:16.723 --> 01:01:18.390
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
And next week you're

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:21.090
going to start to read
your textbook, which

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:23.820
is about the difficulty
of innovation

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:27.380
in complex established
legacy economic sectors.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:30.140
And that's a large part
of this [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:34.352
answering your question.

01:01:34.352 --> 01:01:36.060
AUDIENCE: The question
too is, if there's

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.988
these new capabilities and you
don't use them, somebody will.

01:01:38.988 --> 01:01:40.530
So it's kind of like
a Pandora's box,

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.740
because I may not want to
change my whole supply chain

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:48.660
and get rid of a ton of
jobs for my employees

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:52.575
because of all the things
that happened after,

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:54.450
but my competitor is
probably going to do it.

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:57.083
And if I don't do it, then
he's going to have a lower--

01:01:57.083 --> 01:01:59.250
he's going to lower his
costs, and he'll most likely

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:00.810
beat me to market.

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:04.170
And there's a quote from
Andrew Carnegie, where

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:06.450
he goes like, you should
always use the best tools,

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:09.960
even if it's very hard
to cheat your old tools.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.418
Because as a titan of industry,
if you don't, somebody else

01:02:14.418 --> 01:02:14.918
will.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:21.090
AUDIENCE: And the other
thing I liked from Hayes

01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:21.715
I think about--

01:02:21.715 --> 01:02:25.490
I know it goes a little bit
into next week's readings here,

01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:29.910
but to what extent do you think
that design and manufacturing

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:33.030
can actually be separated?

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.160
I know here at MIT, in
the mechanical engineering

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.870
department, there's still
a big emphasis on taking

01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:43.380
the manufacturing classes, in
terms of just understanding

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.240
when you're designing,
what is feasible,

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.800
what is possible to manufacture.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.220
Maybe 3D printing, it's a
little bit more separate.

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:55.620
You're basically
saying can be made.

01:02:55.620 --> 01:03:00.570
But there's a lot of
know-how embodied in having

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:03.660
the manufacturing there too.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.220
I don't fully think
that they can be--

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.510
or it's wise to
fully separate them.

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:13.060
I want to see if people also
have some more thoughts there.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:16.950
AUDIENCE: I was going to say
that maybe the separation is

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:19.260
just a figment of
our imaginations,

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.050
because I know that
when Suzanne Berger was

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:24.480
on the panel in
bootcamp course--

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.320
I think it was Suzanne who
said that the people who--

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:34.470
the designers for Apple spend
most of their time not here.

01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:36.990
They spend their time in
the offshore manufacturing.

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:38.005
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Shenzhen, in particular.

01:03:38.005 --> 01:03:39.182
AUDIENCE: Makes sense.

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:40.890
AUDIENCE: So they're
not really separate,

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:43.500
although they're quote,
unquote "separate."

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:49.440
AUDIENCE: I think also
objective is important.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.240
And if you're
trying to separate,

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.370
what are you trying to
separate in order to do--

01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:56.382
if you're trying to separate
in order to cut costs,

01:03:56.382 --> 01:03:58.590
you'll find a way, because
it'll be more advantageous

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:01.500
for you to send your
manufacturing section over,

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.280
if you're Apple.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.960
But even if you do
that, you're going

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.080
to have to send your designers
in order to do the next thing

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.870
and really consider how
am I going to manufacture

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:11.120
this thing that I've designed.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.500
And in order to do that,
you can't separate them.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.600
So the mechanical engineering
department, I think,

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.880
is probably pretty
smart by training--

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.340
when training all mechanical
engineers who are then

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.972
going to go up design
and manufacture,

01:04:21.972 --> 01:04:24.180
even though you might
specialize in one or the other,

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.570
you need to have a strong
basis and a foundation of both,

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:28.410
and understandable
are critical in order

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:33.120
to do anything that's probably
long-lasting or meaningful,

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.852
and I guess quote,
unquote "innovative."

01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:40.690
AUDIENCE: When we talk about
design, what do we mean?

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.030
Do we mean the designer
of an industrial system?

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:45.370
Do we mean the designer of
an industrial appliance?

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:46.870
Do we mean the
designer of hardware?

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:48.140
Do we mean the
designer of software?

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.110
What components of
design are we concerned

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:53.620
about, and in what ways is this
relevant in the conversation

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:56.710
we're having right now
about integrative innovation

01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:57.703
processes?

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:05.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I'm
viewing it, when we see--

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:07.350
we're comparing the
design and manufacturing,

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:09.540
so I wouldn't think of
it so much as software.

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.180
Primarily hardware,
where the design

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:19.420
may be having a 3D model or
a layout of my circuit board

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.540
that I'm going to
send to a manufacturer

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.730
on the other side of the
world, who will actually

01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:26.544
make those components, put them
together, and send them back

01:05:26.544 --> 01:05:27.930
to me.

01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:30.605
That's at least
what I [INAUDIBLE]..

01:05:30.605 --> 01:05:31.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:34.130
I guess I raise that concern
because, as a designer myself--

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.320
I think of myself as
a design researcher,

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.390
because I think about
the ways in which you

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:42.200
can take systems engineering
approaches to social issues.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.100
And there's a big
debate right now

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:49.230
in the design community
about what design even is.

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:51.410
There's this big debate
about design thinking

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:54.450
and versus the design cycle,
and who gets to create it.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.860
And there's even more of
a debate about the nuances

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:02.690
and exerting the power
in creating something.

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:05.720
All of these hardware choices
are political choices,

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.930
and they have impacts on
both the user and the society

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.500
in which they're implemented.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.130
So that's why I think it's
important to really consider,

01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:16.340
when both the author and we
talk about design, what kind

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.310
of design we're talking about,
and we view it not necessarily

01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:23.360
as a neutral and apolitical
action, but very much

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:28.880
as a reflection of what
that corporation values

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:35.510
and what kind of values they
want to promote in a society.

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:39.590
When I look at this laptop, I
don't think, this is beautiful,

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:41.600
this is elegant,
this is functional.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.390
I think, this is how this
company wants the world

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:51.270
to look like, and this is
their long-lasting and material

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:56.375
vision for what the world could
look like for the long run.

01:06:56.375 --> 01:06:58.750
AUDIENCE: Alternatively, I
think a lot of design thinking

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:01.408
actually is for companies
that, while we're

01:07:01.408 --> 01:07:03.450
looking at what they--
what we think their vision

01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:05.418
is [INAUDIBLE] when we
look at, say, a Macbook,

01:07:05.418 --> 01:07:06.960
I think a lot of
them are looking to,

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.522
and most designers
at Apple would say,

01:07:09.522 --> 01:07:11.730
in their design process,
they're looking at the users

01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:13.855
and seeing what the
users actually want.

01:07:13.855 --> 01:07:17.650
[INAUDIBLE] there's a
lot of looking both ways.

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:19.480
AUDIENCE: From a
capitalist perspective,

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.078
the way I would
look at it is, OK,

01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:22.620
what are the
manufacturing abilities?

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.382
How much does it cost me?

01:07:24.382 --> 01:07:25.590
How long is it going to take?

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:26.970
What are going to be the issues?

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:28.117
Don't make it complicated.

01:07:28.117 --> 01:07:29.700
Simplify it, simplify
it, simplify it,

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.033
because in execution, it's
going to be way more complex,

01:07:32.033 --> 01:07:34.030
and I'm not trying
to deal with that.

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:35.970
And then, OK, I'll make it.

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:38.220
Make sure it's slightly
different than my competitors.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.110
Make sure it follows
the values of my company

01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:41.040
in a certain amount of way.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.450
And then when I
market it, you think

01:07:42.450 --> 01:07:43.950
it's something more
than it actually

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:46.841
is because then you'll buy it,
because it's worth the value.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:54.190
AUDIENCE: I think maybe
American Apparel and--

01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:56.410
they hinted at American
Apparel, Lucky Brand Jeans,

01:07:56.410 --> 01:08:00.380
and some other companies
that are very heavy--

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.380
or their models are
particularly because they're

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.047
based in the US.

01:08:03.047 --> 01:08:06.740
And even though it might be
less expensive to like build

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:11.230
and manufacture your jeans or
your t-shirts, for example,

01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:16.180
outside of Los Angeles,
you lose other factors,

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:19.960
which is being able to say made
in the USA, blah, blah, blah.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:24.580
But also you gain production
speak and all of these things

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:27.486
that Martin was talking
about from coupling

01:08:27.486 --> 01:08:29.319
these design and the
manufacturing processes

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:30.300
and leaving them here.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.160
But at the end of
the day, I think

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.720
you do a cost benefit
analysis, kind

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.779
of like Martin said,
and then just make sure

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:42.500
that your company values
is in line with the product

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.640
and how you want people to
interface with the world

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.667
through your product.

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:48.250
AUDIENCE: But then
going off that, I'm

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.140
curious how much
of an advantages

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.500
that you get from
producing in the US can--

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.319
or whatever their gimmick is--

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:58.990
how long those will last.

01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:01.210
Like American Apparel just
closed all their stores.

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:05.020
So does that mean that that
approach isn't sustainable

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:11.020
and that they should have taken
another look at outsourcing?

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.600
There are other factors
contributing to it,

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.210
but is that--

01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:18.100
do these companies have
to pick what society

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.771
will want as their
special sauce,

01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:23.229
and hope that it
lasts long enough,

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:25.689
or are they eventually
going to need to think

01:09:25.689 --> 01:09:27.441
about these alternatives?

01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:29.899
AUDIENCE: They definitely should
consider the alternatives,

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.492
but when--

01:09:31.492 --> 01:09:33.700
at least with American
Apparel, like you were saying,

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.117
there's probably
a ton of factors.

01:09:35.117 --> 01:09:36.880
And I think just to
answer that question,

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.350
we just need more data.

01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:41.380
So we need to somehow control
for the type of industry,

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.729
the time period, the location,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:09:44.729 --> 01:09:47.800
And then you could compare.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.290
Based on the information
that we have, the question--

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:53.450
we just don't have the numbers
to back up either side.

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:54.700
AUDIENCE: Or another example--

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.160
I think that this was
written before Zara

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.780
came under fire for a bunch of
basically human rights issues--

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.520
outsourcing--

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.780
AUDIENCE: But I'd look into--

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.890
did that affect sales?

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:07.360
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Or do you
want to lay out the Zara model

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.300
for us, Lily?

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.230
AUDIENCE: Oh, gosh.

01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:11.980
AUDIENCE: Do you know it?

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:14.980
AUDIENCE: No, I'm
afraid I can't--

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:15.200
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I
can summarize it for you.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.240
AUDIENCE: --articulate it well.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.115
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Or
Martin if you know it.

01:10:18.115 --> 01:10:20.180
AUDIENCE: If you know
it better [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:20.630
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I don't know.

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:21.684
We'll find out.

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:22.590
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:24.160
AUDIENCE: You do it, and
then I'll appendix anything--

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.410
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Please do.

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:31.630
It's an example that
Suzanne Berger uses.

01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:36.490
And the point about Zara
is that, by locating

01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:40.600
its production facilities it's
very close to its markets,

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:47.140
it's able to move production
to its sale system

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.870
in a very, very
short period of time.

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:53.170
So by tracking fashion
markets and what

01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:55.380
appears to be
moving and selling,

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:59.280
it's able to shift its
production system quickly

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.620
onto new styles that
seem to be emerging.

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:05.595
Whereas if you shipping
that style across, say,

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:08.680
8,000 miles of ocean
in a container ship

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.990
that's moving at 8 and 1/2
knots, you're not in the game.

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:16.900
So Zara has figured
out how to keep

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:21.370
that relationship between
production facility, market,

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:25.420
and sales facility very
tight, and therefore, be

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.940
able to serve emerging markets.

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.040
Fashion is somewhat
different than other areas,

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.230
but the point, I
think, is still there.

01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:34.780
But serve emerging
markets very quickly--

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.500
so rising to your
market opportunities

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.610
in very short periods of time.

01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:40.293
How's that, Martin?

01:11:40.293 --> 01:11:41.710
AUDIENCE: Pretty
much what they do

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:43.790
is they go into the Fashion
Week, and they're like,

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:45.100
oh, this is a really
expensive thing.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.420
What we're going to do
is we're going to find

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.628
a very cheap way of doing it.

01:11:47.628 --> 01:11:51.190
They have it on the market
by two weeks pretty much.

01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:54.130
They like rapidly design and
they go for a low price point,

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:56.630
and then they'll put
it into the market,

01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:59.293
and then people will buy it.

01:11:59.293 --> 01:12:00.460
You're not buying for value.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:01.630
You're buying because
this is trendy,

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:03.170
and I don't want to spend much.

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:05.320
And that's kind of their
value prop right now.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.540
because they're usually
slightly more than H&M,

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.467
but it's just that
right model for I

01:12:09.467 --> 01:12:11.050
want to buy a good
amount, and I don't

01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:14.250
want to look like I'm
from 10 years ago.

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.250
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Does
that sound right, Lily?

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:17.300
OK.

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.200
AUDIENCE: But yeah, I would
have to look at the data of how

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:19.900
their sales reflected.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.330
Because I think
some people do care,

01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:22.705
or they might act
like they care,

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:25.278
but probably when they
vote with their dollar--

01:12:25.278 --> 01:12:26.820
because there's Zara
and there's H&M,

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.470
but there's not too
much of a difference.

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:30.303
And I'm pretty sure
they different products.

01:12:30.303 --> 01:12:32.460
So somebody might be
like, I really like

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.392
this sweater from Zara, so
I'll definitely go that way.

01:12:36.392 --> 01:12:38.850
I would debate that there's a
very small percentage that'll

01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:41.480
be like, I'm totally never going
to buy from the store again--

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.438
or I'm totally not going
to buy from this store

01:12:43.438 --> 01:12:46.190
again, and then not
go back to buying

01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:47.535
from like two weeks later.

01:12:47.535 --> 01:12:49.910
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So I'm
going to bring us back to Mac,

01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:52.930
since we've now gone off
to into the fashion world--

01:12:52.930 --> 01:12:54.260
back to some more fundamental.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:55.350
Do you have some
closing points you

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:56.642
want to make on Suzanne's book?

01:12:56.642 --> 01:12:59.687
What do you think
is really key in it?

01:12:59.687 --> 01:13:01.770
AUDIENCE: I think one real
key point that maybe we

01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:05.520
didn't get as much to
talk on is that maybe we

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.890
have, as Americans, this
idea of a birthright to being

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:15.660
at the forefront of
innovation, and really

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:20.520
pointing out that no one
who's completed and sitting

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.960
on their laurels will
stay in that position.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.400
I think there's a good
contrast between her ideas

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.278
on outsourcing versus Berger's.

01:13:32.278 --> 01:13:33.618
Something to think about.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:34.660
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Good.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.850
Good point, Matthew.

01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:42.140
All right, that brings us
to our closing reading.

01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:52.590
This is one of MIT's great
provosts, Joel Moses,

01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:56.850
who was deeply
involved in the early

01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:00.150
and, indeed, later stages
of the computing revolution.

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:04.470
So this is a young Joel
at project MAC at MIT,

01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:08.880
which is MIT's
implementation engine

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.810
for a lot of the early
computing advances.

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:16.800
So Joel steps back and
writes this fun piece, which

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.950
I wanted to throw
in here at the end,

01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:25.110
to pick up our determinism
theme one more time.

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:27.360
We've been talking about
different kinds of innovation

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.250
systems and how
different countries have

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.140
varieties of capitalism
and varieties

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:33.060
of innovation systems.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:37.610
And Joel takes us back
a step and gives us more

01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:42.530
of a 10,000-foot kind
of look, which I was--

01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:45.590
I've always been intrigued with.

01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:51.560
He argues that there are three
fundamentally different design

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.340
methodologies.

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:56.450
So this is a design methodology
in a societal sense,

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:59.120
rather than engineering design,
that Matthew was leading us

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.910
through earlier.

01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:04.610
And he argues that,
historically, the US

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:09.920
has used what he calls
a tree and branch

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.310
organizational
attempt, which creates

01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:16.640
very hierarchical firms.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:23.030
And he argues that this
very hierarchical system--

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:27.470
and you can picture with the
organization chart looks--

01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:32.390
it's like a tree, top
management all the way down

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:36.350
through many different
hierarchies of levels--

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.840
that that fits a mass
production company.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.342
This is the kind of economy
that was compelled coming out

01:15:42.342 --> 01:15:43.550
of the Industrial Revolution.

01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:49.540
And it's organized
for manufacturing

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:54.820
at a national scale for
national markets, where

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.490
a lot of vertical
integration is required.

01:15:57.490 --> 01:16:00.970
So think about the big
three US car companies.

01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:03.880
Now, then he makes an
interesting additional point,

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:10.240
which is this, by the way,
fits an Aristotelian hierarchy

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.210
of ordered knowledge.

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:19.630
This is the way in which Western
thought organizes science.

01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:21.310
That's what Aristotle
is doing, he's

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:23.030
creating these tree
and branch systems.

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:27.880
Surprise, it shows up in
industrial organization

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.560
in the West.

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.220
But he argues that the
tree and branch hierarchy

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:38.260
means tremendous inflexibility
and great difficulty

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.810
in managing change,
because you've

01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:43.570
got to bring all those
different systems, all

01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:48.100
those different levels in the
line in order to pursue change.

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:54.770
So the second design
methodology is around what

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:56.270
he calls a layered system.

01:16:56.270 --> 01:17:00.860
And he argues that Japan's
incredible success of the '70s

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:05.000
and '80s is not just the
different industrial model,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.360
a quality production model.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.860
It's deeper than that.

01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:11.510
There's a whole
social organization

01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:14.720
set of issues that's
coming with it.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.270
And [INAUDIBLE],, you
were driving towards some

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:20.210
of these points, I think.

01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:31.290
So in Japan's system, there
are separate layered levels,

01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:35.040
and you tend to move
through your career

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.440
with your age cohort.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.700
And as a group, you move
from level to level.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:46.110
And there's obviously
several levels here.

01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:49.020
It's much less tree and
branch hierarchical.

01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:54.270
It is pretty flat
within that age cohort.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:58.470
And you tend to know that you're
going to move with your level

01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:00.540
into successive position.

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:06.960
So it forces a significant
amount of consensus.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:13.470
So Joel's interesting comparison
is this is Plato's Republic--

01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:16.860
the philosopher king, the
guardians, the citizens--

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.690
those are kind of layers.

01:18:18.690 --> 01:18:25.230
So not an Aristotelian,
but a Platonic model.

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:29.580
And then he says
there's a third.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:36.690
And this is the network model
that the US nurtured coming out

01:18:36.690 --> 01:18:42.390
of the IT revolution, which
is much flatter, much less

01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:44.100
hierarchical.

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:48.480
Not even layered--
it's pretty flat.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:53.520
And it's driven by the
collaborative group innovation

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:58.905
systems that are required
for the development of the IT

01:18:58.905 --> 01:19:01.030
sector--

01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:02.910
that a rigid tree
and branch hierarchy

01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:07.260
is just not going to work
in that IT world, which

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:08.940
requires a tremendous
amount of almost

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.820
democratization of workforce.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:16.260
So back, Martin, to
your Andy Grove analogy,

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:19.860
when the leaders of Intel--

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:24.750
when Bob Noyce, and Grove, and
Gordon Moore were setting up

01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:30.120
Intel, there are no offices.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.770
Everybody's got a
cubicle, including

01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:33.200
Noyce, and Moore, and Grove.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:45.300
The network model, Joel
argues, is actually

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:47.610
much faster, and
much more flexible,

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:52.260
and much more subject to change
than even the layered model

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.760
that Japan brings about.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.340
And so you start
thinking here, gee, it's

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.550
no wonder the US
auto industry got

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:04.110
rolled when it came up
against Japan's layered model.

01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:06.810
And then you start thinking,
oh, no wonder Japan

01:20:06.810 --> 01:20:09.300
missed the IT revolution,
if the organizational model

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.633
required this network.

01:20:10.633 --> 01:20:12.300
Now, look, these are
highly speculative.

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.337
We'll never prove these.

01:20:14.337 --> 01:20:16.170
They're really only for
discussion purposes.

01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:19.450
All of us know that are more
complex stories behind it.

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:24.030
But I think there is an
idea about the relationship

01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:28.200
between social
organization and the kind

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:31.710
of industrial developments that
your society is going through,

01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:36.330
and the kind of organizational
models that those compel.

01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:42.430
Joel's great complaint
is that engineering

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:48.780
lacks the models
to be able to grasp

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.730
these different
organizational structures,

01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:54.750
that you can't really fit
that within a traditional kind

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:58.800
of engineering analysis, and
that engineering, therefore,

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.230
needs to rethink this.

01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:02.850
That's part of the
reason why he's

01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:07.950
a major leader of MIT's
Engineering Systems

01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:11.700
Division, which, of course,
has now been closed.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.640
But that's part of what Joel
and some of his colleagues

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.360
are trying to do, when
they set up BSD at MIT.

01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:28.080
I just want to close out
by saying that there's

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.830
another thing that
we'll need to consider,

01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:31.810
as we move into
next week's class--

01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:34.600
that the whole
nature of competition

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.190
is changing in manufacturing,
that it's no longer

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:41.260
a world of manufacturing
goods, it's

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.570
a world of
manufactured goods that

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:48.610
are fused with IT technologies
that, in turn, are

01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.180
service delivery models.

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:54.700
So there's a whole fusion of
services and manufacturing

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.130
going on that makes some of
the stories we've been talking

01:21:57.130 --> 01:21:59.170
about today more complicated.

01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:04.680
In past decades, the
story was quality.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:07.620
Now, there's a whole
level of customization,

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:10.140
and speed, and
customer responsiveness

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.990
that we have to
think about, as well.

01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:14.730
And your ability to
get on top of those,

01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:18.300
as well as on
quality, becomes key.

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.370
It's not simply the
best technology,

01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:24.750
but it's the best technology
plus the best business models

01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:29.410
and delivery models that
have to be thought about.

01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:32.550
There used to be traded
goods, traded product.

01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:36.180
Now, there's traded all
kinds of knowledge management

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.180
and services that are tied
to these products that

01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:45.040
becomes critical factors
in your ability to compete.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.620
In the past, it was the
workforce skills side.

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:52.130
Now, it's much more continuous
learning in your workforce.

01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:54.320
Then it was low cost of capital.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.510
Now, it's efficiency in
all the financial services

01:22:58.510 --> 01:23:02.080
stages that you've got to
get through the hurdles of,

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.300
not just the initial
capital cost.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.800
And there's a whole evolution
of intangible capital, as well.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.940
So there's a whole
new set of factors

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:16.900
that's coming into the
manufacturing world, that we've

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:20.380
only started to glimpse
from today's discussion.

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:25.530
But let's go back to Joel
and his three models.

01:23:25.530 --> 01:23:27.370
Chris, it's all yours.

01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:31.000
AUDIENCE: So to
summarize, Joel is

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.850
presenting these three models--

01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:35.740
the hierarchical
decomposition model,

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:39.670
where it's the branch tree
structure, the network design

01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:44.590
model, and then the
layered design model.

01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:48.070
And then he basically goes on
to outline a bunch of examples

01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:49.510
where you could present--

01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:52.870
or sorry, apply
different methodologies

01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:54.730
into analyzing various systems.

01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:58.540
So he goes through a
philosophy example,

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:03.500
he goes through manufacturing,
even more science-based--

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.890
so like the models of
the human mind and body.

01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:08.860
And one of them I found
particularly interesting

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:11.350
was where he brought
up culture, and how

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:14.920
preconceptions of how
engineering and manufacturing

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.470
is viewed here
versus, let's say,

01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:21.820
Germany or Japan has
really impacted the way

01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:24.400
these countries have
responded towards shifts

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:28.690
in manufacturing, and how that
industry develops-- and also

01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:31.090
how cooperation in
Japanese culture

01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:34.660
has really allowed
the precipitous rise

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:38.800
of their industry and
manufacturing capabilities,

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.640
and how that shaped and kind
of forced American firms

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.585
to adopt a similar structure
or methodology in order

01:24:47.585 --> 01:24:48.085
to compete.

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:53.080
Interestingly enough,
a lot of the examples

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.640
were not really
engineering-based,

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:59.770
even though he started from the
hierarchical model, which is

01:24:59.770 --> 01:25:01.810
seen very often in engineering.

01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:03.910
And I thought that was
really interesting.

01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:06.790
And we can definitely go
into some of the examples

01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:09.790
more, if anyone has a
particular one to go into.

01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:13.090
But to start off the discussion.

01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:15.430
I thought this question
was really interesting.

01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:18.190
How does a country shift
from a tree structure--

01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:20.020
so the hierarchy one--

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:22.120
to a more layered or
network structure,

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.490
once it's already
been established?

01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:29.050
So if there's any thoughts,
feel free to throw them out.

01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:31.030
AUDIENCE: So I
took a class called

01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:33.150
structural organizations,
and it talks about--

01:25:33.150 --> 01:25:35.192
so it's not like there's
a right or wrong answer.

01:25:35.192 --> 01:25:37.220
It just really depends
what you're trying to do.

01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:38.275
So in general, it's
more networked,

01:25:38.275 --> 01:25:40.300
it means you want to
make better decisions.

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.908
But the drawback is it'll
take a much longer time.

01:25:42.908 --> 01:25:44.950
Hierarchical, you might
not make great decisions,

01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:46.367
but you'll make
them very quickly.

01:25:46.367 --> 01:25:49.360
And as long as people
respect the person who's

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.372
making the decision, it turns
out to be pretty much OK.

01:25:52.372 --> 01:25:54.580
In terms of a company, I
think it really does depend,

01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:57.730
because I think the
network structure works

01:25:57.730 --> 01:25:59.340
great for like a
Facebook or something

01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:01.840
with internet base, where you're
really competing for ideas,

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.715
you're trying to come
up with the best ideas.

01:26:03.715 --> 01:26:06.010
Things move quickly, so you
want to iterate quickly.

01:26:06.010 --> 01:26:07.195
Versus, I think, if
it was manufacturing,

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:08.426
I wouldn't want that as much.

01:26:12.163 --> 01:26:13.830
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Chris, did you agree

01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:15.660
with Joel's presentation here?

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:18.210
Do these models
make sense to you?

01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:22.095
[INAUDIBLE] got an interesting
story out here or--

01:26:22.095 --> 01:26:23.687
what do you think?

01:26:23.687 --> 01:26:25.270
AUDIENCE: I thought
it was interesting

01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:29.050
how he presented three
frameworks for looking

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:31.270
at different firms,
and then went

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:35.680
about applying that model
to different situations,

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.570
companies, industries.

01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:39.520
I thought that was interesting.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.220
Again, just like some of
you, I had a little bit

01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:45.520
of trouble distinguishing
between some of them

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.540
as I was reading it.

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:53.380
So perhaps going into
more about defining

01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:55.330
the differences between
the different models,

01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:59.260
and also maybe even
trying to generalize which

01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:02.410
model would be applicable to--

01:27:02.410 --> 01:27:06.580
what characteristics would be
most amenable to these models,

01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:10.270
that could be an
interesting additional step.

01:27:12.825 --> 01:27:15.200
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right,
I think on that good note,

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.760
we'll end a few minutes early.

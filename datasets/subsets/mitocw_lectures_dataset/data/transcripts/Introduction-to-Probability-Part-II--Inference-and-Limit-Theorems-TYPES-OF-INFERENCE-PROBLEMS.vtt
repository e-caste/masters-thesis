00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.360
Before we dive into the
heart of the subject,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.170
I want to make a few comments
on the different problem

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.750
types that show up in
the field of inference.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.940
You can think of a
general distinction

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.390
between model building
versus making inferences

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.140
about unobserved variables.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.560
We said a little
earlier that one

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.070
of the main uses of
the field of inference

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.820
is to construct models
of certain situations.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.370
But in many cases, we
already have a model.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.150
On the other hand, there may
be variables that are unknown,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.550
that are unobserved-- variables
that are part of the model,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.700
but whose values are not known.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.070
In such cases, we
still want to use

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.890
data to make some
predictions or decisions

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.310
about those
unobserved variables.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.200
So model building might or
might not be part of the problem

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.010
that we're dealing with.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.830
To illustrate the difference
between these two versions

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.690
of the problem, let us
think of a concrete setting.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.060
You have a transmitter
who is sending a signal.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.180
Call it S. And that signal
goes through some medium.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.000
It could be just the atmosphere.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.460
And what that medium does
is that it attenuates

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.340
the signal by a
certain factor, a.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.240
And then as the signal travels,
it also gets hit by some noise,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.670
call it W, and what the
receiver sees is an observation,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.780
X. So the situation is described
by this simple equation here.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.120
This situation often brings
up the following inference

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.710
problem.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.720
We want to find out
what the medium is.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.560
How do we do this?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.190
We send a pilot
signal, S, that is

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.759
a signal that we
know what it is.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.220
We observe X, and then
using this equation,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.050
and, knowing that W
is random noise coming

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.509
from some distribution,
we try to make

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.860
an inference about
the variable a.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.260
So this is an instance
of model building.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.010
We're trying to make a model
of the medium that's involved.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.370
But we can also think
of a different problem.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.270
Suppose that we know
what the medium is.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.320
Perhaps we already went through
this particular phase here.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.220
But we're sitting
at the receiver,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.079
and we do not know
what has been sent.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.230
And we want to
find out what S is.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.700
So we are looking
again at this equation.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.840
This time we know
a, and we're trying

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.220
to make inferences about S.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.140
You notice that these two
versions of the problem

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.390
are essentially of the same
mathematical structure.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.840
We have a linear equation.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.930
In one case, we know S.
We want to find out a.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.070
In the other case, we know a.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.980
We want to find out what S is.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.030
So even though
the interpretation

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.510
of these two problems
[is] quite different,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.560
the mathematical structure
is exactly the same.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.690
This is fortunate.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.820
It means that one and
the same methodology

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.780
would be applicable to
both types of problems.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.730
There is another distinction
between problem types

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.100
which turns out to be a
little more substantial.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.829
There are problems that we call
hypothesis testing problems.

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.460
In those problems the
unknown takes one out

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.710
of a few possible values.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.040
That is, we may have a
few different alternative

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.190
models of the world.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.120
And we're trying to figure
out which one of those models

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.550
is the correct one.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.620
We're going to decide in favor
of one of the candidate models,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.329
and what we want to
achieve is that we

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.900
make a correct decision.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.170
Or if not, we want to
have a small probability

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.000
of making an incorrect decision.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.450
An example of this kind is
the radar detection problem

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.170
that we had discussed in the
very beginning of this course,

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.620
in which we were
getting a signal.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.200
We were getting a radar reading.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.880
And the question was
to make an inference

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.470
whether the radar is
seeing an airplane

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.830
or whether an airplane
is not present.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.070
So in hypothesis
testing problems,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.600
we're essentially
making a choice

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.480
out of a small number of
discrete possible choices.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.740
Instead, in estimation
problems, the unknown quantities

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.480
are more of a numerical type.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.390
They could even take
continuous values.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.000
And what we want
to do is to come up

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.400
with an estimate of an
unknown quantity that

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.510
is close to the true but
unknown value of the quantity

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.540
that we're trying to estimate.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.870
So here, our
performance objective

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.200
is in terms of some kind
of distance function.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.710
We want to be
close to the truth.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.310
And typically, we have a
continuum of possible choices

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.210
that is, our estimates can
be general real numbers.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.080
Generally speaking, these two
types of problems, hypothesis

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.270
testing and estimation, have
some significant differences

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.360
in the way that
they are treated,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.999
as we will be seeing next.

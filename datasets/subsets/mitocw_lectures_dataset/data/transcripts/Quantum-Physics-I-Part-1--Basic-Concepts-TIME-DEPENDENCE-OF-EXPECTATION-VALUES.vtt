00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.600
PROFESSOR: It's a statement
about the time dependence

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.420
of the expectation values.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.325
It's a pretty
fundamental theorem.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.230
So here it goes.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.910
You have d dt of the
expectation value

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.130
of Q. This is what
we want to evaluate.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:36.810
We Now this would be d dt of
integral psi star of x and t,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.720
Q psi of x and t.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.250
And the d dt acts
on the two of them.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.230
So it gives you integral
partial psi star dt Q

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:05.950
psi of x and t plus psi
star Q partial psi dt.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.065
And this is the
integral over the x.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.600
You've seen that kind of stuff.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.030
And what is it?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.980
Well, integral dx, this is
this Schrodinger equation,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:46.655
d psi star dt is i
over h bar, H psi star.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.850
From the Schrodinger equation.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.920
Then you have the
Q psi of x and t.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.330
On this term, you will
have a very similar thing.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:19.820
Minus i over H bar this time,
psi star QH psi of x and t.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.520
So we use the
Schrodinger equation

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.825
in the form, i d psi dt--

00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:30.470
i H bar d psi dt--

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.780
equal H psi.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.620
I used it twice.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.140
So then, it's actually
convenient to multiply here

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:55.600
by i H bar d dt of Q. So
I multiplied by i H bar,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.330
and I will cancel the i
and the H bar in this term,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.060
minus them this term.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:20.030
So we'll have d cube x psi star
Q H hat psi minus H hat psi

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.980
star cube psi.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.820
OK.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.450
Things have simplified
very nicely.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.780
And there's just one
more thing we can do.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.030
Look, this is the
product of Q and H.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.780
But by hermiticity,
H in here can

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.000
be brought to the other side
to act on this wave function.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:02.950
So this is actually equal to
the integral d cube dx psi star

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.240
QH hat psi minus--

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.690
the H can go to the other side--

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.439
psi star H cube psi.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:27.880
But then, what do we see there?

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.810
We recognize a commutator.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.350
This commutator is just
like we did for x and p,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.280
and we started practicing
how to compute them.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.570
They show up here.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.320
And this is maybe one of the
reasons commutators are so

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.870
important in quantum mechanics.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.785
So what do we have here?

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:56.500
i H bar d dt of the
expectation value of Q

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:10.240
is equal to the integral dx
of psi star, QH minus HQ psi.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.990
This is all of x and t.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:29.340
Well, this is nothing else
but the commutator of Q and H.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:39.420
So our final result is that
iH bar d dt of the expectation

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.560
value of Q is equal to--

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.690
look.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.870
It's the expectation
value of the commutator.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.630
Remember, expectation
value for an operator--

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.120
the operator is the
thing here-- so this

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:07.190
is nothing else than the
expectation value of Q with H.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.170
This is actually a
pretty important result.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.640
It has all the dynamics of the
physics in the observables.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.300
Look, the wave functions
used to change in time.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.820
Due to their change in
time, the expectation values

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.610
of the operators change in time.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.970
Because this integral
can't depend on time.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.480
But here what you
have succeeded is

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.430
to represent the change in
time of the expectation value--

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.350
the change in time
of the position

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.020
that you expect you
find your particle--

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.190
in terms of the expectation
value of a commutator

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.960
with a Hamiltonian.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.720
So if some quantity
commutes with a Hamiltonian,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.440
its expectation value
will not change in time.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.540
If you have a Hamiltonian,
say with a free particle,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.130
well, the momentum
commutes with this.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.950
Therefore the expected
value of the momentum,

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.910
you already know, since
the momentum commutes

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.410
with H. This is 0.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.600
The expected value of this is 0.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.200
And the expected value of
the momentum will not change,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.860
will be conserved.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.450
So conservation laws
in quantum mechanics

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.860
have to do with things that
commute with the Hamiltonian.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.690
And it's an idea we're
going to develop on and on.

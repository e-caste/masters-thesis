00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.450
GILBERT STRANG: OK,
let me start again.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.430
Thanks for helping
with Professor Rao

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.470
and working on the labs
the last two times.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.420
I was saying the
labs were really

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.000
for his class,
which is 90 minutes,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.930
so that we were kind of running
out of time just answering

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.660
those questions, getting the
system to say, OK, keep going.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.700
Anyway, he's going
to develop those.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.740
And I think they'll
be a good thing.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.140
So actually, the second
lab, as I was watching it,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.000
I was thinking of
a math question.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.940
And may I report to you
on that math question?

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.810
So you remember the lab
was completing a matrix.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.710
You got some entries.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.860
And you can put in any other
entries in the other positions.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.775
And the question was can you
complete it to a rank 1 matrix?

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.110
Here's my question.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.380
What positions are OK?

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.870
And what positions
could you maybe not

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.160
be able to complete
to a rank 1 matrix?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.310
Examples are the best.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.370
So I'm looking at
this question here.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:58.890
OK, I'm looking for a rank 1
matrix of the form x column y

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.530
transpose, or uv
transpose, I guess.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.039
Those are the letters where
you used to, uv transpose.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.955
And that means of course
that aij is ui times vj.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.140
So we're able to choose--

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.915
we have m u's.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.680
Let me ask a question.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.330
Could I complete-- so let
me take m equal n equal 3.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.740
So a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.810
I'm going to give you m
plus n minus 1, which is 3

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.931
plus 3 minus 1, five positions.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:10.600
And suppose I give non-zeros
in which five positions?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.230
So where is that number m
plus n minus 1 coming from?

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.260
Well, because I have
m u's and I have

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.490
n v's for a rank 1 matrix--

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.990
i goes from 1 to m,
j goes from 1 to n.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.940
So I have m plus n.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.210
But obviously I could require
the first u to be a 1.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.300
In other words, when
I'm multiplying those,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.700
there is one degree of freedom
that is sort of repeated here,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.530
because if I'm just given--

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.710
anyway, you see it,
that I can rescale the u

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.470
so that the first u is a 1.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.580
And that leave me
m plus n minus 1.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.700
So could I give you
these five numbers

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.490
and could you complete
that to a rank 1 matrix?

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.899
So those are non-zeros.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.300
Why do I say non-zeros?

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.690
Because if that number
happened to be a zero,

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.370
I'd have bad news there.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.510
If I prescribed that one and
I prescribed it to be zero,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.640
then if every column has to
be a multiple of that column,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.710
these would all have to be 0.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.970
So I don't want that.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.790
I want to be able to
prescribe five numbers.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.970
And therefore, they
better not be zero.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.850
Could you complete the
job with that choice

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.980
of a five positions?

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.270
I think you could.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.800
Because how would you
decide on that number?

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.540
Well, I mean at
least one way to look

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.630
at it is, what would
that number be there?

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.740
That number would be chosen.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.860
There would be one and only
one choice for that that

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.360
would give rank 1.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.730
In fact, that little 2 by 2
determinant would have to be?

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.710
0, right?

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.690
All the columns are supposed
to be multiples of one column.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.360
All the rows are supposed
to be multiples of one row.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.830
All the 2 by 2s are rank 1.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.210
And rank 1 for a 2 by
2 means determinant 0.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.910
So I would know what
that one had to be.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:01.320
That number would have to be
a 1 2 times a 2 1 over a 1 1.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.090
Every 2 by determinant
has to be 0 here.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.940
If I want rank 1,
I can't stand any 2

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.230
by 2s that are
invertible matrices.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.250
So all the determinants
have to be zero.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.160
And, of course, then
these three numbers

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.560
would allow me to fill in there.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.160
Those three numbers would
allow me to fill that.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.580
Those three numbers will
allow me to fill that.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.770
It would be easy, easy.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.290
So that I can see that those
are five positions that work.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.500
Now, give me five
positions that won't work.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.000
So this is good.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.410
This is check.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.370
Now, I want one where
I can't make it work.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.315
So let me give that
number, that number.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.240
So I'm looking for
something that fails,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.010
a set of positions that fails.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.090
And then I want to be able to
test, does the set of positions

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.210
work for any non-zeros
or does it not work?

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.360
What am I looking for here?

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.970
A different one that works?

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.320
OK, so what else would
work, apart from that?

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.870
Let's see, I suppose
I take that one.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.290
Now, what about
that position there?

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.600
I must not choose
that one, right?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.260
I must not choose that one,
because that would complete a 2

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.940
by 2.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.460
And if I gave the wrong
numbers, the determinant

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.330
wouldn't be zero.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.740
And I would be failed.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.330
So I must not give
that position.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.370
Maybe I could give
that position.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.550
Maybe I could give this one.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.930
How's that?

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.470
If I had those five, would
I be able to complete?

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.160
It looks good anyway.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.250
It looks good.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.770
Let's see, how would I
go about completing that?

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.530
Let's see, I would
know what that number

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.380
had to be from this 2 by 2.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.280
From this 2 by 2, I
would know that number.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.980
From this-- where now?

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.900
This and this and this,
no, that's not any good.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.840
What do I do now?

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.420
How would I get this number?

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.760
Oh, OK, I guess I have to use--

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.010
this would complete that.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.000
Oh, this 2 by 2, oh,
yeah, OK, no problem.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.950
That would complete
that one, right?

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:47.710
But this one, I don't think
I can get immediately.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.000
But I can get it.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.170
Once I know these, then
obviously I can get that,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:53.950
right?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.840
So it's sort of nice
combinatorial problem.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.300
Which five positions will work?

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.980
Which five will not work?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.710
How do I tell?

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.210
Of course, that's for a 3 by 3.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.530
Yeah, so let me--

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.580
I had like a bigger example.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.390
Let me move up to 4 by 4.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:24.190
So here comes the idea
that I learned last night

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.360
from a math professor
who does combinatorics.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.350
So these people who
do combinatorics,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.570
they know stuff that
the rest of us don't.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:45.850
So his view is these would
be rows, one, two, three.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.070
I may add another row.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.860
Let me do a 4 by 4.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:56.440
And these would be columns,
one, two, three, four.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.810
Now, I'm looking for seven--

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:04.330
so if I prescribe an entry, I'll
put in an edge between them.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.630
So let me let me hype
this one up to 4 by 4.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.360
Here, a good one.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.980
Actually, I'll just
draw this picture.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.100
So suppose I prescribe
the 1, 1-- oh, yeah,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.530
and over here I'll show
you what I've done.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.160
So that I'm putting
in the 1, 1 position.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.620
I'm looking for 7, right?

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.860
4 plus 4 minus 1, seven numbers.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.670
OK.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.320
Then, I'll put in,
this is row 2 column 1.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.110
Row 2 column 1,
that would be there.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.930
Then I'll put in a 2 to 4.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:49.140
So that would be
row 2, column 4.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.530
Then I'll put in a 3 to 4.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.920
So that would be
row 3, column 4.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.700
And finally, I'll put in--

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.100
let's see, so how
many have I done?

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.280
One, two, three, four,
and I've got to get up

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.970
to seven, prescribed seven.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:15.060
Well, I'll put more in.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.140
So on row 4, I gave 2, 3, and 4.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.080
And did I put in this one?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.940
Yes, I did.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.090
So I've now prescribed
seven numbers.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:41.230
Could I complete the
matrix to a rank 1 matrix?

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.340
You see the math question.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.850
If I'm given seven
positions there--

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.850
this is another way to
look at the same picture.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.810
This is I put in an
edge for every x.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:02.070
So if I have seven x's,
I've got seven edges.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.060
And this is called
a bipartite graph.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.050
So it's a graph.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.680
I've got four nodes
here, four nodes here.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.960
So I have eight nodes.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.800
It's a bipartite
graph because I have

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.370
one part of nodes over there,
one part of nodes here.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.980
Bipartite means two parts.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.460
So the rows give me
one part of the edges.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.550
The columns give me the
other part of the edges.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:33.500
And all the connections
go between the parts.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.420
I don't have any lines
from a row to a row,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:49.100
because the whole code is that
this tells me where those seven

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.930
positions are.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:56.360
Now, I'm just going ask you,
can I complete the graph?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.340
Can I complete the matrix?

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.460
Can I complete rank
1 matrix there?

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.060
What do you think?

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:12.380
And the real question
is, what's the rule?

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.520
How can I see when I
can't complete the matrix,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.290
something gets in the way?

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:23.490
Here, what got in the
way was this 2 by 2.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.830
And actually, I asked
the question on email,

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.620
can I always complete it--
yeah, so that would be

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.390
the question I could ask you.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.420
Can I always
complete the graph--

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:43.430
complete the matrix to have rank
1 when I don't run into this?

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:48.050
Is that all I have
to avoid, a 2 by 2,

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.430
where I'm given all
four entries-- oh, yeah,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.600
this I was able to complete.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.200
Sorry to-- let's do one.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:08.720
If I'm given those entries
and maybe some others,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.180
I guess seven altogether,
that's a failure.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.440
I can't prescribe any non-zeros
in those seven positions,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.380
because if I prescribe
any non-zeros,

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.790
I probably won't have a
zero determinant here.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.260
I won't have rank 1.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.030
That column will not be a
multiple of that column.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.390
Whatever I do here,
I've screwed up already.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.500
So that's a fail.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:48.530
Let me take that picture and
turn it into this picture, so

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.570
rows, columns.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:55.040
So if I take these
seven, that's a row 1--

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.050
row 1, 2, 3, 4, so
row 1 goes to 1 and 2.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.470
Row 2 goes to 1 and 2.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.530
Row 3 goes to 4.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.520
And row 4 goes to 3 and 4.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.360
That's a failure.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.040
And how do I know
it's a failure?

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.190
I want to now come
up with the answer.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:27.180
So if I give any seven
positions or any m plus n

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:33.270
minus 1 positions like that, I
can create a graph like that,

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.730
just following the
rule that you saw.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:41.270
Those seven positions gave
me seven edges in my graph.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.980
And it's a bipartite
graph because every edge

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.230
goes from this part
over to this park.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.000
And that's a failure.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.790
And the reason it's a failure
is that I have here a cycle.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:03.390
If I go across,
down, across, down, I

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.560
come back where I started.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.740
That would be a
cycle equals failure.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:22.480
Everybody see I can't give
these four numbers generally.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.120
Once I've given you three,
I don't have any freedom

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.170
left with that fourth one.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.220
And the way to see
that in this picture

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.700
is that there's a cycle.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.890
So here is the
combinatorics thing

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:42.340
that Professor Postnikov
told me about last night.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.630
You can complete to a
rank 1 matrix if and only

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.750
if no cycles.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:59.710
So that just answered
my question perfectly.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:04.030
This one is one where I can't
complete, and it's got a cycle.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.660
A cycle meaning you come
back to where you started.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:19.560
So my question to him was,
can you always complete it

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.760
if there are no 2
by 2s in the way?

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:29.760
And his answers told me that
maybe the 2 by 2s could be OK,

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.160
but there could be a
bigger cycle, a longer

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.200
cycle that would screw you up.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.590
So let me close with an
example of that sort.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:46.230
So this is going
to be fail again.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:52.470
But no 2 by 2 is responsible.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.950
In other words,
it's going to fail.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.680
I won't be able to
complete this matrix,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.810
even though there aren't
any completed 2 by 2s.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.440
The 2 by 2, I knew
immediately was failure.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.000
So let me see if I can do that.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.880
So here's a failure.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.440
This is rows 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.000
And this is columns 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.790
And I think I'm going
to have 1 given there.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.550
And I sort of
started this before.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:34.290
And 2 goes to 1 and 4.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.605
And 3 goes to 4.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.760
And 4 goes to--

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.300
let's see.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.150
OK, now, I've only
put it in 2, 4, 5.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.680
And I'm allowed seven.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.760
But I think I'm already
in trouble here.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.570
So let me draw this
picture for that.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.020
So this is rows 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.330
And this is column 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.300
And now, I've
prescribed that one.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.300
Oh, no, that goes from--

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.000
oh, I've forgotten the
right way to do the picture.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.740
My bipartite graph wasn't
what it should have been.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:36.660
So the 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.820
OK, now I'm going to do the
bipartite graph picture that

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.170
goes with this picture.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.870
So 1 to 1.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:45.545
2 to 1.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.190
2 to 4.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.500
But what I'm going to do--

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.660
let me just say what
I'm going to do.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:01.370
I'm going to create a cycle
over here of length 6.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:06.340
A cycle of length 4 is
what I got from a 2 by 2.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.860
From my 2 by 2, that
took me one way, back

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.560
another, back
another, back another.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.920
I completed a cycle.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.390
I came back to where I
started with just four edges.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:23.740
Now, I want to complete
a cycle with six edges.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.000
So let me draw it
in the picture here.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.410
Now, I'm going to put an
edge from 4 back to 1.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:44.550
So 1 to 1, 1 to
4, 2 to 1, 2 to 4.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.930
Have I got any--

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:49.060
I think 1, 2, ah, damn.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.280
I didn't want a short cycle.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.740
I want a bigger, longer cycle.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.690
Let me get the darn thing here.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.140
So 2 to 4 is not what I want.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.630
So I start a cycle.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.500
OK, go somewhere.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.460
Go back.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.270
Go somewhere.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.380
Go back.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.610
Go somewhere.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.300
Go back.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.970
Now, there I got it.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.340
Length six.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.030
Length six.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.180
So let me put the x's
in where they belong.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.240
So 1 is connected to 1 and 4.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.200
That's right.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.255
2 is connected to 2 and 4.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.920
3 is not connected to anybody.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.690
Let's put that one in.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.910
And 4 is connected to 1 and 2.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.090
4 is connected to 1 and 2.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:45.280
OK, I believe that picture
goes with that picture.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.780
Now, my claim is
that there are no

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:57.260
there is no 2 by 2 in here that
shows me immediately failure.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.360
But I will fail--

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.420
I can't live with those--

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.520
that looks like eight.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.195
Sorry, I only want seven.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.990
So shall I just take--

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.264
sorry?

00:22:14.264 --> 00:22:18.120
AUDIENCE: You've got
3, 4 in the wrong spot.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.120
GILBERT STRANG: 3, 4, and
it shouldn't be there.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.130
All right, OK, thanks.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.270
Right.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.400
You see I'm not a
combinatorics person.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.450
But it's so beautiful
to have the inspiration

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.930
to convert that
picture to this picture

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:38.410
and then realize that a
problem in this picture

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.650
is a cycle in this picture.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.360
That's the whole message.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.230
That's the whole message,
that when I'm looking here

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:52.320
a cycle means that I've
built in a requirement, which

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.780
random non-zeros won't satisfy.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.130
So you see that anyway.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:05.580
You see the cycle, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, yeah.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.710
So there's a cycle there.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:13.320
So somehow those six
x's, whichever they are--

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.140
I guess all but the 3 by 3.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:21.030
So I could take away
this part of the graph

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:26.820
and just have 3 and 3, and there
would be 6 numbers in there

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.540
and that's too many.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.573
OK, I'm going to stop
there exactly half way

00:23:33.573 --> 00:23:34.365
through that class.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.780
Well, I'm going to stop
there with a question, which

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.100
I don't know if I dare send
another question to Professor

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.830
Postnikov, who answered
this one perfectly.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.950
But my question would
be, when could you

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.920
complete a rank 2 matrix?

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:58.920
What positions could you fill
in and be able to reach rank 2?

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.860
That would be trouble, right?

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.850
I don't know where we
would go with that.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:11.670
But for us, for 18.065,
that's the natural question.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.460
Rank 1 is super special for us.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:21.330
And rank 2 or rank R
would be the general case.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.510
So they're good math questions.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:29.250
Now, topic 2, convolution.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:38.450
So the first lab
in the course just

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.410
happened to have a convolution
and used that word and so on.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:53.030
But we didn't connect
that with the lectures.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.150
So now, I'd like to
talk about convolutions,

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.360
which are extremely important.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.040
And they are
important in machine

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:12.470
learning because they give you
a set of weights connecting--

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.800
they're an efficient way to--

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.760
let me show you.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.600
Let me show you.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.495
So a convolution matrix--

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.760
and this will be a cyclic
convolution matrix.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:44.030
And the shorthand for
cyclic convolution matrix

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:44.822
is circulant.

00:25:44.822 --> 00:25:46.280
So what does a
circulant look like?

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.990
I'll call it C.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:54.140
A circulant has
constant diagonals.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.080
That's what convolution
means matrix wise.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.925
Convolution means constant
down each diagonal.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:19.640
And cyclic means complete,
circle around again.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:27.560
The diagonals circle around.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.300
So I'll just show
you what I mean.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.500
So 4 by 4, let's say.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.480
So it has some entry to--

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.010
there's one diagonal.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.140
Here is another diagonal.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.130
So now I have
constant diagonals.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.440
But if it's going to
be a circulant matrix--

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.810
and this is the best family
of matrices in the world.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:59.500
The algebra is just
terrific for these matrices.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:04.130
And that's why they're the
heart of signal processing.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.820
So this is a constant
diagonal matrix.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.980
But it's not yet a circulant.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:15.040
That diagonal circles
around to be completed.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.050
Every diagonal has
four entries here.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:22.840
So let me take
another one, say 1, 1.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.660
Then that would
circle around to 1, 1.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.300
And this guy could be 0.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.420
There's a circulant matrix.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:39.760
Do you understand
then what the entry--

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.350
you only need four numbers,
say the first column.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:48.190
If you prescribe the first
column of a circulant matrix,

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:52.420
then you've told Matlab, for
example, all it needs to know.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.050
If you tell it one column, it
can get all the other columns

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.320
just by cyclic shift.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.720
There's the first
column, 2, 0, 1, 5.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.880
The second column is 2, 0,
1, 5 shifted down by one.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.590
The next column is again
shifted down by one, 2, 0, 1, 5.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.680
And the last column
is 2, 0, 1, 5.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:21.790
So they're all the same
columns after a cyclic shift.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:27.610
So the key matrix in this is
really a cyclic shift matrix.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:37.540
Say 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0-- so it
just has one non-zero diagonal.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.340
And then it's cyclic.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:48.050
Do you see that in
fact this matrix C,

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:54.380
I can produce this matrix
C from P and P squared?

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.070
What would P squared be?

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:05.030
And I'll write it here without
while keeping our eye on P.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:10.160
So if I square that matrix,
what matrix would I get?

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.820
So this is a shift by one.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.540
If I shift by one again, that's
multiplying it again by P.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.790
So that would give me P squared.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.410
What what's in the--

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.540
OK, so what happens now?

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.390
It's a shift by two I guess.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:37.744
So this will be 0, 0, 1, 0.

00:29:37.744 --> 00:29:40.740
This will be 0, 0, 0, 1.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.090
Then it's cyclic still.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.870
So I'll put in the 1s there
and then just fill in the 0s.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.700
So P squared, shift by two.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.400
You start out with this one.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.000
Is that right?

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.780
Yes.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.290
Yes.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:06.280
OK.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.850
OK.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.690
Yeah, let's just make
it multiply a vector,

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.760
x0, x1, x2, x3.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.815
What it does is it puts--

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.160
well, I've started the
numbering with 2 here.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:31.860
x2, x3, x0, and x1.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:37.710
So it's shifted it by
two and cyclically.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:41.040
So the x2, x3 that got
shifted off the bottom

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.100
come back to the top.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:51.690
So the first property
is, of circulants--

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.837
so I suppose I have
matrices C and D circulants.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:07.158
So fact 1, C times D
is also a circulant.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.360
So if I multiply
circulant matrices,

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.630
I get more circulant matrices.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.230
And the identity is
a circulant matrix.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.300
I have a little group of
matrices, the best little group

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.910
of matrices there is.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.420
I can multiply two
guys in the group,

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.470
and I get another
one in the group.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.960
Why is CD also a circulant?

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.690
Let's see, can we see
why that fact is true?

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:45.560
I guess here here's
my way to look at it.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.040
A circulant matrix--
let me put it here--

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:59.230
a circulant matrix, every
circulant matrix is C0 times

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:05.860
the identity circulant plus
C1 times the single shift

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:12.580
plus C2 times the double shift
plus C3 times the triple shift.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.500
That's what it takes
to put C0, C1, C2,

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.980
and C3 on those diagonals.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.590
C0I is obviously on
the main diagonal.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.100
C1P-- remember what P is--

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.470
that puts C1 on
the next diagonal.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:39.580
Then C2P squared, when I square
this, I've shifted by one more.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.100
So it will put C2
on that diagonal.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.410
And finally, C3 would
go in those positions.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:55.920
So every circulant matrix
is a polynomial in P,

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.840
in a single shift.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.290
This is any
combination of shifts.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.160
This is a single shift.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.270
That's a double shift.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.410
That's a triple shift.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.140
That's a zero shift.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:14.870
And if I take combinations
I get a circulant matrix.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:18.720
So now, I can see why
CD is also a circulant,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:25.710
because this is a
polynomial in P.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:31.350
And this is a polynomial
in P. And when

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:37.170
I multiply those together,
I get a polynomial in P.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:44.340
But usually, if I multiply
a third degree polynomial

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.380
by another third
degree polynomial--

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.660
so say I'm looking at 4
by 4 circulant matrices--

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:57.000
so this would be a polynomial
of P in P third degree 3.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.760
And this would be a
polynomial of degree 3.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:09.440
So that would give me a
polynomial of degree 6.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.745
But I don't want that.

00:34:10.745 --> 00:34:14.370
That somehow I have to
define multiplication

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:18.230
so that I want
this to be degree--

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:25.010
these are all supposed
to be 4 by 4 matrices,

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.420
just like that one.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.159
That's twice the identity
plus five P plus 1P squared

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.020
plus 0P cubed.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.300
And suppose I square that.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.810
Then, again, I'm going to
get up a circulant matrix.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.920
And I don't want it
to go up to degree 7.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:47.540
I just want four terms
in my polynomial.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.949
I just want the main diagonal
and the next three diagonals

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:56.000
and then cycling around
completes the matrix.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.020
So how to get degrees 3?

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.280
That's the question then.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.130
Can you just tell me the answer?

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:22.260
So I'm multiplying-- yeah,
let's just do an example.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:35.100
So I've C0, C1P, C2P squared,
C3P cubed times D0 plus D1P

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.730
plus D2P squared and D3P cubed.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:45.885
So P is 4 by 4 circular shift.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.380
And I'm writing the 4
by 4 matrix that way.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.020
This should be the
identity, of course.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.450
You knew that.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.550
OK, so when I
multiply those guys,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:09.650
why do I not get degree six?

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.990
Why is that product--

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:16.475
like P cubed times P
cubed C3P cubed times

00:36:16.475 --> 00:36:21.810
DP3 cubed, that gives me
C3D3 P to the sixth power.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.478
So what's up?

00:36:23.478 --> 00:36:24.020
What do I do?

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:24.680
Yeah.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.820
AUDIENCE: Does P to the
4 equal to identity?

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.790
GILBERT STRANG:
Yes, that's the key.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.670
That's the periodic part.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.900
P to the 4 equal the identity.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.350
Thank you.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:35.480
Yeah.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.740
So the P to the sixth term
is really a P squared term.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.440
The P to the fifth term
is really a P term.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.800
P the fourth term is really
a P to the zero term.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:56.570
So I'm just doing cyclic
convolution actually.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:59.870
Let me just say when
I'm multiplying--

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:04.450
yeah, so now, I'm
telling you what--

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.100
I can first tell you
what convolution is

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.170
and then what cyclic
convolution is.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:15.200
And listen up to this, because
it's a good thing to know.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.340
So, first of all, convolution.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:23.480
So suppose I want to take
the convolution of 3, 1, 2--

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:30.620
that's often the symbol for
a convolution-- with 4, 6, 1.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.870
So what does that mean?

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.400
I've got a vector.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:45.020
So for me, what's hiding
there is polynomial 3

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:53.380
plus x plus 2x squared times
4 plus 6x plus 1x squared.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.340
And I just multiply them out.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.235
And I get 5--

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.830
so I get 3 times
4 gives me a 12.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.650
3 times 6x is 18x.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.060
But I've also got 4x from here.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.780
So I've got 22x.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:19.150
So I just do that multiplication
as of polynomials.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:23.410
And what I'm doing is
convolution with the vectors.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:30.400
And here's the way you
wrote it in first grade.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.070
So here's first grade.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.700
2, 12, 8.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.160
You haven't learned
to carry yet.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.950
So 12 goes in there as 12.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:45.070
Then 1 is 4, 6, 1.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.900
And 3 is 12, 18, 3.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.490
And then you add up.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:39:01.090
So you have 2, 13,
17, 22, and 12.

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.160
So that's the answer there.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.690
That's the convolution--

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.990
I guess I have to take it from--

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.130
yeah-- 12.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.080
3 times four gave 12.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:15.100
Now, 3 times 6 plus 1
times 4 that's the 22.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.140
Oh, yeah, we already
started here.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.510
But now, what's after that 17?

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.432
Why did I say 17?

00:39:23.432 --> 00:39:25.692
AUDIENCE: 8 plus 6 plus 3.

00:39:25.692 --> 00:39:27.390
GILBERT STRANG: Oh,
8 plus 6 plus 3.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.210
Thanks.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.560
17.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.900
And then 12 plus 1, 13.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.020
And then 2.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.070
That's non-cyclic.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:41.010
So that's convolution.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.730
Oh, if I want it
to be non-cyclic,

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:44.990
I don't put a circle in.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.740
So that's a symbol for
ordinary convolution.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:56.600
If you do the Matlab command
conv for convolution,

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.390
if you gave it those
vectors, it would give you

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:04.200
a vector with five
components as a result.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.920
But now, let me make it cyclic.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.360
So what's going to happen
now when I make it cyclic?

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:20.540
So this represents 12, 22P,
17P squared, 13P cubed.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:25.370
And what's 13P cubed?

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:29.450
If n is 3 and I'm
doing 3 by 3 matrices,

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:33.940
then 13P cubed is the same as?

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.860
13, right?

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.360
P cube is I.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.090
So the 13 will go back there.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.670
And the 2 will be P fourth.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:49.540
And it will go back as P.
So now with convolution,

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:59.080
cyclic convolution gives 12
and 13, 25, 22 and 2, 24,

00:40:59.080 --> 00:40:59.855
and the 17.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:09.010
So I'm getting back a vector of
length 3 just as I wanted to.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:15.430
If I have a 3 by 3 matrix,
convolution cyclic circulant

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.730
matrix, with those three
diagonals and these three

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.980
diagonals, then I want
the answer to be a 3

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:25.220
by 3 matrix with
these diagonals.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:30.830
So again, matrix multiplication
of circulant matrices

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:35.750
corresponds exactly to
multiplying polynomials

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.610
cyclically.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.420
And that's cyclic convolution.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.520
And then there's
just one little trick

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.340
to see if you've
got the numbers.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:52.790
I believe that it should be true
that if 3 plus 1 plus 2 is 6,

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.720
4 plus 6 plus 1 is
11, and I believe

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.950
that those should add to what?

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:04.026
What do I hope that they add to?

00:42:04.026 --> 00:42:04.526
66.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:12.920
I'm a little nervous about
doing it, but I think we can.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:18.430
Yeah, so 49, 59, 66, check.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:24.760
Yeah, so the digits, the sum
of the digits of one factor

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.280
multiplies the sum of the
digits of the other factor

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.390
to give the sum of the
digits in the convolution.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:32.890
And that would be
true whether we're

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:39.230
doing cyclic, which is bringing
the 13 and the 2 back in or not

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.975
cyclic, where we have 5 numbers.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.680
That's actually a check that
I don't know if you ever

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.980
thought about that
in second grade,

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.730
multiplying these
numbers, multiplying

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:01.360
that number by that
number and getting

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:07.960
some answer, which probably half
the class did not get right.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.370
Then fifth grade, they're
kind of getting it.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:16.450
But if they knew a check, so
they could have just added

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:19.390
these numbers to get
11, added these numbers

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:22.630
to get 6, multiplied
those to get 66,

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:26.180
and check that
those added to 66.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:34.780
That never occurred to me I
admit in second grade either.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.450
But now you know.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:40.830
Now you can pass second grade.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:46.200
So this is the picture
for cyclic convolution.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.850
And I just have a
few minutes left

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:51.510
to tell you about the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.700
of these matrices.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.350
So what can you tell me
about the eigenvalues--

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:01.450
or say, the eigenvectors?

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:06.150
I have a matrix P. It happens
to be a permutation matrix.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:08.310
But it's a matrix.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:13.650
Then I take this
polynomial in the matrix.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:20.290
What can you tell me about
eigenvectors of this matrix C?

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:25.120
So my C looks like that.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.240
And I'm asking you for
the eigenvectors of that.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:37.730
And I'm saying that that is a
polynomial, sum of powers of P,

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:39.570
like so.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:44.460
In fact, the numbers here
just come off the diagonals.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.610
So what about the eigenvectors?

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.000
AUDIENCE: All 1s.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.070
GILBERT STRANG: Well,
that is an eigenvector.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:52.700
That's true.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.000
The vector of all 1s
will be an eigenvector.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.560
With what eigenvalue actually?

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.320
AUDIENCE: C2 plus C1.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.760
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:08.420
So what I want you to see
is the eigenvectors of C

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.300
are the same as the
eigenvectors of P.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.370
If I have an
eigenvector of P, that's

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:18.050
also an eigenvector of P squared
and P cubed in a combination.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:32.270
So eigenvectors of P
are eigenvectors of C.

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:36.260
So then the question is, what
are the eigenvectors of P?

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.710
You see what I mean?

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:43.280
It didn't really matter if
I'm looking for eigenvectors

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.670
what those numbers were.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:50.620
The point is that those numbers
were constant on diagonals

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:56.830
and that therefore it's built
out of 1 matrix P, built out

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:02.840
of 1 matrix P. So all I have to
know is the eigenvectors of P.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.390
So that's the final step here.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:08.810
What are the eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of P?

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:27.660
So eigenvectors, eigenvalues
for P equal 1, 1, 1, and 1, say.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.980
And otherwise zeros.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:40.170
So somebody mentioned that
the vector of 1, 1, 1, 1, that

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:44.340
is an eigenvector, because
if I do that multiplication,

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.380
it shifts this vector down
and cyclically around.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:51.400
But that just brings
back the same vector.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.750
So lambda is 1.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:47:03.560
And that's an eigenvector
with eigenvalue 1.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.930
But this is a 4 by 4 matrix.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.280
AUDIENCE: 1 minus 1, 1 minus 1.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.320
GILBERT STRANG: Ah, now you're
guessing 1 minus 1, 1 minus 1.

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:16.220
Interesting.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.800
Well, tell me an
eigenvector for minus 1.

00:47:23.102 --> 00:47:27.780
Do you want to just
alternate signs there?

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:34.970
So let me let me do that
multiplication times 1 minus 1,

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.860
1 minus 1.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.350
Of course, I don't have
to do that multiplication.

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:41.540
I'm just going to shift this.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:45.060
So I'm going to shift
that down, 1 minus 1

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:48.180
and cyclically around.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.150
And now, what's the eigenvalue?

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:53.540
It is an eigenvector.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:48:00.770
And what multiple of that
vector gives that vector?

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:01.860
AUDIENCE: Minus 1.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:02.860
GILBERT STRANG: Minus 1.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.980
So that was a good idea.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:15.520
But the rest of what
you said was a bad idea,

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:24.500
because the next eigenvectors
got to be somewhere else.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.200
We've just got one eigenvalue
there and one there.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.850
And we haven't
got the other two.

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:32.450
So what are the
other two eigenvalues

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:36.230
of this permutation matrix?

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:38.580
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.140
GILBERT STRANG: 1, that's right.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.750
We're in a circulant world.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.490
Draw a circle.

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:49.530
So the eigenvectors are
the four roots of 1.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:50.660
Complex.

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:53.280
So 1 and minus 1 you've got.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.230
These are the lambdas.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:58.970
But the other ones are
I and minus I. Yeah.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:01.050
Yeah.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:04.890
Why don't I, since
time's up, let me

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:08.250
leave until Friday
the eigenvalues

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:16.710
and eigenvectors for in
general, for arbitrary size.

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.380
But that's a picture
of the eigen--

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:24.690
we're close to the eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of every--

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:29.070
all circulants have
the same eigenvectors.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:33.900
All circulants have that
eigenvector, 4 by 4.

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.900
All circulants have
that eigenvector 4 by 4.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.610
And we'll find the other two.

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:44.400
OK, so I'll see you Friday
for those and the convolution

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.810
rule, which is the most
important rule in signal

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:49.610
processing.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:50.110
OK.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:51.660
Thanks.

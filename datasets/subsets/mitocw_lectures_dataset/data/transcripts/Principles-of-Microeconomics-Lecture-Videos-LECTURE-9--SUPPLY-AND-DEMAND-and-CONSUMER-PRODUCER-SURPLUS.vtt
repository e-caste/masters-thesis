[CLICKING]

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.990
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK, why
don't we get started?

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.910
Today, we're going to
come full circle back

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.380
to the first lecture.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.750
So in the first
lecture, we talked

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.470
by-- we started by drawing
a supply and demand graph.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.330
We've now spent
the last few weeks

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.127
explaining where supply and
demand curves come from.

00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:31.460
And now, we're going to talk
about the supply and demand

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.200
curves.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.980
What do they know?

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.813
Do they know things?

00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:35.990
Let's find out.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.975
So, no one?

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:38.600
No one on that?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.648
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:40.940
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK, thank you.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.540
All right.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.560
So let's start by talking about
shocking the supply and demand

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.060
curves.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:52.350
Shocking the supply
and demand curves.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.558
That was a BoJack Horseman
reference for those of you

00:00:54.558 --> 00:00:55.380
who missed that.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.380
OK, let's talk about shocking
the supply and demand curves.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.489
So let's start with a review of
the supply and demand framework

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.900
that we introduced
in the first lecture.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.750
So let's go back to figure 9-1.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.130
We've got the market
for gasoline, OK?

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.670
On the x-axis is big
Q. Quantity of gas

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.720
is the market-level diagram.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.120
On the y-axis--
the price of gas.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.310
And as we said, the first
lecture-- the supply curve

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.830
that's upward sloping,
representing the fact

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.440
that higher prices
call forth more supply.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.490
We now know where
that comes from.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.420
We know that what happens is
when there's a higher price,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.800
firms can now afford to move up
the marginal cost curve, which

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.060
is the supply curve.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.590
So we know where
that comes from.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.320
We have demand curve,
which is downward sloping.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.820
Higher prices lead
to less demand.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.540
We know where that comes from.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.960
We know that as the
price of a good rises,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.550
through both income
and substitution

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.210
effects for normal goods,
consumers will want less of it,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.810
so whenever that comes from.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.090
So we now have derived these.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.560
And we're back where we
started in equilibrium.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.400
So let's actually start
by asking what happens.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.980
Let's start by asking,
as we move forward,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.920
how do we want to think
about these curves?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.910
And the way we
think about them is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.820
we want to think about
the demand curve,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.720
want to think about
these as willingness

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.240
to pay and willingness
to supply curves.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.710
So think about the demand curve
as a willingness to pay curve.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.415
How much are you
willing to pay to get

00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:23.540
that next unit of the good?

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.430
Or how much is the market
willing to pay to get

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.250
the next unit of the good?

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.370
OK?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.020
And the supply curve is
willing to supply, OK?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.020
An equilibrium is the point
where consumers' willingness

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.080
to pay for the next
unit of the good

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.070
meets the suppliers
willing to supply

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.970
the next unit of the good.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.080
When those are equal,
we're in equilibrium.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.610
So that's where we start.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.570
Now, let's ask, what happens
as these curves shift?

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.000
So, for example,
let's take this market

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.010
and imagine the tastes change.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.830
Suddenly, everyone
wants to drive big cars.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.318
Everyone wants to
drive SUVs, OK?

00:03:03.318 --> 00:03:04.985
What does this do to
the market for gas?

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.090
Well, so what does this do?

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.278
Well, what it does--
yeah, go ahead.

00:03:11.278 --> 00:03:13.070
AUDIENCE: SUVs require
a lot more gasoline,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.390
so the demand goes up.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.380
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.200
SUVs are what we call
a complement as opposed

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.990
to substitute--

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.400
are a complement for gasoline.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.980
When demand for SUVs goes
up, demand for gas goes up.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.210
So the demand curve
would shift out.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.120
So we would end up in a
situation like figure 9-2.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.280
But let's talk
through the dynamics.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.510
All you would see in the
market is quantity of gas sold

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.390
would go up from Q1 to Q2.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.110
And price of gas would
go up from P1 to P2.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.580
Well, let's talk about
underneath, how we get there.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.763
What happens is
demand shifts up.

00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:53.180
People want more
gas, because they

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.280
want to drive these
gas-guzzling cars.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.850
So demand shifts from D1 to D2.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.330
What does that mean?

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.580
That means at the previous
equilibrium price--

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.490
if the price didn't
change, if the price

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.980
stayed a P1, what would happen?

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.290
Well, we'd no longer
be in equilibrium.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.720
Because people would--
firms would still

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.230
be happy to supply
Q1 units of gas.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.690
But people would want
way more than that.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.030
We would have excess demand.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.790
If the price didn't change,
there would be excess demand.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.150
People would want more
than the Q1 units of gas.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.710
Suppliers will recognize
this and say, well,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.070
if people want more, we're
happy to produce more.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.700
But remember, we have to
respect the marginal cost curve

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.128
and marginal cost of rising.

00:04:41.128 --> 00:04:42.670
If we're going to
produce more, we're

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.140
going to have to charge more.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.110
We're going to have to
move up the supply curve.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.430
So a shift in the demand
curve makes firms move along

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.480
the supply curve.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.030
Want to keep shifts and
movement along curves separate.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.020
A shift in demand
curve, meaning people

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.380
are saying to gas
producers, we want more gas.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.630
Gas producers are like, great.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.980
We want to give you more
gas, but we're going

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.510
to charge you more to do it.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.150
Because our marginal cost
curve is upward sloping,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.980
which is our supply
curve, as we learned.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.660
So the price rises.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.030
And we need to reach a
new equilibrium at E2.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.092
So we don't see these
steps in practice.

00:05:18.092 --> 00:05:19.800
In the end, we just
see the price change,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.600
but think about it as two steps.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.840
Demand shifts out,
creating excess demand.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.130
Providers, to meet that excess
demand, have to produce more.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.630
And to produce more, they're
going to charge a higher price.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.710
And that moves you
from E1 to E2, OK?

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.320
So we have a shift in
demand, which caused a slide

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.870
up the supply curve, OK?

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.880
Now, let's think about
a different example.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.890
Imagine war breaks out
in the Middle East.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.530
Not too hard to
imagine, unfortunately.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.440
And as a result, the quantity--

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.570
so suppliers need to pay
more to get the oil that they

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.030
use to make gasoline, OK?

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.110
What does that do?

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.110
We see that in figure 9-3.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:07.490
Now, what happens is
for every unit of gas,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.230
suppliers need to charge more.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.695
Their underlying marginal
costs have gone up,

00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:14.570
because they have to
pay more to get the oil.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.880
That's a variable cost
of production of gas.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.022
So their marginal
costs have gone up.

00:06:19.022 --> 00:06:21.230
Their marginal costs going
up mean their supply curve

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.420
has shifted upwards, OK?

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.150
For every unit of production,
their marginal cost

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.975
is higher, because their
variable costs have gone up.

00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:32.100
Therefore, they're going
to need to charge a higher

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.780
price to break even.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.780
OK, we're still in perfectly
competitive markets

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.420
where nobody is
making any profit, OK?

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.470
They're going to charge
more to break even.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.470
So now, let's once again
talk about the dynamics

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.280
of what's happening.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.160
The dynamics are the
costs and the input

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.230
to the suppliers went up--

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.390
oil, OK?

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.810
Their marginal costs
shifts up to S2.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.190
So they want to
charge a higher price.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.150
So if we kept the
price the same as it

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.980
was before, suppliers
would say, we

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.920
don't want to sell Q1 anymore.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.330
We're not interested in selling
Q1 anymore at that old price.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.830
OK?

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.540
That doesn't interest us.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.080
Therefore, consumers
want more than providers

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.280
are willing to sell.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.600
And we once again
have excess demand.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.910
So in both cases, we
get excess demand.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.110
In the first case,
we got excess demand

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.120
because consumers wanted more.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.100
The lower-- the
consumers' tastes

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.800
shifted, so they wanted
more gas at every price.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.200
Now, we have excess demand
not because taste shift,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.433
but because costs go up.

00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:36.350
So providers don't want
to provide as much gas

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.490
at every price.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.550
So what happens is
providers are going to say,

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.180
fine, we're going to
charge a higher price, OK?

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.820
And we'll slide up
the demand curve.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.710
Because as providers
charge a higher price,

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.870
people want less gas.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.370
At a higher price,
you want less gas

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.810
through the substitution effect.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.390
Because you'll buy other things
instead and for the income

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.690
effect.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.107
Because you're
effectively poorer,

00:07:58.107 --> 00:07:59.860
because the price
of gas went up.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.940
For those reasons, you're going
to shift up the demand curve

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.570
and reach a new
equilibrium at E2.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.670
So that's the
underlying dynamics

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.740
of how shifts in
supply and demand

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.060
lead to changes in
quantity and price, OK?

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.490
So that's basically
what we're seeing.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.620
Questions about that?

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.750
Yeah?

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:27.965
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:29.590
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Great, great question.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.240
So what's the answer?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.523
What's the substitution
effect with gas?

00:08:33.523 --> 00:08:34.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
not driving.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.020
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
you've answered yourself.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.070
It's not driving.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.179
It's taking the bus.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.740
It's driving less.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.667
It's walking or
taking your bike.

00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:44.000
So once again, when everything
about substitute effects,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.630
you want to think about
the next opportunities

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.787
you could use instead, OK?

00:08:48.787 --> 00:08:49.370
Good question.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.940
Other questions?

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.500
OK, so here's an
interesting point.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.200
Look at figure 9-2 and 9-3.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.050
In both cases, the
price went up, OK?

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.670
In both cases,
the price went up.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.460
So we can't tell.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.970
If a price goes up, you
can't tell from that

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.310
alone whether there was a
shift in demand or supply.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.750
So if I, for example, asked
you on an exam or your mom

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.250
came home.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.460
Your mom asked you, hey,
if the price goes up,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.680
does that mean demand
shift or supply shifted?

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.163
You say to your
mom, I don't know.

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:24.830
I can't tell with
just that information.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.747
I need to know what
happened to quantity, too.

00:09:26.747 --> 00:09:27.247
OK?

00:09:27.247 --> 00:09:29.090
And then you say your
mom, good question.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.270
OK, so let's go
through the reasons

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.580
why the supply and
demand curves shift.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.330
So why do curves shift?

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:36.910
OK?

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.690
Well, on the demand
side, there's

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.170
at least six reasons why
demand curves would shift.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.150
So why do demand curves shift?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.330
OK, one reason is tastes change.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.830
I just used that reason--

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.920
tastes change.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.260
OK, people want
different things.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.080
OK?

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.405
A second reason is
that income changes.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.320
Second reason-- because
people are richer or poorer.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.362
And so that makes them
want different quantities,

00:10:08.362 --> 00:10:10.200
even with the same tastes.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:17.580
A third reason is the
change in the price

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:27.053
of a complementary or
substitutable good, OK?

00:10:27.053 --> 00:10:27.970
Now, that's different.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:28.690
I should separate.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.160
The actual example
before was this.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.700
Taste change is
slightly different.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.720
So change in price [INAUDIBLE]
is what I talked about.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.680
Taste change would be
literally for everything

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.540
held being equal, I just wake
up one morning psyched to drive.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.490
That'd be a taste change, OK?

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.370
So really, the example
I used was a change

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.070
in the price of complimentary--

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.640
no, no, price didn't change.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.450
No, I go back.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.140
I go back.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.860
The example I used
was a taste change.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.950
People wanted more SUVs.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.870
But at the same time,
imagine a different change.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:03.080
Imagine that we're looking at
the demand for babysitters.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.420
And the price of
movies goes up, OK?

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.800
Well, movies are complementary
with babysitters.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.560
You guys don't worry about this.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.143
You don't have kids
yet, but trust me.

00:11:11.143 --> 00:11:12.790
Movies are complement
to babysitters,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.250
that basically the more
you go to the movies,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.020
the more you need babysitters.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.910
So if the price
of movies goes up,

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.690
that's going to lower my demand
for babysitters or vice versa.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.800
Imagine that how a change
in the price of movies

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:33.882
affects the demand for Netflix,
while those are substitutable.

00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:35.340
As the price of
movies goes up, I'm

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.550
going to want more Netflix
and less babysitters.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.710
So change in price of
complementary substitutable

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:47.130
goods will also affect
my demand curve.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.470
Another thing that could
affect the demand curve

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.490
is a change in the market size.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.200
So we will talk in
a couple lectures

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.580
about international trade.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.760
If suddenly you're selling
goods to a much larger market,

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.720
that will affect the
demand for your good.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.970
So preference haven't changed.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:04.600
Price haven't changed.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.820
You just suddenly got a
bunch of new customers.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.945
That will affect demand
for your good, OK?

00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:12.320
And the last thing that could
change, the most subtle way

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:19.300
demand could change is
expectations of the future.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.630
So for example, imagine
you expect the price of gas

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.100
to go up tomorrow.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.577
You might buy more gas today.

00:12:26.577 --> 00:12:27.410
And that'd be weird.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.325
[INAUDIBLE] look,
nothing changed today.

00:12:29.325 --> 00:12:31.450
Your taste didn't change,
prices-- nothing changed,

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.450
but people buy more gas.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.160
What's going on?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.550
It's that they expect the
price to change in the future.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.300
So expectations of the
future can actually

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.430
drive demand today, OK?

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.670
We've all-- experiences in
various aspects of our lives,

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.390
OK?

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.110
So those are the reasons why
the demand curve can shift.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.580
There's a lot of reasons why
the demand curve can shift.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.080
For the supply curve, why
the supply curve shifts

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.300
is much simpler.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.040
There's really only
two reasons, OK?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.930
One reason is changes
in input costs.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.744
And the second is a shift in
the technology and production.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.810
So the production function
changes or input costs change.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:22.090
That's pretty much why
supply curves shift, OK?

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.910
So that gives you a
catalog of how to think

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.620
about these curves shifting.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.270
I have a fun example
in the videos that

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:33.730
go with this class,
which is that we all

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.440
know Kim Kardashian is--

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.630
you may or may not know
she has more Instagram

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.790
followers than there
are people in France.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.940
She got 80 million.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.900
It's up to about 100-plus
million Instagram followers.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.420
Kim Kardashian, a few
years ago, tweeted out

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.230
a picture of herself in an
exercise corset, she called it.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.300
She basically
claimed-- a corset is

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.600
this thing they used to
wear back when we didn't

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.220
care about women much at all.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.910
And we just made them wear these
incredibly constrictive things

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.560
to make them look skinnier, OK?

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.563
They're basically
like a brace you'd

00:14:04.563 --> 00:14:06.730
wear to make you look
skinnier back in the old days.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.735
And Kim Kardashian
said, actually,

00:14:08.735 --> 00:14:10.360
if you wear a corset
when you exercise,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.500
it helps you lose weight.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.260
Well, actually, she's
totally fucking wrong, OK?

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.030
It doesn't, OK?

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.840
There is no-- it does
not help you lose weight,

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.530
but she tweeted this out.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.130
And there was a massive increase
in demand for exercise corsets,

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:25.630
OK?

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.180
And the one company that made
them made scads of money.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.500
There was a huge demand shift
based on this Kim Kardashian

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.540
tweet, OK?

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.980
So tell me what happened next.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.480
Yeah?

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.490
JONATHAN GRUBER: More
companies entered, OK?

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.930
So what happened
was profits were

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.050
being made on exercise corsets.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.480
So more companies started
making exercise corsets.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.690
And they came in and drove
those profits down, OK?

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.053
So that's a classic
example of how demand shift

00:14:55.053 --> 00:14:56.470
and how the market
in the long run

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.430
will respond to return
us to zero profits.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.430
Zero profits in the long
run-- in the short run,

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.530
some corset companies
made a lot of money.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.510
They should-- they owe, Kim, OK?

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.240
But in the long run,
profits go to zero.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.560
Yeah?

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.430
AUDIENCE: With the expectations
where the demand curve shifts,

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.560
is that when companies--
you're like, oh,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.292
there's these coupons for
limited kind of sales?

00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:16.750
Would that be an
example of demand?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:16.870
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.240
And anything where you
basically-- well, no.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.910
But once that's on,
that's a price change.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:24.340
A limited time sale for good
is literally just a standard

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.812
to price changed, OK?

00:15:25.812 --> 00:15:28.270
It's you think the sales are
going to happen in the future,

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.260
so you buy less today.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.530
That's the expectations, OK?

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.690
So that shifts in
demand supply curves.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.370
Let's now talk about what
determines the shapes of supply

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.090
and demand curve.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.240
Now, what determines the shapes
of supply and demand curves?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.730
OK?

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.958
So basically, the effect--

00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.250
not what determines the shapes.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.270
We already talked about
what determines the shapes.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.890
We want to talk about the
role, the shapes the supply

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.460
and demand curves play.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.450
Let me rephrase that.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.710
We already know what
determines the shapes.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.990
We covered that in the last
10 lectures or whatever.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.365
Now, we're talking
about the role

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:07.770
that shapes play as
demand curves shift.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.980
So for example, let's
think about a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.030
Figure 9-3 shows what
happens with a supply,

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.250
the figure we're
just looking at, OK?

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.990
Figure we're just
looking at, figure 9-3,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.300
shows what happens
when the supply shift

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.740
with a standard downward,
sloping demand curve, OK?

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:29.380
Which is that the price
goes up, quantity falls.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.120
However, imagine, instead, we
had perfectly inelastic demand.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.962
So, for example, for insulin.

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:36.920
Then what would happen?

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.200
Well, figure 9-4 shows if
demand is perfectly inelastic,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.730
quantity won't change.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.190
So if there's a supply--

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.560
if there's a shock that
shifts up the supply curve

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.910
like war in the Middle East.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.810
So this is the question here.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.227
Why wouldn't gas
just be perfectly

00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:52.400
inelastically demanded?

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.150
In fact, in the short
run, gas is actually

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.810
pretty inelastically
demanded, OK?

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.140
It's not perfectly inelastic,
but is pretty inelastic, OK?

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.520
So in that case, you would
see just prices going up,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.810
and quantities wouldn't change.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.410
Now, in the long run, do we
think the elasticity for gas

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.599
will be higher or lower in
the short run, the demand

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.710
elasticity for gas?

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.560
AUDIENCE: Higher.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:12.849
JONATHAN GRUBER: Higher.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:15.069
Somebody raise their
hand and tell me why.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.960
Somebody raise their
hand and tell me why.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.680
Somebody else besides people
who always answer questions.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.180
Yeah?

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.238
AUDIENCE: People can shift
towards electric cars.

00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:21.280
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.900
In the short run, all
you can do is drive less.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.400
And we got to drive to
work and stuff like that.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.980
And in the long run, I
can buy a different car.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.355
So this is an
example of long run

00:17:27.355 --> 00:17:31.030
versus short run, how it can
affect these elasticities, OK?

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.430
Now, let's think instead about
a perfectly elastic demand,

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.470
the demand for--

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.710
I don't know-- chachkies in a
market or something like that,

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.280
OK?

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.820
Perfectly elastic
demand in figure 9.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.333
It's always hard
to think of markets

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:44.500
with perfect elastic demand.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.670
It's easier think
about firms that

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.850
have perfectly elastic demand.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.225
It's hard to think
about markets.

00:17:48.225 --> 00:17:51.000
But think about a market
for a certain kind of candy

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.160
with another kind of candy
that's just as good, OK?

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.760
So those are markets, which are
fairly elastically demanded,

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.840
OK?

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.290
There you see when the supply
shifts, price doesn't change,

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.910
only quantity does.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:04.810
And why is that?

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.560
That's because demand
is probably elastic.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.750
You can change the price.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.720
If you try to raise
price by one penny,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.170
you'll lose the entire market.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.670
If you lower the
price by one penny,

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:14.795
you gain the entire market.

00:18:14.795 --> 00:18:16.420
And then your
profits will go away,

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.600
because your marginal cost
will be through the roof, OK?

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.360
So with perfectly
elastic demand,

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.120
you're going to get prices
fixed, but only quantity

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.610
changes, OK?

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.368
So basically, that's how we
think about these extremes.

00:18:31.368 --> 00:18:33.910
The bottom line is that's how
the shapes of supply and demand

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:39.250
will affect the
response to shocks, OK?

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.940
The more elastic is demand,
the more price shock

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.150
will come through in
quantity and less in prices.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.150
The more inelastic is
demand, the more supply shock

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:53.310
will come through in prices
and not in quantity, OK?

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.460
Any questions about that?

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.160
OK.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.990
So now, let's go on to what
we can do with these supply

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.740
and demand curves.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.190
So now, we're the masters
of supply and demand curves.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.090
We know where they come from.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.790
We know why they
shape the way they do.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.372
We know what happens
when they shift.

00:19:08.372 --> 00:19:10.330
And we know what happens
how that shift depends

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.560
on their shapes.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.870
So we own supply
and demand curves.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.830
Now let's go, what
can we do with them?

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.800
And what we can do
with them is use

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.920
them to take the next
step in this class

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.953
from positive to
normative economics.

00:19:23.953 --> 00:19:25.870
So far, this class has
been completely focused

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.590
on positive economics.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.620
Why do firms behave
the way they do?

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.390
Why do consumers
behave the way they do?

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.348
And we haven't talked at
all about whether it's

00:19:33.348 --> 00:19:35.150
a good thing or a bad thing.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.840
Well, we need a new
set of tools if we're

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.540
going to move from
positive economics

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.130
about why things--
the way things are

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.790
to normative economics about
the way they should be, OK?

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.590
And those set of tools--

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.350
we're going to derive from
supply and demand curves.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.450
And this is
critically important.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.700
Because, for example,
let's take where

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.230
we ended the last lecture--

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.000
or the last lecture,
I think, talking

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.790
about how with perfectly-- or
in the middle of last lecture,

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.640
talking about in a perfectly
competitive market under a set

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.950
of assumptions, all firms-- a
zero profit in the long run,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:08.450
OK?

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.027
So you buy that.

00:20:10.027 --> 00:20:12.110
But you have to ask yourself,
is that a good thing

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.257
or a bad thing?

00:20:13.257 --> 00:20:15.090
Is zero profits in the
long run good or bad?

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.080
Well, on the one hand,
firms are cost minimizing.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.500
That's good.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.800
On the other hand, why would
anyone start a business?

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.800
In the long run, they're
going to make no money.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.607
That's bad.

00:20:24.607 --> 00:20:26.690
So how do we think about
trading those things off?

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.950
How do we think
about whether it's

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.470
good or bad to have
long run zero profits?

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.010
OK?

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.210
This is the question.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.020
This set of questions
is what we turn to

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.230
with the notion of
welfare economics.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.920
Welfare is going to be used
in two senses in this class.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.170
Mostly when I say
welfare, I'll mean

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.690
as a measure of well-being.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.188
Mostly when I say welfare, I
mean welfare is well-being.

00:20:55.188 --> 00:20:56.230
Sometimes we say welfare.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.570
We mean cash payments
to poor people.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.583
That's welfare payments.

00:20:59.583 --> 00:21:01.750
That's not what I mean,
usually, when I say welfare.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.580
I'll try to distinguish
when I mean the other thing.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.810
When I say welfare,
I don't mean the way

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.227
it's used in the
political debate,

00:21:06.227 --> 00:21:07.960
meaning cash payments
to poor people.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.330
I mean welfare is a
measure of well-being.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.350
And welfare economics is the
tools of normative analysis.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.240
The tools of welfare
economics are the tools

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.392
of measuring well-being.

00:21:20.392 --> 00:21:21.850
And we're going to
start by talking

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.637
about the concept
of consumer surplus.

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:27.220
It's going to be the
first thing we're

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.920
going to use when we talk about
welfare economics is consumer

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.340
surplus, OK?

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.550
Now, if we want to
measure well-being,

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.940
however, we have a problem,
which is, how do you

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.530
measure how happy I am?

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:45.370
My utils But utils don't exist.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.740
So we've got a fundamental
challenge here,

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.480
which is our indicator
of well-being

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.350
is utility function, which
isn't a real thing, OK?

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.535
We use it to derive decisions,
but we don't actually

00:21:56.535 --> 00:21:57.910
have a measure of
well-being that

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.400
gives real meaningful inputs.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.060
So what do we do?

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.390
We do a clever thing economists
thought of a long time

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:09.990
ago, which is to use the concept
of compensating variation.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.160
The concept of
compensating variation.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.810
What does that concept-- means?

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:22.000
That means instead of asking you
how happy you are, I ask you,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.010
how much would I have to
pay you to become less--

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.360
to become sadder?

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.030
Or how much would you be
willing to pay to be happier?

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.690
So I can't measure margin
utility in dollars.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.390
But I can measure
how many dollars

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.230
you would pay to buy the
next good or how many dollars

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.220
you'd pay me not to be
punched or whatever, OK?

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.040
I can basically
measure those things

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.330
by essentially asking
you, how much would you

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.320
pay to be better off?

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.390
Or how much would you be willing
to pay not to be worse off?

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.540
And those are what we called
a compensating variation.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.720
We measure your well-being
by the money equivalent

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.340
that you give to us in
expressing your preferences.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.820
And what we can then
define consumer surplus--

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.400
we'll define consumer
surplus, which

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.590
is our first measure of
normative welfare economics,

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.180
as the benefit that a consumer
gets from consuming a good,

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.850
above and beyond the
price of that good.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.830
The benefit that a consumer gets
from consuming a good, above

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.400
and beyond what they
paid for that good.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.780
That's consumer surplus.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.210
Surplus means extra, right?

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.410
So it's your extra.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.080
It's how much more you
get than what you actually

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.560
pay to get the good in
the first place, OK?

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.400
So basically, consider my
daughter's demand for songs

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.760
by Kendrick Lamar, OK?

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.860
And to make life easy, let's
say this is pre-streaming

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.350
and songs cost $1, OK?

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.478
So she wants songs
by Kendrick Lamar.

00:24:01.478 --> 00:24:04.020
So that's actually-- yeah, she
wants songs by Kendrick Lamar,

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.120
and there's no streaming.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.560
And the songs cost $1.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.530
So if my daughter is willing
to pay $1 for a Kendrick Lamar

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:15.750
song and it costs $1, then
her consumer surplus is zero.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.540
The benefit she gets
from the song is $1.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.430
It costs $1 to hit zero.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:27.990
But if she was willing to pay
$2 for a Kendrick Lamar song

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:33.830
and it only cost a $1, then
she's got $1 in surplus, OK?

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.090
So basically, the key thing
is to define consumer surplus,

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.140
we need two things--

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.010
the price and the
willingness to pay.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.350
Well, how the hell do we
get willingness to pay?

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.200
Where does that come from?

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.000
Someone raise their
hand and tell me.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.180
Yeah?

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:50.810
AUDIENCE: Demand.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.227
JONATHAN GRUBER:
The demand curve.

00:24:52.227 --> 00:24:53.263
We already defined it.

00:24:53.263 --> 00:24:55.180
We already defined what
willingness to pay is.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.660
It's the demand curve.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.940
So consumer surplus is
simply defined as the area

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.540
below the demand
curve, above the price.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.940
Because that tells you.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.690
The demand curve tells
you how much you're

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.940
willing to pay for each unit.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.030
The price you face tells
you how much you had to pay.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:19.100
So any gap between them
is consumer surplus, OK?

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.130
So let's go to figure 9-6.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:26.110
Let's do my daughter's demand
for Kendrick Lamar songs, OK?

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.180
Let's say that her
demand is such that--

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.480
now, once again,
the trick here is

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.080
we've drawn a
continuous demand curve.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.830
It's a discrete decision, so
bear with me-- the numbers.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.330
Bear with me, just
think about this.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.420
But roughly speaking,
she's willing to pay

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:50.455
for the first Kendrick Lamar
song between $4 and $5, OK?

00:25:50.455 --> 00:25:51.830
For the next
Kendrick Lamar song,

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:57.090
she's willing to pay
between $3 and $4 and so on.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:00.130
So this gives you--
so to make life easy,

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.630
let's imagine she's willing to
pay $4 for the first Kendrick

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.030
Lamar song, $3 for the
second Kendrick Lamar song,

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.570
$2 for the third
Kendrick Lamar song,

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.490
and $4 for the first
Kendrick, and--

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.720
I'm sorry-- $1 bucket for the
fourth Kendrick Lamar song, OK?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.595
So imagine that's
basically her demand curve.

00:26:16.595 --> 00:26:18.970
It's not quite that discrete,
but we can make it stepwise

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:19.710
if you want--

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.680
just be ugly looking, OK?

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.492
So that's her demand curve.

00:26:23.492 --> 00:26:24.450
So what does that mean?

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.580
That means when she buys the
fourth Kendrick Lamar song,

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.760
when she buys King Kunta
or whatever, that is

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.490
zero surplus, OK?

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.270
Zero surplus.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:39.800
She was willing to pay $1 for
"King Kunta," and it cost $1,

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.550
so she's done, OK?

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.540
However, what does that mean?

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.040
That means when she
bought "Humble,"

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.570
which was her first choice
song, she gained a surplus.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.760
Because she paid $1 for that.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.740
But she was willing
to pay $4 for it.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.570
So she gained a surplus.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.550
And the surplus
is the difference

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.070
between what she paid,
which is represented

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.768
by the horizontal
line and a dollar,

00:27:04.768 --> 00:27:06.310
and what she was
willing to pay which

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:09.040
is the main curve, which is $4.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.480
So she gained that surplus.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.195
Yeah?

00:27:11.195 --> 00:27:13.610
AUDIENCE: Let's
say as her father,

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.010
you want to get her a gift--

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.930
all these Kendrick Lamar songs.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:18.460
And let's say it's special.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.190
I don't know-- $2,
something like that.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.450
Would the consumer
surplus be what you think

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.320
she would want out
of it or what she--

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.070
JONATHAN GRUBER: Let
me come back to that.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.970
It's a great question.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.160
There's a famous
article about that.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.868
And I'll come back to
that in one minute.

00:27:29.868 --> 00:27:30.780
Let me finish this.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.600
The bottom line is
the surplus there

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.810
is between what she was willing
to pay and what she had to pay,

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:39.570
which in a continuous example
is this entire triangle.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.140
Think of being able to
buy fractions of songs--

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.470
little bits, ringtones
or whatever, OK?

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.450
Fractures of songs, OK?

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:51.230
Then this entire area under
the curve, above the price

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.430
is her surplus.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.340
She was willing to pay
the points on the curve.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.710
She only had to pay
the flat line at $1.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:02.420
So the entire difference
is her surplus, OK?

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.970
The key point is
this is all driven

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.590
by diminishing margin utility.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.420
That is the reason her surplus
goes to zero eventually--

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.850
is eventually gets tired
of Kendrick Lamar songs,

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:15.570
so it goes down.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.880
We have diminishing margin
utility for the songs.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.358
And that's why we get consumer
surplus as a triangle.

00:28:20.358 --> 00:28:22.650
It's the difference between
the downward sloping demand

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:27.340
curve and the flat price line
that the consumer faces, OK?

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.000
So the individual consumer
surplus-- individual consumer

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.350
surplus, OK?

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.210
It's her demands-- that
individual graph, OK?

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.160
Individual graph.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.840
Her demand is downward sloping.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.790
And therefore, her
surplus difference between

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.120
is the area under the demand
curve, above the price line.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.620
Yeah?

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.649
AUDIENCE: If demand is
perfectly inelastic, is

00:28:44.649 --> 00:28:46.175
it infinite consumer circle?

00:28:46.175 --> 00:28:47.800
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Let's talk about that.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:53.380
Let's talk about-- actually,
I don't have it here.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.500
If demand was
perfectly inelastic,

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.500
you're absolutely right.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.540
The consumer surplus
would be infinite.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.945
Because the area
under the demand

00:28:59.945 --> 00:29:01.820
curve above the price
line would be infinity.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.680
It'd be a rectangle
going up to infinity.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.720
Why is that?

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.220
Why is the consumer
surplus infinite

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:06.985
if demand is inelastic?

00:29:06.985 --> 00:29:08.580
AUDIENCE: Because they'd
pay anything for it.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.747
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because
they'd pay anything for it.

00:29:10.747 --> 00:29:12.600
So at any price, it's a bargain.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.720
In theory, if you're an
incredibly rich diabetic,

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.605
you would pay an infinite
amount to have insulin.

00:29:18.605 --> 00:29:20.480
So at any price, you're
getting huge surplus.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.813
You're getting infinite surplus.

00:29:21.813 --> 00:29:24.220
Infinitely minus
anything is infinity.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.810
Likewise, what's
the consumer surplus

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:27.160
if demand is perfectly elastic?

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:27.700
Same person.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.000
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.450
JONATHAN GRUBER: What?

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:28.760
Zero.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.260
Why?

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.923
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:30.923 --> 00:29:32.590
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's graphically why.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:33.490
But intuitively, why?

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.770
Why do you get no
surplus from a good

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.932
where demand is fairly elastic?

00:29:37.932 --> 00:29:39.478
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:39.478 --> 00:29:42.020
JONATHAN GRUBER: What makes a
perfectly elastic demand curve?

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.210
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because-- why?

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:50.593
Because there's substitutes
that you're indifferent towards.

00:29:50.593 --> 00:29:52.510
That's what gets the
perfectly elastic demand.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.295
So if I'm indifferent
between Jujyfruits--

00:29:55.295 --> 00:29:57.170
god, you guys probably
don't know Jujyfruits.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.120
If I'm indifferent between--

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.620
God, I don't even know
what candy is anymore.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.120
Whatever.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.160
If I'm ever eating candy
A and candy B, and then

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.550
I get no surplus for
consuming candy A, why?

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:13.040
Because I'm equally
happy with candy B. So

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.600
candy A gives me no surplus.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.900
What does the candy people eat?

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.400
What do people eat?

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.570
AUDIENCE: Jolly Rancher.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.810
JONATHAN GRUBER: What?

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:18.440
AUDIENCE: Jolly Rancher.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.010
JONATHAN GRUBER: Jolly Rancher.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.910
I love Jolly Ranchers.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:20.970
AUDIENCE: M&M's and Skittles.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:21.590
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.090
Well, no.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.920
But that's irrelevant, 'cause
Skittles are just disappointing

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.790
M&M's.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:26.690
Let's be honest.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.600
When you get Skittles, you're
just pissed off they're not

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.100
M&M's.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:29.733
Am I right?

00:30:29.733 --> 00:30:31.650
I mean, Skittles are
just disappointing M&M's,

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:32.720
so we can't do that one.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.877
Let's do Jolly Ranchers
versus Skittles, maybe.

00:30:34.877 --> 00:30:35.960
Those are more comparable.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.668
Because M&M's are
better than everything.

00:30:37.668 --> 00:30:41.008
So basically, Jolly Ranchers
and Skittles-- since I'm

00:30:41.008 --> 00:30:42.800
indifferent to Jolly
Ranchers and Skittles,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.240
I get no surplus
eating the Skittles.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.448
Because I would equally
happy having a Jolly Rancher.

00:30:46.448 --> 00:30:48.780
So surplus is zero for a
perfectly elastic demand

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.280
and good.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.447
It's infinite for a perfectly
inelastically demanded

00:30:51.447 --> 00:30:52.322
good, OK?

00:30:52.322 --> 00:30:53.780
Now, let's go back
to the question.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.060
There's a famous article
in economics called

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.730
the "Deadweight
Loss of Christmas--"

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.600
we're such an awful profession--

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.450
based about how
terrible gift-giving is.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:04.550
And why is gift-giving terrible?

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.970
Because if you gave
people cash, they

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.140
could get what
they want the most.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.930
But if you give
them a gift, it's

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.750
by definition, lower
surplus than the cash.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.780
Because they could always
go out and buy that good

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.555
with the cash.

00:31:18.555 --> 00:31:20.180
So by definition,
giving someone a gift

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.930
makes them worse off than giving
them that same amount of cash.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.972
So this guy-- is he
interviewed all the students.

00:31:24.972 --> 00:31:26.180
I think was at Penn State.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.940
And he asked them how much their
parents' presents really worth

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.710
to them.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.585
And he found the deadweight
loss of Christmas

00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:33.170
is hundreds of
billions of dollars.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.570
People would way rather
have cash than the parents--

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.210
but what did he get wrong?

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.160
What did he get wrong?

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.040
Why is that not
necessarily a bad thing?

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.040
Yeah, you asked the first
question, so go ahead.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.732
AUDIENCE: You like the
surprise of opening a present.

00:31:46.732 --> 00:31:47.690
JONATHAN GRUBER: Maybe.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.070
But even ignoring that,
what else did he get wrong?

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.310
Yeah?

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.440
AUDIENCE: It's an emotional
connect if something my grandma

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.240
bought me a--

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.590
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
like the surprise.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:55.890
There's emotional connections.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.595
That's all well and good,
but that's not very big, OK?

00:31:58.595 --> 00:31:59.970
What's really big
that he missed?

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.180
AUDIENCE: Because the
person who buys it-- they

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.323
saw what they get from it.

00:32:03.323 --> 00:32:05.490
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, he
missed the fact the person

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.590
who gave it gets
utility from giving it.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.010
So in fact, the package
may be efficient,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.680
because you like the surprise
and the person gets utility.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.638
But if compare it to
dollars, it's inefficient.

00:32:15.638 --> 00:32:18.870
So it's a clever, clever
little exercise he did.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.622
OK, so basically, that's
individual consumer surplus.

00:32:22.622 --> 00:32:25.080
But in this course, we don't
care about individual consumer

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:25.580
surplus.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.700
We care about market
consumer surplus.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.200
So let's turn to figures 9-7
and think about a market.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.450
Let's see about
the market for gas.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.250
Now, the mechanics
is the same here.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.720
But we're actually
now thinking not

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.680
about the individual buying
1 gallon versus 2 gallons,

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.750
but the market for gas.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.250
How many gallons in
aggregate will be bought?

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:50.610
But the analysis is the same,
that basically the willingness

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.150
to pay for gas is the demand
curve for gas, the market

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.890
demand curve for gas.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.730
The price is the price.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.480
So the difference is the
area under the demand

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.100
curve above the price.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.170
The idea here is for consumers
all the way to the left,

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.378
they have to drive to work.

00:33:08.378 --> 00:33:09.170
They have to drive.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.010
They have to drive a lot.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.570
They're truck
drivers or whatever.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:12.720
They have to drive a lot.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.380
So for them, they have a huge
willingness to pay for gas.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.715
So they make a huge surplus.

00:33:18.715 --> 00:33:20.590
The more you want
something at a given price,

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.600
the more surplus you get.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.150
Whereas you move to
the right, that's

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.970
people who need to
drive less and less.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.940
Once you pass point A,
why does surplus go away?

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.216
To the right of point A, why is
there no more consumer surplus?

00:33:31.216 --> 00:33:32.122
Yeah?

00:33:32.122 --> 00:33:33.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.910
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Didn't happen, because?

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.794
AUDIENCE: Because [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:37.794 --> 00:33:38.383
It's beyond.

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:40.050
JONATHAN GRUBER: Your
willingness to pay

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.550
is below the price, right?

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.043
So a transaction-- so consumer
surplus can't go negative,

00:33:44.043 --> 00:33:45.710
but when negatives
just wouldn't buy it,

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.140
especially with negative
consumer surplus, OK?

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.760
When negative, you just
wouldn't buy it, OK?

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.330
But as you get closer
and closer to A,

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:58.470
then you actually do end up with
consumer surplus going to zero,

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.360
OK?

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.590
So that's the market
consumer surplus.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.070
So let's ask.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.429
Let's talk about a couple of
aspects of market consumer

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:08.929
surplus.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.510
First question-- what
happens to consumer surplus

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:12.980
when the price changes?

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.830
Let's show that in figure 9-8.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:22.420
Let's say the price of gas goes
up from $3 to $3.50 a gallon.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:30.310
Consumer surplus
shrinks by a trapezoid.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:34.629
Consumer surplus used to be the
entire area below the demand

00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:35.129
curve.

00:34:35.129 --> 00:34:37.780
It used to be the entire area
is below the demand curve

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.159
and above $3.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:40.760
It used to be that
whole triangle.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.480
Now, it's just
the empty triangle

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.940
above the new price curve
and below the demand curve.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.409
So the new consumer surplus
is just the area above $3.50

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:52.690
on the main curve, so it's
the area not shaded in.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:57.080
What you've lost
is the trapezoid,

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.545
that on the y-axis goes between
$3 and $3.50 and then along

00:35:00.545 --> 00:35:01.670
the line, goes from A to B.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.410
You've lost that trapezoid.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.890
Why is it a trapezoid?

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.990
Why is the loss-- consumer
surplus a trapezoid?

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.430
Because two things
have happened.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.597
What are the two things
that have happened that have

00:35:12.597 --> 00:35:14.380
reduced your consumer surplus?

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.220
Get some more folks involved.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.380
Folks, go ahead.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.463
AUDIENCE: The quantity
supplied goes down as well.

00:35:19.463 --> 00:35:21.547
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, not
just quantity supplied.

00:35:21.547 --> 00:35:22.960
Quantity sold goes down.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.980
Because you want less
supply, because you are--

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.030
so the first thing is
because the price gone up,

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.710
you want less.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.600
That's the triangle you lost.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.440
You have given up units that
you used to get surplus on,

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.650
used to derive surplus in all
the units from 900 to 1,000.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.840
So what happened here
is the price goes up.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.970
And a hundred fewer
people buy gas.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:43.600
That's the way
I've labeled this.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.020
That could be
people buy less gas.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:45.850
Let's make it easy.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:47.008
A hundred people buy gas.

00:35:47.008 --> 00:35:49.300
So a hundred people used to
buy gas, no longer buy gas.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.550
They're out of the gas market.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.330
They bike instead, OK?

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.555
Now, they clearly were
not that sad to bike,

00:35:55.555 --> 00:35:57.430
or they would've had a
huge surplus from gas.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.380
But they're a
little sad to bike.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.790
It's a crappy day out.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.250
They rather be driving.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.910
And so they lost
surplus from the fact

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.280
that now at the higher price,
they have to bike instead,

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.655
but it's a little
bit of surplus.

00:36:07.655 --> 00:36:09.200
It's just a little triangle, OK?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.390
So there's a little
bit of surplus lost.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.670
Because some people who
were close to indifferent

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.770
now have to bike
instead of driving.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.060
But why the big--

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.450
what's the big rectangle?

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:18.960
Same person.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.436
What caused the big rectangle?

00:36:20.436 --> 00:36:21.950
AUDIENCE: The increase in price.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:23.900
JONATHAN GRUBER: Increase
in price for who?

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.840
For the people who were
already buying it anyway.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.910
So the big losers
are the people who

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:30.830
are going to drive
anyway and now just have

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.510
to pay more for it.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.610
Because here's the key point.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.470
The people between A and B--

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:37.920
the last hundred people--

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.680
they were pretty
close to indifferent.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.230
They didn't lose that much
surplus from not driving.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.810
All the people to the
left of person 900--

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:47.000
they get big surplus
from driving.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.267
So their surplus simply
went down by this rectangle.

00:36:49.267 --> 00:36:51.350
They used to get the
difference between the demand

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.200
curve and $3.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.450
Now, that's the difference
the demand curve and $3.50.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.220
It's just a pure loss.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.380
So when you raise a price,
the existing-- the people

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.210
whose behavior doesn't
change are worse off.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.460
Some of those behavior change.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.478
They're a little worse
off, but not that much.

00:37:06.478 --> 00:37:07.520
So the triangle is small.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.660
The rectangle is big.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.590
The big loss is the
people who like gas a lot,

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:15.380
but now have to pay
more for it, OK?

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.460
Point one.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.750
Point two-- what determines
whether consumer surplus is

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:21.400
large or small?

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.580
Well, we cover this.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.160
It's elasticity of
demand, determines

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.860
whether consumer surplus
is large or small.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:33.565
So, for example, figure 9-9
takes the gas market with

00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:37.000
a price of $3.00 and a thousand
people buying gas and uses

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.550
two-- shows two
different demand curves,

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.790
both of which go
through point A.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:47.830
So both demand curves yield
the equilibrium price of $3.00

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.040
and the equilibrium
quantity of a thousand, OK?

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.540
So these two different
demand curves

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.915
are just two different sets
of preferences, both of which

00:37:54.915 --> 00:37:56.380
yield the same
equilibrium outcome.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.400
And yet, under the
steeper demand curve,

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.850
the consumer surplus is larger
than under the flatter demand

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:05.530
curve.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.200
And that's for the
reason we talked about.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.450
That's for the reason.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.880
That's because with
a steeper demand

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.370
curve, the more
inelastic demand,

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.770
people want the good more.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.960
They basically-- they're
less willing to give it up

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.790
as the price goes up.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.120
Therefore, at any price, they're
making more surplus off it.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.730
With a flatter
demand curve, people

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.000
are basically closer
to indifferent

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.170
with some other good.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.970
So they're not so sad
if the price goes up.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.877
Their surplus is smaller
from getting this good.

00:38:35.877 --> 00:38:37.710
They're seeing what
they were willing to pay

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:42.490
and what they have to
pay is smaller, OK?

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.610
So that's how we think
about consumer surplus.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.460
It's basically the excess
of your willingness

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.470
to pay above what
you have to pay.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.280
So if the price goes up,
your surplus goes down.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.510
And surplus is larger, the more
inelastic is the demand curve.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.010
Yeah?

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
producers would want it,

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.760
but consumers are having a zero
surplus, if that makes sense?

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.563
Because they're at the point
where not only paying more,

00:39:07.563 --> 00:39:09.230
but they're selling
as much as they can?

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.850
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Great question we'll

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.558
talk about when we
talk about monopolies.

00:39:11.558 --> 00:39:13.630
Right now, why can't
producers do that?

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.930
Why can't producers
exploit that?

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:18.040
Because perfectly-- yeah?

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.302
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:39:21.302 --> 00:39:23.802
That's a perfect answer to a
perfectly competitive question.

00:39:23.802 --> 00:39:25.687
Because they're
price takers, OK?

00:39:25.687 --> 00:39:27.520
So they can't do an
exploiting of consumers.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.440
They don't have that choice.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.190
Starting next lecture
or one lecture after,

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.385
we'll talk about monopoly.

00:39:33.385 --> 00:39:34.510
Then they're price setters.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.950
Then they'll start
thinking about that.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.570
But right now, they can't,
because their price takers.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.540
JONATHAN GRUBER: I mean,
ultimately, that's what-- yeah,

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.707
ultimately, they'd like to--

00:39:41.707 --> 00:39:43.870
the surplus is just extra
money somebody has got.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.300
If you're a business owner,
why should consumers have it?

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.610
You want it, OK?

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.920
So that's consumer surplus.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.120
Any other question
about consumer surplus?

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:54.810
OK.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.190
Now, let's move on.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.905
And let's talk about
producer surplus.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:09.010
Let's talk about
producer surplus, OK?

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.380
Now, the idea here is the same.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.630
Consumer surplus
was the difference

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:18.520
between the willingness to
pay for a good and its price.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.550
Producer surplus
is the difference

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:24.090
between the willingness to
supply a good and its price.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.460
And how do we measure
willingness to supply?

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.780
The supply curve.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:33.995
So as figure 9-10 shows, the
producer surplus for any given

00:40:33.995 --> 00:40:34.495
firm--

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.740
firms have an upward
sloping supply curve.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.030
And the market is
delivering them some price.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:46.230
So let's think about this firm.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:49.410
When they produce the first
unit-- this is a gas production

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:50.100
firm, OK?

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.540
A gas refiner, say.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.130
When they refine that
first gallon of gas,

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.340
that costs them almost nothing.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.110
Because margin cost
is upward sloping.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.190
They've already
paid the fixed cost.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.620
They don't care
in the short run.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.120
So all I care about
is variable costs, OK?

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.258
So at the end of the day,
this is not expensive.

00:41:07.258 --> 00:41:09.800
They are willing to produce that
first gallon really cheaply.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.260
They've already invested in
this giant refinery plant.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.658
Marginal costs are tiny.

00:41:13.658 --> 00:41:15.950
So they get a huge-- but at
the same time you pay them,

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:18.590
you don't differentiate
what you pay per gallons.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:21.800
You plug the thing into your
car and you get the gas, OK?

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.410
So they're getting $3 a gallon,
but they're not paying much

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.820
to make that gallon.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.260
However, as they
make more gallons,

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.710
their marginal cost increases.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:35.620
So the surplus they earn on
each gallon produced shrinks.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:39.900
The surplus they earn at
each gallon produced shrinks.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.000
And so eventually,
they get to a point

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.547
where they are essentially
indifferent about producing

00:41:44.547 --> 00:41:45.630
the next unit of gasoline.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.090
That's at a price of
$3 and a quantity of--

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.453
should be little q, OK?

00:41:50.453 --> 00:41:51.870
That's the point
at which they are

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:58.970
indifferent between producing
gas and not producing gas.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.500
Therefore, their
surplus is zero.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.990
So producer surplus
is the difference

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.360
between the price line.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.200
And the upward sloping supply
curve is produced surplus.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.420
Now, in the long run,
we have a name for that.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.660
It's called profits, OK?

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.510
So our consumer surplus is this
abstract, weird, theoretical

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.080
concept.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.490
Produced surplus-- you
can get your hands around.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.510
It's profits.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:24.900
Basically, remember,
in the long run,

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.390
marginal cost equals
average cost, right?

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:30.930
Because in the long run, you
produce until marginal cost

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.830
equals average cost.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:36.480
Therefore, the supply curve
is the average cost curve.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.880
Price minus average
cost is profits.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.770
Therefore, producer
surplus is profits.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:43.680
Let me say it again, a little
three-line proof for you.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.920
OK, in the long run, marginal
cost equals average cost.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.530
Second, the supply curve
is the marginal cost curve.

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:54.210
Therefore, it's the
average cost curve.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:58.380
Third, profits is defined
as price minus average cost.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.050
Fourth, profits is
the shaded area.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.440
Now, in the short run,
that's not quite right.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.960
Because there's the whole
shutdown decision, which makes

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.490
things awkward.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.100
But roughly speaking,
it's not terrible to think

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.860
about producer surplus
as being profits.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.750
That's a shorthand
that largely works.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.700
If it ever doesn't work,
we'll let you know.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.742
But that's the shorthand.

00:43:17.742 --> 00:43:20.750
It should largely work, OK?

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.250
Now, of course,
once again, we don't

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.167
care about individual
firm's producer surplus.

00:43:24.167 --> 00:43:25.980
We care about the
market producer surplus,

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.400
so let's go to figure 9-11.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.390
Figure 9-11 is basically
the market surplus curve.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:38.940
And the idea here is that
essentially to the left,

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.947
you have a market supply curve
where basically, remember,

00:43:41.947 --> 00:43:44.030
the individual firm's
supply curve is always flat.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.460
But the market supply
curve doesn't have to be.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.960
It doesn't have to be flat, OK?

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.370
The market supply curve--

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:51.478
well, no, let me back up.

00:43:51.478 --> 00:43:53.520
A market supply curve is
flat under a certain set

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.600
of conditions.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.418
But now, let's imagine that
those conditions aren't true.

00:43:57.418 --> 00:43:58.710
For example, let's go back to--

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.390
I talked at the
end of last lecture

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:01.635
about heterogeneous firms.

00:44:01.635 --> 00:44:03.510
Remember, we talked
about the cotton example.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:05.677
Some firms are more efficient
producers than others.

00:44:05.677 --> 00:44:07.290
If all firms are
identical and it's

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.060
very competitive, of course,
the market supply curve is flat.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.540
So this graph would
be uninteresting.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.390
But in fact, imagine that
firms aren't identical.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:18.620
Some firms are more efficient
producers than others, OK?

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.410
For example, in that
case, what you'll see

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:24.290
is the most efficient
producer will earn

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.220
the most surplus,
i.e., the most profit.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.320
They're all the way to the left.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.210
As you move to the
right, you're getting

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.480
to less and less
efficient producers, OK?

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.070
So profit is shrinking.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:40.660
So under the conditions
we started with last time,

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.010
then price would
always equal supply.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.820
It'd be a flat supply
curve at the price

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.530
and therefore, profits are zero.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.880
That is producer
surplus is zero.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.640
So we derived-- towards the end
of the last lecture, we said,

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.770
in the long run, a perfectly
competitive market--

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:55.615
profit is zero.

00:44:55.615 --> 00:44:57.740
That's the same as saying
producer surplus is zero.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.830
And why is that?

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.950
That's because in that
case, the price line

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:02.480
is on top of the supply curve.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.843
Therefore, there's
no gap between them.

00:45:04.843 --> 00:45:07.010
So in the long run, a
perfectly competitive market--

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:10.130
there's zero produced of
surplus, means zero profit.

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.430
In reality, we talked
about conditions

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.930
why there would be an upward
sloping, long-run supply curve,

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:17.360
like firms different,
how efficient they are.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.890
Or there's barriers
to entry, which

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.040
means some firms can't come
in and drive profits to zero.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.643
Or there's an upward
sloping input price curve,

00:45:24.643 --> 00:45:26.810
meaning that basically the
more you want to produce,

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:28.520
the more you have
to pay workers.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.923
For all those reasons, the
supply curve slopes up.

00:45:30.923 --> 00:45:32.840
And therefore, you can
get a producer surplus.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:36.930
You can get some profits,
even the long run, OK?

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:40.470
So basically, what
we have here is

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:44.370
a situation where as long as
the supply curve slopes up,

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:45.940
you get a long-run
producer surplus,

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.580
which is the difference between
the price and the supply curve,

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:49.080
OK?

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.550
And that is the same as profits.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.810
Questions about that?

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:54.143
OK, let me cover one last point.

00:45:54.143 --> 00:45:56.102
Going back to last
lecture-- going to have time

00:45:56.102 --> 00:45:57.520
to get to your last lecture.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:01.660
Remember, we talked about three
reasons why, in the long run,

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.230
even in a competitive
market, supply can slope up.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:06.835
We talked about
heterogeneous firms.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.850
That is firms with
different levels

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.040
of efficiency of production.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.615
We talked about
barriers to entry.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:21.540
That is reasons why firms
can't enter and drive profits

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:22.320
to zero.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.120
Because it's not
costless to enter.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:32.937
And we talked about upward
sloping, input supply curves.

00:46:32.937 --> 00:46:35.020
We talked about the fact
that as you produce more,

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.940
you might have to pay
more for your inputs.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.440
And therefore, you
can't just charge

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.658
when-- you have to charge higher
prices as you produce more.

00:46:42.658 --> 00:46:44.950
I want to highlight something
I said quickly last time,

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:48.610
the difference between
these two and this one.

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:52.510
In these two, there are profits.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.682
In these two, there
are profits, OK?

00:46:54.682 --> 00:46:56.140
Because in each of
these, there are

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.897
reasons why the
market will not drive

00:46:58.897 --> 00:46:59.980
every firm to zero profit.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.740
Some firms remain in-- much
like Pakistan made profits

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.150
on their cotton sales.

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:05.110
Some firms remain in.

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:06.850
Likewise, with the
barriers to entry,

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.530
the firms that are
in the market that

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:12.260
have gotten over those
barriers will make money, OK?

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.450
In this case, the firm doesn't
necessarily make money, OK?

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.700
What it does here
is it just pays.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:23.370
It takes that extra money and
pays it out to workers, OK?

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.650
So whether or not an upward
sloping supply curve,

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:28.020
doesn't necessarily mean
the firm makes profit.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.187
It could just be upward
sloping, because their input

00:47:30.187 --> 00:47:31.890
costs are rising, OK?

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.350
So that's an important
distinction to keep in mind.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:37.542
So let's stop there with
that mind-blowing insight.

00:47:37.542 --> 00:47:38.250
Let's stop there.

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:39.240
And we'll come back.

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.880
And we'll talk more
about welfare economics.

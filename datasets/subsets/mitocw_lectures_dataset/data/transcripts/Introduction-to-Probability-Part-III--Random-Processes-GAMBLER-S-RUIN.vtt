00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.910
In this last video,
we illustrate

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.210
how to use the techniques
we have recently

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.880
learned in order to
answer some questions

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.250
about the following
classical problem--

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.410
consider a gambler
putting a bet of $1

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.380
in a game that has a pay off
of one dollar if she wins.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.320
We assume that this
is a fair game,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.320
so the probability of winning
$1 on each play of the game

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.250
is one-half.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.910
And so the probability of
losing the bet is also one-half.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.150
Suppose that she
starts with i dollars

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.930
and continues to play
the game until either she

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.380
reaches a goal of n dollars, or
she has no money left, whatever

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.950
comes first.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.600
Let us consider a
first question, which

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.070
is the following-- what is the
probability that she ends up

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.840
with having her
goal of n dollars?

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.830
Now, how to go about
solving this problem?

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.080
Can we think of a Markov
chain representation

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.200
for this problem?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.620
But in that case, what
would be good choices

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.629
for the definition
of the states?

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:13.170
Let us think.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.730
At any point in time, the
only relevant information

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.150
is the amount of money
the gambler has available.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.970
How she got to that amount
in the past is irrelevant.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.030
And if this amount is
neither zero nor n,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.729
then she will play again.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.400
And the next state
will be a number

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.750
which will be increased
or decreased by one unit,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.300
depending on winning
or losing the next bet.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.470
So we can represent the
possible evolution of this game

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.930
with the following
probability transition graph.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.979
So we have n plus 1 states.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.160
This is the state where
she loses all her money.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.050
This is the state where
she has i amount of money

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.020
before the next betting.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.810
And here, this is the state
n where she reaches her goal

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.320
and she can leave.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.840
In terms of the
transition probability,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.650
assuming that you are at a
given time in that state,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.210
that means that you have
i money in your pocket,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.660
and you play the next bet.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.470
With a probability one-half,
you will gain or win.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.600
And so your amount
of money is i plus 1.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.290
Or you lose and your
money is i minus 1.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.340
And you keep repeating until
you reach either n or zero.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.360
And then you stop.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.900
So this is a Markov chain, and
that state 0 and that state n

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.579
are absorbing states.

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.790
Once you reach them,
you stay there forever.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.360
So what this question is
asking is the probability a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.100
of i of-- starting from i, what
is the probability that you

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.390
will end up in that
absorbing state?

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.420
And we have done this
calculation previously.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.760
So let us repeat the
technique very briefly.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.630
Clearly here, if you
start with 0 dollars,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.860
you will never reach that.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.670
So it's going to be 0.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.170
On the other hand, if you
start with your desired goal,

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.240
you don't play anymore.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.110
So your probability is 1.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.640
Now of course,
what is of interest

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.260
is if i is strictly
between 0 and n.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.760
And now the question is how
to calculate that probability.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.550
And we have seen
that the way to do

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.320
that is to look
at the situation,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.300
and say let's assume that
you are in that state i.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.500
And what happens next?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.280
Well with a probability 0.5,
you will move to that state.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.760
And now you are in that level
with i plus 1 amount of money.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.410
And what is the probability
that, given that you're here,

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.079
you're going to end up in n?

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.740
It's going to be a i plus one.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.470
So it's a i plus one.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.410
Plus the other
alternative is that you

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.570
are going to lose money
and end up in that state.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.780
And there, the remaining
probability to reach the time n

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.860
is a i minus 1.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.870
So you have this
kind of equation.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.329
This is valid for all
i between 0 and n.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.280
And this is a system of
equations that you can solve.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.010
It's not very
difficult to solve.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.910
Actually, you can
look in the textbook.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.760
There will be some
trick to do that.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.420
There are many, many
ways to do that.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.700
We're not going to spend
our time going into details,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.130
but essentially if
you solve that system,

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.760
you will see that the
answer will be that a of i

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.000
is i over n.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.350
So if you start with
i amount of money,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.640
the probability that you're
going to reach your goal here

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.100
is i over n.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.659
So here clearly, if
you're extremely greedy,

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.260
and you have a very,
very, very high goal,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.000
that means n is
very, very large--

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.600
so large that compared
to your initial amount i,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.647
n can be considered
to be infinity.

00:05:10.647 --> 00:05:13.230
Then the probability that you're
going to reach your high goal

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.000
will go to 0, where
n goes to infinity.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.060
So again, if you are
extremely greedy,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.450
no matter how much your fixed
amount of initial money is,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.640
the probability that you
will stop the game reaching

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.220
your goal is going to
be increasingly small.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.720
And since the other state
is 1 minus this one,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.460
the priority that you're
going to get ruined

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.710
is going to be closer to 1.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.850
All right, so we have
that answer here.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.970
What about the next question?

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.920
Next question is
the following-- what

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.440
would be the expected
wealth at the end?

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.190
Again, this is a
Markov chain where

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.900
there are two absorbing states.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.960
All the others are transient.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.020
You're guaranteed
with probability 1

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.330
that you will reach
either 0 or n.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.910
So it's a valid question to
know once you reach either 0

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.330
or n, what is the expected
wealth at the end?

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.530
Well, if you arrive
here, it's going to be 0.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.790
And if you arrive here,
it's going to be n.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.450
So the expected
value of that wealth

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.320
will be 0 times the probability
of ending in that, plus n times

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.120
the probability
of getting there.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.210
So it's going to be that
expression-- 0 times

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.040
1 minus a of i,
plus n times a of i.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.970
And here what we then get is
n times i over n, which is i.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.130
Which is quite interesting.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.590
This is exactly how you started.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.570
So in some sense, in expectation
there is no free lunch here.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.500
The next question is--
how long does the gambler

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.460
expect to stay in the game?

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.850
We know that eventually,
he will either reach 0

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.830
or n with probability 1.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.160
The question is-- how
long is it going to take?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.830
Again, we have seen
in a previous video

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.670
that this is essentially
calculating the expectation

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.130
to absorption.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.030
And we know how to do that.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.550
So let's recap what we had said.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.770
If you define mu of i to be
the expected number of plays

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.540
starting from i,
what do you have?

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.880
Well, for i equal
to 0 or i equals n,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.010
either way-- if you
start from here,

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.390
or you start from here--
the expected number of plays

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.440
is 0, right?

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.520
Because you're done.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.930
And otherwise, you use the same
kind of derivation that we had.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.470
If you start at i
between 1 and n,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:48.480
then you will see that mu of i,
after one transition, plus 1,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.570
you will either be in state
i plus 1-- in that case,

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.200
this expectation will
be mu i plus 1 --

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.450
or you will be in
state i minus 1.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:05.680
In that case, the
expectation is mu i minus 1.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.470
So this is an equation
that you have,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.370
which is almost the
same as this one,

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.830
except that you
have a plus 1 in it.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.140
And as we had discussed
before, in general

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.620
this is the kind of
formula that you have.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.680
Now you can solve the system.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.890
I will let you do that.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.300
There are many ways to do this.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.700
But the solution that
you're going to have

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:34.610
is that mu i will be equals
to i times n minus i.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.520
This is the result.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.530
Finally what would
be the case if you

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:45.510
didn't have a fair game-- for
example, unfair to the gambler

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.660
or unfair to the casino?

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.550
What we mean here is
that the probability p

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.930
is different from 0.5.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:02.160
So here, instead of 0.5,
you have p everywhere.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.570
And here, of course,
you have 1 minus p

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.400
everywhere on this side.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.090
So you have a
probability p of winning,

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.180
and probability 1 minus
p of losing each bet.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.520
So you might ask the
same question-- well,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.470
for the probability a of
i, you still have 0 here.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.380
You still have 1 here.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.180
The formula that you
would write here,

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.330
instead of writing
it this way, it

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.550
would be-- you start from
here with a probability p.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.410
You end up here.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.350
And with a probability of 1
minus p, you end up there.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.360
And the expression that
you get for a of i--

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.970
if you define r to be 1
minus p over p-- you will see

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:49.820
that a of i is going to be
1 minus r to the power of i

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:55.060
over 1 minus r to the power n.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.510
And what would be the expected
amount of time she will play?

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.500
Instead of that equation,
if you solve it,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.830
you would have mu of i
equals r plus 1 divided

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:16.840
by r minus 1 times i minus
n times 1 minus r to the i

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.330
divided by 1 minus
r to the power n.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.730
Because you would have here
again p, and 1 minus p here.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.490
And you can see that when p is
strictly less than one-half--

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.110
in other words, it's even
worse for this gambler--

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.860
then a of i-- which is
the probability of getting

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.600
to this favorable
state-- will also go to 0

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.290
when n goes to infinity.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.370
And in the case where p is
strictly greater than 0.5--

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.930
that means that she has some
favored odd on her favor--

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.880
then in that case, this number r
to the power n will go to zero.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.970
And 1 minus r of i will
represent the probability

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.730
that she would become
infinitely rich.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.880
In other words, being very
greedy and n going to infinity.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.840
This will go to 0 and 1
minus r to the power of i

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.520
is the probability that she
would get infinitely rich.

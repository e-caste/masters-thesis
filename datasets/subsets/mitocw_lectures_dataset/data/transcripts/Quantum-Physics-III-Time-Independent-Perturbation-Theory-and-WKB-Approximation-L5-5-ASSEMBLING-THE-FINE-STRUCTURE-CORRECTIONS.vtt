00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.340
PROFESSOR: So again,
much of the difficulty

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.660
here is just making sure you're
doing the perturbation theory

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.840
right and working with
the two basis correctly.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.380
But now we're in
the good position.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.410
We can combine our results.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.380
So here is what I
want to combine.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.930
I want, in principle, to combine
all the things, all the terms.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.190
And we've calculated all
the terms to some degree.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.650
So we saw the Darwin term
only affects l equals 0.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:04.440
On the other hand, spin orbit
really requires s dot l.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.970
And the state should be
acted nontrivially by l.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.880
If all your states are
singlets, l gives 0 on them.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.320
So actually, you
have a little bit

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.480
of an uncomfortable situation
because l acting on l

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.640
equals 0 states will give you 0.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.400
But you still have
the 1 over r cubed.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.860
And the 1 over r cubed
has l dependencies here.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.260
So it's 0 in the denominator,
0 in the numerator.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.770
The whole spin orbit
coupling doesn't seem

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.110
to make sense for l equals 0.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.030
So most people say, physically,
the spin orbit coupling

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.050
vanishes for l equals 0.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.990
It should not be there.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.100
But then something
very funny happens.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.890
If you take a proper limit
of this as l goes to 0,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.550
it gives you, for the spin
orbit result, the same thing

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.510
as the Darwin result.
So for l equals 0,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.750
the spin orbit limit is
actually the same as the Darwin.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.750
It's almost as if
you say, oh, the spin

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.370
orbit has everything in it.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.280
But it's not legal
for l equals 0.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.800
But the Darwin does it.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.560
So if I put together the
spin orbit and relativistics

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.570
for l different
from 0, I'm legal.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.090
For l equals 0, I should really
sum relativistic and Darwin.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.160
But actually, it
turns out that it's

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.190
the same as summing
relativistic plus spin orbit.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.680
Because the limit of
spin orbit for l equals 0

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.270
is equal to the Darwin.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.240
So we will just sum
relativistic plus spin orbit.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.120
And that gives the result
for everything, including

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.340
Darwin for l equals 0.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.520
So this is minor subtlety.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.080
But the end result is
that we can combine it.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.210
So the happy thing, as well,
is that we now can do this.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:26.260
mj delta H relativistic plus
delta H spin orbit nljmj.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.300
Because whatever
we calculated here

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.200
was actually the same
that H relativistic

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.630
in the coupled basis.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.830
And anyway, the spin orbit,
we use the coupled basis

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.100
to get this number.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.040
So this thing, you can
add the two results,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:01.360
and you get En0 squared
over 2mc squared 3 plus n

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:12.670
J j plus 1 minus 3l l
plus 1 minus 3/4 over l l

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.060
plus 1/2 l plus 1--

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.825
a little messy.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.390
OK.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.510
Something very
unexpected happens now.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.880
It's something that when you do
the algebra yourself, you say,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.780
wow.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.625
How did that happen?

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.815
Here is the issue.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.810
We are trying to compute the
splittings of the hydrogen

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.340
atom.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.300
And for this, as we said
in the coupled basis,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.480
the degeneracies happen
for a given value of n.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.775
I'm getting good at
doing this diagram now.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.390
So we're looking at the fixed n.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.390
And then, you have all kind of
degenerate states for various

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.090
l's and j's.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.120
So is there a better way
to rewrite this formula?

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.130
And you say the following--

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.630
suppose you think of
some states of fixed j--

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.620
fixed j states-- j.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.070
For example, this state-- we'll
use our l equals 1 over here--

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.160
I have 1, 2, 3--

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.960
3P 3/2 and 3P 1/2.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.020
Here, I have 3D 5/2
because this is l equals 2.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.850
So 2 plus 1/2 and 2 minus 1/2.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.280
So I have here
states of fixed j--

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.340
two states with the same j.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.610
But they come from
different l's.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.480
Because when you get a
total j of some value,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.195
it can come from a lower l--

00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:39.640
l plus 1/2 gives you that j--

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.850
or it can come from a top l with
l minus 1/2 giving you that j.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:53.230
So a given j value can arise
from an l that is 1/2 higher

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.450
or an l that is 1/2 lower.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:04.300
So for a fixed j, it may be
that l is equal to j minus 1/2,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.250
or l is equal to j plus 1/2.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.260
Now, look at this quantity.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.165
We'll call this whole
quantity f of jl.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:40.660
Very astonishingly, f of jl when
l is j minus 1/2, or f of jl

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.150
where l is j plus 1/2,
you can calculate it.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.250
Put l equals j minus
1/2 on that formula.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:56.185
And then put l equals j
plus 1/2 in that formula.

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:59.870
You would say, it's
going to be a mess.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.460
In fact, both
cases are the same.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:10.410
And it give you minus
2 over a j plus 1/2.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:16.880
So the whole l dependence
here, amazingly, is fake.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.200
There's no l dependence
in this factor.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.950
It is a little strange.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:27.500
There's no l dependence because,
given j, l can be two values.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.470
And for those two values, that
function gives you the same.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.720
It's one of those, like x
squared gives the same for 1

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.804
and minus 1.

00:08:34.804 --> 00:08:40.039
This function, once you
fix j, l can be two values.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.960
And it so happens that these
two values give the same.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.160
So at the end of the day,
this just depends on j.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.000
That's the most important
result of this lecture.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.760
The whole structure,
once you put relativity,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.830
Darwin, and spin orbit,
just depends on j.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.835
And what is the result
when you simplify this?

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:20.620
Our result is that the
fine structure Enljmj--

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:36.460
fine structure 1-- is equal to
minus alpha to the fourth mc

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:45.050
squared 1 over 2n to the fourth
n over j plus 1/2 minus 3/4.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.900
Whole answer, all together--

00:09:53.900 --> 00:10:01.180
Darwin fine spin orbit
and relativistic.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:06.880
So a few comments about this.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.900
People that look at
the Dirac equation

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.210
more seriously would have
expected this result.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.160
It turns out that in the
Dirac equation, the symmetry

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.440
and the rotations--

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.520
the generator of rotations--

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.890
is exactly j, which is l plus s.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.420
That generates rotation.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.640
That commutes with
the Hamiltonian.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.820
So you should expect that
the energy eigenstates

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.590
are j eigenstates.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.240
So here, we're seeing
that, yes, they can

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.150
be simultaneously diagonalized.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:47.000
The eigenstates can also
be labeled by the j value.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.050
So the exact eigenstates
in the Dirac equation

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.060
can be labeled by the
j value, and we're

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.060
seeing a reflection of this.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.950
This means that the j multiplets
are not going to be split,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.770
and there's going to be,
moreover, some degeneracy.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:07.030
They're not split because
there's no mj dependence.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.820
And they are all
going to be the same.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.740
So let me finish by drawing
how the spectrum looks.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.060
It's pretty important
to see that.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.590
This quantity over here,
this numerical quantity,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.590
is always positive--

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.640
positive-- for any state
in the hydrogen atom.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.940
You can see that because j max--

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.250
the maximum value--
so this is negative.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.960
So you need to know what is the
minimum value of this quantity

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.550
to see if it goes negative.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.530
The minimum value of this
ratio is when j is maximum.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:55.580
The maximum j is when j is l
plus 1/2 with the maximum l.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.090
So this is l plus 1 maximum.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:03.260
But l plus 1 maximum
is, in fact, n.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.320
So the minimum
value of this is 1.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.720
So this is always positive.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.090
As n increases, the
corrections become smaller.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.880
So what happens?

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.170
All the corrections
are negative.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:24.630
So if you had the original
states, they all go down a bit.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.750
Even the ground state
goes down a bit.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.110
1S 1/2 is down.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.920
Because for n equal
1, you do get a state.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.300
Then what do you get?

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:45.350
2S 1/2 is here.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.720
It's also down a bit.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:54.270
3S 1/2-- so this is l equals 0.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.035
Then you have l equals 1.

00:12:58.035 --> 00:13:01.130
Remember, what did we have here?

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:11.330
We have 2P 1/2 and 2P 3/2.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.440
Because l equal 1 gives
you j equals 3/2 and 1/2.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.540
Look, these two remain
degenerate because they

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.870
have the same n and the same j.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.890
And that's all that matters.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:31.060
So 1/2 and 1/2 have the same
j, so they remain degenerate.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.970
2P 3/2 has a higher
j, therefore,

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.500
has a smaller number.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.050
So it's lowered less, and
it appears a little higher.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:50.530
So here, you would have
3P 1/2 and here, 3P 3/2.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.765
And the next state here is 3D.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.270
Now you're combining l equal 2.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.840
So you get 5/2 and 3/2.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:15.470
The 3/2 is degenerate with this
3/2 because it has the same j.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.630
And the 5/2 is a little higher--

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.920
3D 5/2.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.780
So this is our final picture.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.470
The hydrogen atom, all the
states get pushed down.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:40.390
The various multiplets with
different l but the same j

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.610
are still degenerate.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.660
This formula has
no l dependence.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.760
So these two are the same.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.050
These two are the same.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.930
These two are the same.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:55.000
Moreover, the j
multiplets are not split.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.700
Every j multiplet differs
[? because of ?] a collection

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.370
of states with different mj.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.780
But mj doesn't appear.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.740
So this is your fine
structure of hydrogen atom.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:11.140
And this is where you study
in detail the Zeeman splitting

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.030
and the Stark splitting.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.860
And we'll talk a
little bit about them

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.710
next time, as we
will begin, also,

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.680
our study of the
semiclassical approximation.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.560
See you then.

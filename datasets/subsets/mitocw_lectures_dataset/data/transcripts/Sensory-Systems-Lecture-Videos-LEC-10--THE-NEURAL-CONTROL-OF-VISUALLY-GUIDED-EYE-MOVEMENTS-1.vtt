00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:26.030
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.980
So today then we are going
to talk about eye movement

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.480
control.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.260
This is a fact-laden
set of topics.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.940
We're going to talk about
the basics of eye movements,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.440
and then we're going to talk
about the various neural

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.100
structures that are involved
in eye movement control.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.560
The interesting thing about
studying eye movement control

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.500
here, which is very closely,
obviously related to vision.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.410
It's also very closely related
to the ocular motor system

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.714
because it involves
moving the eyes.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.030
Now the basic fact is
that we move our eyes

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.670
practically endlessly every day.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.440
We make about three
saccades a second.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.230
And we make more than
150,000 saccades every day.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.460
And it's not something
you ever think about.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.800
Yet every time you
look at something,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.250
you have to decide as to where
you're going to look next.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.550
You're not even aware of it.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.330
It just happens automatically.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.450
It's a remarkable system,
works with incredible rapidity,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.480
and it involves recognizing
objects out there,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.590
recognizing the visual
scenes, making a selection,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.510
moving your eye there,
and you keep doing it,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.630
as I said, three times a second.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.890
So this is, obviously,
the eye movements

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.530
that you make like that, jumping
from one location to another.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.690
And with each of those eye
movements, as I've said,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.930
you need to decide where
are you going to look next.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230
So that's quite an amazing feat.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.330
And it's not just something
that we do as humans,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.710
but it's also done
regularly by animals.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.500
And most of the work
I will tell you about

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.390
has been conducted actually on
monkeys whose eye movements are

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.080
remarkably similar to
those of our eye movements.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.750
Now let's first of
all go over what

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.280
I'm going to cover in
the next two sessions.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.170
First of all, before
I do that, I just

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.150
thought I'll show you an
amusing cartoon from The New

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.320
Yorker, which was made
in 2001 which sort of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.590
puts in a nutshell what
the nature of all this is.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.840
Here's a cat.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.710
He's going to try to jump
up there to get the thing.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.130
And so it has to make a decision
where that thing is in space,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.750
has to make the
calculations, as to how

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.340
to generate the motor
activities to jump up there.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.404
Now when it comes to
the eye movements,

00:03:05.404 --> 00:03:07.070
you don't have to
jump up there, but you

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.740
have to decide how to
jump your eye from one

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.590
location to the next.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.780
So what we are going
to try to understand

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.350
is what are these
calculations that we perform

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.470
to be able to make accurate
eye movements from one location

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.530
to another.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.870
And what neural structures
are involved in this,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.500
and what are the various
rules these neural structures

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.700
are involved in to generate
those eye movements.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.310
Now here are the topics.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.715
First of all,
we're going to look

00:03:37.715 --> 00:03:40.880
at just the basics
of eye movements.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.940
Then we are going to look
at the so-called eye plant

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.060
and the brain stem
nuclei, which are

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.342
involved in moving
your eye muscles.

00:03:50.342 --> 00:03:52.800
Then, we are going to look at
an important structure in eye

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.160
movement generation which is
called the superior colliculus

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.240
that we hadn't talked about yet.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.420
And then we are going to
look at the visual input

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.310
for saccade generation.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.050
We're going to examine
what the various types

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:14.810
of retinal ganglion cells do
to be involved in eye movement

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.460
generation.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.918
In particular, we
are going to look

00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:18.870
at the midget and
the parasol cells.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:26.560
Then perhaps a little bit today,
but most of the next time,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.820
we can look at the
cortical structures

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.870
involved in movement control.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.480
Then we're going to look
at the effects of paired

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.160
electrical and
visual stimulation

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.970
because that would give
us additional insights

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.870
about the nature
of eye movements.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.370
And then we're going
to look at what

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.550
happens when you have various
deficits in motor control

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.320
as a result of having
lesions in various parts

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.565
of the visual and
ocular motor systems.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.570
And then we're going to look
at some pharmacological studies

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.580
to try to understand what the
pharmacology is of eye movement

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.080
control.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.780
And I should only say visually
guided eye movement control.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.500
All right.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.865
So let's first start then with
the basics of eye movements.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.810
We can ask a question,
why do we move our eyes.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.380
Now you already have the
answer to the first reason

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.340
we do that, which is
that in the retina,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.180
we have a highly specialized
system in higher mammals

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.110
and humans where there's
only a very small area

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.890
where you have a very high
density of photoreceptors.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.850
And so to see fine
detail, you need

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.370
to move your eye to
the location to be

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.470
able to analyze it at
a high level acuity.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.800
So that then involves
the directive

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.460
to acquire objects
for central viewing.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.620
Because it's the
central viewing that

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.160
allows you to have high acuity.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.590
Now those are
accomplished predominantly

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.080
by saccadic eye movements,
just like the ones

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.340
I had mimicked at
the very beginning.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.040
You make these very
rapid eye movements

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.510
fro one location to another.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.340
Another important part
of eye movement control

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.070
is that when either your are
in motion, or whatever you're

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.810
looking at, like a
bird flying in the sky,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.215
to be able to analyze it,
you track that object.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.930
You make what is called
smooth pursuit eye movements.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.950
So that is another
important mechanism

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.920
that enables you to analyze
things accurately in the world.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:49.320
Now yet another factor is
that when we move about,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.830
it's important for us
to be able for our eyes

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.640
to be stable with respect
to the world out there.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.910
And one of the
mechanisms involved

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.850
in that, as we shall see, is
the accessory optic system--

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.030
and that's what you're going to
be writing a paper about-- that

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.610
is involved in controlling
the eyes involving

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:17.175
both visual stimuli and
the vestibular system.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.140
So that is what we're
going to talk about.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.990
Actually that part
we're probably

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.660
going to talk about
when we-- in the next

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.420
to last lecture, not next
time, but the time after.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.330
We're going to talk about the
accessory optic system a bit.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:34.890
All right.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.020
So now then, just
to reiterate then,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.940
we're talking about
the vestibular ocular

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.795
reflex and the
accessory optic system.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.670
So now then, people have
classified eye movements

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.250
into some very basic types.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.810
We have so-called conjugate
eye movements when the two

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.450
eyes move in unison, and
then vergence eye movements

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.030
of an object comes close to
you, it goes away from you,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.200
then the two eyes
converge or diverge.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.050
And that still has to
be done to make sure

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.840
that the images you
see in the world

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.660
fall upon corresponding
regions of the two eyes.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:20.020
Now the conjugate eye movements
fall into two basic categories.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.870
They're called
saccadic eye movements,

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.070
the ones we have talked
about already a bit,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.620
and smooth pursuit
eye movements that

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.450
causes us to be
able to track object

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.900
so that we can keep that
object on the fovea.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.250
Now vergence eye
movement-- you go back

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:46.990
to that picture I'd shown
you before in which you have

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.480
the horopter or the Vieth-Muller
circle, if you remember.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.710
If any object is along
the Vieth-Muller circle,

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.000
like going from 1 to 2, say an
object jumps from here to here,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.140
then when the eyes
track it, they

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.630
follow in corresponding
points into two retinae.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.970
However, if there is an object
that falls outside or inside

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:16.070
the Vieth-Muller circle, as
shown here, then the object,

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.460
the second object follows
an non-corresponding point.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.930
And so therefore you have to
bring about eye movements that

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.120
involved vergence-- either
divergence or convergence.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.230
For the most part, we
get, today especially

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.020
and the next time
as well, we're going

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.280
to be talking about
saccadic eye movements.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.910
And then as I said, after
we have covered movement,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.310
we're going to look
at the movements that

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.780
involve pursuit and vergence.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:59.090
Let's now take a look
at a human subject

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.879
and see the eye movements
the subject makes.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:04.420
I mean, you're
perfectly aware of it,

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.960
but I thought it would be
fun for you to look at it.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.765
So here's a subject, and he's
looking at something, right?

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.590
And all these eye
movements obvious there's

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.370
nothing moving out
there, so these are all

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.750
saccadic eye movements.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.625
The head is fixed.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.827
And so now once
you've seen this,

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:30.285
there are a number of questions
that comes into one's mind.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.170
The first one, on the
not too scientific end,

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.490
is well was that
a male or female.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.620
Or secondly, what was
a person looking at?

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.580
And then thirdly, way down
the list you say, but how does

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.705
the brain do this.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.230
So let's see if you can
answer these three questions.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.115
The third one will
take the two lectures.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.395
But the first and second one
can be answers fairly quickly.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.545
Was it a male or female?

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.380
Anybody want commit themselves?

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.250
AUDIENCE: Male, male, male.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.525
PROFESSOR: Male, male, male.

00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:08.775
Anybody think it was a female?

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.820
You guys are good.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.900
It was a male.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.091
Very good.

00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:13.590
All right.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.560
Now the second
thing, of course, is

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.780
what on earth was this
person looking at.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:25.140
Now there's no way you could
glean that until I tell you.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.980
So let me tell you what
this person is looking at.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.080
And what this person
looking at is up

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.500
picture which is created
by Rene Magritte.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.260
And actually resides in at
the National Gallery of Art

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.305
in Washington DC.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.570
That's quite an
interesting painting,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.420
and that's what I'm
showing it to you.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.420
And it relates closely
to perception--

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.210
the curious aspects of it.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.570
And you can see this doesn't
make sense quite right.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.100
But it's because
of that, because

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.770
of the puzzling nature
of this picture that it

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.780
is in the fabulous museum.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.390
Because it is so unusual
and different that it makes

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.460
you think.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.930
So anyway, what happens then
suppose you started here

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.597
when picture came
on, then you're

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:13.180
going to have to
make a decision where

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.630
you're going to look next.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.660
So what would you look at next?

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.856
Most, commonly, would look
at the eyes Of the rider.

00:12:20.856 --> 00:12:22.730
Then you would look at
the eyes of the horse.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.340
And so I look at various
outstanding features.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.380
Now the way this looks, more or
less-- looks like in real time,

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.340
looks like this.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.880
So that's what this
person was looking at.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.109
And that makes you
aware of the fact

00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:50.650
that whenever you look at the
pictures, you look at anything,

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.150
you make all these eye movements
in this very short time for you

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.680
to comprehend the scene and to
understand it in some detail.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:09.710
When this kind of eye
movement series is made,

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.540
you wonder is this something
that animals also do.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.700
And the answer is yes.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.720
Monkeys certainly do.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.150
Most mammals do, and even
birds do this kind of stuff.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.290
So what I want to
show you next is,

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.370
first of all, what the
pattern of eye movements

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.470
is in humans and the
initial person who

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.520
did beautiful work on
this who's name is Yarbus.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.340
Now this is a famous sculpture.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.560
This sculpture the
so-called Bust of Nefertiti.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.090
And what Yarbus did is he looked
at the kinds of eye movements

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.420
a person makes when
they look at this figure

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.142
to be to comprehend it.

00:13:49.142 --> 00:13:50.600
And you can see
what is interesting

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.620
about this is there is a lot
of saccades along the edges,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.440
and there's a lot of detail,
and not too many saccades

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.260
made to regions where
there's smooth areas.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.540
So what Yarbus did, he
actually published a book

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.350
on this analyzing the
nature of our eye movements

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.140
just looking at its
behavior like this.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.290
Now if you do the same
thing with monkeys,

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.090
they are going to show you that
monkey, a bunch of monkeys,

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.180
they also move their
eyes just like we do.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.400
They also have foveas, of
course, as we discussed.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.730
And so as they move around
and look around in the world,

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.410
they make even more eye
movements than we do.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.660
They're a little bit
more quick about it,

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.720
and so they make many,
many eye movements

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.445
and make about maybe almost
four saccades a second.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.940
Now to see whether they
also actually select objects

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.550
in a sensible way,
what you can do

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.350
is you can present
a bunch of displays.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:54.000
Here is a bunch of round
ones-- in round locations,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.830
I should say--
different objects.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.530
And here we have a
bunch of them arranged

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.350
in a rectangular fashion.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.790
Then on the right, with the
[INAUDIBLE] fixed again,

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.010
you see the kinds of eye
movements the monkey makes.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.140
And what you can readily do,
even if you didn't see these

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.350
here, you can tell
that there must

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.930
be a whole bunch of
objects at these locations,

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.570
including one in the
center, and here,

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.100
that the objects must be-- are
aligned the way they are there.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.900
So clearly the monkeys
do the same thing we do.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:29.970
They tend to look at particular
objects in the scene,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.440
and make accurate
saccades to them

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.000
to be able to analyze them.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:42.470
So because of that, it is
natural to take monkeys

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.810
and to study their eye
movements and to study

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.570
the underlying neural mechanisms
in these animals, which

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.510
would then make us more
capable of understanding

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.960
just how the brain
moves your eyes about.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:10.480
So now, let us becoming more
concerned with the neural

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.200
mechanisms and the machinery
involved in eye movement

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.310
generation.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.650
And so we are going to
refer to this as eye plant

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.060
and the brain stem
nuclei, which are

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:27.300
in the mid and lower portions
of the brain, not in the cortex.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.460
We'll talk about the
cortical factors later on.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.335
So let's start first of
all, with the muscles.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.730
Each eye have six
extraocular muscles,

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.405
as they are delineated here.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.550
They're called the superior
and inferior recti,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.400
the medial and lateral
recti, and the obliques,

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.640
the superior and
inferior oblique muscles.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.000
Now the remarkable feature
about these muscles

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.610
that renders them
different from the muscles

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.700
that you have in the
rest of your body

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.920
is that the fibers
of each muscle

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.680
run the entire length
of the muscle itself.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.980
It's not segmented.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.730
Most muscles in the
body are segmented.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.849
Because of that, they're
often difficult to understand

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:18.599
the nature of the operation.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:23.010
But here we have a situation
that since all the fibers

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.849
on the entire length,
it is a relatively easy

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:31.090
to comprehend the basic
mechanisms that generate

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.566
the eye movements
at this low level.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.860
The next thing that's
important to know

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:47.180
is that the eye is a
balanced structure.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.775
It doesn't have any
weights anywhere.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.460
And so when you
move the eyes, it's

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.980
not like when you have
to pick up an object.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.840
If you were to pick
up a heavy object

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.920
and you thought it
was a feather then

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.280
you would practically
hit yourself in the face.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.220
But if you know what the object
is, you can correct for the way

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.180
you're going to
lift it, which adds

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.910
another huge dimension on
how you move your body about,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.240
and how you operate
your muscles.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.670
Luckily when it comes to the
eyes, that is not a factor.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.320
And because of that,
it's easier to understand

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.395
the way it operates.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.430
So now that you have this,
the next question one can ask

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.320
is how are these
muscles innervated.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.690
I mean obviously, you have
to have some nerves that

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.310
connect to it that's cause
the muscles to contract

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.360
or to let go.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.590
The way that works is
that the nerves that

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.700
connect to the muscles
of the eye release

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.570
acetylcholine that causes
the muscle to contract.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.060
OK so that's a basic-- that
happens everywhere in the body.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.140
So that's very basic.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.360
You already know all that.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.040
But what you probably
don't know yet

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.660
is what are the nuerons--
where do they come from,

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:18.410
in other words, to
innervate these muscles.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:23.140
Well it turns out that there
are three cranial nerves--

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.900
how many cranial nerves
are there in the brain?

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.760
AUDIENCE: 12.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.357
12?

00:19:27.357 --> 00:19:27.940
PROFESSOR: 12.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.755
3 of those, believe
it or not, are

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.880
involved in the control
of eye movement.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.710
And so we can designate that.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.380
We can tell you that
the lateral rectus

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.795
is innervated by
the abducens nerve.

00:19:44.795 --> 00:19:46.920
The abducens nerve comes
from the abducens nucleus.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.150
The superior oblique
muscle is innervated

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.980
by trochlear nerve, which
is the fourth cranial nerve.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.990
And the rest of
them are innervated

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:21.050
by sub-nuclei of the
third nerve, which

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.040
is called the oculomotor nerve.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.400
So we have these three
oculomotor is a third,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.520
trochlear is the fourth,
and abducens is the sixth.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.980
So it's these three
nuclei which-- note again

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.370
that the oculomotor
has sub-nuclei--

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.845
that innervate these muscles.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:50.110
So now that we know
that, the next question

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:58.480
is how do these neurons
from these three nuclei

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.220
act to do this.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.450
But before I tell
you that, I want

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:09.620
to make sure that you learn
what the 12 cranial nuclei are.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.540
What you can do
here-- and I'm using

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.310
a so-called clean
mnemonic device.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.950
On old Olympus towering
tops a fat armed girl vends

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.710
snowy hops.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.630
That's easy enough to remember.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.990
The first letter
of each designates

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.985
each of the 12 cranial nerves.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.560
So if we then look at
that, here they are.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.550
The first one is the olfactory
one, the second is the optic.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.630
Then we have the
ones in blue here,

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.287
which innervate
the eye muscles--

00:21:45.287 --> 00:21:46.620
oculomotor, trochlear, abducens.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.200
And then one important
ones that you're

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.470
going to hear a lot about
is the auditory one--

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.420
that's number eight.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.390
So those are 12 cranial nerves.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.850
And then, you don't
have to remember this,

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.650
it might help to
know that, of course,

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.560
you have a whole bunch
of spinal nerves as well.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.655
You have 31 of them.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:16.284
And those 31, of course,
each doubles-- one

00:22:16.284 --> 00:22:17.950
on the left side, one
on the right side.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.904
You have 8 cervical, 12
thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral,

00:22:23.904 --> 00:22:24.570
and 1 coccygeal.

00:22:26.435 --> 00:22:29.250
Now you don't-- as I say, you
don't have to remember this.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.460
And I'm not even tell you
have to remember these.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.900
But it's good to know that.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.360
It's something that you
can commit to memory,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.980
so that when you go to a
party and talk to somebody,

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.810
you can say, hey, you know
about the 12 cranial nerves.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.420
And they go, [YAWNS],
see you later.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:49.650
All right.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.910
So anyway, we can
move on now and see

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:59.615
how these neurons that
innervate the muscles, that

00:22:59.615 --> 00:23:04.450
are so often referred to as
a final common path-- how

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.070
they operate.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.250
Actually that underwent
quite a bit of debate

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.590
for a long, long time.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.540
We're not going to go
into the debate itself,

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.373
but I'm just going to
tell you how it works.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.030
But the fact is
that these neurons

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:24.070
are involved in generating
all sorts of eye-- all the eye

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.000
movements we talk about,
meaning smooth pursuit,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.830
meaning maintained eye
position, and saccade.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.470
And so here's an example.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.757
This show vertical
eye movements, just

00:23:34.757 --> 00:23:35.715
vertical eye movements.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:42.090
And what you can see here
is that the more they eye

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.570
looks down, like here, the
more sustained activity

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.230
to keep the muscle contracted,
to keep the eye down.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.500
Now but you also have to
remember that while this

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.440
is happening here,
the opposite muscle

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.750
on top, the superior
rectus, has to let go.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.660
So there would be no
activity to contract

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.320
the muscle in the superior
rectus-- no muscle

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.620
fibers in the superior rectus.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.340
Secondly, the important
thing to notice here

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.350
is that whenever
there's a saccade--

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.170
saccade, saccade,
saccade, saccade,

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.670
and so on, when there's
a little saccade,

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.250
there's a high frequency burst.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.510
And the high frequency is short.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.320
When you have a big
saccade, there's

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.810
a much longer high
frequency burst.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.070
And when there's a saccade
in the opposite direction,

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.072
there is a pause.

00:24:30.072 --> 00:24:32.155
So what do you think happens
when there's a pause?

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:38.250
In that case, the superior
rectus would get a burst

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.550
and would contract rapidly to
get an upward eye movement.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:46.140
So this muscle will cause
your downward eye movement,

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.030
and the superior rectus records
an upward movement, of course.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.480
So that is the basic layout.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.900
Now this is schematic, but to
show you that this is real,

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:02.320
I'm going to show you some
data here of a monkey doing

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:08.600
the actual eye movements,
recording from the ocular motor

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.530
nucleus.

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.680
And in this case again,
invading the inferior rectus.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.410
And what you can see here
are a bunch of saccades.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:20.620
And here the monkey is tracking
an apple as it moved down.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.360
And what you can
see-- let's look first

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.130
at this at the bottom.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.672
What you can see here is
that somewhere along the line

00:25:26.672 --> 00:25:28.130
here is what the
monkey's tracking.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.430
This particular neuron
begins to cut in,

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.750
and then gradually
it increases the rate

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.934
of its activity as
a result of which,

00:25:34.934 --> 00:25:36.475
you get smooth
pursuit eye movements.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.450
Now if you look
at the upper part,

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.770
once again as I've shown you,
the frequency of activity

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.260
is proportional to the angular
deviation of the eye, this case

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.410
because you're talking
about the inferior rectus,

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.010
in the vertical dimension.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:55.470
And whenever there's
a saccade downward,

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.520
there's a high frequency burst.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.335
And whenever there's a saccade
upward, there's a pause.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.820
So that is the basic
nature of this.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.890
And what is so lovely about
this, is it's like a machine.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.300
This is so lovely
that if you then

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.240
collect data from several cells,
and here's an example of it,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.310
and you look at the number
of spikes per second

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.700
and the angular
deviation of the eye,

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:26.980
it shows you that each
of these four neurons

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.020
acts in a linear fashion.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.540
As the eye deviates
more and more,

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.140
the frequency, the activity,
gradually increases.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.610
This is not saccades, obviously.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:41.170
This is maintained activity--
let me go back again--

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:45.460
like here, like here,
like here, and like here.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.320
So you get this beautiful linear
function, which again as I've

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.960
said, makes it relatively easy
to understand quantitatively

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.405
the process of moving the eyes.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.960
So that is the basic
mechanism that you

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:09.750
see in the oculomotor nuclei.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.750
And the important thing
to understand then

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.920
is that the activity
of these neurons

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.230
is involved both in
the making saccades

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:24.516
and in maintaining
various eye positions.

00:27:24.516 --> 00:27:29.290
The reason I emphasize
this is because maybe

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.990
about 30 years ago,
there was a big debate.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.060
Some people argued,
and they initially

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.660
began to record from
these oculomotor nuclei

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:46.040
that we have two
different sets of neurons

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.420
in the final common path, one
of which controls saccades,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.400
and one of which controls
maintained position,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.820
or smooth pursuit.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.390
But that's not the case.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.105
The case is that
these neurons do both.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.880
Now why did this
confusion arise?

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.840
Well, it arose
because it was found

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.080
that if you looked at the
so-called supranuclear

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.740
complex, which are neurons which
are sort of above, if you will,

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.040
the oculomotor, trochlear,
and abducens nuclei,

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.124
there are a whole bunch
of subnuclei there--

00:28:23.124 --> 00:28:25.040
we're not going to go
into details about them.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.890
You don't have to know that.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:30.740
But at any rate, in
those nuclei there

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.920
are neurons that are
indeed separately coding

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.360
different attributes.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.410
I'm going to show
this, but before I

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.350
do I want to make one
more important point.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:45.360
If you take a microelectrode,
and you put it

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.660
in one of these nuclei that
controls a final common path,

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.590
if you stimulate there at a
high frequency, in this case

00:28:54.590 --> 00:29:00.680
500 Hertz, if you increase the
duration of the stimulation,

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.860
you get progressively
bigger saccades,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.993
Which proves, with
stimulation that it's indeed

00:29:07.993 --> 00:29:12.560
the duration of the high
frequency burst that defines

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.025
the size of the saccade
that you elicit.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.500
So now we can move on.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.890
And in this case as I say,
you don't have to know this,

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.290
but I want to just
mention it briefly.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.680
We have a [INAUDIBLE]
the eye-- the eye muscle.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.980
And then we have, in addition
to the final common path,

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.620
we have a supranuclear complex,
which have various neuron, some

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.449
which pause, in other words,
that don't cause saccades,

00:29:39.449 --> 00:29:40.990
and some which fire
only to saccades.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.590
I think that's the only
ones I need to point out.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.350
But at that level,
they're separate.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:51.170
But once they come together
in the oculomotor complex,

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.440
then they impinge
on these neurons

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.400
of the final common path that
carry both of these signals.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.550
So that then is the essence
of the oculomotor complex

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.090
that I want to cover.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.770
And so we can a quick,
summary diagram here.

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.410
We're going to make
a diagram that's

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:16.070
going to grow over in this
session and the next one,

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.510
and that's going to be
very complex in the end,

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.590
unfortunately.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:24.340
But here we have the brain
stem oculomotor complex.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.790
And the way to put
this-- because you

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.680
talk about what kinds of coding
operations are involved-- this

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.760
carries what you're going
to call a rate code.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.750
The higher the rate, the
greater the angular deviation

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:37.680
of the eye.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.450
And of course, the longer
the high frequency burst,

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:41.840
the bigger the saccade.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.570
So that is the
so-called rate code.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.830
So this is the
basic layout then.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.340
And of course, if there's
a lot of activity here,

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.780
this muscle is
going to contract,

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.624
the eye is going to
deviate downward.

00:30:53.624 --> 00:30:55.540
At the same time, you're
going to get a signal

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.980
to the upper part
that's going to let go.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.990
In other words,
the signal is going

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:02.510
to be terminated
so that you have

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:07.730
no activity in the upper part,
so that that muscle can expand.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.830
So that's basically
it at this point.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.060
And as I say, this will grow,
and grow, and grow, and grow,

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.310
until by the end
of next time, it's

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.610
going to be really complicated.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.487
But that's how the brain works.

00:31:18.487 --> 00:31:19.195
It's complicated.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.910
So with that then,
we are next going

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.595
to move to the so-called
superior colliculus.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.140
Now the first thing I want
to say about this structure

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.410
is that this region of
the brain-- I'll show you

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.130
a picture of it
in just a minute--

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.416
is one that has undergone
tremendous changes

00:31:42.416 --> 00:31:43.540
in the course of evolution.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:49.940
In more primitive
animals, like in fish

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:55.120
and in amphibia,
what you find is

00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:02.040
that this structure is the prime
structure for analyzing vision.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.230
So it does vision
and then generates

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.000
commands of various
sorts, including

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.199
commands to make eye
movements, or generate

00:32:10.199 --> 00:32:12.115
other kinds of movements
in different animals.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.510
And this is the case
because in these animals,

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.660
there is very little cortex.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.880
But with the process
of encephalization

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.440
more and more of the
analytical undertakings

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.200
the brain was involved in had
been relegated to the cortex.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.260
And that also meant
that more and more

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.700
of the way we analyze
vision became more central,

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.980
as we have discussed already,
with cortical mechanisms.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.890
Now to make this
clear, let me show

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:54.640
you three drawings of a
so-called toad, a rabbit,

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.990
and a monkey.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.672
And what you see
here, the toad--

00:32:57.672 --> 00:32:59.005
here is the superior colliculus.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.950
This structure is
quite large relative

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.500
to the rest of the brain.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.690
Then when you come
to the rabbit,

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.910
there's some degree
of encephalization.

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:09.650
So this structure
is much smaller

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.200
relative to the
rest of the brain.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.630
And then when it
comes to the monkey,

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.090
it looks like the superior
colliculus is actually

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.640
quite tiny.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.640
And in monkeys and humans,
the superior colliculus

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.010
is very small.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:27.500
It's maybe about five or
six millimeters in diameter.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.870
And yet, it's an extremely
important structure

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.950
and we're going to examine
just what the structure does.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.300
And later on, we're
going to examine

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.135
what happens if you
lose that structure.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:45.170
So now here is a sagittal
midline section of the monkey.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.780
So you can see this real.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.930
And here we have
the lunate again.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.860
This is what part
of the brain here?

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.574
This is a cephalic area.

00:33:53.574 --> 00:33:54.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:55.323
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:33:55.323 --> 00:33:57.570
This is area V1 here.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:02.090
Then if you look down here,
you see this little bubble

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:03.410
looking thing here?

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:04.825
That's the superior colliculus.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.150
So that is a
structure that we are

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.260
going to look at in some detail.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.560
Now if one enlarges this--
this in a cat actually--

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.560
and one takes a
coronal cross section

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.520
of the superior
colliculus, they can

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.760
see it's a fairly
complicated structure.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.679
It has several layers.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.009
People have distinguished
at least seven clear layers.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:31.590
And you can see
the upper part here

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.025
is often referred to
as superficial gray.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.550
There are two layers of that.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:41.730
The very top layer gets an
input directly from the retina.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:45.007
The one little
further down, I'll

00:34:45.007 --> 00:34:46.340
elaborate on that in the minute.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.050
It gets input from
the visual cortex.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.560
And then we have a whole
bunch of other layers

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.199
that we are going to examine in
some detail in just a minute.

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:58.040
So that's the nature
of the structure--

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.960
the superior colliculus.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.060
And the fact is that in more
primitive animals, actually,

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.470
it is a structure
with many more layers.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.230
Some of these more
primitive animals

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.020
have as many as 14
layers in this structure

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.800
because it is heavily involved
in eye movement control,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.805
as well as in the
analysis of vision.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.450
Now the interesting
fact about the way

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:27.910
this is laid out in the
cat, and in higher animals,

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:32.840
and in humans, that most of
the cells in the various layers

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.570
reside in those layers.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.510
They don't talk to
each other that much.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.920
But they get a lot of input
from many other structures

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.070
that control those layers.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.420
And I'll go into that in
some detail in a minute.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:50.960
Now the next important fact
about the superior colliculus,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.650
which makes it similar to
lateral geniculate nucleus

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:58.270
in the cortex, is that the
visual field is laid out

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:02.140
in a topographic manner in
the superior colliculus.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.990
This is a top view
of the colliculus.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:06.510
This is the visual field.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.800
And once again, the
rule, if you remember,

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.980
is that the contralateral
half of the visual field

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.175
is it projects to the
superior colliculus.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.840
And of course, the opposite then
is the case for the other side.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.720
And then if you look at the
nature of the connections,

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.200
you find that everything
that's close to the fovea,

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.830
the foveal representation,
projects to the anterior

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.070
level of the
superior colliculus.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.680
So this is sort of
the foveal region.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:44.420
Then the upper
visual field projects

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.220
to the medial portion
of the colliculus.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.860
The horizontal
meridian area projects

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.350
to the horizontal meridian of
the colliculus in the back.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.380
And the lower part
of the visual field

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.160
projects to the lateral
portion of the colliculus.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.930
Now why do I emphasize this?

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:07.230
You will see in just a
minute why that is important.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.110
It's very important
for us understand

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.000
that there's a lovely
topographic layout

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.470
of the visual field on to
the superior colliculus.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.020
So now we are going
to move on and examine

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.880
the question of what is
the nature of the responses

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.555
of neurons in the
superior colliculus.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:33.570
Now I can tell you right off
that in the monkey colliculus,

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:36.480
in the cat
colliculus, the nature

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.490
of the responses
of these neurons

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.840
is not particularly interesting.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.140
They're small receptive
fields, and they

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.980
tend to respond
both to the onset

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.520
and the termination
of a visual stimulus,

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.425
meaning that they seem to get
an input from both on and off.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:58.150
And then if you make the a
stimulus progressively larger.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.180
You get an increase
in responses,

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:05.870
but then once you make it quite
large, in this case 10 degrees

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.150
and 20 degrees, the
response greatly

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.970
declines, which says that
just like in the retina,

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.776
these neurons have
centers around antagonism.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.120
And they respond
vigorously to small spots

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.400
and very little to large spots.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.190
Now that's a basic layout.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.730
But then if you
ask the question,

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.220
well, are these cells in
the colliculus orientation

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.780
and direction specific?

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.210
Are these cells color selective?

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.360
For the most part,
that answer is

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.400
no, not entirely, but
mostly no, meaning

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.610
that these cells are not
that really interesting.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.840
They are very, very, very basic.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.660
So that is the nature
of the responses

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.620
of these neurons in
the superior colliculus

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.120
in the superficial layers.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.690
I've told you that the
superficial gray, which

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:58.340
consists of two layers,
the one that that's

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.110
a direct input from the
retina, and the other that

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:05.520
gets an input from
the cortex, gives you

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.563
vigorous visual responses.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.270
But now, when you
get into the deeper

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.640
layers of the colliculus, you
find something very exciting

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.440
an extremely interesting.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.540
And that is sort
of diagrammed here.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.290
What you have is a
bunch of eye movements.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.780
And then look at this cell.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.660
This cell responds-- it's the
same cell throughout-- responds

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.270
vigorously to a small saccade.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.280
And this responds well
before the saccade is made.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.150
That's what happens here.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:40.970
But then if the monkey
makes bigger saccades,

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:44.189
and some even in the same
direction, like these here,

00:39:44.189 --> 00:39:45.230
you don't get a response.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.320
So what does that mean?

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.110
That's curious.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:59.899
So what that means is that
these cells, some have something

00:39:59.899 --> 00:40:00.940
to do with eye movements.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.172
This fires vigorously, and
then eye movement ensues--

00:40:05.172 --> 00:40:06.880
fires vigorously and
eye movement ensues.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.310
Now there's an eye movement
that ensues here as well,

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:11.870
but there's no saccade.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.670
So how do we explain this?

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.670
Well, what you're do in
these kinds of experiments

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:26.210
then is that you collect
extensive data to see when

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:30.110
a cell like this fires,
and when it doesn't fire.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:34.550
And you can generate a
response curve, if you will,

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:37.910
or a response diagram
to see when it fires

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.400
and when it doesn't fire.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.040
So now to look at that,
here's an example of that.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.640
In this case, all
the white spots

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.950
are saccadic eye
movements generated

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:56.770
from a central point that were
not preceded by eye move--

00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:02.480
saccadic-- by neural responses.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.810
And the red ones
show the times when

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:11.520
the neurons you're recording
from, the single cell,

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.595
responded vigorously.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.660
So that meant that
whatever mark you

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.320
made a saccade in
this direction,

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.370
there was vigorous
activity in this neuron,

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:24.570
meaning the neuron had an
important role in generating

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:32.990
an eye movement, whereas all
the other saccades did not

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.840
generate a responds in
this particular neuron.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.900
But to make this clear, there
are many different neurons

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.990
in many different parts
of the colliculus.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.920
And so when you generated
other eye movements,

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.975
other neurons fired.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.140
So how can we analyze
this in more detail?

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.590
Well, the way we can-- let me
just add one more point here.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.450
This green circle
here is what we're

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:05.600
going to call the motor field
of this particular neuron.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.260
So that's a new concept
for you-- motor field.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.740
These neurons in the
intermediate and deep layers

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.670
of the colliculus
have motor field

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.530
that define the
size of the saccade.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.810
Now let me say one more
thing in anticipation--

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:25.890
that if you then study where the
cells' visual receptive field

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:30.690
is, it's right there relative
to the central fixation point.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:34.670
So it means that
this particular cell

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:39.820
fires when a saccade is
made into the receptive

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.360
field of that neuron.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:48.700
So how can we verify this
interesting, clever arrangement

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:53.450
in the superior colliculus?

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:58.390
Well, the way we can do this
is to instead of recording,

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.510
or actually I shouldn't
say instead, really.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.990
But we can do two things.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.900
We can record and
see what happens

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.600
in different parts
of the colliculus.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.690
Or we can electrically
stimulate there.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.930
Well, so here is a schematic.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:21.160
Here is a colliculus-- this is
anterior, this is posterior.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.680
So this, obviously,
if you remember,

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.804
this is close to the fovea.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.950
And here is medial
and here is lateral.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.240
And what we can do
then, we can see

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.475
where the receptive fields
are of these neurons.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.360
And we can plot them out.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.120
Here are the receptive fields.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.360
Here is number 1,
close to the fovea,

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.810
number 2 is medial is
up, and lateral is down.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.917
Now that one has done
this, you can switch over

00:43:53.917 --> 00:43:55.375
and you can
electrically stimulate.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.200
And look what happens.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.150
If you electrically
stimulate at 1,

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:04.090
you get a saccade that moves
the eye into the receptive

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:08.280
field of that neuron-- that
set of neurons, I should say.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.980
Then if you stimulate in 2, you
get saccades that move it to 2.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:16.010
And when you simulate in
3, it moves to location 3.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:25.360
Now what more do we need to
verify given this situation?

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:29.730
How can one believe this
hypothesis, if you will,

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:30.500
at this stage?

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.200
What did I tell you about
when you electrically

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:40.680
stimulate the neurons in
the final common paths,

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.270
back in abducens, in
the oculomotor nucleus,

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.650
for example?

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.000
What did I tell you?

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.620
That this duration
of the simulation

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.800
define the size of the
saccade elicited, right?

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:01.960
Now if that's the case,
if that's were the case,

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.550
then this would not mean
a damn thing, would it?

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.470
Because you could take that same
location and stimulated longer,

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.630
and you would get
a bigger saccade.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:11.620
So what you need to do?

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:15.850
You need to systematically
vary the duration

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:18.750
of the high frequency
burst in the colliculus

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:23.290
to compare it with what
happens when you stimulate

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:26.480
in the abducens or
oculomotor nuclei.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.350
OK so let's look at that.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:30.790
Here is a picture
I've shown you before.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:37.370
As we increase the duration
of the high frequency burst,

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.950
you get progressively
biggest saccades.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.550
So now we do the same
thing in the colliculus.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:45.200
And lo and behold, you get
something totally different

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.750
because you have a
totally different code

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.120
in the colliculus.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.750
What you get here
is that you get

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.947
after you exceed a very
short time-- just 10

00:45:55.947 --> 00:45:57.780
milliseconds-- when you
don't get a saccade.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:03.470
From 25 to about 120
milliseconds, you get saccades,

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:06.550
but they're all
the same size, so

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:10.180
meaning it's where you stimulate
in the colliculus, not how

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.440
long you stimulate.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.800
And then to prove
this even further,

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.940
when you make the stimulation
much longer than that, you get

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.520
a staircase of saccades,
each reaches the same size.

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.630
Now yet another proof here
is that if you stimulate

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:27.607
an anterior tip
of the colliculus,

00:46:27.607 --> 00:46:29.440
remember where the
receptive fields are very

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.930
close to the foveola, then
they get a hold array of,

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:38.124
I think there's something like
14 saccadic eye movements--

00:46:38.124 --> 00:46:40.540
bang, bang, bang bang, bang,
bang-- because the simulation

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.130
goes on for a long time.

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:45.870
So each little saccade
is the same size,

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.310
you just get a
staircase of them.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:54.820
So that proves that the coding
operation in the colliculus

00:46:54.820 --> 00:47:04.300
is one that defines the
location of a receptive field,

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.170
and when you stimulate
it, it generates a saccade

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.375
that moves the eye into
that receptive field.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:15.350
So that then in a
nutshell tells you

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:21.060
what the basic principle
is off the functioning

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.670
of the colliculus when
it comes to eye movement.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.580
Namely it says, a
saccade is generated

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.410
by computing the
size and direction

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:31.950
of the saccadic
vector needed to null

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:35.445
the retinal error between
the present and intended eye

00:47:35.445 --> 00:47:35.945
positions.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:41.750
That's just putting it in a
slightly different way, saying

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:45.070
that, OK, I decide I'm going to
make a saccade to here-- bang,

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.027
like that.

00:47:46.027 --> 00:47:46.860
Just a saccade line.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:55.730
And but you did that you
had an intended location.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:48:00.080
And by making an eye
movement, you know the error.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.160
Now the colliculus is
really quite accurate.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.850
You can make saccades
with very small error.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:15.420
Usually the error is
roughly, at most around 10%,

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.420
meaning that when you
make very small saccades,

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.040
is almost negligible.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.860
When you make a large saccade,
then maybe there is an error.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.680
And when that happens,
sometimes what you have to do

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.180
is to make what is called
the corrective saccade.

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:33.690
So suppose you're looking here
and an object appears here.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.940
And so you say, I
intend to go here,

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.580
and the colliculus fires in
that region of the colliculus

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:42.990
to generate an eye movement.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:45.350
And say the eye
movement goes to here.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.820
Then what you have to do is
to make a second saccade,

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.955
like that, to correct
for that little error.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:56.010
So sometimes when you
make large eye movements,

00:48:56.010 --> 00:49:01.300
indeed, you make a secondary
saccade for the correction

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:06.065
because your accuracy is
roughly around 90% correct.

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:13.420
Does everybody so far
follow the basic principle?

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.430
It's very important to
understand the basic principle

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:18.520
of the operational
characteristics

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.645
of the superior colliculus.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.650
So again to repeat, a
saccade is generated

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:27.270
by computing the
size and direction

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:29.700
of the saccadic
vector needed to know

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.950
the retinal error between
the present and intended eye

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:34.100
position.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.970
And what you have
in the colliculus

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:38.170
is a cell that is
being activated

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:42.260
because a target falls into it.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:47.150
And that activation
then generates a signal

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.870
to the lower parts
of the colliculus--

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.620
we'll talk about that, how that
is done-- which then results

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:56.060
in a saccadic eye movement
that nulls that error signal.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:02.320
Very clever, very
basic, very beautiful--

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.880
and almost computer-like
at this level.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:16.200
So what we can do now, we are
adding the superior colliculus,

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.455
the very basics of it
so far, to this diagram.

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.820
And that says that
the colliculus then

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.765
sends a signal to
the brain stem.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.610
Some of it initially to
the supranuclear complex,

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:33.100
and then from there
it sends a signal

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:41.210
to the abducens, or
oculomotor, or trochlear nuclei

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:43.585
to generate the
appropriate eye movements.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.680
So that then is
the very basics of

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.850
the operational characteristics
of the superior colliculus.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.890
Now what we're
going to do next is

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:02.780
we are going to examine what
the nature of the visual input

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:08.780
is, predominantly the
superior colliculus--

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:15.895
not entirely, but heavily--
to generate a saccadic eye

00:51:15.895 --> 00:51:16.395
movement.

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:23.620
So if you remember, I told
you that in the retina,

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.080
we make a major distinction
between two classes

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.190
of retinal ganglion cells--
the midget and the parasol.

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.460
The midget project to
the parvocellular layers

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.980
of the colliculus.

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:42.210
And the parasol cells project
to the magnocellular layers.

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:47.525
However, it's also been
found that-- I mentioned

00:51:47.525 --> 00:51:51.030
that only briefly,
that in the retina

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:53.640
there is yet another
class of cells

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.340
it is called-- some
people have called

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.370
it the W cells in the cat.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:01.760
Other people have called it
the corneal cellular cells that

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:08.330
reside in the relatively
small numbers compared

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:16.450
to the other two throughout the
retina, and project, in part,

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:22.320
to interlaminar layers of the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.050
But it's been found that
they also project heavily

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:29.500
to the superior colliculus.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.130
Now how do we know this?

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:33.880
Well let me tell
you, it's important

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.770
always is to understand the
experimental procedures.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.510
So let me skip that here.

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.850
Just to remind you again
are the connections.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:45.375
This I've shown you
several times before.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.780
So it says here the
interlaminar layers project

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:54.230
to the upper portions
of the visual cortex.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:56.390
But I didn't tell
you before that

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:58.660
these corneal
cellular cells also

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.295
project to the
superior colliculus.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.880
So here's the
superior colliculus.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.020
And here, initially, we
can ask the question,

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.050
what projects look
to the colliculus.

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.940
So how do we find out?

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:16.280
Suppose you are in a laboratory
where the big question is what

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.270
kinds of cells project
from the retina

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:20.810
to the superior colliculus.

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:22.760
Think about this for a minute.

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.510
What kind of experiment
would you do?

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:25.468
How would you find out?

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:32.100
Well, that's quite an
interesting question.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:36.940
And so to understand
that, I'm going

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.790
to tell you about a
couple of techniques.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.620
One technique would be
that you could inject--

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.280
anatomical technique--
you would inject

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:49.560
a substance in the colliculus
that would be then retrogradely

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.107
transported to the retina, and
would light up the cells there.

00:53:53.107 --> 00:53:54.315
That's would be one approach.

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:58.630
Another approach is
that you could actually

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:02.870
record from the retina
itself with microelectrodes.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.940
And you could electrically
stimulate the colliculus.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:10.610
That way we would be
backdriving cells.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:13.420
And when you find the
cell in the retina that

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.750
is backdriven from
the colliculus,

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:19.540
you know that particular cell
does project to the colliculus.

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.540
So that's a very
strong technique

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:26.900
because that enables you then
to identify the cell type

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.340
and also you could, if you
do intercellular recording,

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.140
to label it.

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:35.430
So they can do the
same thing also--

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:37.600
because I'm going to talk
about that as well-- is

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.500
to see what happens
in terms of inputs

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.025
to the colliculus
from the cortex.

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.570
So let's talk about
each of those,

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:51.260
and that'll give us a
better sense of what

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:53.322
the projections
are from the retina

00:54:53.322 --> 00:54:54.905
and from the cortex
to the colliculus.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.080
So here's an example
of how you do it again.

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:04.710
So we are recording
from the retina here,

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:09.480
or in a different experiment,
you can record from the cortex.

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.820
You can then electrically
stimulate here.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.550
You can backdrive the
cells in the retina,

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.900
or we can backdrive the
cells in the visual cortex.

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:23.630
And then once we do so, and
record it from a single cell,

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:26.250
you can study to
see what it is like.

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:28.360
So that is the approach.

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:32.770
And if you do that, you come
up with some very nice answers.

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:36.300
First of all, these
cells are W-like,

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.320
which means that they're like
the corneal cellular cells

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.990
that we have seen the retina.

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:44.540
These are these small
cells that are not

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:48.740
particularly rapidly
conducting, obviously

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.720
and are not color selective.

00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:58.400
And then if we look
at the cells up here,

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.680
we find that all those
cells are complex cells,

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.320
and they all reside
in layer five.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.430
That's already
known anatomically

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:08.640
that the cells in
layer five are the ones

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.260
that project-- many
of them project

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.740
to the superior colliculus.

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.090
So that then is the
basic procedure.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:22.035
So now we can expand on
this basic procedure.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.612
What we can do here
is we can record

00:56:27.612 --> 00:56:28.820
from the superior colliculus.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:35.250
And then we can eliminate
the inputs from the cortex

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:36.300
by cooling it.

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.455
That's one approach.

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.920
So if you do that, you
record from a cell here,

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.810
you drive it by
electric stimulation--

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:45.985
by visual stimulation.

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:54.350
We identify that cell
in V1 by backdriving it.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:59.050
And then once you cool it,
cool the visual cortex,

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:02.820
you see what happens to that
cell in the various layers

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.690
of the superior colliculus.

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:09.360
Well when you do that, you get
a very dramatic and, luckily,

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.120
clear cut result.

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.110
The result is the following.

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:18.400
If you look at the superficial
layers of the colliculus,

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.830
and look at what happens
before you cool, when you cool,

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:26.030
and after you cool,
the cells keep firing.

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:30.520
So in these upper layers
in superficial gray,

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.864
those cells keep firing.

00:57:32.864 --> 00:57:34.280
They're not
interested in anything

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.190
that comes down from the cortex.

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:40.370
That's because the
inputs from the retina

00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:47.050
goes to these upper layers
of the superior colliculus,

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:50.060
and goes predominantly
to the superficial gray.

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:55.880
However, once you get down
to the intermediate layers,

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.980
and the lower layers
as well, every time

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:03.140
you cool, the cell stops
firing, as you can see here.

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:09.065
Which means that these cells
in the intermediate and lower

00:58:09.065 --> 00:58:11.770
layers of the
colliculus are driven

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:13.780
by the cortical down flow.

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:18.300
They're not driven by the
direct input from the retina.

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:26.330
So now that we have seen this,
one can say, OK, that's fine.

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:35.050
But is this really something
that happens over time,

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:36.480
or is this just
something peculiar

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.970
to the particular
experiment that's been run?

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:41.790
So what do you do to
see if this is really

00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:45.540
something-- a permanent effect?

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:51.710
Well, what you can do here
is you can take a monkey,

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:56.240
and you can remove the
visual cortex on one side,

00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:00.550
so the monkey can see fine
in half the visual field.

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:04.750
And then you can
record on either side--

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:07.840
the intact side or
the affected side--

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.900
in the superior colliculus.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:10.910
Everybody follow that?

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.730
All right.

00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:18.540
So if you do that, what you
find is this is the intact side,

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.350
and this is the side
where there's no V1.

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:29.170
And this was taken months
after the area V1 was removed.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:32.720
And here you see these red spots
here, and the red spots here?

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:37.240
That spot is the location
after which you no longer

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.150
could drive any cells visually.

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.600
So in the intact
side, you can drive it

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.570
to very deep layers
of the colliculus.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:47.700
They had responded very
well to visual stimuli.

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.140
But on this side, they
stopped responding here.

00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:54.040
So none of these
deeper layers could

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:57.930
be activated by visual stimuli
because those deep layer,

00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:02.760
indeed, are driven
by visual inputs

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.605
from the downflow
from the cortex.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.580
So that then is the
basic rule of what

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:13.400
has happened in the
superior colliculus.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:14.820
All right.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:24.320
Now let's see-- the next
big question we can ask

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.570
is this downflow
from the cortex that

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:31.680
drives these important
intermediate layers, which

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.320
are involved in eye movement
generation, to what degree are

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.180
those cortical
tactile cells driven

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.240
by either the parvocellular
or the magnocellular

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.670
layer of cells, meaning
by the midget cells,

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:47.190
or the parasol cells.

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:51.600
Well how do you do that?

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.850
I've already told
you about experiments

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:57.230
in which what you can do
is you can put a recording

01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.410
electrode, in this
case in the colliculus.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:03.810
And then you can inactivate
either the parvocellular

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:10.330
or the magnocellular of the
lateral geniculate nucleus,

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:14.665
while you record in the
superior colliculus.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.360
So what happens is that these
cells then, obviously as shown

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.540
here, project to V1, and then
layer five cells project down.

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.690
So what we are going
to identify then

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:29.970
is what is the nature of
these cells in layer five

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:31.360
that drive down there.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.730
So first of all,
what this shows is

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:38.250
that if you record
from-- in this case,

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:41.220
from two cells in the
geniculate shown-- sorry,

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.560
two cells in the
colliculus shown,

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.760
this is under normal
conditions, and this

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.240
is when the parvocell
layers are blocked.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.490
Here's another cell--
normal condition,

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:52.910
and then magnocellular
layers are blocked.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:55.340
So this clearly shows-- and
this was done with dozens,

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.350
and dozens, and
dozens of cells--

01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:02.680
that blocking the
parvocellular layers,

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.720
meaning blocking
the midget system,

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:12.210
had no effect on the cortical
tactile driving of cells,

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:15.740
whereas magnocellular
block eliminated it.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:22.390
So that meant that these
cells in layer five that

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.340
project to the
superior colliculus

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:30.570
are driven exclusively
by the parasol system.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:34.040
And indeed then,
that was also done--

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.730
now let me go back to
that-- that was also done

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:39.730
in another set of
experiments showing that

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:44.010
those cells in the
cortex in layer five,

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:48.840
that you could drive from the
geniculate by backdriving it

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.340
if you then block the
midget or parasol cells,

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.960
those cells would stop firing.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.140
So those were indeed cells
that were driven exclusively

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.550
by the parasol system.

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:03.420
So the parasol system
plays a very important role

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:05.490
in getting-- in
driving the colliculus.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:09.210
But doing it so only through
the cortex, not directly.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:19.510
so to then put this in an
easy to remember the diagram,

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:23.960
is to say that when you come to
these high level animals, what

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.330
happened is that due
to encephalization,

01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:33.920
the cortex gained control
over the superior colliculus,

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.710
except the superficial gray.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.800
Everything else
in the colliculus

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.450
is controlled by the
cortical downflow.

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:46.090
And that, of course,
became very important

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:48.390
because when you make a
decision as to where you're

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:51.940
going to look next, where you're
going to identify an object,

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.360
you have to have information
from the cortex itself,

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.950
which then has to be
transferred, in this case,

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:02.760
to the colliculus to generate
the desired eye movement,

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.020
so that you can
analyze in detail

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.140
what you want to analyze.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.180
So that then is
the basic layout.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.970
And so now what we can
do is we can expand

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:19.040
some more on this diagram,
namely-- once again,

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.270
let's go through all this.

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:22.840
We have the brain stem
here, which is a rate code.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.610
And then we have a
superior colliculus.

01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:29.810
And that code that we're
going talk about there,

01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:31.890
that I've already
described, you can

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:33.840
refer to that as
the vector code.

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:38.430
And then what we
can see here-- some

01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:40.530
of this work I've
shown you before--

01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:43.710
is that we have these three
systems from the retina

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:45.110
that we talked about now.

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:48.510
The midget, the parasol,
and the W system,

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.960
or the corneal cellular system,
that goes up the cortex.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:58.480
And then the downflow
from V1, we now know,

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:04.310
is driven exclusively, it
seems, by the parasol system.

01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:09.990
However, remember also that
when we go to higher cortical

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:14.430
areas-- V2, MT, and V4, and so
on-- these areas, some of them

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:16.860
get a mixed input
from two systems,

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:21.250
like V4 and the temporal lobe.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:24.390
And MT, on the other
hand, is dominated

01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:28.440
by inputs from the parasol
system, but it's not exclusive.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.180
So in the end, the
colliculus also

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.440
gets an input from
the midget system.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:41.870
But the heaviest input to it is
indeed from the parasol system.

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:46.890
So that then is what the diagram
looks like at this point.

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:49.670
And so what we are
going to do next time,

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:57.104
we're going to expand on
this connection in which we

01:05:57.104 --> 01:05:58.770
are going to look at
some other cortical

01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:02.470
structures-- namely I've already
referred to that a few times--

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:05.200
the frontal eye fields
and the medial eye fields,

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.140
which are regions in the cortex
that control eye movements.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:13.090
And that's what we're going to
look at in much more detail.

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:16.965
So now I'm ready to summarize
what I told you so far.

01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:22.740
First of all, there are several
classes of eye movements

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:23.990
one can distinguish.

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:26.850
Those are vergence eye movements
and conjugate eye movements.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:31.280
And the conjugate
eye movements come

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.580
in two major types, which
we call the smooth pursuit

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.760
type and the saccadic type.

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:41.100
Then we're going to
talk about eye movements

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:46.300
as a result of the 6 extraocular
muscles that we have.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:51.650
And important to note that
these extraocular muscles are

01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:53.540
such that the
fibers in the muscle

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.160
run the entire length
of the muscles.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.600
They're not segmented,
and that they

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.650
are innervated by the
third, fourth, and sixth

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:02.400
cranial nerves.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.680
Then we say that
the discharge rate

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.350
in neurons of the
final common path

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:12.085
is proportional to the
angular deviation of the eye.

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:16.060
Saccade size is a
function of the duration

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:19.480
of the high frequency
burst in these neurons.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.360
And if you look it up
and down eye movements,

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:28.780
as I've shown you, if the
more the muscles contract that

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:35.240
are the inferior recti, the more
the idea deviates downwards.

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:39.880
And because it's reciprocal, as
the eye deviates more and more,

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:44.380
the superior rectus is
activated less and less.

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.340
So we have this
proportional arrangements.

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:50.750
It's as beautiful as I've shown
you-- a linear system that

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:55.360
defines very accurately
the degree of deviation

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.150
of the eye as a function
of the frequency

01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:59.385
of the neuronal activity.

01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:04.900
Then the superior colliculus
codes saccadic vectors

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:09.130
whose amplitude and direction is
laid out in an orderly fashion

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:12.620
and is in register with the
visual receptive fields.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.880
I told you that in the
anterior colliculus,

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.590
the receptive fields are
very close to the fovea.

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:22.590
And then you go to the
back of the colliculus,

01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:27.580
the progressively further
peripheral, and medial is up,

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.060
lateral is down.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.425
It's a nice orderly arrangement.

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:36.490
And you have an arrangement
where the visual receptive

01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:40.100
fields and the motor fields are
in register with each other.

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:45.210
And every time there's activity,
there's a particular receptive

01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:48.240
field location, the
result is that a saccade

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:51.760
will move the eye into the
receptive field, thereby

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.180
nulling the retinal
error signal.

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:58.410
And then the retinal input
to the superior colliculus

01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:01.160
comes predominantly
from w-like cells.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:06.069
But the cortical downflow from
V1, which comes from layer 5,

01:09:06.069 --> 01:09:08.365
is driven by the parasol system.

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:11.319
But we should not
neglect the fact--

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:17.840
I'm not sure if you're-- neglect
the fact that they are other

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:24.045
pathways to which the midget
system can also make maybe

01:09:24.045 --> 01:09:27.844
a more limited contribution
in generating eye movements.

01:09:30.979 --> 01:09:35.020
And as a diagram
I had shown you,

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:38.180
I demonstrated that
the superior colliculus

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:43.140
is on the cortical control
in higher primates.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.620
So that then is the essence of
what I wanted to cover today.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.990
And then next time, we are going
to talk about-- let me see,

01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:54.100
do I have a--
we're going to talk

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.640
about the cortical areas
involved in saccadic eye

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.140
movements control,
which we will then

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:06.270
highlight the fact that this
incessant activity of us moving

01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:09.760
the eyes is incredibly
elaborate and complicated.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.610
There are millions of
neurons involved in doing it.

01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:16.970
And yet, it's such
an incredible system

01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:19.080
that it's something we
never even think about.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:24.870
Luckily, it's a kind of system--
partly because of the fact

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:29.000
that there's no wait
involved in the muscles,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.730
and that the fibers run
the entire length of each

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:36.710
of the extraocular muscles-- it
is a system that one has been

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:38.690
fortunate enough to
understand reasonably

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:43.230
well in how it
works in the brain.

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:46.760
So that, in essence, is what
I wanted to cover today.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.050
If any of you have
any questions,

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:51.720
anything that-- I know this
is kind of complicated,

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.610
but I hope that
you will understand

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:57.080
this reasonably well.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.480
And if it's not
clear to you, I will

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.786
be very happy to answer any
questions that you might have.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.000
Well, I was
reasonably clear then.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:17.780
So next time-- here's my
to-do-- the cortex, heavily.

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:21.555
I will also show you some
interesting movies about that.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.701
And I think you're
going to find that it's

01:11:25.701 --> 01:11:30.430
a really fascinating story
of how the cortex has evolved

01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:33.990
to generate more and more
areas that are involved

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:39.760
in an incredible
number of functions

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.990
in the generation of eye
movements, as well, of course,

01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:45.470
as in processing
visual information.

01:11:46.921 --> 01:11:47.420
OK.

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.670
Well, thank you very much.

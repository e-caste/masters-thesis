SUSAN SHEEHY: So I just want to
do an overview of healthcare,

00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:36.050
lean for healthcare,
because you've learned a lot

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.175
in the last couple of days.

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:39.800
And how do you apply
this at the front line--

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.780
at the front lines of
hospital or healthcare?

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.330
So just to give you a little bit
of an overview of our company,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.900
our company's stationed-- or
the headquarters is in Montana.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.690
We've worked with about 115
healthcare organizations,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.950
mostly hospitals.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.110
We've had some other
kinds of organizations

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.290
like Johnson Johnson,
Blue Cross, Penn State,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.800
some universities as
well as medical centers,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.130
from 50 bed centers
to 1,200 bed centers.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.460
So Lean works across the
board in every department

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.980
in every organization in
the healthcare system,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.357
lean for healthcare.

00:01:14.357 --> 00:01:16.190
Matthew May wrote a
really nice little book.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.260
And I was telling Earl
about it at the break.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.760
It's a little paperback book.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.560
You can get it on Amazon for $2.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.930
It's called The Elegant
Solution by Matthew May,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.662
and it's about Lean,
not only about lean

00:01:25.662 --> 00:01:27.620
for healthcare but it's
an awesome little book.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.370
It takes about an hour
and a half to read.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.250
And what Matthew May
says is Lean doesn't

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.690
light a fire under people.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.720
It lights a fire within
people, because it's really

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.540
an exciting thing to bring
to a healthcare organization.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.410
Why Lean?

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.890
Because it's a great fit for
healthcare organizations.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.040
It produces meaningful, useful,
important results right away.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.470
And it provides
a power to change

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.450
an entire culture
of an organization,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.040
if you do it right.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.710
One of the things we have to
ask ourselves in healthcare

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.130
is, is there a better way
to do what we're doing?

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.030
So I put this.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.050
This is my administration slide.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.150
And this is how
we do what we do.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.900
And the answer we
always get in healthcare

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.479
is because that's the
way we've always done it.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.100
So lean is the systematic
pursuit of perfection,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.460
and it's a discipline
of incremental changes,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.840
one little step at a time.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.172
You're not going to come in and
change the world in six months.

00:02:24.172 --> 00:02:27.690
Taiichi Ono, who was
the president of Toyota,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.920
said it's better to make a
2% improvement every month

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.370
than a 24% improvement one month
and none the rest of the year,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.800
because what happens
is it doesn't embed

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.810
the philosophy of
continuous improvement

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.670
and continuous change.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.940
So you have to intermingle
your rapid improvement

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.260
events with lean sustainability
across the board as well,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.440
really important.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.950
And in our experience,
a lean transformation

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.240
in healthcare organization takes
four, five, six years at least,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.600
depending on the commitment
of the administration

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.410
and the ability to actually
educate and train the staff.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.640
There's no quick easy way.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.420
People think of
lean as a quick fix.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.250
It's not.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.840
It's a good fix, but
it's not a quick fix.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.320
It's learned through
experiences, clinical and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.090
operational experiences.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.820
It takes practice,
practice, and more practice.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.220
One of the questions that
came up is it's too risky.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.810
If you take a risk,
you might fail.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.310
Well, yeah.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.470
But if you don't take a
risk, you are going to fail.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.410
So it's important
to take some risks

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.820
and give some new things a try.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.470
In order for lean to succeed--

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.630
and I'll intersperse
it through my talk--

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.860
the entire healthcare
team has to own it.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.500
It's really bad for a
CEO to hire a consultant

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.500
to come in and fix things
for you, and then they leave.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.900
Everybody has to own it--
the senior administrators,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.030
middle managers, and
the front line staff.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.250
It has to be evident
in everyday work.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.450
Somebody sees a problem.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.060
Let's do an A3 on that
and fix it right now.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.310
It has to be embedded
and practiced

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.630
by everyone in the organization.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.200
And it has to be expected of
everyone in the organization,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.050
not just one or two activities,
but across the board.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.287
I used to be a director years
ago before I knew about lean.

00:04:11.287 --> 00:04:13.120
And someone would come
to me with a problem.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.500
And I'd say, don't come
to me with a problem.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.740
Come to me with a solution.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.420
And that is the absolute
wrong thing to say.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.120
Come to me with what the
issue is and background,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.760
and we together will
work on the solution.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.780
That's how lean is.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.330
So managers are no
longer dictators.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.110
Managers become coaches
and barrier removers.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.207
That's how lean succeeds.

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:36.290
This is what we hear in
healthcare, because that's

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.920
the way we've always done it.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.620
And Mr. Einstein said the
significant problems we face

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.990
cannot be solved at the same
level of thinking we were

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.630
at when we created them.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.880
Why Toyota production system?

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.110
Why lean for healthcare?

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.890
They make cars.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.900
We take care of people.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.400
Well, first of all, they're the
most successful manufacturer

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.650
in the world, most people think.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.820
Can it work for healthcare?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.900
Let's see.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.450
They have the best record of
introducing new technology.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.350
Well, guess what?

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.840
We have a technological
imperative in healthcare.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.220
We have to do that.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.410
Best record of
employee satisfaction.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.680
We have to keep our
employees with us.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.820
Retention, happy-- employees
who stay are important.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.860
Relentless commitment
to eliminating waste.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.370
And heaven knows we have a
ton of waste in healthcare.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.560
One million suggestions
a year Toyota

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.260
expects from their employees,
and they implement over

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.870
90% of their suggestions.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.680
And those employees
feel very valued.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.040
And who better to tell
us how to fix our system

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.300
than the front line workers?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.490
Who better to tell us how to
clean a bed than the cleaning

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.910
lady?

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.285
Who better to tell us how to
prepare a tray than somebody

00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:40.690
from the cafeteria?

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.300
Not somebody from
here who says, I

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.430
want you to deliver those
trays better with hotter food.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.460
We need to go ask them,
why is the food not hot?

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.430
Features of Toyota
production system, a.k.a.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.610
lean-- management
is not top-down.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.700
Healthcare has a traditional
model of command and control.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.590
Can't do that anymore.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.690
Toyota also has a
model of employees

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.370
being on the value
side of the ledger,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.140
and not on the
expense side, even

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.440
though they are an expense.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.150
Healthcare, we have
just the opposite.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.773
We put employees on
the expense side.

00:06:10.773 --> 00:06:11.690
We need to cut budget.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.280
We cut physicians.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.310
We need to think differently.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.820
We need to take the people
who are doing the work

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.950
and recognize them
as the experts.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.140
This is work we did at
Mount Sinai in New York

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.920
when they were implementing
Epic, a big massive software,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.780
medical software program.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.480
They wanted to fix
their processes first,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.490
their clinical
processes, and then

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.090
do the Epic builds based
on their newly renovated

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.180
clinical processes, rather
than building Epic and then

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.280
trying to fit the
processes into those.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.500
So we asked the people
who are doing the work

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.110
to do the mapping of their
processes, and we coached.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.440
We had 56 nursing units to
work with, daunting task.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.330
Imagine what would
happen in a hospital

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.430
if every employee
in that hospital

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.970
was empowered to do lean,
to identify problems

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.370
and issues every day,
to identify barriers

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.880
to them getting their work done,
to allow them to make needed

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.840
changes on a daily basis.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.230
It's the power of 1,000,
or 2,000, or however

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.430
many employees you have.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.130
Bill Bradel who's the CEO at
Northern Arizona Healthcare

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.190
calls lean the best
thing since penicillin.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.270
He says it's the best thing that
ever happened to him as a CEO.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.870
Why Lean?

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.650
Lean gives employees a
purpose, a direction,

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.830
a sense of belonging, a
sense of contributing,

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.630
a different way
to think and work,

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.090
and an opportunity to build
a better work environment.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.430
I finished a project
recently where a cleaning

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.250
lady discovered
$750,000 of waste,

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.400
getting rid of hazardous waste
material that really wasn't

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.010
hazardous waste, a cleaning lady
who came to my class and said,

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.860
I don't think I have
anything to offer.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.970
Hello.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.340
It was amazing.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.660
Why lean for healthcare?

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.990
We talked about this earlier.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.990
It's the largest
industry in America.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.990
And the cost is going
up, and up, and up.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.990
And by 2019, it's
going to be almost 20%

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.400
of our gross domestic product.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.450
We can't do that.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.130
It's not sustainable.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.010
What's happening is the reason
this is going up so fast

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.870
is we have job
losses, and people

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.990
who were originally
insured are now gone,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.380
going out to Medicaid.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.400
And we baby boomers, some of
us, are starting to retire

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.310
and moving from Blue
Cross to Medicare.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.590
It costs money to do that.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.080
And it's going to
increase 7.4% annually,

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.220
Medicare spending,
between 2011 and 2017,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.270
the big baby boomer surge.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.860
We also have to
figure out how we're

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.320
going to take care of these
different populations.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.387
We've got baby boomers
who pretty much believe

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:42.679
anything the doctor tells them.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.330
And we take advice.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.250
Gen Xers are a little
bit more skeptical.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.890
They're going to go on
Google and look something up.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.110
Millennials-- I have
a 26-year-old son

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.700
who's going to come
with information,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.130
and he's going to tell
you what he needs done.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.310
The digital natives who are
the newest being born children

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.363
want everything now
at home, online.

00:09:01.363 --> 00:09:02.780
So we have to
figure out how we're

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.440
going to deliver healthcare.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.350
Why do I have to come into the
hospital for my blood test?

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.267
Can't I just stick my
finger into my computer,

00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:11.278
and can't it just draw my
blood and give me a read out?

00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:12.320
Think about these things.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.140
Why not?

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.150
Why not?

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.010
Why does this work
for healthcare, again,

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.630
massive waste in healthcare?

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.130
It's estimated
that everything we

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.100
do in healthcare between
50% to 60% of everything

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.310
we do every day is
waste, 50% to 60%.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.732
Excuse me.

00:09:28.732 --> 00:09:31.030
Lean is rock solid common sense.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.960
It's very easy to learn and
teach at the front line.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.110
It's easy to apply at the front
line where work is happening,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.320
and improvement occurs
with the first application.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.610
Quick example.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.483
I had a security guard
in one of my classes.

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:45.150
And I always say to
them, pick something

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.400
that drives you crazy every
day when you come to work.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.970
That's going to be your project,
not a person but a process.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.610
And this security guard
says, OK, taking--

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.580
investigating lost false teeth.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.290
Sounds funny.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.080
Hospital's spending
$3,000 a week

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.000
replacing lost false teeth.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.820
And this guy was writing
reports that went nowhere.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.910
So the first thing we have them
do is an observation exercise.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.950
He went to gemba, looked
around, came back, and said,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.840
I think I figured it out.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.420
Every room is designed
for a right handed person.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.290
So I'm in the bed.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.040
I'm the patient.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.350
I've got my bedside
table, my over bed table,

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.180
and the trashcan.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.390
So I'm grandma, and I'm
not really good at night

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.580
when I take off my
glasses, take off my teeth,

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.750
go to put them on the table.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.780
They fall in the trashcan.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.490
Housekeeping comes in really
quietly, takes the bag,

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.430
throws it away, gone,
never to be seen again.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.932
So he said, I
moved the trashcans

00:10:36.932 --> 00:10:39.140
on the left side of the bed
this week, and I watched.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.970
We found teeth on the floor,
but we didn't lose any.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.130
Security guard.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.760
Wasted time-- this is a study
done by John Kenagy, who's

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.450
Boston based.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.250
He actually lives in Belmont.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.780
Dr. Kanegy and his group looked
at 1,000 hours of nursing work

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.490
across a number
of organizations.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.950
And what they found is only
a third of nurses' time

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.200
is spent at the
bedside, one third.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.440
Another 24% or 25% is spent
with administrative things,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.390
paperwork, medication
reconciliation.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:14.160
And 43% was pure waste,
clarifying, hunting, reworking,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.850
redundancy, checking, waiting.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.050
Think what we could
do with this time,

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.942
if we could capture it back,
if we can put it in here,

00:11:21.942 --> 00:11:24.150
and get our patients out of
bed, and get them walking

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.190
and do DVT prevention
and pressure sort

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.605
prevention, shorter lengths
of stay, better outcomes.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.780
Everything we do in
lean and our mantra,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.700
and it should be
everything we do in lean

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.730
must be patient focused.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.260
It's not about the physician.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.430
It's not about the nurse.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.722
It's not about the housekeeper.

00:11:43.722 --> 00:11:47.910
It's about that patient,
because that's why we're there.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.020
And the old mentality
in healthcare

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.110
is we worked in siloes.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.980
I worked in the
ED for many years,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.570
and it's like, oh, my god,
this patient is going to die.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.487
I just don't want him
to die in my department.

00:11:57.487 --> 00:11:59.000
Let's get him to the OR.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.330
That was the old thinking.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.450
Now, we have to think
this is our patient, all

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.338
of our patient.

00:12:04.338 --> 00:12:05.880
So I have a little
thing that I like.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.370
It's a piece of
artwork called mandala,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:14.170
where every point in a circle is
connected to every other point.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.215
And this is why I
like to think of how

00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:18.340
we need to think about
healthcare, with the patient

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.460
in the middle supported by
every single department that's

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.620
connected to every
single department.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.942
So it's no more
their fault. The ICU

00:12:25.942 --> 00:12:28.150
won't take my patient,
because the nurse is on break.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.050
And we never get a break.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.400
And we haven't had
lunch for three months,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.010
and they go to lunch every day.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.920
That's the kind of thing
that's got to stop.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.080
Another Einstein--
I love this saying.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.240
Everything must
be made as simple

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.090
as possible but not
one bit simpler.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.740
So it needs to be a continuous
flow without the workarounds.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.780
The nurse goes into the
room to do something.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.680
The equipment isn't there.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.060
She has to go to
the supply room.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.230
She goes to the supply room.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.855
It isn't there.

00:12:53.855 --> 00:12:56.080
She has to go call
storeroom to get it.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.990
She comes back.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.000
She needs a medication.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.080
She goes to the Pyxis.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.220
It's not there.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.670
These are all called
workarounds, which prevent us

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.650
from that continuous flow.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.770
And that's what we're looking
for in lean, continuous flow.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.550
Paul Batalden was a professor at
Dartmouth who recently retired.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.892
And he said that--
and this is absolutely

00:13:14.892 --> 00:13:17.350
true-- everyone in healthcare
must recognize that they have

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.830
two jobs when they come to
work every day, doing the work

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.550
and improving the work.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.540
So we all have to be
looking for waste.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.610
What can we do with
lean healthcare?

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.930
Produce more defect
free health care,

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.008
eliminate waste, improve
workplace appreciation

00:13:34.008 --> 00:13:35.300
for the people who do the work.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.950
And it also
strengthens leadership,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.480
because you have
a common dialogue.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.370
I'm going fast because I want to
show you some examples as well.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.842
So we need to ask ourselves
everyday in healthcare,

00:13:45.842 --> 00:13:47.800
are there things happening
to our patients that

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.780
shouldn't be happening?

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.540
We also need to ask
ourselves, are there

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.910
things not happening
to our patients

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.810
that should be happening?

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.720
Every day, ask
yourself this question.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.070
Now, what does defect free mean?

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.800
Defect free means exactly
what the patient needs

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.030
when they need
it, without errors

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:11.190
and that it's safe for the
patients and the staff.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.652
The mudas are pretty similar.

00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:14.610
We've tweaked them a
little bit for healthcare.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.063
And every organization
that deals with healthcare

00:14:17.063 --> 00:14:18.480
has them a little
bit differently,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.475
but these are ours.

00:14:19.475 --> 00:14:20.850
In my particular
company, they're

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.400
pretty close to manufacturing--
most manufacturing.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.830
And we've added the
eighth one for us

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.210
is matching people
skills with the task,

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.270
because a study done by the
Wisconsin Nursing Intervention

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.670
Outcomes Project
over 20 years showed

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.220
that 16% of everything
nurses do clinically

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.790
can be done by somebody else.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.890
So can we do that?

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.890
Can we reassign some work
to make the right people be

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.560
doing the right things?

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.970
Confusion is a muda.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.220
In healthcare-- and these
are just some examples--

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.590
clarifying physician's orders,
medication reconciliation,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.900
which is such a headache.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.340
Patients come in, and
we have to find out

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.507
what medications they're on.

00:14:57.507 --> 00:14:58.200
This is grandma.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.720
She comes in with a shopping
bag and pours her meds.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.380
Some are old.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.480
Some are new, from three
different pharmacies,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.860
five different doctors.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.670
Who knows?

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.530
So you're spending hours.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.470
And the average med-surge
nurse spends about two hours

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.290
doing a med reconciliation
on one patient,

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.310
making phone calls.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.158
It's crazy.

00:15:15.158 --> 00:15:16.950
We have to figure out
how to embed computer

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.770
chips in people's ear, so
that any time a medication

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.010
changes it gets recorded
on the chip or something.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.410
Motion-- this is
waste in healthcare--

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.750
looking for supplies,
trying to find a chart,

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.370
multiple diagnostic tests
in various locations.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.040
So you come to get the patient.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.970
Transportation comes.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.170
Oh, they're in X-ray.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.425
Housekeeping-- or dietary
comes to deliver their tray.

00:15:37.425 --> 00:15:38.400
Oh, they're in CT.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.700
Patients all over the place
with no central scheduling way

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.110
to see where they are.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.210
Nonsensical staff assignments.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.130
I've worked in the
ER for 34 years.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.470
There was never a match
between the physician schedule

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.310
and the nurse schedule.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.700
They were all different.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.318
And so trying to work as a
team, it took so much time

00:15:56.318 --> 00:15:58.610
to get everybody caught up
at all the different changes

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.480
of schedule.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.160
And I have this
really strong feeling

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.850
about nurses working
12 hour shifts,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.750
but that's another
band soapbox for me.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.890
It's horrible.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.610
And not having the
equipment you need.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.280
These are all
involved with motion.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.430
Waiting-- healthcare waiting,
waiting for appointments,

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.830
waiting for transport to
arrive, waiting for the surgeon

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.672
to come, so that the OR case
can start, waiting in an ED.

00:16:19.672 --> 00:16:20.630
What's wrong with this?

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.365
Oxymoron-- emergency
room, waiting room.

00:16:24.365 --> 00:16:25.600
It doesn't make sense.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.350
Does it?

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.080
Waiting for discharge orders,
waiting for meds to arrive.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.650
We wait non-stop.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.840
Processing-- not
having the things

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.770
you need in the med container
Pyxis, complex and redundant

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:39.367
paperwork.

00:16:39.367 --> 00:16:41.200
Have you ever gone to
a doctor's appointment

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.700
to the hospital,
and three people

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.770
ask you the same question?

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.500
Processing that
incorporates workarounds.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.850
They're part of the plan.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.260
We don't even realize it.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.090
Insurance nuances, the worst.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.720
Inventory-- big problem, too
much of one thing, too little

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.780
of another, expired items,
not the right things or not

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.920
in the right place.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.599
My ER had nine different
kinds of arterial line trays.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.490
Every one had to be
calibrated differently.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.920
I had 97 nurses on my staff.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.200
What do you think
the expertise was

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.988
in any nurse on any
one of those trays?

00:17:15.988 --> 00:17:17.280
And the physician's complained.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.869
I said, OK, let's get together.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:19.911
You're going to pick one.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.319
Sometimes, you have
to be a hard nose.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:29.160
Defects or errors--
in the IHR report,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.910
over 100,000 hospital deaths
each year due to errors that we

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.600
make--

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.270
medication errors,
failure to rescue error.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.310
My father went in for
an outpatient procedure

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.590
and died because
something happened,

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:44.940
and they ignored it and did
something else, something

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.620
that could have been rectified.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.970
Incorrect identifications-- two
people with the same last name.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.400
Wrong site surgeries,
and it happens.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.180
Wrong leg amputated, wrong
arm, wrong side, falls.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.500
Falls happen all the time.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.110
These are major errors.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.900
Healthcare is the largest
industry in the world.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.960
It's also the least reliable.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.790
We have an extremely
high defect rate.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.170
Hospitals may be hazardous
to your health, seriously.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.780
You come in, and the chances
of you getting an infection

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.650
are not slim.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.070
Medicare has developed what
they call never events.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.535
If something happens
during your hospital stay--

00:18:28.535 --> 00:18:29.910
and there's a big
list; these are

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.370
examples-- they will not
pay for that treatment

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.780
of that particular thing.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.880
Urinary tract infection,
pressure sores,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.630
hospital acquired pneumonias,
different kinds of infections--

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.820
if this happens during
the hospital stay,

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.980
Medicare will not pay
for that treatment.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.970
The hospital has to suck it up.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.370
And it's a good thing, because
they should never happen.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.410
But why do they happen?

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.920
Because people don't have time
to attend to these things.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.960
Or we don't have standard
ways we do our work.

00:18:59.483 --> 00:19:01.900
There's another thing that's
coming up that you may or may

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.900
not have heard of.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.480
It's called value
based purchasing.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.120
This is another new
Medicare/Medicaid idea.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.190
It's scary, because
what they're going

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.610
to do starting next
year is a portion--

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.320
every patient is assigned
a diagnostic revenue

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.540
group, or DRG, and
you get paid a set

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.640
amount for that diagnosis.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.380
They are going to withhold 1%
of the DRG payment from all

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.150
hospitals, and then
it's going to be--

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.190
there's-- and this was
authorized by an act--

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.880
it allows a portion of that
Medicare and Medicaid payment

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.050
to be withheld.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.950
And then, it will be reimbursed
to the hospital later based

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.260
on performance.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.510
They'll get a score, a
value based revenue score.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.150
And then, they'll get incentives
to get that money back.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.250
So it's performance based.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.660
It'll include clinical measures.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.920
70% are clinical.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.600
30% are age gaps.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.100
If you don't know
what age gaps are,

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.540
that's the patient's assessment
of how their care went.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.940
So if the patient doesn't say
you did a good job, guess what?

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.440
You're not going
to get your money.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.390
These are the big four that
they're starting with in 2013--

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.850
heart failure, myocardial
infarction, pneumonia,

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:07.600
and surgical care.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.475
And the list is going
to keep getting bigger.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.340
These are the proposed
things for 2014.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.150
They're going to look
at clinical outcomes,

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.440
patient safety issues,
operational throughput,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.960
and mortality rates.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.620
Hospitals need to start
to get better or continue

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.880
to get better.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.350
It's the lean imperative.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.240
I have CEOs who
say, we really can't

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.250
afford to do lean
throughout the hospital.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.870
And our response
is, you can't afford

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.070
to not do lean, because
as the number of metrics

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.820
and complexity of
measures increases,

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.110
it'll be vital to learn to
effectively design and manage

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.687
overall delivery systems,
rather than targeting

00:20:46.687 --> 00:20:48.520
just select things like
door to needle time.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.062
That's great.

00:20:49.062 --> 00:20:50.800
Everybody does that,
or door to cath lab.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.717
It's going to be the
whole organization that's

00:20:52.717 --> 00:20:54.020
getting measured.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.987
So the whole organization has to
figure out how to address this.

00:20:58.987 --> 00:21:00.820
There's another, getting
back to the mudas--

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.260
overproduction--
different people

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.480
asking the same
questions, multiple forms

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.300
requesting the same
information, unnecessary lab

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.300
or diagnostic tests.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.840
We have this a lot in academics,
and we reword everything,

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.650
covering all bases.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.690
And overproduction,
again, different--

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.090
oh, didn't I just do that?

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.180
Sorry.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.170
Excuse me.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.650
Ideal healthcare is exactly what
the patient needs, no more, no

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.670
less, on demand, exactly
as requested with no waste.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.220
It's an immediate response
to a problem or a change,

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.150
if that happens.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.400
And it's physically,
professionally, emotionally

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.930
safe for patients and staff.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.100
Those are the ground rules.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:45.340
Now, in the-- a lot of
the lean sensible papers

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.100
that have come out, there are
some really good information.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.070
And Bowen and Spear,
who are from this area,

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.160
in their MBA work, looked at
the lean-- the Toyota production

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:55.660
system.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.580
They said, basically,
there are four rules.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.110
Toyota has never stated them.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.190
But Bowen and Spear
identified them.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.000
So here are the four
rules about lean.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.390
All activities of work must
be specified, standard work.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.220
Content, timing,
sequencing, outcome

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.417
would standardize how you
do an arterial line, how

00:22:12.417 --> 00:22:14.000
you admit a patient,
how you discharge

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.590
a patient, how you order meds.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.930
The second rule-- and we
looked at this and said,

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.130
how does this fit in--

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.540
every process in healthcare
has a map, a value stream map.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.750
Across the top is the
request for that process.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.730
And then across the middle is
the delivery of that process.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.240
So we interpreted this
as rule number two

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.490
has to do with the
request for the process.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.200
So in the request,
all connections

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.920
in the request or service
are simple and direct.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.390
Here's an example.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:43.920
Old way-- patient comes in.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.780
They want care in
the emergency room.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.840
They come in to the ER.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.340
They wait.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.030
They sign in.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.603
They wait.

00:22:48.603 --> 00:22:49.770
They go to the waiting room.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.160
They wait.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.180
They go to registration.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.750
They wait.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.160
They see the triage nurse.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.510
Maybe they go to an exam room.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.740
Maybe they wait.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.085
That's the request before
that patient even gets care.

00:22:59.085 --> 00:23:01.210
What we need to do is look
at that request and say,

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.390
how can we get that
patient, comes into the ER,

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.190
immediately through
triage or back into a bed?

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.580
So how can we eliminate
a lot of these steps

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.350
and make it less complex?

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.800
Can we do that?

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.440
Rule number three has to
do with the actual steps

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.300
in the process itself.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.060
So rule number three is that
all pathways in the process

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.040
to deliver the
request are simple

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.390
and involve as few
steps as necessary.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:25.640
Do we need all of these steps?

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.190
Can one person be doing
two tests instead of one?

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.600
Can we consolidate some?

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.260
Can we change the order?

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.890
So again, this is the example
I gave you of the nurse.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.080
If we map this
nurse and how she's

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.730
doing this procedure
for the patient,

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:38.897
look at all the workarounds.

00:23:38.897 --> 00:23:40.790
And how can we get rid
of those workarounds

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:44.060
and make it simple and direct?

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.550
And rule number four is that
everything we do in lean needs

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.390
to lead towards improvement.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.520
You don't change just
for the sake of change.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.250
And we've all been
through healthcares

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.958
where we've done some
changes, and nobody

00:23:53.958 --> 00:23:56.120
knows why we made that change.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.090
So direct response to a
problem, as close to the problem

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:00.230
as possible.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.080
Any change we make is first
tested in a smaller area

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.820
or for a smaller period of
time to see if it works.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.420
And then, all the redesign
is done by the people

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.580
who actually do the work.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.200
And supported by a coach.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.290
This is huge in
lean, need a coach

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.590
who's not directly involved
in that project to help coach

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.682
the people along.

00:24:21.682 --> 00:24:23.640
Now, you've learned about
value stream mapping.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.140
And I'll go through
it a little bit.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.888
We're also going to talk later
today about A3 problem solving.

00:24:27.888 --> 00:24:29.430
And people get a
little bit confused.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:34.310
So I say, OK, the forest
is the value stream map.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.498
And the value stream map
is when you analyze it,

00:24:36.498 --> 00:24:38.540
it is going to point to
where there are problems.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.332
It's not going to tell
you how to fix them.

00:24:40.332 --> 00:24:41.780
It just points to the problems.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.010
A3 problem solving is picking
those trees or those problems

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.610
and pulling them out
and addressing each one.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.770
So you're dissecting
your map and figuring out

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.260
how you're going to
address the problems.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.110
We always use the
scientific method in lean,

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.110
where you always have
to do an observation.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.080
You can't make it
up in your head.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.180
And I always know when
my students have made up

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.660
their value stream map in their
head, because all of their data

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.540
is divisible by 5--

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.840
0, 5, 10 seconds,
not odd numbers.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.400
And change is always done first
as an experiment or a test.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.150
We also use the
Socratic method--

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.050
which healthcare people,
I'm sure you are used

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.150
to as well-- when we ask why.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.380
And we ask, how do you
know how to do your work?

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.380
What's the next thing
that prompts you to do it?

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.940
Why do you do it that way?

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.330
Are there clear signals that
cue you to the next thing?

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.310
Do all workers do the
task the same way?

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.830
So we are going to
constantly be asking why,

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.890
not only to get to root cause,
but to help the people we're

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.840
coaching learn critical
thinking skills as well,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.840
so that they also
start to ask why.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.410
And the basic tenant of Toyota
production system, or lean,

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.890
is to deeply understand how
the work currently happens

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.640
before you try to fix it.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.400
This is really important.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.040
PDCA is the fix it part.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.010
We need a little
preliminary discussion

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.790
about how it is now before we
go to what it's going to be.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.040
And I'll explain that a
little bit better in a minute.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.980
You have to go and
observe, bottom line.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.880
I love Yogi Bear.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.850
He has some of the
most awesome sayings.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.820
You can observe a
lot just by watching.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.810
Taiichi Ono said he challenges--
he challenged people

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.470
to go stand in one
spot for 30 minutes

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.940
and write down 30
things you would

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.440
change that you're looking at.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.160
It's a challenge,
but it's interesting.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.535
I did it in my
kitchen, and I was

00:26:35.535 --> 00:26:39.670
so surprised at how many
things I needed to change.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.220
We talked about gemba,
going to look and see

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.490
at the site with your eyes,
not only collecting data

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.400
but using your qualitative
sense of what's going on.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.660
Experience the environment.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.070
Immerse yourself in it.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.950
Ask questions of the
people you're observing.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.330
Use an observation sheet.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.320
Use spaghetti diagrams,
whatever works for you.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.612
And I'm going to show you a
couple of different methods

00:26:59.612 --> 00:27:00.610
that we used.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.970
We had a client hospital where
they had seven phlebotomists

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:04.882
and four floors.

00:27:04.882 --> 00:27:06.340
And they always
had trouble getting

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.632
their morning blood draws done.

00:27:07.632 --> 00:27:09.460
And a lot of
decisions for the day

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.470
had to do with the
morning blood results.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.650
So we took a look at it.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:15.130
And what happened was the
phlebotomists would come

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.020
to the lab, pick
up some pink slips,

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.420
which were the orders
for labs go to the floor.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.960
So here's the--
lists phlebotomists

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.960
who went to the second
floor, drew three bloods,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.752
went back to the lab,
picked up more slips,

00:27:24.752 --> 00:27:26.050
went to the third floor.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.195
Drew some bloods,
went back to the lab.

00:27:28.195 --> 00:27:30.070
So you can see that
these seven phlebotomists

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.330
were all over the place.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.220
And until we actually
drew this, they

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.215
went, oh, no wonder
it takes us so long.

00:27:36.215 --> 00:27:38.590
We need to figure out how to
get all those slips together

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.140
and one phlebotomist go to
each floor, or maybe two

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.480
if it's a busy floor.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.230
But it was just like
a lot of these things

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:48.398
are you don't even realize
it until you look at it.

00:27:48.398 --> 00:27:49.190
Here's another one.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.800
This is my very first
on my own trauma--

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.723
lean project.

00:27:52.723 --> 00:27:54.140
And I was at a
hospital where they

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.910
wanted to look at trauma
patient throughput.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.320
It was taking
three to four hours

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.720
to get a major trauma
patient through the emergency

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.252
department.

00:28:00.252 --> 00:28:01.460
So we did a number of things.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.290
But one of the things
I wanted to look at

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.870
is once we got the number
of people in the room

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.930
down to a reasonable number,
what were they doing?

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.940
So in order for me
to do this, so I

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.340
had to look at six
different trauma cases,

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.550
and spaghetti map one
individual at a time,

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.747
and then overlay them.

00:28:18.747 --> 00:28:20.330
Spaghetti mapping
can teach you a lot.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.120
What we learned-- what
I learned from this

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.965
is this a nurse in red.

00:28:23.965 --> 00:28:25.340
You can't see the
colors to well.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.860
This nurse was all over
the room and four times

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.210
had to leave the room.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.583
So every time she left the room,
I said, why are you leaving?

00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:34.250
To get meds from the
refrigerator, to go

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.250
get a warm blanket, to
get warm IV [INAUDIBLE],,

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.930
to use the phone because
the phone's busy here.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.510
Looking at the motion,
why did this nurse

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.410
have to go over here?

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.860
Because the supplies he or
she needed was-- weren't here.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.560
Why was there congestion
coming down here?

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.820
Never noticed this before.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.480
We had one trash can,
one phone, and one sink.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.500
Everybody was congregating
to that corner.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.515
So spaghetti mapping
can show you a lot.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.970
And then, this was when
we did a little bit

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:05.670
different observation.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.373
A hospital in rural Maine
was having difficulty

00:29:08.373 --> 00:29:10.540
getting patients through
the nuclear treadmill test.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.440
It took too long.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.930
And these were the
mandatory steps.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:15.860
And then the red is wait times.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.520
So the person who came in--
this is before and after.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.520
The person who came in first
had the longest wait times

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.920
from anybody.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.013
Now, why was that?

00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:26.180
They couldn't figure it out.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.763
And they had one
nuclear medicine tech

00:29:27.763 --> 00:29:30.160
who was getting
blamed for everything.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:30.952
So they came to me.

00:29:30.952 --> 00:29:32.660
They weren't in the
class I was teaching.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.000
But they said, can you help us?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.320
And they said, we did
a value stream map.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.150
And they brought out
this butcher paper

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.605
that went around
three walls of a room

00:29:40.605 --> 00:29:41.730
for their value stream map.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.030
I said, whoa, this is
like input overload.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.870
What we needed to do was
take one patient, and what

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.573
happens to that
one patient, what

00:29:49.573 --> 00:29:50.990
has to happen to
that one patient,

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.418
because everything is timed
in nuclear medicine treadmill.

00:29:53.418 --> 00:29:53.960
They come in.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.800
They get an IV.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.237
They get some dye.

00:29:56.237 --> 00:29:58.070
They get a picture taken
at so many minutes.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.880
Then they have to wait.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.170
Then they go to the treadmill.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:01.460
They have so many
minutes on the treadmill.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.418
Then they have to wait.

00:30:02.418 --> 00:30:04.980
So we met one patient.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.730
And what would happen
with one patient?

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:13.320
When we put that second patient
with the same steps next to it,

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.440
we realized we-- you can't
schedule them at 30 minute

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.230
increments, because that's not
the way it works, for that one

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.920
tech to be able to handle these.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.712
So we started moving these
things to stagger them.

00:30:25.712 --> 00:30:28.170
And what we found out is you
do a little bit of a staggered

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.260
admission, it works better
and that some of the tasks,

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.392
like up here--
where's-- on here,

00:30:33.392 --> 00:30:35.850
[INAUDIBLE] med tech right here
had to be in four different

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.790
places.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.640
No wonder he wasn't
getting his job done.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.940
So what we did was we
looked at what job the med

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.950
tech had that we could
assign to someone else.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.250
So basically, it came
down to three times

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.550
during the schedule a nurse had
to come down and start the IV.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.665
Everything else, he could do.

00:30:54.665 --> 00:30:57.040
What happened, if you look
at-- and the interesting thing

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.810
was this schedule was set up at
the convenience of the doctor,

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:06.260
because they wanted to read
all the results sequentially,

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.200
without thinking about the
patients waiting around

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:09.943
forever.

00:31:09.943 --> 00:31:11.360
So we met with the
doctors as well

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.980
and said, OK, if we spread
these out a little bit,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.060
so you have a few minutes
between, is that OK?

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.100
And they want to try it.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.780
Look what happened
when we did this.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.040
It opened up all of this time.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.100
They were able to schedule five
additional nuclear medicine

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.670
tests a day, by just tweaking
that schedule a little bit.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.198
It's an observation.

00:31:29.198 --> 00:31:31.240
We didn't have to change
how they did their work.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.520
We just had to change how
they scheduled their work

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.230
and some help for the people--

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.570
the one person who was
trying to do it all.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.340
So they thought I
walked on water.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.093
And it wasn't rocket science.

00:31:41.093 --> 00:31:42.760
It was just sitting
down and saying, OK,

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.830
what did it take to get
one patient through,

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.440
and then how do we move
the other patients through?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.190
Then, of course, in
the middle of all this

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.920
with all the excitement of
opening up scheduling spaces,

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.230
because they had lots
of patients in a queue,

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.900
there was a worldwide
shortage of isotope.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.330
So they couldn't put that
many patients through.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:02.060
They couldn't get them--
the dye that they needed.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.940
Anyhow, value stream
mapping, we talked about.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.910
It's the view from 10,000
feet, the big picture, view.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.580
All activities in the value
stream map, once you get it,

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.310
are recognized as value
or non-value added.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.900
And as I said, a
value stream map

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.080
doesn't tell you what to do.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.280
It tells you where
to look for issues.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.010
And it's a springboard
to a future state map.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:24.720
So a value stream map--

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.170
as I said, what we do is we
do-- we divide the value stream

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.820
map into three.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.310
Across the top from right
to left is the request.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.170
All the raise or
request can be made

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.400
for whatever the process is.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.498
Whether it's a phone call,
an email, somebody coming

00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:40.290
and grabbing you in
the hall, all the ways,

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:41.400
a request can be made.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.760
The middle section is the actual
steps to deliver the request.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.260
And then the bottom
was-- is where

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.080
you add your data on how long
each of those process boxes

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.460
takes.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.335
So here's one that just
shows you-- this is--

00:32:52.335 --> 00:32:54.180
I didn't add data to
this yet, but this

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.210
was a patient going from
the emergency department

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.060
to a floor, once the decision
was made for that patient

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.750
to be admitted.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:05.250
So we mapped out the process
of what has to happen

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.697
or what is happening currently.

00:33:06.697 --> 00:33:08.280
And then, we went
back, and looked at,

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.170
and said, where are
all the problem areas?

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:11.530
We call these storm clouds.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.800
So we identified problem areas--

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.260
delayed information to the
nurse, delayed response,

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.880
nurse not available
on the floor.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.860
And each one of
these storm clouds

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.570
now becomes a topic
for A3 problem solving.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.135
So we're going to look at why
is there a delayed response?

00:33:26.135 --> 00:33:27.760
We're going to do,
why is the nurse not

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.810
available on the floor?

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.720
So you can chip away
with six or seven

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.030
A3's to come up with a
really nice new value stream

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:37.430
map that works better.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.670
Value stream map is going
to identify every way

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.030
a request can be made.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:44.140
So this is one that we
did in a trauma system.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.767
This is how the patient
comes to the hospital.

00:33:46.767 --> 00:33:48.350
There's a trauma
patient needing care.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.450
So how do they get there?

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.860
They come by helicopter.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.630
They come by ambulance.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.050
Helicopter radios into
a medical control.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.240
Ambulance calls in or radios
in to medical control.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.000
Medical control then calls
the appropriate hospital,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.890
either by radio or by telephone.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:05.590
So the jagged line is an
electronic communication.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.580
That's the request.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.409
What we forgot to
add in on this one

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:10.960
was the drive by, where the
patient just came in a car

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.172
and they dropped off.

00:34:12.172 --> 00:34:14.380
And then, what you need to
do is look at the request.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.300
Are there any problems
with the request?

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.520
Because a lot of times,
your process is good,

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.929
but the request
is all messed up.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:21.429
And that's where
the problem starts.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:27.500
So remember that you have
to go look at the process

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.241
and capture it.

00:34:28.241 --> 00:34:30.199
I just take notes the
first time I'm observing.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:31.460
I don't try to draw the map.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.389
I take notes.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:34.605
Then I go back to my
office, draw the map,

00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:36.480
and then bring it back
to the people and say,

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.355
did I get this right?

00:34:37.355 --> 00:34:39.500
Did I miss anything?

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.440
Validate your map with
the people doing the work.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.900
That's really an important step.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.520
So in this particular
hospital, these were the steps

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.630
that they identified.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.190
Here comes the trauma patient.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.989
Now, we're ready
to do the process.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.730
So the patients go
to the trauma room

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:53.989
in the emergency department.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:55.489
They have assessments done.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:57.050
They have procedures done.

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.990
They have blood work that's--
or blood that's coming.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.810
They go to imaging for
a CT scan or X-ray.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.970
And then decisions are
made about where they go.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.760
That's how they mapped
out their process.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.620
Value stream maps
are very useful,

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.220
because it helps you understand
every step of the process,

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.230
identify where
there are problems.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.020
It helps you launch
specific problem solving.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.670
If you have a current
state map, you

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.170
can use that to
orient new staff.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:23.520
This is the way we do it.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.495
And it clearly describes the
process to other departments,

00:35:27.495 --> 00:35:29.370
if you're going and
saying, we have a problem

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.490
with the OR and the ED.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:32.940
So let's bring the map
together and take a look at it.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.490
And it also shows
regulatory authorities,

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.180
like Joint Commission
loves these.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.910
If you show them your work in
progress, they're so impressed.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.550
So here's this map.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.490
Once we got it mapped, we
looked at 10 trauma cases.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.350
And we like to do
30 sets of data.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:52.400
But to collect data on
30 major trauma patients

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.650
would have taken way too long.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.650
So we thought 10 would
give us what we needed.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:59.190
We looked at each
process box, 10 patients.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.370
The highest in the trauma
room was 235 minutes,

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.690
almost four hours.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.790
The lowest patient was--
we could get through

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.690
in 36 minutes.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.240
And the average of all
10 was 187 minutes.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.740
So we didn't make
any judgments yet.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.100
We just went through and
mapped how much time.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.260
This time, we used
upside down deltas.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.600
That's our own little quirky
thing in Healthcare West.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.550
Delta means change.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:22.277
So we decided upside down
delta means no change, when

00:36:22.277 --> 00:36:23.110
nothing's happening.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.080
So these are delays.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.600
We did the map, and
then we put in the data.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.790
And then as a team,
we looked at this map

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.810
and said, OK where
do we need to work?

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:34.650
So I said, there's too
much variability here.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.250
We don't know what
we have to do yet,

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.820
but we know we
have to look here.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.810
It takes too long.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:44.330
Too much variability in
how the procedures are done

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.958
or how long it takes that may
be a factor of what procedures

00:36:46.958 --> 00:36:48.000
the patients need or not.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.957
We don't know that yet.

00:36:49.957 --> 00:36:52.040
Once the decision was made,
it was taking too long

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.342
to get the patients to a
bed, more than an hour.

00:36:55.342 --> 00:36:57.050
When they said, this
patient needs to go,

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.133
it took more than an hour.

00:36:58.133 --> 00:37:00.677
So this gave us the basis
for where we were going

00:37:00.677 --> 00:37:01.760
to do our problem solving.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.450
Once you do your
current state, you

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.800
want to draw a future state map.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.730
What do you want
it to look like?

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.130
And this is where
you really need

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.030
to push people, to really push
with, what do you really want?

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.760
Don't just put a Band-Aid
on a leaky trash bag

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.550
and move that trash bag to
somebody else's department.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.430
What do you want?

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.097
And I would say, if
you were the emperor

00:37:23.097 --> 00:37:26.445
or the empress for the day, how
would you want this to look?

00:37:26.445 --> 00:37:27.870
They're like, oh,
we can't do it.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:28.870
I said just put it down.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:30.210
How would you want it to look?

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.668
And then, let's compare your
current state and future state

00:37:32.668 --> 00:37:34.440
and figure out what
problems we have

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.250
to solve to get you
to your future state.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.500
Really important to have
that vision and future state

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:46.130
and to push, push for just
not mediocre but really push.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.130
So this is what happens.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.250
You draw a current state
map with all the ways

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:54.035
a request can be made and
all the process boxes.

00:37:54.035 --> 00:37:55.410
Then you draw a
future state map.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.705
What do you want
it to look like?

00:37:57.705 --> 00:38:00.080
And then, you determine how
do you get from here to here?

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.680
By identifying problems you're
going to solve, so that then,

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.190
when you do that, you have
a new current state map.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.670
And then, you start
all over again.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.410
It's continuous.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:11.785
And you tweak it some more,
and some more, and some more.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.200
When you do particularly
A3, value stream especially

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.690
but particularly A3,
it involves anybody

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:22.310
who has anything
to do with that A3,

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.770
any department has
to be at the table

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.330
when you do the A3
problem solving.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.270
You cannot solve a problem and
then tell another department,

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.420
this is what you're going to do.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.372
They'll totally turn off,
but if they're part of it,

00:38:35.372 --> 00:38:37.080
they come up with some
amazing-- and I'll

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.640
show you some work
that we did where

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.660
some amazing creative
things happened.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.580
And Matthew May-- we use--

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.320
what you have here,
this is the A3 form

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.810
that we use to do a problem.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.310
Matthew May says, if you can't
fit your problem on one page,

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.852
you haven't really
done your thinking

00:38:52.852 --> 00:38:54.060
about what the problem is.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.130
And sometimes, I'll start
doing an A3, and it's too big.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.630
And then I realize I have to
do we call it the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.510
And then we break it
down into smaller ones,

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:03.060
because you really want to
dig into that problem to get

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.032
to root cause and fix it.

00:39:05.032 --> 00:39:06.740
You're going to hear
more about A3 later.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.770
So that's a two-day
workshop for me that we do.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.058
And my corollary
to all of this is

00:39:13.058 --> 00:39:14.850
if you ask the right
questions, the answers

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.067
will usually come easily.

00:39:16.067 --> 00:39:18.150
It's knowing how to ask
the right questions to get

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.060
to root cause, really
important, and not going off

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.365
on these tangents.

00:39:23.365 --> 00:39:24.990
You heard about the
Jefferson Memorial,

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.782
but I'm going to tell
you a little bit more

00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:29.220
in depth about this,
because it's a true story.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.260
The Jefferson Memorial
was having problems

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.810
with cement falling,
and they were

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.210
worried it was going
to injure tourists.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.280
Because it's part of the
National Park System,

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.830
every monument has a manager.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.740
So the whoever was
doing the investigating

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.660
went to the manager
and said, why

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.250
is this cement falling here?

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.548
We have other monuments in the
area, the Lincoln Memorial,

00:39:50.548 --> 00:39:52.590
the Washington Monument,
all around the same age,

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.917
all made with basically
the same material.

00:39:54.917 --> 00:39:57.000
They don't have a problem
with the cement falling.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.040
And the manager said, well, the
reason the cement is falling

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.720
is because the cleaning people
are washing it all the time.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.620
And the soap is mixing
with the jet fuel

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.720
from Reagan Airport, which
is right up the river.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.430
And we think that
the jet fuel is

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:10.560
causing the soap
and-- the combination

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.263
of the soap and the jet fuel
to cause the cement to corrode.

00:40:13.263 --> 00:40:15.180
So he said, we either
need to move the airport

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.400
or change the soap.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.230
So whoever was on this
investigating team said,

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.450
wait a minute.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.250
Let's go ask the people who are
doing the work what's going on.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:26.750
So they went to the
cleaning people.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.950
And they said, you're
cleaning this really often.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:30.920
Why?

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.170
And they said, because there's
pigeon poop everywhere.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:34.080
It looks really bad.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.450
We have tourists.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.990
So they brought in a bird
expert, an ornithologist,

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.940
and said, why is there
pigeon poop here,

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.650
not in the Lincoln Memorial,
not in the Washington Monument,

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:44.480
but here?

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.730
And the bird expert
looked, and he said,

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:50.300
it's because the pigeons are
coming to eat the spiders.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.370
So then, they brought
in an entomologist

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.410
or whatever spider
people are called.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.408
And the spider people--
person looked and said,

00:40:56.408 --> 00:40:57.950
the spiders are
here, because they're

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.740
coming to eat the midges,
these little gnats.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.130
And he said, and the gnats
hatch along the river.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.080
They don't have a
very long half-life.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.760
They hatch in the afternoon.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.630
They fly around.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:09.350
They lay eggs.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.790
The eggs are fertilized.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.280
They have a little
fun time frolicking.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.920
And then right around
dusk, they die.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.290
And they're attracted to light.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.590
So these little midges
saw these lights at the--

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.570
Jefferson Memorial
floodlights came on.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.640
And they would fly there,
and they would frolic,

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.995
and then they'd die.

00:41:26.995 --> 00:41:29.120
And then, the spiders would
come to eat the midges.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.010
The pigeons would come
to eat the spiders.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.150
The pigeons poop.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.620
The cleaning people
were washing.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.905
And the cement was falling.

00:41:35.905 --> 00:41:38.030
What they found out was
the lights on the Jefferson

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.805
Memorial were coming
on an hour earlier

00:41:39.805 --> 00:41:41.180
than any of the
other floodlights

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.130
on the other monuments.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.370
So what did they have to do?

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:48.050
Change the timing of the lights.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.383
So this is the importance of
getting to root cause analysis,

00:41:51.383 --> 00:41:53.800
really getting to root cause,
because the initial reaction

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.238
was we just need
to change the soap.

00:41:56.238 --> 00:41:58.780
So when I work with people, and
they're going off on tangents

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.405
and coming up with ideas without
doing root cause, I would say,

00:42:01.405 --> 00:42:02.950
you're changing the soap.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:06.550
Be disciplined to go through
the steps of A3 in the order

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.330
they're presented, and it will
lead you to the right answer.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.000
If you jump to a solution,
it may or may not

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.810
be the right solution.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.520
So be really careful about that.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.450
Front line workers can do A3's.

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:21.040
They're easy to teach.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.740
They allow the organization
to experiment more,

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.300
get faster results,
because they're

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.370
doing small projects every day.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.560
Learning occurs in
the course of work.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.750
It generates ideas,
and those ideas

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:34.330
can start to be
clusters of ideas.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:38.730
And A3's can be
organization changing.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:39.990
How do you select topics?

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.450
A lot of times, from
the value stream map.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.700
Sometimes, you just observe,
and you see a problem.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.500
And you say, let's
do an A3 on that.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.510
Identify specific
issues, and then you

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.990
just prioritize and begin.

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:53.490
It's a view with a microscope.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.920
It's drilling down
into variation.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.200
It's documenting
problem solving.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.040
And it tells a story visually.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.480
So on an A3, you'll have words,
and you'll have pictures.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.230
It satisfies the people who
are very right-- left brain who

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:08.520
want to see words and numbers.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.830
It satisfies the people
like me who are right brain

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:12.700
and want to see visual.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.520
So it's a combination of both.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.290
And Taiichi Ono, I love him.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:18.730
He's like my
favorite philosopher.

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:20.590
And he was the
president of Toyota.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.080
He said, always temper
immediate knee jerk reaction

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.180
with root cause
analysis, always.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.830
Resist drawing conclusions
based on emotions.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:28.330
This is me.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:30.040
I would say, oh,
patients are dying.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.260
That was my line all
the time, with why

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.670
I needed what I needed.

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.830
Question hearsay and
draw from experience,

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:39.640
but be careful
not to rely on it.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.400
We always, when we do A3,
use a pencil and paper,

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.690
pencil with an eraser.

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:45.400
There are electronic versions.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.647
Save them for later,
because if people

00:43:47.647 --> 00:43:50.230
start doing electronic versions,
it becomes like a video game.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.860
And they're not really paying
attention to the content.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.180
Focus on problem solving.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.490
And also, if I do
an A3, and I'm going

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:01.000
to go meet with the blood
bank, and I bring my A3 ideas

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.610
on paper with pencil
and eraser, it clearly

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.520
gives them the message that we
can change this if we need to.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.170
If I put it in
electronic version,

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.640
it almost gives a message,
please try not to change it;

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.830
I spent a lot of time on this.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:14.930
So pencil/paper,
really important.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.770
I know that sounds
crazy, but it works.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:18.080
It's a non-threatening tool.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:18.940
Here's your A3.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.100
I'm just going to go
through this very quickly.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.450
You have it in front of you.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:26.740
And the left side is all
current state information.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:31.540
The right side is the
equivalent to PDSA, or PDCA.

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.760
So we always deeply understand
the rights-- the left side.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.850
And I'll show you how
to do that before you

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.110
go to the right side.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.810
In my classes that I teach,
I make them fold it back.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.570
And no one is allowed
to touch the right side

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:48.040
until the left side is totally
complete, because if you don't

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.190
follow this incrementally
with discipline,

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:54.050
you're going to wind
up changing the soap.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:56.000
So this will lead
you to where you

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.120
need to go if you have
the discipline to do it.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.840
Let me show you one.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.170
And so you'll see on the left
side the first category's

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:04.848
issue.

00:45:04.848 --> 00:45:07.140
Always state the issue through
the eyes of the customer

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.560
or the patient when you can.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.450
So here's an example.

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.490
This was one that one
of my clients did.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.993
The issue was they had
fiber optic endoscopes that

00:45:13.993 --> 00:45:15.660
weren't available
when they needed them,

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.570
because they were either
broken or being repaired.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.780
Problem, that's the issue.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.550
The next area is the background.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.652
It's like, why is this an issue?

00:45:24.652 --> 00:45:27.110
So explain why it's an issue
if you have some measurements,

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:31.310
like 50% of the time or two out
of four cases this happened.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:32.430
Put that here.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.910
So in their background about
the fiber optic endoscopes,

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:37.040
they said from--
in one year's time,

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.220
they spent $48,400
repairing and replacing

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.040
fiber optic endoscopes.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.640
That's a lot of money.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.460
In the current condition,
you draw a picture,

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.620
stick figure, no rules.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:54.010
Just draw a picture of
what the problem is.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.040
You don't have to be Picasso.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.900
So what they drew is
here's the patient.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.980
Here's the doctor.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.920
Here's the cart with the
endoscopes and big questions,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.590
looking for the endoscopes.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:06.570
Once you draw that
picture, you go back

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.920
and you add storm clouds.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.460
What's wrong with the picture?

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.800
Endoscopes are broken when
they're slammed in drawers

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.160
or dropped on the floor.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.410
Bingo!

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.300
Anesthesiologists are
searching for endoscopes.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.030
They don't know--
excuse me-- if they're

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.940
clean or dirty, because they're
put on the top of the cart.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.338
That's scary.

00:46:24.338 --> 00:46:26.130
And there's a potential
danger to patients.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.650
So once you have
your storm clouds,

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:30.380
you can combine some
of them that are alike.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.990
Then, what happens is you
take those storm clouds,

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:37.890
and they drop down into the
problem analysis section.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:42.220
And each one becomes the
topic for A3 problem solving.

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.500
So you're chipping away
at what the issue is here.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.170
Now, they combined
some of theirs.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:50.190
So in the problem
section, problem analysis,

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.190
you're going to ask the
what's called five whys.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.560
Keep asking why until
you get to root cause.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.370
You may only have
to ask it twice.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:00.310
You may have to ask it 10
times, but you keep going.

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:05.580
One of the things that I learned
when you ask why is we indent.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.500
The anesthesiologist
wastes time searching

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.940
for fiber optic endoscopes.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.690
Why?

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.600
Because fiber optic endoscopes
are not always available.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.540
For me, before I ask
the next why, I say,

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:20.238
why are fiber optic
endoscopes not available?

00:47:20.238 --> 00:47:22.030
Because they're broken
when they're slammed

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:23.233
in drawers or drawers.

00:47:23.233 --> 00:47:25.900
Why are they broken when they're
slammed in drawers and drawers?

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.375
Because there's no
designated place.

00:47:28.375 --> 00:47:30.580
You know you have
a root cause when

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.170
you have an actionable item.

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:35.820
There's no designated place.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.480
On the other side, we're going
to make a designated place.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.900
So you indent your whys as you
follow that train of thought.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.970
Now there's a second
train of thought

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.990
under the anesthesiologists
wasting time.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.490
Why?

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.200
Because they're placed
on top of the cart

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.770
before and after procedures.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:51.270
Why?

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:53.730
Because there's no way to tell
if they're clean or dirty.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:54.270
Why?

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:56.310
Because there's no
designated location.

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:59.220
So sometimes, your root causes
can come out to the same thing.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.750
Sometimes, you have
different ones.

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:02.367
And then, it's a
danger to patients,

00:48:02.367 --> 00:48:04.200
that storm cloud from
above, because there's

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.270
confusion as to which
ones are clean or dirty.

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.930
Why?

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:08.970
Because there's no
designated location for

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:10.590
cleans and dirties.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:12.820
See what's happening here?

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.833
You've got your
driver for what you're

00:48:15.833 --> 00:48:17.250
going to do in
your countermeasure

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:19.630
on the other side.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.190
Root causes are actionable.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.670
And most of the time root causes
are because of violation rule

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.370
number one, not
specified how we do it.

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:29.890
I would say 80% to
90% of the time that's

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:34.600
why you have a problem,
not been specified.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:39.050
So once you complete the left
side, you go to the right side.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:42.110
Do not jump to the right
side, because the left side

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.610
is giving you information.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.010
Stupidity is having an
answer for everything.

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.810
The left side gives
you the answer.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:49.430
Wisdom is having a question.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:54.603
The left side forces you
to ask those questions.

00:48:54.603 --> 00:48:57.020
Remember, thousands of people
saw the apple fall, but only

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:57.800
Newton asked why.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.080
We need to start asking why.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.840
So here's the whole
A3 that they did.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.980
This was a real one.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.070
They had their counter--
their root causes over here.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.530
They drew a picture of what
they wanted it to look like.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:12.470
And they put fluffy
clouds about what's

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:15.560
good about this new picture
that what they wanted

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.290
was a cart that had two
separate places for endoscopes,

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:19.460
clean and dirty.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.060
On the external part of the
cart, they had dirty and clean

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.060
were identified.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:24.770
They saved money.

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.930
And it was safer for patients.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.090
So the countermeasures--
how do you--

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:30.990
what are you doing
with these root causes?

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:33.530
They were going to put two
tubes on the side of the cart

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.270
and identify clean and dirty.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.370
They also had the
contextual processing

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:40.350
on how they would keep
those tubes clean.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.140
Once you have your
countermeasures identified,

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.742
what's the plan to implement
those countermeasures?

00:49:45.742 --> 00:49:46.700
What's going to happen?

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.158
Who's going to do
it, by what date,

00:49:48.158 --> 00:49:50.280
and what's the outcome
accountability?

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.890
Then, you also have to say,
OK, if we do this project, what

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:54.750
is it going to cost?

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.032
And if we do this project,
what are the benefits we're

00:49:57.032 --> 00:49:57.990
going to get out of it?

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:01.072
Because that's how you sell
this to an administration.

00:50:01.072 --> 00:50:02.530
Then, how are you
going to test it?

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.822
So they decided they were
going to test it for-- on one

00:50:04.822 --> 00:50:07.020
cart for a couple of weeks.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.450
The first day they
retrofitted the cart,

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:12.770
all the other anesthesiologists
wanted the same thing.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.360
They didn't want
to wait two weeks,

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.920
because it was just brilliant.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.470
And the follow-up was
for the next six months,

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:23.100
they had zero broken
fiber optic endoscopes.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.670
That's A3 problem solving.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:25.545
Where can you use it?

00:50:25.545 --> 00:50:28.930
Use A3 thinking to do
specific problem solving.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:31.740
If you're doing a redesign
of a department or process,

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:32.590
you can use it.

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:35.280
You can document changes
for regulatory bodies.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.560
I like this for capital
equipment requests.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.810
Do an A3 and tell me what
your current state is

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:41.040
and why you need it.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.990
You can use it to run a meeting.

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.800
What's the issue?

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.770
What's the background?

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:47.400
Let's get to some root cause
and then come out with a plan.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.590
Facility design is being--
it's being used a lot

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:50.980
now to redesign new facilities.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.850
And it's endless what
you can use these for.

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:57.300
Here's an ambulance coming
in with a trauma patient.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.660
Problem-- I've got
two trauma patients.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.912
And look at the mob
of people there.

00:51:06.912 --> 00:51:09.120
And if I had sound, there's
all these people talking,

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.930
and there's incredible
noise and cacophony.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:12.060
It's horrible.

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.230
This is my scene.

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:14.100
I've got a problem.

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.600
I have trouble
moving these patients

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.620
through the department.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.430
So what we did was
we did-- again,

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:20.430
this is a different emergency
department from what I showed

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.940
you--

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.240
the requests for the service
and then the actual service.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.660
In this department, they decided
to have three process boxes--

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.790
the trauma assessment
and intervention,

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.470
moving them out to
imaging, and then

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.620
coming back to the
ED for disposition--

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.360
and then disposition.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.420
So that didn't look too bad,
pretty simple value stream map.

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.890
But then we started adding data.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.260
And holy mackerel.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.440
Look at this data.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.250
You're dying three hours.

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:52.490
Then, you have to wait 37
minutes till the transport's

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:54.380
ready to take you to X-ray.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:58.180
Then you get to X-ray,
and it takes over an hour.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.940
Then you wait again for them
to bring you back to the ER.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.760
Then you wait again for the
docs to make a decision.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.320
And then you wait for the bed.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.422
So they decided that there
were a bunch of things here--

00:52:08.422 --> 00:52:09.130
I can't see this.

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:11.013
Can this go down a
little bit lower?

00:52:11.013 --> 00:52:11.900
AUDIENCE: No.

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.810
SUSAN SHEEHY: OK.

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:15.310
What we did then was we said
we know we have a problem here.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:16.640
We don't know what it is.

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.640
So we had to go
back in and look.

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.960
We did more observation.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.570
And what we found is there were
too many people in the room.

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.450
There were no defined roles
of the people in the room.

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:27.070
We had missing equipment.

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:28.820
There were lots of students.

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.940
We love students, but
they were taking up space.

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.110
So you couldn't move.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:35.350
Poor documentation, poor
communication between the OR

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.975
and the ICU, delays in getting
O negative blood, John and Jane

00:52:38.975 --> 00:52:41.350
Doe patients that we couldn't
do anything with until they

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:43.730
were registered, X-ray delays.

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:46.780
So all of those things
dropped down and became topics

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:47.920
for A3 problem solving.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.020
And we systematically
went through this,

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:54.040
and waiting for an X-ray
read became a topic for A3.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.960
Slow decision making
became a topic.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.620
We had 14 A3's that we
were going to do with this.

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:01.480
And they involved all
different departments.

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.280
This is what we wanted
it to look like.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.430
So I said, why does a patient
come from ED into imaging

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:07.750
and then back to ED?

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:10.850
Make a decision in imaging, so
they can go right to their bed.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.690
So what they wanted it to
look like was time in the ER,

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.550
time in imaging, go.

00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:18.790
They wanted it to be under 60
minutes here, under 10 minutes

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:20.380
here, for a total
time of 70 minutes.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:21.772
That was their
future state plan.

00:53:21.772 --> 00:53:23.980
How they were going to get
there, we didn't know yet,

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.830
but we were going to deal
with those 15 or 14 A3's.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:30.680
And these were all the good
things about this new map.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.870
So you have a vision about
where you want to go to.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:36.370
So I know you can't read these,
but I just want to show you.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:40.138
This was registering a John and
Jane Doe patients, one topic.

00:53:40.138 --> 00:53:40.930
Here's the patient.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:42.400
The picture was
here's the patient,

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.537
blood pressure 70 over 40.

00:53:43.537 --> 00:53:44.620
They're bleeding to death.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.640
Big stop sign.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.390
Because they don't
have a hospital number,

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.628
we can't get X-rays,
lab, blood, or CT.

00:53:49.628 --> 00:53:51.670
And here's the nurse
[INAUDIBLE] out there trying

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:53.560
to find out the patient's ID.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.850
And here's a tombstone.

00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:55.930
I love dramatic pictures.

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:59.050
The patient's going to die if
we don't do the right thing.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:01.600
We put in storm clouds about
what's wrong with this picture,

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.430
did root cause analysis.

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:07.300
We worked on this A3 with
legal and the admissions

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:08.920
and registration
people and the ED

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.340
together and came out with a
plan for preassigned trauma

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.088
numbers.

00:54:13.088 --> 00:54:14.380
You didn't have to have a name.

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:15.670
If you came in and you
didn't have a name,

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:17.890
you became trauma 101, and
you had a piece of tape

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:18.530
on your head.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:22.787
And every single thing that we
process for you was trauma 101.

00:54:22.787 --> 00:54:25.120
Then, when we found out your
name, we merged it with it.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.440
So it worked really well.

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:30.400
This is one with too
many people in the room.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.230
So we had to figure
out what to do.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.340
We wanted to have a team.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.757
We also wanted to figure out
what to do with the students.

00:54:35.757 --> 00:54:38.950
So part of the process was
to limit the number of people

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:41.890
in the room by team
assignment and then

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:44.590
have the students-- there was a
classroom right down the hall.

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:47.637
We mounted an overhead
camera over the top,

00:54:47.637 --> 00:54:49.720
so that they could see and
hear what was going on.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.220
They liked it
better, because they

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.470
said they could see
better, real time,

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:54.760
watching the trauma patient.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.000
And we were able to get it
down to five or six people

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:58.840
most of the time.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.520
Everybody brought their
buddies with them, though,

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.520
when there was a trauma.

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.113
We also had issues
with overhead page

00:55:03.113 --> 00:55:04.280
when a trauma was coming in.

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.460
So we did away with that,
because the whole world

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.330
would come, because
they wanted to see.

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:08.830
Yeah?

00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:10.690
AUDIENCE: Don't you have
a privacy issue with that?

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:11.200
SUSAN SHEEHY: With what?

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:12.862
SUSAN SHEEHY: Yeah.

00:55:12.862 --> 00:55:14.620
We actually met with
legal about that.

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.870
We didn't videotape them.

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:18.910
The students were
allowed to be there.

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:21.610
And so the room was
locked, and they

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:23.440
signed a privacy agreement.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.302
And then, every once in a while,
we would tape the scenario,

00:55:28.302 --> 00:55:30.010
and we used it at
morbidity and mortality

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:30.970
rounds, which is legal.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.762
It's not discoverable
in court, and then we

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:34.072
destroyed the tapes afterwards.

00:55:34.072 --> 00:55:35.530
So we met with the
legal department

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:39.003
to give us advice
on how to do this,

00:55:39.003 --> 00:55:40.670
because you can do a
lot with teach it--

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:43.370
for teaching purposes.

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:45.920
This one was not the right
supplies or equipment

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.700
in the room.

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.520
We met with this equipment
people in central stores.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.340
And they actually agreed to
put together exchange carts

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.610
that they would manage,
which was really cool.

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:57.980
But because central
stores volunteered

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.870
to do the exchange carts, we
didn't tell them to do it.

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.000
It worked really well.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.220
Then we wound up having to
have two exchange carts,

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:07.280
because one made everybody
still run all around the room.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.480
And we decided to divide the
equipment into side A, side B.

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.230
And they took it
when it was done.

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:14.360
They had backup carts.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.350
They stocked it.

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:17.250
And they recorded
everything they used.

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:18.380
We never had missing stuff.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:25.280
O negative blood,
my favorite one,

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.900
difficulty getting
O negative blood.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.200
We had patients who were dying.

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.230
This was a knife and
gun club community.

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:32.690
The blood bank was
across the street.

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:34.760
It was closed at 5
o'clock at night.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.730
And the nursing supervisor
had to go get a key,

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:37.980
and go in, and find the blood.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:38.840
It was a mess.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.400
So we sat down with blood bank.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.735
And they said, why don't
we put two refrigerators,

00:56:43.735 --> 00:56:45.110
one on each of
your trauma rooms?

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:47.568
We'll bolt them to the floor,
because things had a tendency

00:56:47.568 --> 00:56:49.460
to walk in this department.

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.530
We'll put four units
of O negative blood

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:52.642
in each refrigerator.

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:53.600
We'll put a lock on it.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.460
And we will come
every day and check it

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.742
for an expiration date.

00:56:57.742 --> 00:57:00.200
And if it's getting close,
we'll put it back into the main.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.033
Now, if we went to the
blood bank, and said,

00:57:02.033 --> 00:57:04.010
we want you to put
refrigerators in our room,

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:05.425
we want you to put 4 negative--

00:57:05.425 --> 00:57:07.550
4 units of blood, and we
want you to come and check

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:09.680
it every day, they
would say, go away.

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.140
But because we sat at
the table together,

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.730
they offered to do this.

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:17.750
There were a number of other
A3's about obtaining X-rays

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:20.840
and communication breakdowns.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.670
And so what happened
after all of this--

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:25.640
it took about six months
of really intensive work--

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:29.210
almost six months to the day,
we had our first trauma patient

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:32.840
through in 60
minutes, not 70, 60.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.790
And there was a massive
celebration throughout

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:37.207
the whole hospital with every
department that was involved

00:57:37.207 --> 00:57:38.240
in any of these A3's.

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.782
We sent cakes to
all the departments.

00:57:39.782 --> 00:57:41.448
They were just-- it
was on the bulletin.

00:57:41.448 --> 00:57:42.290
It was everywhere.

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:45.048
Pretty proud team that
did this together.

00:57:45.048 --> 00:57:47.090
What we didn't do, and
which we should have done,

00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:48.440
was tracked outcomes.

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.560
We did that later.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.352
But in this one, we didn't.

00:57:51.352 --> 00:57:52.450
I'm going to move quick.

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:55.270
This is about rental
isolettes in a hospital that

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:57.310
had capacity for 12.

00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:58.960
They usually had an
average of eight.

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.870
So they had 10 of
their own isolettes.

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:04.270
And then, they had
to rent two any time

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:05.998
they had like twins
or triplets born.

00:58:05.998 --> 00:58:08.290
What happened was they rented
the exact same isolettes,

00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:09.940
so everybody would be
familiar with them.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.500
And they didn't mark
them as rentals.

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.610
So when they were
done with them,

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:13.810
they put them in the storeroom.

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:15.280
And every day they
stayed in the storeroom,

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.680
the hospital was paying money
for those rental isolettes

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.060
that weren't being used.

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.510
So they spent about $35,000
more than they needed to

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:23.470
on rental isolettes.

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:26.470
And we do that with bariatric
equipment and Clinitron beds

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:27.130
all the time.

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:28.960
So they came up with
a really nice method

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.120
with biomedical
engineering how to do that.

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.280
Lean for facility design--

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.140
I'm going to finish in
a couple of minutes--

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:36.460
this is a new thing for us.

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.877
In the last year
and a half, we've

00:58:37.877 --> 00:58:40.060
been getting called by
architects and designers,

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.060
because in the request for
proposal for new buildings,

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:45.932
the hospitals are asking them
to please have a lean component.

00:58:45.932 --> 00:58:47.890
Most hospitals don't know
what that even means.

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:50.230
But they said, we want it lean.

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:51.440
So we've been getting calls.

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.600
So what happens
is we have them--

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.840
we work with the
hospitals in advance

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.600
to identify their current
problem areas, department

00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.620
by department.

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.330
We map their current
and future states

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.970
of what they want it to
look like and help them then

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:06.100
design their A3's to fix it.

00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:09.310
And then that information
informs the design team

00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:12.640
about how to make the design,
rather than making a design

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.530
and then trying to fit
the work into the design.

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:17.470
So we have a process
methodology where

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:20.590
we do current state,
interviews, utilization surveys.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:25.120
We identify problem processes
in given departments.

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.630
We map the states.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:27.880
We do future state.

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.130
We do A3 problem
solving with them.

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:33.340
And then the future state
maps inform the design team.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:36.010
And then the design team
will take that information,

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:36.880
create a design.

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.610
And then they bring a big floor
layout with puzzle pieces.

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:42.460
And we allow the staff
to move things around

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:45.280
to see how it would work
using their processes.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.173
It's pretty cool.

00:59:46.173 --> 00:59:47.590
And then, some of
the design teams

00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:50.890
actually do-- rent a warehouse
and do big gigantic real size

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:54.950
mock-ups.

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:56.840
Here's an example
in the emergency

00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.680
department, a bunch of
problems that they identified.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.010
These are the big issues.

01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:04.880
So let's look at boarding
and how that informs design.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.510
So with boarding patients, these
are the A3's that they did.

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:11.030
No patient beds, waiting
for diagnostic results,

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.250
in patient discharge
scheduling was a problem,

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:16.250
waiting for specialists,
and equipment availability.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:19.670
So then, with design, we
picked one of those, no beds

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:21.020
available.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.030
And we then did
some more digging

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:25.910
to see how design could
support fixing this

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:27.500
based on the A3 they did.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:30.380
So can we consider a
transition to admission unit,

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:33.380
do some care centered care, not
everybody has to be in a bed?

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.420
Can we do teleconferencing
with consultants,

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.840
because we're waiting
for them to come in?

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.382
Can we bring the
computer in the room

01:00:38.382 --> 01:00:40.790
and do a Skype conference
with the patient?

01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:42.950
Can we do some real
time bed tracking,

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.600
which wasn't happening?

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.690
And then, can the design
team also select finishes

01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:51.200
that led to quicker cleaning?

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.660
So we take each one step
by step and deal with it.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.700
Here's another one with OR.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.710
Lots of issues in the OR.

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:02.650
Then, the one that
we highlight here

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:05.080
is room turnaround
time in the OR is huge.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.090
So what are the things
that prevent the room

01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:08.590
from being turned around?

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:10.970
These are all A3's
that we worked on.

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:12.250
So let's take the top one.

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.860
Anesthesiologist is not ready.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.420
So how can we inform the
design team about that?

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:22.080
Well, because the
anesthesiologist office space

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.980
wasn't near the preoperative--
the perioperative and surgery

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.670
suite.

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:29.160
The perioperative suite
and the surgery suites

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.475
were not close together.

01:01:30.475 --> 01:01:32.850
The proximity-- he always had
to go to the family waiting

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:34.320
room, that was not nearby.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.630
So how do you design
that so that this person,

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:40.050
not a-- a case cannot start
unless this anesthesiologist is

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:40.650
in the room.

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:43.900
So how do we make the
design make this happen?

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.180
So this all informs design.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.000
It's pretty cool.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.610
It's a lot of fun.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:51.150
And the keys in design are
participation from everyone

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.880
in the staff, valuing
everybody's input.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.040
Anything goes in the room.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.540
We respect employees,
patients' families,

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.990
staff across the
board, collaboration

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:02.200
between departments.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.900
So if we're working
on an OR thing,

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:07.750
but it involves an ER
transfer or transport,

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:11.490
they come to the table and work
on that same project together.

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:15.540
And then, this becomes our
patient, not your patient.

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.840
And then, a total commitment
from administration.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.460
We always do a
report all at the end

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.200
of each day with
administration present

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.150
to show them what
they've come up with.

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:27.480
And then, empowering staff to
make those decisions, really

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.065
important.

01:02:28.065 --> 01:02:29.940
These are just some of
the things we've done.

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:33.672
There's thousands of them.

01:02:33.672 --> 01:02:35.130
But I want to just
show you that it

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.930
can go anywhere
across the hospital

01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:40.590
with value stream mapping and
A3's, from med reconciliation

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.950
to we had problems with DNR
orders, or fast-tracks, or lab

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:45.630
turnaround times,
or poor signage,

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:50.500
or cluttered halls, wrong
site surgeries, coding issues.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.590
We can work anywhere, anywhere.

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:57.712
Let the staff tell you
where their problems are.

01:02:57.712 --> 01:02:59.420
One of the things
that's really important

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.260
is if you're going to prepare
an organization for culture

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.760
change, you really
have to prepare

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.500
the soil for those seeds.

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.050
So that means working
with senior leadership,

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:11.150
we do lots of work
with senior leadership,

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:13.010
overview of what lean is.

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:16.130
We spend a day just doing
planning for rollout of lean.

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:17.600
Who's going to be on that team?

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.938
Who are the lean champions?

01:03:18.938 --> 01:03:21.230
You need to make sure there's
some physicians involved.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.300
And they're the hardest
group to get involved, not

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.425
because they don't want to
be, but because of time.

01:03:25.425 --> 01:03:27.480
And then, who are
the informal leaders?

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.855
There are going
to be people that

01:03:28.855 --> 01:03:31.370
start to rise to the
service, managers and staff.

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:33.340
So you need a lean coordinator.

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.090
If you don't have a
lean coordinator who's

01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:36.710
going to follow up
on these projects

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:39.140
and make sure they're working
and make sure people have

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.160
what they want, it's
not going to work.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.030
So that lean coordinator,
or one, or two, or 10,

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:46.220
are really important.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:48.340
And instead of telling
people what to do,

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.530
we're now saying no one knows
this job better than you do.

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:53.480
How can I help you?

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.760
Different way of thinking.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.560
Healthcare has to be a place
where good enough never is.

01:04:02.857 --> 01:04:04.940
When you ask for change,
though, you need to know,

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.648
because you have to
be a little bit gutsy

01:04:06.648 --> 01:04:10.940
to be a lean proponent, make
sure it's change that matters,

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.830
because change is scary.

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:16.900
And a lot of people are not
going to like it at first.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.130
And I like this one too.

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:19.690
This is an Air Force mantra.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.640
If you're taking
too much flak, you

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.750
know you're definitely
over a high value target.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:28.290
So my advice to you is so when
you're taking a lot of flak,

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:30.930
either put your flak jacket
on and stay the course

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:32.530
or go choose another project.

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:34.970
It's your call.

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:37.760
Why does lean fail in hospitals?

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.185
Lack of leadership commitment
is the biggest one--

01:04:40.185 --> 01:04:42.060
when they just hire you
to come in and do it,

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.370
but they're not committed.

01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:47.120
Inadequate resources, incomplete
lean education of the staff.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.735
This is so important that there
are no expectations placed

01:04:50.735 --> 01:04:52.610
on the staff that this
is the way we're going

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:54.230
to do business from now on.

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:56.930
And the absence of teamwork
and the presence of siloes.

01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:59.870
This is why lean fails.

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:00.710
This is interesting.

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:04.250
In 2004 Olympics
in Athens, the US 4

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:06.200
by 100 relay teams,
men and women,

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.660
were projected to be
by far and away better

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.550
than anybody else in the world.

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:14.660
They failed, both teams,
because they were all

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.100
good at what they did, but
the handoffs were not good,

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.580
the baton handoff.

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.580
Missed timing, dropped baton.

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:27.940
It's really important to
synchronize those handoffs.

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.070
No matter how good
you are individually,

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:34.570
if your team isn't working
well, it's going to fail.

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:36.520
So ending with what
I started with.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.310
Matthew may said, lean doesn't
light a fire under people.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:40.990
It lights a fire within people.

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:43.450
And it's so exciting
to watch a kitchen

01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:46.840
worker, or a housekeeper,
or a security guard come up

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.900
with ideas and be so proud of
the ideas they come up with

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.680
and own it.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.790
And they become a
part of that team.

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:57.100
So I challenge you, because Walt
Disney said, why do we do this?

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.300
He said, it's fun to
do the impossible.

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.850
And I think that's what
we're facing in healthcare.

01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:04.880
So let's fix what's
wrong with healthcare.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.830
Just to show you, we
do have some resources.

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.060
If you want to go
to our website,

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.860
we have some books,
some training sessions.

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.210
We have some courses coming up.

01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:12.320
We've got a conference.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.780
Please go on the website
and check out anything.

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:15.680
And I'll be here.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.687
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:16.687 --> 01:06:18.312
SUSAN SHEEHY: I have
them here if you--

01:06:18.312 --> 01:06:20.570
Oh, and if anybody is
interested in a facility design,

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.470
I brought a few articles.

01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:22.928
I didn't have enough
for everybody,

01:06:22.928 --> 01:06:24.950
but it's about St. Anthony's
in Pendleton Oregon

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:26.750
and how we did the
facility design there.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:28.650
So if you want them,
I'll just pass them on.

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:29.775
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Susan.

01:06:29.775 --> 01:06:33.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:21.800
PROFESSOR: --

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.760
All the things would be
relevant, so here are some

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.870
examples from a couple
of lectures ago.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.035
And so here we're thinking about
what happens when we add

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:30.330
an inert gas.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.040
And remember, it's all about
the partial pressure.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.290
So, you always have to ask
yourself did the partial

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.290
pressure change, and partial
pressure's going to change if

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.740
there's a change in volume.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.115
So, the secret in this problem
is realizing that if inert gas

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:48.060
is added, and the total pressure
is kept constant,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.980
what had to have happened?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.660
Yup, the volume would have had
to increase, and so the system

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.950
is put at stress, and it
responds in a way to minimize

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.880
the stress.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.330
So it's going to respond in a
way to go from fewer numbers

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.700
of molecules to more
molecules.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.070
So, on one side of the equation
reactants there are

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.990
three, and on products there
are two, so it's going to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.930
shift toward reactants.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.350
All right.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.420
So today we're going to have
another clicker competition,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.680
and because it is Halloween,
this is the prize for the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.450
recitation that has the
most correct answers.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:39.800
So, let's see how we do today.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.830
All right.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.890
So we're going to continue
where we left off on

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.570
Wednesday, and so these
are your notes --

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.020
I've added them to today's
handout and they're also in

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.870
the handout from
the last class.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.220
And I want to make a note that
it's a good idea to start this

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.710
problem-set early.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.930
You don't know everything you
need to know to do the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.700
problem-set, but you do know a
number of them, so there's

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.340
some questions on thermodynamics
and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.710
equilibrium, and Le Chatelier's
principle, you can

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.740
do all those problems. So next
week -- today we're going to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.240
talk about bases and buffers,
and then we're going to move

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.120
into acid-base titrations
on Monday.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.530
And so, the problem-set looks
like it's not that long, it's

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.910
not that many questions, but the
acid-base titrations have

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.830
many parts, and each part
is actually quite long.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.720
So it's a very deceptive
problem-set.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.090
So don't be fooled by the total
number of questions.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.460
All right, so we were talking
about acid and water and base

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.700
and water and p h, and so we're
going to continue with

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.150
base and water right now.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.740
So here we have a base in water,
and so in this case,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.810
the water is acting
as an acid.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.590
It's giving up a hydrogen ion
or proton to the n h 3,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.070
causing it to form its
conjugate, n h 4 plus, ammonia

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.550
ion, and also hydroxide ion.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.460
So here we have a base in water,
and when we're talking

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.650
about a base in water, we're
going to talk about base

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.870
ionization constant, or k b.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.960
So at the end of last class
we talked about the acid

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.650
ionization constant, or k a, and
when you're talking about

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.750
bases, you're going to
talk about k b's.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.220
So, k b, it's an equilibrium
constant for this reaction of

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.010
a base in water, and so it'll be
equal to the products in h

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.890
4 plus and hydroxide ion over
the reactant, n h 3.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.040
The water is the solvent here,
and since this is all pretty

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.985
dilute, it's mostly pure and its
concentration isn't going

00:03:56.985 --> 00:03:58.930
to change, so it's
not included in

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.270
that equilibrium constant.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.240
So we have a k b when we're
talking about a base in water.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.910
And we were talking about a base
in water, the equation

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.340
should work that you
have hydroxide ions

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.090
on one side of it.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.640
So here, the k b is 1 .

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.780
8 times 10 to the minus 5 at 25
degrees, so that's a fairly

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.810
small number.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.480
And so the small value tells us
that only a little bit of

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.940
the n h 3 is going to ionize
when it's in solution.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.580
So only a little bit it's going
to form n h 4 plus and

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.490
hydroxide ions.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.240
So that's what that small
number tells us.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.650
So that tells us that it's
going to be a weak base.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.470
So a strong base is something
that's going to react pretty

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.210
much completely to go to
hydroxide ion concentration.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.980
A weak base only ionizes
a little bit in water.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.060
And you can tell about whether
something's strong or weak by

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.750
its k b value, or if it's
an acid, it's k a

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.700
value or p k a value.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.080
So here are some general ways
to write these equations.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.830
We have a base in water and so
the water's going to act as

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.200
the acid, base is going to
accept that proton or hydrogen

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.790
ion forming a base, h plus,
and hydroxide ion.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.180
So the base is just
written as b.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.540
You could also write the base as
a minus, something a minus

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.480
in water going to h a
plus hydroxide ion.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.960
So sometimes you might see that
when you're talking about

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.290
a conjugate base
of a weak acid.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.980
So these are two expressions
that you'll see that are

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.280
fairly generic that expresses
what happens when you have

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.490
bases in water.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.740
Now remember, you know it's a
base in water, you better have

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.280
hydroxide ions on the other
side, because a base in water

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.080
is going to be forming hydroxide
ions, and acid in

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.750
water would be forming
hydronium ions.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:01.530
So, a strong base, again, almost
completely ionizes to o

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.000
h when in water, and here we can
know what's strong or weak

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.060
by the k b, so the larger the
k b the stronger the base.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.930
And like there is the p k a,
there's also a term p k b.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.070
P k b is minus log of the k b.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.060
And the larger the p k b,
the weaker the base.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.530
Now you won't see
p k b very much.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.930
It's not used very much,
most things are

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.880
converted to a p k a.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.900
So you'll see p k a's quite a
bit, and you will see p k a's

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.630
if you take organic chemistry,
if you take biochemistry, if

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.010
you take biology, you'll be
hearing a lot about p k a's as

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.830
we go along.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.060
Not so much about p k
a's, but p k b's.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.110
And so what I want you to do
when you hear about p k a's,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.510
is remember that you've
learned about it.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.470
Because I have been confronted
by some of my colleagues who

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.050
teach in advanced levels, and
they said our students tell us

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.050
that you never talked about p
k a's in freshman chemistry.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.910
And I assure them that I did.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.500
So I'll be emphasizing this.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.510
And so I want to make sure that
by the end of this unit

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.020
you're really familiar with p k
a's because you'll need them

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.940
later on, and I want you to
really impress my colleagues

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.350
in later classes, and they'll
say oh, that's a 511-1

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.090
student, of course, they
know what a p k a is.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.460
Even my six month old daughter
who's over there, she's like

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.730
what, people didn't know
what a p k a is?

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:34.080
You don't want to
get her upset.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.650
OK.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.110
So all of these things are
related with the acids and the

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.470
bases, because for every acid it
has a conjugate base, every

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.520
base is a conjugate acid.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.350
And so, if you have a stronger
acid, the stronger the acid,

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.620
the weaker its conjugate base.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.620
And the stronger the base, the
weaker its conjugate acid.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.580
And this becomes very important
in doing these

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.910
problems. So here's a
little table that

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.900
emphasizes that fact.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.080
So we talk about
a strong acid.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.840
Most people are familiar with
h c l, hydrochloric acid.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.610
So it's a very strong acid.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.540
And its conjugate base, c l
minus, is not really a base,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.960
it's completely ineffectual
as being a base.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.630
It doesn't really do
anything at all.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.720
A strong acid really drives you
all the way to hydronium

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.030
ion concentrations.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.020
It doesn't go back the other
way, it's not really

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.660
equilibrium, it's just going
to completion there.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.660
So the conjugate is really,
really weak, basically not a

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.790
base at all.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.860
Then we get into this middle
range and here things that are

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.820
moderately weak or very weak
acids also have their

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.100
conjugates in the weak range.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.810
But if you get to something
that is a very strong base

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.560
down here, its conjugate is
going to be also ineffective

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.700
as an acid.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.980
So if something is very strong,
its conjugate is

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.170
pretty much non-existent in
those properties, but when you

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:07.390
have weak-weak, then you can
start talking about buffers,

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.470
which we're going to get into
later in today's class.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.220
OK.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:18.230
So let's prove that, in fact, it
has to be true that there's

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.560
a relationship between the
conjugate acid and its

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.270
conjugate base or conjugate base
and its conjugate acid,

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.730
that they both can't
be strong.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.080
One has to be -- you have to
be weak-weak, strong or

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.320
ineffectual.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.380
All right, so let's look at
the first one up here.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.400
So first let's look at what
is this acting as?

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.730
What is n h 3 acting
as, an acid or a

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.950
base in this equation?

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.750
So it's acting as a base.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.150
And that means water is
acting as an acid.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.190
The water gives up a proton or
hydrogen ion to the n h 3

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:02.630
forming the conjugate
acid of that base.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.890
And then the conjugate base
is the hydroxide ion.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:14.390
All right, so now let's write
term for k, and so we're

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:20.120
talking about a base in water,
so we're talking about k b.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:29.420
So k b is going to equal what
-- what do I put up here?

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.020
Tell me one thing
to put up there.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.490
Yup.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:46.350
OK, n h 4 plus, and hydroxide
ion over n h 3.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.720
OK, so we don't have
water in there.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:11:02.540
All right, so let's look
at the next reaction.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.850
So what is n h 4
plus acting as?

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:11.060
It's acting as an acid here, so
it's giving up its proton

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.640
or hydrogen ion to the water,
which is going to act as a

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.170
base and accept that
hydrogen atom.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:21.790
And when this gives up its
hydrogen ion or proton, it

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:27.380
forms its conjugate base, and
the water is conjugate here,

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.960
is an acid, hydronium ion.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.320
So we have our conjugate
acid base pairs here.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.710
So now am I talking about
a k a or a k b?

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.550
I'm talking about a k a, so I'm
talking about an acid in

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.640
water, and we know this is an
acid in water if we look at

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.100
what's happening over here.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.900
So we have an acid in water,
and so we'll put our

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.280
concentration of hydronium
ions and n h

00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:04.470
3 over n h 4 plus.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.290
So now we have k a's and k b's
written for the conjugates,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:15.480
the conjugate acid of n
h 3 and n h 3 itself.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:21.860
So now, we can think about what
happens if we take these

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:27.600
k's and we multiply
them out together.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:39.300
All right, so we have a
k a and we have a k b.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.200
All right, so we have a k a and
a k b, so if we take our k

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.280
a and times our k b, we're going
to just multiply these

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.500
out together.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:13:04.330
So I'll do this one first, k a
-- just copy from above --

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:18.310
times k b, hydroxide
ion, over n h 3.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:28.180
And things are going to cancel
out, and so I'm left with

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:34.400
hydronium ion and
hydroxide ion.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.340
What is this, when you
have hydronium ion

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.790
times hydroxide ion?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.700
What is that called?

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.850
It's another k.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.280
K w.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:52.780
So we just showed that k
a times k b equals k w.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:58.220
So we can take the logs of all
our k terms here, and if we

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:10.670
take the log of k a plus the log
of k b equal the log of k

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:33.240
w, or p k a plus p k b equals
p k w equals 14.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.220
So there's this relationship
with a conjugate acid and its

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.530
base between its k
a and its k b.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.450
So if one is really big, the
other has to be small or they

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.690
can both be sort of
in the middle.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.790
But they're always going to add
up in terms of the p k a

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.850
and the p k b to 14.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.040
And the thing about these
problems is if you're given a

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.340
k a for an acid, you can
calculate the k b for its

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.530
conjugate base, and you'll be
doing that a lot in titration

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.510
problems that are coming up.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.270
All right, so there's this
relationship between the

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.890
strength of an acid and the
strength of its conjugate

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.490
base, and let's just think for
a minute again about this

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.260
concept of strong and weak,
because this is really

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.320
important for the next unit.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:34.430
So if we have a strong acid, h
a, in water, it's going to go

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:39.180
pretty much completely over
to hydronium ion and the

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:44.470
conjugate, and this conjugate
is going to be really

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:49.000
ineffective as a conjugate
base, as a base at all.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.620
So it's going to really go
all to that hydronium ion

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.740
concentration.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.760
And so, in talking about a
strong base, you don't really

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.390
have to worry about an
equilibrium situation.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.540
Just remember it goes pretty
much to completion, and so you

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.110
can do complete subtractions
when you're doing this.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.250
And the same is true
for a strong base.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.075
So, for a strong base, any b,
in water, it's going all the

00:16:14.075 --> 00:16:21.470
way down, it's driving the
reaction all the way over

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.070
here, and you're forming, you
can consider it that however

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:32.740
much strong base you added
is how much hydroxide

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.500
ion you have here.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.110
How much strong acid you add is
equal to how much hydronium

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.920
ion concentration
you have here.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.300
So however much of a strong
acid or a strong base, you

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.510
think they go all the way to
completion, but for a weak

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.920
acid we're going to have
equilibrium, and so you'll

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.860
have to set up equilibrium
tables to figure out if you

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.840
added this much weak base,
how much did it ionize.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.650
So remember that -- people get
worried about the strong acid,

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.970
and you just assume it goes
right to completion.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.320
And you can tell again by the
k a's and the k b's what's

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.870
going to be strong or not.

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.160
And so our definition for strong
acids is that you have

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.430
a k a greater than one, strong
base pretty much, the only

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:24.010
problems you use, people are
adding sodium hydroxide or

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:27.510
potassium hydroxide, there are
not a lot of options for

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.380
strong bases.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.230
But for strong acids, people
are always worrying about

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.060
whether they've identified
those correctly or not.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.530
OK.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:42.760
So let's look at this relative
strength of acid problem and

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.890
do an example here.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:52.700
So in this equation we have acid
in a base going on one

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.690
side, another different acid
on the other side.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:18:00.100
So we can look at whether the
reaction is favored toward

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.890
this direction, toward the right
or the left, depending

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.230
on which acid is stronger.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.500
Will the reaction ride
to the right or left.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.700
So if this acid is stronger,
then it should drive the

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.940
reaction this way.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.310
If this is the acid on the other
side, if it's stronger,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.640
then you would expect to drive
the reaction the other way.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.390
So we can take a look at that.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.250
So we can consider the k for the
overall reaction, again,

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.390
just products over
reactants here.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.960
And we can also consider the
reaction from just each acid

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.120
alone in water.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.680
So we can consider it
separately as well.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.230
So first we can take
a look at one acid.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.530
So if we take a look at this
acid alone in water, it'll

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:53.500
form h 3 o plus and
n h 3 minus.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.490
So when it gives up its hydrogen
ion to the water and

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.650
then it forms its conjugate
over here.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:07.510
So now are we going to look
at a k a or a k b?

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.800
K a?

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.200
So we're going to have our
products over our reactants,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.450
and the number is quite large,
20, for that k a.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:21.020
And now we can look at the
other reaction as well.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.420
So we can look at this acid in
water here and form your

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.710
hydronium ion concentrations and
your conjugates -- again,

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.860
we're looking at that acid in
water, so it's a k a, and we

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.870
have our products
over reactants.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.640
Now we have a number of 5 .

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.730
6 times 10 to the minus 10.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:48.860
So, we can consider those two
equations back together, and

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.490
this time we're going to be
subtracting the equations from

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.230
each other to get our
sum equation.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.720
And because we are subtracting,
we're going to

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.430
end up to dividing the
equilibrium constants.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.550
So when we add the equilibrium
constants together, we

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.900
multiply things, and if we're
subtracting we divide.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.190
So the k in this case is going
to be equal to the k a of the

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.780
first acid over the second acid,
and you can prove this

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.980
to yourself, you write up the
k a here, and the k a here,

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:22.160
and then some of your terms, the
hydronium ions cancel, and

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.940
you get the k overall
equilibrium constant that we

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.040
wrote in the beginning, again
products over reactants.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.890
We know the value for k a for
one acid, we know the value of

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.780
k a for the other acid, and we
can divide those to get the k

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.940
for the overall reaction.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.000
And then you can tell me what
that k means in terms of which

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.960
is the stronger acid of the
two, and which side of the

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.940
equation does the reaction lie
to, the right or the left?

00:20:51.940 --> 00:21:18.440
All right, let's give
10 more seconds.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:35.270
Yup, people did pretty
well on this.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.860
So you could have thought
about it in terms of the

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.720
overall k or of the
individual k a's.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.320
So, the stronger acid is the
one with the larger number.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.265
And h n o 3 had a number of 20,
so that was pretty big, so

00:21:49.265 --> 00:21:52.030
that's a really strong acid.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.530
And because it's a strong acid,
it'll lie to the right,

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.100
so it's going to push toward
products -- it's a strong

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.560
acid, so it wants to
disassociate a lot, so would

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.750
push it that direction.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.830
And you can see that also in
terms of the equilibrium.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.690
Overall equilibrium constant,
if we go back to the slides

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.480
for a minute.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.760
So this number overall, k, is
also quite large, very large,

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.340
so that means a lot more
products than reactants at

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.960
equilibrium.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.740
So again, those are what you can
determine if you're given

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.190
a table of k a values, which
on the test you will get a

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.780
table of k a values, you can
tell me a lot about different

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.200
reactions knowing that
information about k a's.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.670
All right.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:50.050
So in this unit there are
different types of acid base

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:54.090
problems, and sometimes it feels
for people like there's

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.950
an infinite number of different
types of acid base

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.900
problems. But, in fact, there
are really only five.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.690
And so one of the things I
strongly recommend in this

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.990
unit and working problems is
figuring out which type of

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.060
problem it is, and that will
help you a lot in solving it.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.280
So you can either have a weak
acid in water, a weak base in

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.530
water, and sometimes you can be
fooled and say oh, it's a

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.830
salt and water problem, but
a salt and water problem

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.130
actually breaks down to a weak
acid and water problem and a

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:26.450
weak base and water problem.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.270
So it's really not a different
kind of problem, and we'll see

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.390
that in a few minutes.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.420
And you can have a strong acid
in water and a strong base in

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.560
water, and then you can have my
good friend the buffer type

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.510
of problem.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.460
So those are the type of
problems and being able to

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.200
recognize them is key to doing
well in this unit.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.760
So let's work a problem in the
first type of a weak acid in

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.670
water problem.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.220
All right, so what's
a weak acid?

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.800
Well, vitamin C is
a weak acid.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.760
And so sometimes when you're
taking your vitamins you get a

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.850
bad taste in your mouth.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:07.220
And if you did take a vitamin
C tablet here, which is 500

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.690
milligrams in this vitamin C
tablet, and dissolved it in

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.420
water -- this is not
scientifically measured -- but

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.410
dissolved it in water, so you
would say taking your vitamin

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.900
with a lot of water, and it was
starting to dissolve and

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.980
being pretty unpleasant, then
we could calculate at

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:28.400
equilibrium what kind of p h we
would have in that mixture.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.900
Now, these vitamins, this
Nature's Bounty, they do a

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.760
really good job of isolating the
vitamin, so it is pretty

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.190
much impossible for
it to dissolve.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.780
So they have a nice coating
around it that's highly

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:47.930
protective, at least at normal
water p h's, so it doesn't

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:48.500
really dissolve.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.800
And one year I thought I would
do the actual experiment, we

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.920
could talk about significant
figures, but I could not get

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.090
the tablet to dissolve --

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:59.200
I heated it, I stirred it, I did
everything at neutral p h,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.950
at room temperature.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.960
I want to do it at room
temperature, it just didn't

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.570
work, even the high temperature
didn't work.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.840
So if you buy Nature's Bounty,
it will not dissolve in the

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.330
water that you're taking, so
just for that little bit of

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.210
information.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.840
But if you had, say, an inferior
brand of vitamin C

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.380
that readily, that didn't have a
nice coating around it, then

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.990
you could do this experiment.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.010
So let's take a look at that.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.720
So the first thing that we have
to do is calculate the

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:34.130
molarity of the acid
that we've added.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.040
So here, just have to make sure
that your units are going

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.170
to be correct.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.670
So we have grams, we're
converting it with a molecular

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.570
weight to moles, and then we
have the number of moles in

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:49.840
the amount of water, and we can
calculate the molarity of

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.250
that solution.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.960
And one of the mistakes that
people often make in doing

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.540
these problems, they forget to
do all of the conversions that

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.060
are necessary, sometimes they
stop at moles, and you're

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:03.100
talking about concentrations
here, so don't forget about

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.380
your friend the volume.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.170
All right, so then you can
write and equation, and I

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.570
highly recommend that people do
this on the test because it

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.360
helps them figure out what type
of problem it is and it

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.050
voids people making
silly mistakes.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.170
So if we're talking about an
acid in water, you should make

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.670
sure that your equation reflects
an acid in water.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.510
If you have hydroxide ion on the
other side, something is

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.730
very wrong that's going on, and
acid and water is going to

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.550
be giving hydronium
ion concentrations

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.710
and a conjugate base.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.160
So then we can set up an
equilibrium table here.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.260
We calculated the initial
molarity.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.170
And in the beginning there's
nothing over on this side, so

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.540
we've just added our
weak acid to water.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.300
And so then the change, there's
going to be some

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.880
amount of this that ionizes
minus x, some amount of this

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.290
that's formed, and some
amount out of the

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.000
conjugate that's formed.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.080
So we have 0.0284 minus
x plus x plus x.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.040
Now we're talking about a weak
acid in water, so what term am

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.780
I going to want to use next?

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.990
K a.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.370
So I'm going to want to
use k a next -- k a

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.480
value is here, 8 .

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.200
0 times 10 to minus 5, we have
products over our reactant

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:33.030
here, and we have x squared
over 0.0284 minus x.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.500
Now you can make an assumption
when you're working on these

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.270
problems and check it later.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.640
So you can make the assumption
that x is really kind of small

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.670
compared to this o.084, and you
can just drop this x out

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.140
of the term here.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.950
And then check later and see
if that worked or not.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.030
So that makes the math easier,
and so now we can just solve

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:00.560
for x, and x comes out
to be 0.00151.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.500
The really two significant
figures, but we're going to

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.120
carry an extra one for the
moment, so they're just two

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.030
figures right here, two
significant figures here.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.040
Now we can check and see if x
was really small, if that

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.600
assumption worked right.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:27.570
So, is 0.0284 minus 0.00151
really the same as 0.0248, and

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.780
we let you make the assumption
that it is, we say it's OK if

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.010
it's less than 5%
of the value.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.820
So, in this case, it's actually
not, it's 5 .

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.970
3, so that violates
our policy.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.240
So it's more than 5%, so then
you have to use the quadratic

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.700
equation to solve the problem.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.130
I just want to note that this
term, this percentage, can be

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.890
called sometimes percent
ionized or percent

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.220
deprotonated, so that you're not
thinking that's some kind

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.220
of bizarre term if
you see that.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.140
And if you use the quadratic
equation, you get an answer of

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.950
0.00147, again, that's really
two significant figures.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.200
So it's not a whole lot
different, actually, than the

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:16.980
number you got making
the approximation.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.000
So, once you know what x is,
x is the hydronium ion

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.780
concentration in this problem,
and so we can plug that in, p

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.780
h is minus log of this,
so that's 2 .

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.540
83.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:35.610
And so we had really two
significant figures here, and

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.450
so we are going to have two
significant figures after the

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.190
decimal point here.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.690
And if you haven't reviewed your
sig fig rules and need

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:46.020
more help if that seems wrong,
then you should definitely

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.500
review it before
the next test.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:55.240
All right, so now we'll continue
with today's lecture

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.470
notes, and we're just going to
continue right on and we're

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:03.510
going to talk about weak bases,
and well, we're start

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.460
working on our way through,
we're also going to try to get

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.850
to buffers today.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.140
So, we've done a problem for
a weak acid in water.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:19.620
So now let's talk about a weak
base in water, and you can

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.870
start us off.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:25.340
So in this problem we're given a
molarity, so you didn't have

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.930
to calculate that, and now you
can help me fill out the table

00:30:29.930 --> 00:31:15.270
so we know what to do here.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:30.120
OK, let's just do
10 more seconds.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.070
Very good.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:38.600
So you're going to be losing
some of the amount -- some of

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.540
the amount of the weak base
you have in, it's going to

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.100
ionize, and so then you'll be
forming the conjugate acid

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.340
plus x, and you're going to be
forming hydroxide ions plus x.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.980
And so the one with the minus
sign is important, and

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.590
sometimes there will be 2's
involved, and that depends on

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.940
the stoichiometry
of the reaction.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:03.810
All right, so we can use that
information now and go on and

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.190
look at -- actually you could
leave that clicker question up

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:11.790
for a minute, and we're going
to talk about the k b.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:17.420
So the k b is going to be equal
to our products, n h 4

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:25.670
plus and our hydroxide ion
concentration over n h 3.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:30.190
And so now I can fill in the
values that you told me.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:34.650
So we have, on the top we're
going to have x squared, on

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.880
the bottom we're going
to have 0.15 minus x.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:44.030
And now we can make an
approximation here that x is

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:48.520
going to be small compared to
0.15, and so we can say that's

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:54.390
just going to be equal to x
squared over 0.15, and the k b

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.290
value that was given was 1 .

00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:02.840
8 times 10 to the minus 5.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:08.180
So now we can solve for x using
this approximation, and

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.950
using this approximation
x comes out to be 0 .

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:18.470
00164, and we can look
at whether that

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.490
approximation was OK.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:31.710
So is this number less than 5%
of 0.15, so we can say 0.00164

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:40.310
over 0.15 times 100, and that
comes out to be 1.1%, so

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.760
that's OK, that's
less than 5%.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.690
So that's good, we don't
have to use the

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.910
quadratic equation here.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:56.810
So now, we want to calculate
the p h.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:03.650
So can I just plug that number
for x into my p h equation?

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.620
What is x?

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:13.060
What is x equal to here?

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.280
It's equal to two different
things.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.900
What's one of them?

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.490
Hydroxide ion concentration.

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:23.950
So what we can do is
calculate a p o h.

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:29.890
So, p o h is minus log of the
hydroxide ion concentration,

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:34.090
or minus log of 0 .

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:41.490
001647, and we really only have
two significant figures

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:45.910
here, and that is going
to come out to 2 .

00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:48.050
79.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.740
And so, we would have two
significant figures after the

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.350
decimal point, because this
number had two significant

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:54.530
figures in it.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.430
But I'm not done.

00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:59.810
I've calculated p o h and
the problem wanted p h.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:05.320
So how do I go from
p o h to p h?

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.920
14 minus, yup.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.230
So 14 .

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:14.500
00 at room temperature
minus 2 .

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.160
79 is going to be equal to 11 .

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.460
21.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.910
And so that makes sense.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:28.140
Now in doing these problems
always consider, sometimes

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.720
you're rushing and you get done
you say OK, my p h is 2.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.080
But go back and think
about the type of

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.180
problem you're doing.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.470
It's a base in water problem.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.980
Would it make sense that the p
h was 2 if it was a base in

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.530
water problem?

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:42.220
No.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:46.440
And so then you realize oh,
I have to do another step.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.050
So that kind of thinking can
save you a lot of points on

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:53.350
the exam, to remember what it is
you're trying to calculate

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:57.020
and go back and make sure that
your answer makes sense.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.970
And sometimes people run into
weird math problems and some

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:05.590
they'll write and say this p h
should be above 7, it's 2, I

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.640
don't know what I did wrong,
clearly I did something wrong.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.070
I know that's wrong but I don't
have time to figure out

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.100
what I did wrong.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.620
That will get you points.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.560
So just recognizing that if
something makes sense or not

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.490
tells us you know what's going
on, and sometimes math issues

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.610
can get you into a place that
you can't get out of quickly.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.180
So just thinking about whether
the problem makes

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.710
sense is a big step.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.280
All right.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.550
So now, we're going to talk
about salt problems and I'm

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:39.070
going to try to convince you
that salts are actually the

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:44.520
same as the weak acid and weak
bases that we just did.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.810
So a salt is formed
when you mix an

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:49.070
acid and a base together.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:53.490
So, for example, if you have
h c l and sodium hydroxide,

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:58.270
you're going to get table salt
and a c l and water.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:04.460
So the p h of a salt in water
is not always neutral.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.770
Sometimes it's neutral,
sometimes it's not neutral.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.960
Well, when would it
not be neutral?

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.960
Well, if a salt contained a
conjugate acid of a weak base,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.610
then that conjugate
acid is going to

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.300
make it weakly acidic.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.930
Salts that contain things
like iron 3

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.860
plus also may be acidic.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.250
So when you're drinking water
and you measure the p h of

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.840
that water and it's not neutral,
this could be part of

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.550
the reason that there's some
salt in the water, some

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.420
different ions in the water.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.320
So a general rule from the
periodic table group one and

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.520
group two metals, so lithium,
calcium, sodium, those are all

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.720
going to be neutral in solution,
so you can just

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.820
remember that.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.070
And if a salt contains a
conjugate base of a weak acid,

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.340
then it'll form a
basic solution.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:59.460
So it's all about whether the
salt derived from a weak acid

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.500
or a weak base that's going to
give you a clue as whether

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.930
it's an acid or a
basic solution.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.880
If it derived, say, from a
strong acid mixed with a

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.680
strong base, then it's
going to give you

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.280
a salt that's neutral.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.900
So let's look at
some examples.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:19.250
So here we have n h 4 c l.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:22.750
So we can break this down and
think about where a salt like

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.240
this would have come from.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.150
So it would have come from n h 4
plus, and it would have come

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.470
from c l minus.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.360
So n h 4 plus, let's think about
where this came from.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.090
What is it?

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:42.980
So, we want to ask the question
is n h 4 plus a

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.750
conjugate acid of a weak base?

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.020
And what is its conjugate
base?

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.430
Well, it's conjugate
base is n h 3.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.740
If you lose a hydrogen ion
or proton from n h 4

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.290
plus, you get n h 3.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.020
And so you're really asking,
if that's a weak base, then

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.210
its conjugate is also
going to be weak.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:03.280
So you need to know about these
guys to see what would

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.660
happen if you have n h
4 plus in solution.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.600
So how do you know about this.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.080
Well, you know about things
being weak or strong based on

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.200
their k a's and their k b's.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.290
So, is ammonia a weak base?

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.480
It has a k b of 1 .

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.010
8 times 10 to the minus 5, so
yeah, that's a small number,

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.700
so that's a weak base.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.820
And so it's actually in this
table, so if you have

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.620
something that's weak over here,
then its conjugate is

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.430
also going to be weak
over there.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.160
These are totally
lined up right.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:42.560
And so the conjugate over here
is also going to be weak.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.340
And if you weren't really sure
you could always look it up,

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.070
so here you have ammonium ion
and it has a k a of 5 .

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.150
6 times 10 to the minus 10.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:56.920
Yup, that's a very small number,
that is a weak acid.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:02.250
So yes, the conjugate is weak,
the base is weak, and the

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.520
conjugate acid of that weak
base is also weak.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.500
So, n h 4 plus does have
acidic properties.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.280
It's not a strong acid, it's a
weak acid, but it will make

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.370
things acidic.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.900
So this should be acidic.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.950
What about c l minus?

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.920
Do you think it's going to do
anything useful for you?

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.900
Where do you think c
l minus came from?

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.170
From h c l.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:32.170
So we could ask again, is
a c l minus a conjugate

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.780
base of a weak acid.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.770
The acid is h c l, is
that a weak acid?

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:39.990
No.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:44.300
So we can look it up if you
didn't remember it, 10 to the

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:49.470
7, definitely not weak -- very,
very, very strong acid,

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:53.270
and if something is strong
acid, its conjugate is

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.330
ineffective as a base.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:41:00.840
So c l minus is ineffective as
a base so it's going to be

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.510
neutral here.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:05.690
So overall, you have something
that's going to be acidic with

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:07.750
something that's going
to be neutral.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.730
So overall it'll be acidic.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:13.420
So this particular salt and
water is going to be acidic

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.930
because the things that were
mixed together to get it, one

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:19.725
of them included a weak base,
and so that's going to form a

00:41:19.725 --> 00:41:25.590
weak conjugate acid, so it'll
be acidic in solution.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.590
All right, so let's look
at another one.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:33.240
I'm giving you the k a value in
this problem, and knowing

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.150
that particular k a value,
tell me what you think is

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:41.170
going to be true about this
particular salt in solution,

00:41:41.170 --> 00:42:27.350
whether it'll be acidic,
neutral, or basic.

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:46.160
OK, 10 more seconds.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.960
So, some people were a little
fooled by the information I

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.700
gave you, so let's take
a look at this.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:43:00.960
So if we go to my presentation
here.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:07.700
So we can break this up into n
a plus and c h 3 c o minus.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:13.440
N a plus, is that a conjugate
acid of a weak base?

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.960
Is that going to be acidic?

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.920
What do we know about things in
group one, a column of the

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.900
periodic table.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.250
They're going to be neutral.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:26.100
Where do you think that this
came from, n a plus, where

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:30.060
might it have come from?

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.010
It might have come from n a o h,
that might have been a base

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.060
that was added.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.220
So it's not going to do anything
for you -- things in

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.320
group one and group two are
going to be neutral.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.870
All right, so we can ask
the question about

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:45.350
a c h 3 c o o minus.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:49.030
Is it a conjugate base
of a weak acid?

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:53.310
So then we can say is the acid
that it came from a weak acid?

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.720
Is its conjugate a weak acid?

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.060
Well, how do we know
about that?

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:01.540
Well, we know about that from
the k a value that I gave you.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.330
So is this a weak acid?

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.120
Yes.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.440
So is its conjugate going
to be a weak base?

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.130
Yes.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.400
So, given that information
we can say yes.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.370
So its conjugate acid
is weak, so then it

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:19.930
would be a weak base.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:25.680
So if it's a weak base then
it'll be basic in solution,

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.550
and we have something that's
neutral plus basic, so overall

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.970
you get basic.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:34.700
All right.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:45.780
So let's look at a general
example now of this as well.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.980
So here we can talk about
a general rule.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.150
So if you have compound
x y, we can talk about

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.180
x plus and y minus.

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.730
And for x plus you're going
to be asking about is it a

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:01.010
conjugate acid of a weak base.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.560
For y minus you're going to be
asking is it a conjugate base

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.870
of a weak acid.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.180
So for the first part you're
asking about if it's a

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.510
conjugate acid, in the second
half you're asking about if

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.120
it's a conjugate base.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.860
So if something is a conjugate
acid of a weak base, and

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.370
that's yes -- if you know that's
a weak base or you know

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:22.970
that it's a weak acid, then it's
going to be acidic, if

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.940
it's not, it'll be neutral.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.180
Same thing is true over here.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.550
You might know about that
something is a weak base, you

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.520
might know that its conjugate
is a weak acid, and if you

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.120
have a conjugate base of
something that's a weak acid,

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.930
then it is a base.

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:39.540
If it's a strong acid it would
be ineffectual, but if it's a

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.380
conjugate of a weak acid,
it'll be basic.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.230
No, it's neutral.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:47.760
So overall, you can have
three possibilities.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.230
Acidic plus neutral is acidic,
basic plus neutral is basic,

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.730
and neutral plus neutral
is neutral.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.420
Now some people might come up
with another option here.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:03.090
What other thing am I leaving
off of this overall?

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.200
Acidic plus basic.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.540
That's because I'm never going
to ask you that when

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.720
it comes to a salt.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.850
Because pretty much, salts are
formed when you're doing a

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.980
titration, and you're going to
be either titrating a strong

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.870
acid, a strong base, you're
going to be titrating a weak

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:19.270
acid with a strong base, or
you're going to be titrating a

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.400
strong acid with a weak base.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:25.120
You are never going to titrate
a weak acid with a weak base.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.770
That would yield no interesting

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:28.210
results of any kind.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.350
So you're not going to be
forming salts that are

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.490
conjugates of both
those things.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.700
So, if you want to think about
it that way that's fine, or

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.750
you could just remember that
that is not what I'm

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:38.700
going to ask you.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.190
These are great little short
answer questions on an exam,

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:44.860
so if you're good at thinking
about this, it'll definitely

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:51.410
give you a couple of points
on one of the exams.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.570
All right, so now and last, just
a couple minutes, I just

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:58.420
want to introduce very
briefly buffers.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:02.990
So a buffer is something that
maintains the p h of a

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:06.890
solution, so it's going to
buffer that solution.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:10.050
So if you add a little bit of
strong acid or a little bit of

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.300
strong base, it doesn't
matter the p h is

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.930
going to stay the same.

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:16.580
So there are two kinds
of buffers.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:20.510
You have an acid buffer, which
is going to buffer/maintain

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.130
the p h on the acidic
side of neutral.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:27.600
And a basic buffer, which will
maintain the p h on the basic

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.080
end of the p h scale.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:35.220
So let me just give you a brief
example of a buffer and

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.360
just get you thinking
about buffers.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.940
So here, in about a buffer
problem you're going to mix an

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.560
acid with its conjugate base.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:49.360
So, you have acetate, and then
probably the acetate salt of

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.010
the acetic acid.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:53.500
So over here, you have the
acetic acid, on this side you

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.000
have its conjugate base
usually added in

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.640
the form of a salt.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.220
And then you have
an equilibrium.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.470
So, what's going to happen
if you add a strong

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:06.530
acid to this solution?

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:13.190
If you add strong acid, if you
add more h 3 o plus, what

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:14.280
happens if you add more?

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:19.650
What direction will the
reaction shift?

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:22.240
So you'll get the back reaction,
it'll try to

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.550
minimize that stress and move
the other way, and it'll use

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:29.310
up some of that acid and
maintain the p h.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:33.400
Then you can think, so these
amount of acid added is

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:37.800
effectively removed and the
p h stays the same.

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.170
What about if you add
a strong base?

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:47.210
Well, that strong base will
react with the acid, it will

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:53.030
remove protons from this acid,
or the hydrogen ion here,

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.320
forming this water and
its conjugate.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.680
So you'll make more of these
and the p h will

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.880
also stay the same.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.860
So the base is going to be
removed by reacting.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.350
So they're effectively removed
and the p h stays the same.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:10.850
So in this you have a weak
acid, h a, it'll transfer

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:17.570
protons to o h minus supplied
by the strong base.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:21.220
The conjugate of that weak acid,
which would be a weak

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:25.720
base, is going to accept protons
from any acid that is

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.340
going to be supplied.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:32.340
So, in this way, you
maintain the p h.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:37.550
And so I just to emphasize that
in a buffer solution you

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:42.130
have h a, acidic buffer
solution, you have h a, and

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:43.990
you have its conjugate.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.470
And if you only have one or the
other, it's not going to

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:47.830
make a good buffer.

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:52.470
So, I want you to remember that
in buffers you have both

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:55.500
conjugates -- one alone
is not going to work.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:59.330
And people forget this in the
class, and so you can remember

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.740
that for Halloween, your
chemistry professor dressed up

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:07.620
as a buffer to help you remember
that in a buffer

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.150
you're going to have both.

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:12.200
You've got to have the conjugate
acid base set,

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.640
otherwise it will not buffer.

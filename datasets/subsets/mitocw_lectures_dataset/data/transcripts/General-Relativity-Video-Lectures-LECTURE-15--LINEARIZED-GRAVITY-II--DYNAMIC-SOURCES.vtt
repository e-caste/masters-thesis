SCOTT HUGHES: In the
previous lecture,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.070
I began with the
Einstein field equations

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.690
in the most general form.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.130
And then I specialized
to linearized gravity,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.172
to taking the spacetime
metric, assuming

00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:26.130
that I can find a coordinate
system in which it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.460
is close to the
eta alpha beta form

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.588
that we use for flat space
time, plus a small perturbation,

00:00:35.588 --> 00:00:36.630
something that's defined.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.020
So I set whenever I have
that h multiplied by itself

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.580
I can neglect it.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.120
Doing so I was able to
recast the Einstein field

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.090
equation as a simple linear
equation, which is the wave

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.240
operator acting on a variant
to that perturbation,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.810
the trace reverse version
of that perturbation.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.570
It is minus 16 pi g times
the stress energy tensor.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.210
So in doing this
recasting, I have--

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.680
this is essentially just a trick
of reorganizing the variables.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
I have taken my h
alpha beta, which

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.623
describes the way in which
spacetime is shifted away

00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:13.290
from that of flat spacetime, the
perturbation of flat spacetime,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.957
and I've just rearranged
that to give it

00:01:14.957 --> 00:01:17.370
the trace with
the opposite sign.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.730
And I've chosen a gauge
such that the divergence

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.440
of that trace reverse
metric perturbation is zero.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.890
If we take this equation,
which is completely

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.447
general for
linearized spacetime,

00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:34.030
the only thing which I had to
do is choose a particular gauge.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.322
And there's no physics in that.

00:01:35.322 --> 00:01:38.100
That's essentially
a coordinate choice.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:50.240
If I then imagine that
my source is static,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.965
I will have static fields.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.100
And so my wave
operator goes over

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.380
to a simple Laplace operator.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.330
And that it's not too hard to
show that the solution that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:28.280
emerges from this looks
like this, where phi n is

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.990
Newtonian gravitational
potential, which

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:47.470
arises from a distribution
of mass like so.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.650
So this is the leading solution.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.840
And it's one that is very
powerful and very useful.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.430
And it's actually
using tremendous number

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.790
of physics and
astronomical applications.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.750
This restriction to a
static source, though, is--

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.340
well, it's restrictive.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.840
What if I do not want to simply
consider a static source?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.450
What if I am
interested in sources

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.440
of the gravitational interaction
that are themselves dynamical?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.150
And so I emphasized last time
that this wave equation, my box

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.050
h bar alpha beta equals
minus 16 pi GT alpha beta,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.080
this is something that
I hope you have already

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.020
seen in the context
of electrodynamics,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:51.830
in particular whenever we have
a wave equation, who's not even

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.740
a wave equation, but any
differential equation

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:15.690
that is of the form linear
differential operator on field

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.955
is equal to a source.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.650
OK, so I'm separating out time
and spatial behavior here.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.900
Whenever I have a
situation in which I'm

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.540
interested in studying a field
in which some differential

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.450
linear operator acting on that
field is equal to a source,

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.281
we can solve this using the
technique of Green's functions.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.160
I am not going to be able
to go through the technique

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.140
of Green's functions in detail.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.750
I will quickly give you a
synopsis of how it works

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.480
and then I will look at the
particular Green's function

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.890
that applies to
the wave operator.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.740
Students who would like
to read more about this,

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.550
I would point you to
the textbook by Arfken.

00:05:21.118 --> 00:05:24.210
I believe it is called
Mathematical Methods

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.360
for Physicists.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:35.370
And in the third edition,
Green's functions

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.780
are described in
Section 16.5 to 16.6.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.150
So in a nutshell, let me just
give you a very brief synopsis

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.510
of how this technique works.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.120
Suppose we take
our source, which

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:05.565
may be some complicated,
very ornate entity.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:08.910
And what we're going to
do is replace that source

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.990
with a delta function.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.360
So imagine that I
take s of t and x

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:38.000
over 2a delta at
some time t prime

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.155
and a three-dimensional delta
at some location x prime.

00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:45.530
What I'm basically
saying here is

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.240
I'm imagining I might have some
source that's extended in time

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.330
and extended in
space, and I'm just

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.790
going to look at the little
blip at one particular event

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:03.230
and see if I replace my source
with this one single blip,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.990
what field emerges from that?

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.110
What we're going to do is
assert that a solution exists.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.980
And we will call the
field that arises

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.660
when my source is replaced
with a delta function,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:39.740
we'll call it capital G. OK?

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:47.400
This notation means that this
is the amount of field at t, x,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.730
arising from my source
at t prime x prime.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:13.610
So my differential equation
for this solution G

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.470
now looks like so.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.937
So whatever my linear operator
is when it acts on this G,

00:08:25.937 --> 00:08:28.270
it gives me the source, which
is now the delta function.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.669
Let me just introduce a
little bit of notation here.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:41.010
So t and x, I call
this the field point.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.590
This is the point at which
the field G is being measured.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.520
t prime, x prime
is my source point.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.267
This is the point at which
the source is non-zero.

00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:04.850
In this particular
case, it's actually

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.790
a little delta function spike.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:14.540
The reason why we do this is
pretty much by definition.

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:20.650
Pardon me one second.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.200
Yes, pretty much by definition.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.860
If I take the source
and integrate it

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.006
against the delta function--

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.060
integrate over all time,
integrate over all space--

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.960
I must get the source back.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.040
This is a tautology.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.600
All I'm doing here
is really saying

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.660
this is the properties
of delta functions.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.810
However, what's sort
of remarkable is

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.140
if instead of
integrating the source

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.987
against the delta functions--

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.860
if instead of
integrating the source

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.940
against the delta functions--

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:56.390
I integrate the source
against the Green's function,

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:03.320
if I do this, then what
I must get out of it

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.170
is the solution f.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.680
This is actually
very easy to prove.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.650
Simply take this equation--

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.080
let's call this equation A--

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:21.210
if you take a equation
A and operate on it

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:32.340
with your differential
operator D,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.420
so if I hit equation
A with D-- remember D,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.200
it's a differential operator
that acts on only the unprimed

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.320
coordinates.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.935
You know what?

00:11:58.935 --> 00:12:00.310
Let's just go and
write this out.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:34.770
So D on this integral,
when I hit D on this,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.350
it goes straight
through the integral.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.720
This only acts on the
unprimed coordinates.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.010
So it ignores the integrals.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.090
It ignores the s.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.610
The only thing that operator
hits when I act on the integral

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.450
is the Green's function itself.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.550
But I have asserted that
the Green's function is such

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.070
that when D acts on it, I
get the delta functions out.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.803
And by the definition
of delta functions,

00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:40.220
this just gives
me my source back.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:50.180
So what this means is that if
we can find the Green's function

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.670
for our differential
operator, all we need to do

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.640
is integrate it
against our source.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.940
And the result must be the
solution to our field equation.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.490
It's a beautiful technique.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.560
So if you haven't
seen this before,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:13.070
I highly recommend that you
turn to that reading in Arfken.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.290
I'm going to take
advantage of this.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.480
I'm going to use
this technique now.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.730
In particular, I'm going to
take advantage of the fact

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:25.520
that if my differential operator
is in fact the flat spacetime

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.960
wave operator, there is a
very well-known solution

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.317
for the Green's functions.

00:14:31.317 --> 00:14:33.650
It's called the radiative
Green's function in this case.

00:15:05.327 --> 00:15:07.410
I'm just going to write
down what the solution is.

00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:42.250
So I'm going to talk about
the properties of this

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.240
in just a moment.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.040
So I'll just comment
that this is something

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.900
that you should be able to find
developed in any good quality,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.400
advanced electrodynamics
textbook.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.620
In my notes here I suggest
looking at this place where

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.990
I originally went
through this carefully

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.540
was in the second
edition of Jackson.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.440
It's presumably also present
in the latest edition.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.410
But it might be in a
slightly different place.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.868
In the second
edition, you can find

00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:11.350
this discussed in Section 6.6.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.695
When I have taught MIT's junior
level electrodynamics course,

00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:15.880
I actually go through this.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.955
And by essentially introducing
a Fourier transform,

00:16:19.955 --> 00:16:23.320
a Fourier decomposition,
turning the wave operator

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.010
into an algebraic operator,
just rearrange a bunch of terms,

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.510
then invert a Fourier transform.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.600
It's not too hard to show
that this is the result that

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.350
comes out of that.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:43.050
Notice the argument of
that delta function.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.040
And please bear in
mind, we are working

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.790
in units in which we have set
the speed of light equal to 1.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.154
So the delta function,
it has support only at--

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.829
well, what's going
on here is this

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.819
is taking into account
the amount of time

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:27.020
it takes for information to
travel from the source point

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.430
to the field point.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.300
OK, if I can illustrate
this with a little cartoon,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:04.760
imagine I have some dynamical
source of mass and energy

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.080
that's down here wiggling away.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.970
Here is my one example
of a source point

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.940
that is going to end
up inside the integral

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:25.740
when I integrate up the Green's
function against my source.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.080
Here I am.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.250
I'm an observer making
my measurement out here

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.210
at position x.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.360
Whatever is happening
at x prime takes time

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.860
to be communicated to me
making my measurements out here

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.850
at distance x.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:59.660
The time lag is the distance
that has to be traveled,

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.043
x minus x prime.

00:19:01.043 --> 00:19:02.460
And, again, I'll
remind you, we're

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.860
working in units with a
speed of light is equal to 1.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.960
We would divide by c if we were
working in normal SI units.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.460
OK?

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.510
So this factor in the Green's
function is building in--

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.550
I'm going to do the
integral in just a moment--

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:18.330
it is building in
the fact that we

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.360
need to account for
the amount of time

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.510
it takes for information
about the source's dynamics

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.490
to be radiatively communicated
to observers far away

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.450
from that source.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.490
All right, so we are
now going to apply this

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:43.470
to the linearized--

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.250
the Einstein field equation
for linearized gravity.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:05.890
So here is our field equation.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.850
Sadly, the letter capital
G is doing multiple duties

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:14.520
in this lecture.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:39.280
So when we solve this,
what we need to do

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:45.670
is integrate t alpha beta
regarded as a function

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.100
of prime--

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:54.980
time t prime, position x prime
against the radiative Green's

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:55.480
function.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.975
Plug in the radiative Green's
function, which we use.

00:21:08.313 --> 00:21:10.730
This is the Green's function
that corresponds to that wave

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:11.540
operator.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.170
We have a minus 1 over 4
pi hitting our minus 16

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.210
pi out front there.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.650
We're going to do the integral
over the time variable.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.860
And we're going to leave
our result expressed

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.250
as an integral over space.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:12.310
This is an exact solution of
the linearized field equations

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.260
of general relativity.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.270
This is telling me
that what happens--

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:22.600
the field that is measured, the
trace reverse perturbation that

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.640
is measured at
time t and position

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.380
x prime is given by
integrating over my source, all

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.730
the dynamics that happened
earlier than that time t.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.240
What I need to do is take into
account that over this source I

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.030
have to fold in
the amount of time

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.220
it takes for
information from source

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.170
point x prime to go out to x.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.650
I integrate over the source.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.360
At every point in
the integrand, I

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.500
divide by the distance between
the field point and the source

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.360
point.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.560
Do that integral,
multiply by 4G.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.460
There's my solution.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.420
This is wonderful.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.480
It's actually an exact solution.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:13.180
Like most exact
solutions, it's not always

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.380
the most useful
thing in the world.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.000
There's one problem which
we need to diagnose,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.820
which is that in the way that
this has been formulated,

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:33.800
it looks like every component of
this trace reverse metric looks

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.836
radiative.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.120
What do I mean by
it looks radiative?

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.640
Well, it came from
a wave equation.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.110
They all depend on
information that traveled out

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.420
at the speed of
light with a time lag

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.430
appropriate to the speed
with which radiation

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.848
moves in flat spacetime.

00:24:15.848 --> 00:24:17.640
You know, you look at
that, and you sort of

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.090
say, wow, the entire metric
has this sort of character

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:25.020
that we associate with
a propagating wave.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.280
All of spacetime is radiative.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.740
We need to be careful
about that, because here

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.900
is where we need to
revisit and think

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.993
carefully about what happens
when we choose our gauge.

00:24:38.993 --> 00:24:41.160
What I'm going to show you
is a little demonstration

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:48.570
that in this case,
the gauge we chose--

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:56.540
and let me emphasize that was
a wonderful gauge for putting

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.290
the horribly messy field
equation into a form where

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.330
we could actually solve it--

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:10.850
but the gauge we
chose is unfortunately

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:20.451
masking some of the physical
character of the spacetime.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:34.750
So this Lorenz gauge
was great for producing

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.640
a set of field
equations that we could

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.590
bring to bear powerful
mathematical techniques

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.560
and get a closed
form actually exact

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.800
within the context of linearized
theory, an exact solution.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.830
But it might be
misleading us as to what

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.470
the resulting solution means.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.032
Let me illustrate this with an
example from electrodynamics.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:11.310
Suppose I gave you a vector
potential that was of the form

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:21.370
at a time-like component that
was q over r minus q omega sine

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:28.850
q dot r minus omega
t capital R over r.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:37.630
Little r is square
root of x squared

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.210
plus y squared plus z squared.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.590
And capital R is some parameter
with the dimensions of length.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.550
And my three spatial
components of this thing,

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:59.040
I'm going to write
them as kqi sine k

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:07.705
dot r minus omega t
capital R over r minus qxi.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:23.480
OK, this is the potential that
has a form that kind of looks

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:30.040
like if I were to sort of give
this to you on an oral exam

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.830
and say without doing any
calculation, what would

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.798
you guess this is?

00:27:35.798 --> 00:27:37.340
And that would
actually be, as you'll

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.350
see in a moment, that'd be
a very unfair question of me

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.800
to ask.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.633
And I look at this and
I say, you know what?

00:27:41.633 --> 00:27:43.880
That looks kind of
like a Coulomb field.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.970
And then there is
something radiative

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.068
that it's embedded in,
kind of a funny amplitude

00:27:49.068 --> 00:27:50.360
associated with that radiation.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.100
But maybe this is sort
of like a dipole radiator

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.370
with a net monopole
moment going on it.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.510
You know, we've got things
that involve fields that

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.850
oscillate in space and time.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.240
They fall off as 1 over r's.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.600
A component falls off
as 1 over r cubed.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.480
Yeah, that would be my guess--
a point charged with radiation.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.950
So your oral examiner,
the next thing they say

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.580
is, great, work out the
electromagnetic field tensor

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.630
corresponding to this.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.023
So you do this by
taking some derivatives.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:29:07.420
And what results is this.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:11.440
This is the electromagnetic
field tensor corresponding

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:25.350
to a Coulomb electric field
with no magnetic field.

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:30.180
This potential is nothing
more than a Coulomb point

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:37.740
charge in a really dumb gauge.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.590
The way I actually generated
this was I started with the q

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:43.145
over r potential of a
Coulomb point charge.

00:29:43.145 --> 00:29:46.080
And I just applied some
crazy gauge generator to it

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.140
to see what happened.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:52.430
So the parable of
this story is whenever

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.500
you are working
with quantities that

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.800
are subject to gauge
transformations,

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.620
you have to be careful about
drawing conclusions about what

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.990
those quantities mean in
terms of the physics you

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:07.120
want to get out of it.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.090
Gauge can obscure the physics
if we are not careful.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.460
And in particular-- there's
almost like a conservation

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.140
of pain principle here--

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.990
it is often the case
that the best gauge

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:22.190
for formulating tractable
equations for solving

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.910
your problem turn out to
be gauges that give you

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.790
just kind of crappy results if
you want to interpret what's

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.314
going on physically.

00:30:31.314 --> 00:30:33.723
In the remainder
of this lecture,

00:30:33.723 --> 00:30:35.390
I am going to introduce
something that's

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.270
a slightly advanced topic.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:42.713
And I pretty shamelessly stole
this from a paper that I wrote,

00:30:42.713 --> 00:30:44.630
something that I did
with a colleague of mine,

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.380
Eanna Flanagan.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.290
And it's based on an
idea that was developed

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:53.395
in a different context by my
MIT colleague Ed Bertschinger.

00:30:53.395 --> 00:30:54.770
So here is what
we're going to do

00:30:54.770 --> 00:31:00.430
in the remainder
of this lecture.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:11.510
What we're going to do is
recast the metric and the source

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:24.380
in a form, which
allows us to categorize

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.860
the radiative and non-radiative
degrees of freedom

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.103
of the spacetime.

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:51.240
This will, in fact-- we're
going to do this in a way

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.850
where the results are, in
fact, completely generic,

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.670
provided we stick to
linearized gravity,

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:05.700
gravity linearized
around flat spacetime,

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.400
which will be sufficient for
our discussion right now.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.920
I will give you the
punch line upfront.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:28.500
What we will discover
is that spacetime

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:41.990
has four physical degrees of
freedom that are non-radiative.

00:32:49.848 --> 00:32:51.390
And the hallmark of
this is that they

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.580
are going to be governed by
differential equations that

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.320
look like the Poisson equation.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.600
They will look like the Laplace
operator on some potential

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.475
is equal to a source.

00:33:05.041 --> 00:33:06.432
Let me rewrite that.

00:33:06.432 --> 00:33:07.640
This handwriting is terrible.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:37.450
Spacetime has two more degrees
of freedom that are radiative.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.182
These are governed
by wave equations.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:11.870
The metric tensor of
spacetime has 10 components,

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.469
10 unique components.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.810
It's represented by about
4 by 4 symmetric matrix.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:17.310
OK?

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.520
So it has 10 components in it.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.145
4 plus 2 does not equal 10.

00:34:21.145 --> 00:34:22.520
You might look at
this and think,

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.159
what about the other four
components of this thing?

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.320
I've got 4 degrees of freedom.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.767
That must correspond in some
sense to 4 of those components.

00:34:30.767 --> 00:34:32.350
I've got another 2
degrees of freedom.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.350
That must correspond to
two of those components.

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:35.949
What's going on the other four?

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.270
Well, the other 4
degrees of freedom

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:41.429
are essentially eaten
up by our gauge freedom.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.540
OK, we are free to
specify our coordinates

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.520
via an infinitesimal
coordinate shift.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.719
And so we have 4 degrees of
freedom under our control.

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:53.750
General relativity
insists on giving physics

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.120
to the other six.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.700
These four non-radiative
degrees of freedom, the two

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.910
radiative ones, and the four
gauge degrees of freedom

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.550
completely describe
the spacetime metric.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.550
And just to use an analogy,
these non-radiative

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.380
of degrees of
freedom are kind of

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.770
like the non-radiative
electric and magnetic fields

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.740
that you get in electrodynamics.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.310
Your two radiative
degrees of freedom

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.210
are going to turn out to two
polarization states associated

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:24.140
with waves in the gravitational
field in the same way

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.350
that in electrodynamics, the
electric and magnetic field

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:32.670
also have two polarizations
associated with them.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:38.090
So this is all worked out
in great detail in a paper

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.400
that Eanna Flanagan of
Cornell University and I

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.670
wrote about 16 years ago.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:50.120
And so I will make available
through the 8.962 website

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.210
a copy of that paper.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.700
And it was Flanagan who
sort of got this started.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.700
And he and I then figured
out all the details together.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.030
Ed Bertschinger is sort of
the grandfather of this idea

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.490
since he did
something very similar

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:10.580
in an analysis that
characterized perturbations

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.250
to cosmological spacetimes.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.910
All right, so here's
how we proceed.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.500
Let's consider h
mu nu as a tensor

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.469
field on a flat background.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:40.460
In the previous lecture
that I recorded,

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:45.560
I described how when I am
working in linearized theory,

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.507
it's a useful fiction
to think of h mu nu.

00:36:47.507 --> 00:36:49.340
Even though we know
it's actually telling us

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.630
about the curvature
of spacetime,

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.670
it's a useful fiction to
think of it as a tensor

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.200
field in a flat background.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.080
And we're going to
take advantage of that.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:03.427
We are going to choose
time and space coordinates.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.800
Once I have chosen time
and space coordinates,

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:23.160
I then think about how
this 4 by 4 tensor, how

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.050
its different
components break up

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.690
and how they behave with respect
to rotations in the spatial

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:29.190
coordinates.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:34.610
I can imagine going in and tweak
my spatial coordinate system.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:51.510
And what I want to do is
examine how the components break

00:37:51.510 --> 00:38:05.560
up into subgroups with
respect to spatial only

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.123
coordinate transformations.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:24.790
What we'll see is h mu nu is
going to break up into-- you're

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:26.560
going to get one piece.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.670
It's your time-time piece.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:29.380
OK?

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.170
If I have chosen my time
and my space coordinates

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:36.160
and I imagine messing around
with my spatial coordinate

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.010
system, htt is unchanged.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:39.848
And so this--

00:38:39.848 --> 00:38:41.390
I'm actually going
to give it a name.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:44.610
I'm going to call
it minus 2 phi--

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.210
this behaves as a scalar.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:55.650
My spacetime piece--
so components of this,

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:56.820
of the form hti--

00:38:59.873 --> 00:39:02.290
I'm going to characterize this
in more detail a little bit

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.340
later.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.290
But these three
numbers are going

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.260
to behave with respect to
spatial only coordinate

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.060
transformations like a vector.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.880
Likewise hij is going to
behave like a 3 by 3 tensor.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.060
So let's break this down
a little bit further.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:41.130
Whenever I am dealing
with a function that

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:44.880
is vector in nature--

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.950
and bear mind it's a field.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:48.450
So I'm dealing with
a vector field--

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:07.150
I'm going to write this as
a divergence-free function

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.340
plus the gradient
of some scalar.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:17.470
So what I'm going
to do is say hti

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:23.590
is equal to beta i plus
the gradient of some gamma.

00:40:28.005 --> 00:40:30.380
And I'm going to require that
the divergence of that beta

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.060
be equal to 0.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:36.800
Notice, since all of my
indices are spatial indices

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.878
and I am working in nearly
Lorenz coordinates--

00:40:44.155 --> 00:40:46.280
the placement of the indices,
whether it's upstairs

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.095
or downstairs, is immaterial--

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.200
I will tend to write them all
in the downstairs position.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.752
And so repeated indices--

00:41:02.752 --> 00:41:04.460
we're going to sort
of abuse the Einstein

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.002
notation a little bit-- repeated
indices will be summed over.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.510
Let's extend this logic to
the tensor piece, to hij.

00:41:29.822 --> 00:41:31.280
This takes a little
bit of thought.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.440
So let me just
write out the answer

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.650
and then describe the
character of every piece that

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.370
goes into this.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:59.630
So hij can be
written as hij tt--

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.660
I will define that in a moment--

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:16.760
plus 1/3 hij plus d, sort
of a symmetrized gradient

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:27.650
of a vector epsilon, plus
delta i delta j minus 1/3 delta

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:32.420
ij plus operator on
some function lambda.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.340
So let me go
through and describe

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.470
what each of these things mean.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:41.870
And while I'm at
it, let me count up

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.390
the number of degrees of
freedom associated with them.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.540
Let's back up for just a
second and do that over here.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.800
Gamma is a scalar.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.280
So there's 1 degree of
freedom associated with gamma.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:42:59.910
Let me move this over to here.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.340
So that's 1 degree of freedom.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:13.252
Beta is a vector, but
it's divergenceless.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:22.850
Because it's a vector,
I have three components.

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.110
But being divergence-free,
those three components

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.690
obey a constraint.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:34.314
So that's 3 minus 1.

00:43:34.314 --> 00:43:38.150
So this scalar and this
divergence-free vector

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.100
give me the 3
degrees of freedom I

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.540
need to specify the 3
independent components of hti.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:50.270
Over here, as I look through all
of these different functions,

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:51.410
h is a scalar.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.920
I have defined it
in such a way--

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.250
hold on just one second.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.500
I'm going to come back to
that point in just a moment.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.850
Epsilon j is a vector.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:33.720
It is defined such that
its divergence is 0.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.970
OK?

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:40.217
So what is going on here is
this contribution to hij,

00:44:40.217 --> 00:44:42.050
it gives me a piece of
this thing that looks

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.217
like the gradient of vector.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:52.210
This has 3 degrees of
freedom minus 1 constraint.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.040
This is a scalar.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.550
It only has 1 degree of
freedom associated with it.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.810
Lambda is another scalar.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:15.260
Notice whereas h feeds directly
into hij its derivatives

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.640
of lambda that feed into this.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.230
So this has one
degree of freedom.

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:30.360
But this is defined
in such a way

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:37.240
that if I take the trace of
hij, this operator gives me 0.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:37.740
Right?

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:55.320
So the trace-- what
the trace will do

00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:01.120
is sum over elements
when i and j are equal.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.850
So this will give me essentially
the Laplace operator.

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:09.490
But the trace of delta ij is 3.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:12.310
So I get Laplace operator
minus Laplace operator,

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:16.230
I get the 0 operator
acting on lambda.

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:19.970
So this gives me 1
degree of freedom.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.100
This gave me 1
degree of freedom.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.880
hij tt-- and you
know what, I'm going

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.652
to go to a separate
board for this one.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.180
This is a tensor.

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:13.650
tt stands for transverse
and traceless.

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:17.310
This is defined so that
if I take its trace--

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.250
oops, I said this would
all be downstairs--

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:26.260
if I evaluate this, I get 0.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:26.760
OK?

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:30.660
So hij is a tensor
but with no trace.

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:37.320
And it's defined so that if I
take it's divergence, I get 0.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:43.320
So this guy has 6
independent components.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.242
This is 1 constraint.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.220
This is 3 constraints, right?

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.400
Because it holds for
every value of j.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:02.740
So this ends up giving
me 2 free functions.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.304
So as we sum all these up--

00:48:06.304 --> 00:48:08.190
let's see, did I
miss anyone here?

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:15.540
Right.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:30.330
So I have totally
characterized h mu nu

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:40.464
by a set of scalar, vector,
and tensor functions.

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:49.390
I have a scalar phi,
which I have over here

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.850
with my time-time piece.

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:55.580
I have a scalar gamma.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.930
I have a vector, beta i.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:08.220
I have a scalar h, a scalar
lambda, a vector epsilon i,

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:13.910
and finally, a tensor hij tt.

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:14.410
OK?

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:16.553
So what I've done is--

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.640
let me just step
back for a second.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.320
What I've been doing
in this exercise

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.140
is trying to figure
out with respect

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:26.410
to its behavior under
rotations and then

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:29.010
just because it'll prove to
be convenient in a moment

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:34.330
its behavior when I sort of
look at casting quantities

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:37.210
in this irreducible
form that involves

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:40.655
divergence-free vectors
and gradients of scalars.

00:49:40.655 --> 00:49:42.280
This is sort of the
equivalent of doing

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.950
that for a tensor function.

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:48.820
The 10 independent
components in h mu nu

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.560
have now been encapsulated by--

00:49:50.560 --> 00:50:01.470
I've got one function here 1
here, 2 here, 1 here, 1 here 2

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:04.200
here, 2 here.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:09.720
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.530
So all I've done is rewrite
those 10 independent components

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:17.340
of h mu nu into a form,
that as we're going to see,

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:21.570
is particularly convenient for
allowing us to understand what

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.312
the gauge invariant degrees
of freedom in spacetime

00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:25.770
are, at least in
linearized theory.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:38.920
All right, so, so far,
all I've really done

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:48.040
is rewrite my metric using
a set of auxiliary variables

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:51.610
that might look a
little bit crazy.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:59.650
What we would like
to do is examine

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:01.960
what my linearized
Einstein field

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.250
equation looks like in terms
of all of these new fields.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:31.050
So in terms of the phi gamma
beta h lambda epsilon hij tt,

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:33.480
I would like to run this
through the mechanism,

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.700
make my Einstein field
equation, but express it

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.110
in terms of these things.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:39.475
We'll see why that
is in just a moment.

00:51:39.475 --> 00:51:41.850
But before I do this, we have
to be a little bit careful.

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:44.250
We have 10 functions here.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.630
We have 4 gauge
degrees of freedom.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:48.130
And the whole point
of this exercise

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:51.450
is to try to understand
how to deal with the fact

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:54.720
that a gauge that is convenient
for doing my calculation

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.690
may leave me with
a result that is

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:59.580
confusing in terms
of the physics

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.780
I'm trying to understand.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:07.960
So what we're going
to do is say that I

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:21.880
can take my generator of a
gauge transformation, xi alpha.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.820
I can write this since
I have chosen time

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.520
and space coordinates.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:30.310
I can break it into a time-like
piece and a spatial piece.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.260
I'm going to say that the
timeline piece is some scalar

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:42.910
field A. And spatial piece
looks like a vector field B

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:48.820
sub i plus the gradient
of some scalar c.

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:55.140
And I'm going to require
Di Bi to be equal to 0.

00:53:11.607 --> 00:53:22.520
The reason why I'm doing this is
these functions that I came up

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:26.930
with, my phis and gammas and
betas and epsilons, whatever,

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:33.460
they are going to change
if I introduce a gauge

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.701
transformation.

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:44.760
So suppose I change
gauge as we learned how

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.010
to do in the previous lecture.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.440
When you do this,
what you discover

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:08.450
is the function phi changes
to the original phi,

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:11.820
so something that looks like the
time derivative of that scalar

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:23.390
A. The beta picks up a term
that looks like the time

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:33.620
derivative of the
vector field B. Gamma

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:38.570
goes to gamma minus A
minus time derivative of c.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.920
H goes to H minus 2
nabla square root of c.

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:05.430
So all of these functions
that we sort of cleverly

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:10.080
introduced trying to write these
different pieces of the metric

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:14.400
of spacetime in an irreducible
form, when we change gauge,

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:18.790
they change in this way.

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:20.210
I left one out.

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:32.760
It turns out when you change
gauge, hij tt goes to hij tt.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.366
This piece is actually
gauge invariant.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.200
That's really interesting,
because that tells me

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:56.600
that once I have
worked out my field

00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.860
equations, the piece
of it that describes

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.470
this transverse
and traceless piece

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:08.720
of the metric
perturbation, it has

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.300
meaning in any representation
that I write down.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:15.260
So the piece that
looks radiative in one

00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:17.120
representation, in
fact, is radiative

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.703
in all representations.

00:56:18.703 --> 00:56:20.120
We still have to
figure out what's

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.370
going on with all this stuff.

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:21.550
OK?

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:23.210
So we have a little
bit more work to do.

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:25.752
But we've just learned something
very interesting about this.

00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:41.780
So at this point, there's
really no simple way

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.610
to describe what you do next.

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:45.950
Honest to god, what
you essentially do

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:50.540
is you just stare at
these things for a while.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:55.520
And you start to notice that
there are certain combinations

00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.980
of these different
functions that, like hij tt,

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.880
certain combinations of
them are gauge invariant.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:57.370
So if I define capital Phi to
be little phi plus the time

00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:07.550
derivative of my gamma minus
1/2 2 derivatives of lambda,

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:17.270
if I define theta as 1/2 h minus
Laplace operator on lambda.

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:23.760
I define the vector
field, psi i to be

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:29.040
beta i minus 1/2 epsilon i--

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:35.620
note, this vector field
is divergence-free--

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.340
and, of course, hij tt.

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:49.200
Every one of these combinations
is unchanged under a gauge

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.417
transformation.

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.100
But let's note something.

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.600
Phi is a scalar field.

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.450
Theta is a scalar field.

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:48.590
So I have 1 plus 1 functions
associated with them.

00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:54.460
This is a
divergence-free vector.

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:08.500
So it has 3 minus 1 degrees
of freedom associated with it.

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:17.840
And hij, this is traceless
and divergence free.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.320
And as I already
counted up, this guy

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:31.540
has 6 minus 1 minus 3 degrees
of freedom in it, also 2.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.060
So when I characterize
the gauge invariant

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.070
degrees of freedom
in the spacetime,

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:38.040
I've only got 6 functions left.

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:48.650
But this is good, right?

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:52.610
My original 10 degrees of
freedom in the spacetime metric

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:55.670
are characterized by these
sort of 6 fundamental degrees

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:57.620
of freedom in the
gravitational field

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:02.000
plus 4 gauge degrees of
freedom that are bound up

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.735
in my gauge generators.

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:14.730
So what I would
like to do is see

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:17.280
if I can write
the Einstein field

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.868
equations in terms of
these gauge invariant

01:01:20.868 --> 01:01:21.660
degrees of freedom.

01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:42.600
And you know what, I'm going
to write it in its full form.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.350
We're, of course, going
to linearize this.

01:01:48.177 --> 01:01:50.010
But what I'm going to
do is take this thing,

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:57.510
write it in linearized gravity,
using my gauge invariant

01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:58.140
variables.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.140
Before I do this,
it's really helpful

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:14.260
to first decompose
the stress energy

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:19.435
tensor in a manner similar to
how we decomposed our metric.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:34.080
So what I'm going to do is
I've chosen time and space

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.353
directions.

01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:38.020
So I'm going to call
the time-time piece

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.530
rho in energy density.

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:45.530
The timespace piece, we
know that this tells me

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.090
something about
the flow of energy

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:48.790
or the density of momentum.

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:57.440
And I'm going to write this
as a divergence-free vector

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.150
plus a gradient of some scalar.

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:05.840
And I am going to describe
the space-space piece

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:12.700
as an isotropic pressure,
an anisotropic term--

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.450
I'm going to give you
a constraint on this

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:15.200
in just a moment--

01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:29.070
some kind of a gradient
of a vector field,

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:32.700
and then a second order
trace free operator

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.500
acting on a scalar.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:47.760
So, yeah, I'm going
to want to introduce

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.110
a couple of constraints here.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.624
I'm going to require--

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:58.950
I've already written
out that the ISI is 0--

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:05.320
I'm also going to require
that the divergence of sigma

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:13.970
be equal to 0, the divergence
of the sigma ij be equal to 0.

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:18.420
And I'm going to require
that the trace of this

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.490
trace be equal to zero.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:25.890
Let me strongly emphasize
that really all I'm doing

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:27.750
is rearranging terms.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:30.390
I'm just trying to rewrite the
components of my stress energy

01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:34.620
tensor using this
decomposition under rotations

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.420
and then looking
at fields that can

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:39.300
be written as divergence-free
vectors plus gradients

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.610
of scalars.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.420
And I have a typo.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.220
I'm just trying to do this
in a way that parallels

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.022
what I did for the metric.

01:04:49.022 --> 01:04:49.522
OK?

01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:19.020
Before I do this,
don't forget that I

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:26.510
am required to make sure that my
stress energy tensor satisfies

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:31.070
a law of local conservation
of energy and momentum.

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:40.360
When we do this, what we find
is that these various things

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.180
that I introduced here, some of
them are related to each other.

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:50.530
So in particular, what you find
is the Laplace operator on s

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:56.290
is equal to the time derivative
of the density, the energy

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:57.920
density.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:05.450
Laplace operator
on the scalar sigma

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:12.950
is related to the pressure and
the time derivative of this s.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:25.360
Finally, Laplace
operator on that sigma i

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.680
is related to also
the time derivative

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:33.020
of this derivative of si.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.803
What this tells us is that--

01:06:34.803 --> 01:06:37.220
so I really want to make sure
people don't get too hung up

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:37.720
on this.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:41.350
This is really just sort
of the a convenient way

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.565
of reorganizing the
information in those terms.

01:06:43.565 --> 01:06:45.190
But if you do want
to think about this,

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:54.940
this is telling us that only
rho, p, si, and sigma ij

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.530
are freely specifiable.

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:06.450
If you know these, there's a
total of 6 functions here--

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:11.220
1 scalar, 1 scalar, 3
vectors minus 1 constraint,

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.750
6 tensors minus 4
constraints, because this is

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:16.060
divergenceless and trace-free.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.730
These are the only ones
that are freely specifiable.

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:25.580
They determine the
other 4 fields.

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:30.290
OK?

01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:33.980
So density, pressure,
kind of an energy flow,

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.405
and anisotropic stresses.

01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:43.210
OK, redemption is at hand.

01:07:56.610 --> 01:08:01.790
Take all of the framework
that we developed

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:04.190
and that we discussed
in the previous lecture.

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.920
And let's grind
out the components

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:07.920
of the Einstein tensors.

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:17.702
Doing so to linear
order in h, which

01:08:17.702 --> 01:08:20.160
is equivalent to saying linear
order in all of these fields

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.279
that we've introduced,
what you find

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:31.560
is Gtt minus Laplace operator
times this field theta.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:44.109
Gti is minus 1/2 Laplace
operator on this vector field

01:08:44.109 --> 01:08:52.448
psi minus the time derivative,
the gradient of the time

01:08:52.448 --> 01:08:53.490
derivative of your theta.

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:06.729
And Gij, it's like
a wave operator

01:09:06.729 --> 01:09:08.140
on the tt piece of your metric.

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:42.490
OK, that's a lot.

01:09:46.327 --> 01:09:47.660
Let's equate them to the source.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:06.990
And we'll take advantage of
the fact that when you do this,

01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:09.470
you're always going to
associate like with like, OK?

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:11.570
Terms that are
divergence-free, you're

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.862
going to equate to a source
that is divergence-free,

01:10:13.862 --> 01:10:14.570
things like that.

01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:27.550
This completely characterizes
the Einstein field equations,

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:29.680
solutions to the
Einstein field equations

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.540
in linearized gravity.

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:36.460
Now, I want to make a couple
of remarks about this.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:39.190
Part of what was the motivation
for this entire lecture

01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:44.690
was this observation that when
we solve the field equations

01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:50.820
using the radiative Green's
function, by construction,

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:54.120
the entire spacetime solution
had this radiative character

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.560
associated with it.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.290
Everything sort of
fell off as 1 over r

01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:01.770
and had a time dependence
that reflected a time

01:12:01.770 --> 01:12:04.260
delay, the time it takes
for radiation to travel

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:06.960
from the source to the point
at which the field is being

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.160
measured.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:14.220
But we saw via this
electrodynamic example

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:16.560
that we put up just
for intuition's sake,

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.690
that it's entirely
possible to have

01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:23.520
a totally non-radiative field
that looks radiative basically

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.730
because we chose a gauge that
masked its physical character.

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:30.050
This was a lengthy and--

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:32.420
I'll be blunt-- a somewhat
advanced calculation.

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.520
I do not expect everyone
to be able to follow

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.520
this in great detail.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.110
But I want you to understand how
we got to this final end result

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:40.160
here.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.640
By decomposing the
spacetime, the perturbation

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.710
to spacetime in
linearized theory,

01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:52.690
into sort of as irreducible as
possible a set of functions,

01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:56.410
we found that there
are exactly 6 degrees

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:59.450
of freedom in that spacetime
that are completely

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:01.420
gauge invariant.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:06.080
These functions, they
will have this form.

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.940
They will obey these equations.

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.610
In principle, you can
solve these things

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:14.080
and understand how these
fields behave no matter

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.430
what gauge you are working in.

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:19.600
And what we see is 2
degrees of freedom--

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.510
remember, hij tt
is a 3 by 3 tensor,

01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:24.430
but its traceless and
its divergenceless.

01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:27.340
So there's actually only 2
degrees of freedom here--

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.910
it is indeed a wave equation.

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:33.010
It is the only
piece of the metric

01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:36.460
that is a wave
equation in every gauge

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.350
and in every representation.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:41.800
All other gravitational degrees
of freedom obey something

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.660
more like a Poisson equation.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:47.030
These are non-radiative.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:48.337
This is radiative.

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:53.600
The way that we are going to
use this-- the next thing which

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.450
I want to talk about is
gravitational radiation.

01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:58.010
And what this
calculation told you

01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:01.740
is that if you are interested
in gravitational radiation,

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:06.080
this is the only piece of
the spacetime and the source

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.980
that you need to
be concerned about.

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:12.020
If you solve that
equation, it will give you

01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.780
the gauge invariant
radiative degrees of freedom

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:19.710
in a spacetime no matter
what representation you use.

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:24.390
So we are going to-- for
the next couple of lectures,

01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:27.740
we are going to focus on this.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:32.390
We're going to show how we
can sort of solve the Einstein

01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:36.050
field equations in a
particularly convenient gauge

01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:39.350
and then say, all
right, I know I've now

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:42.260
got these 10 functions.

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.540
Four of them are
just purely things

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.240
I can get rid of by
choosing my gauge.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.120
There's only six that are
sort of truly physical.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:54.200
Of those six, four of them
don't constitute true radiative

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.040
degrees of freedom.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.230
There's only 2 degrees
of freedom in my solution

01:14:57.230 --> 01:14:58.992
that described radiation.

01:14:58.992 --> 01:15:00.950
We're going to talk about
how to pull them out,

01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:05.630
how to characterize them, and
the important physical content

01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:08.150
that this gravitational
radiation carries.

01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:11.780
So in a nutshell, you
should take this lecture

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:21.080
as demonstrating that in
a very deep way spacetime

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.790
always has some kind of a
radiative component associated

01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:24.290
with it.

01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:25.790
But it's really
only encapsulated

01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:29.090
in 2 degrees of freedom
in the spacetime.

01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:30.230
It may look otherwise.

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:32.630
But just be careful
that because your gauge

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:35.786
has confused you essentially.

01:15:35.786 --> 01:15:39.670
And with that, I will
stop this lecture here.

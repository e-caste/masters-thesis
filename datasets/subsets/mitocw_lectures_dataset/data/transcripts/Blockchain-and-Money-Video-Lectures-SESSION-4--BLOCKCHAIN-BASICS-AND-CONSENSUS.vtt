00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:24.840
GARY GENSLER: Hello, everybody.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.890
Good weekend?

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.080
Everybody staying dry, I hope.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.610
So we're going to dive back
in to blockchain, money.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.810
And we didn't lose
too many people

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.290
when we did cryptographic
hash functions

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.080
and digital
signatures last week.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.370
So I thank you for
all being back.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.600
So what were today's
study questions again?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.340
What's the Byzantine
Generals problem?

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.720
Anybody want to tell me what the
Byzantine Generals problem is?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.558
Ben.

00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:08.350
AUDIENCE: So, the
Byzantine General problem

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.750
is this sort of general
mathematical puzzle.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.310
And basically, what it is is,
how do you coordinate actors

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.370
when they may be an actor
who's not acting in the best

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.300
interests of the group--

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.430
how do you sort of get a
good actor on that then?

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.470
GARY GENSLER: So there--

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.510
it might be how to coordinate
when somebody is not

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.940
acting in good faith
as a malicious actor.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.090
But it also might be
just somebody that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.860
doesn't get the communication.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.920
Somebody that-- there's a
thought, whether it's malicious

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.230
or not.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.130
How we doing, Alene?

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.690
Yeah.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.170
How does proof of work and
mining in Bitcoin address it?

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.730
We're going to
walk through this,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.810
and I'm going to give
you my sense of it.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.160
But does anybody want to
give a short version--

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.500
prepared for a--

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.410
Brodush.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.270
AUDIENCE: So the
proposed way solves it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.400
in a probabilistic way, rather
than a deterministic way,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.730
using amount of
CPU power to solve

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.440
a problem of certain complexity
to prove that one consensus has

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.260
been reached by a majority
of the participants.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.260
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.590
So what Brodush said is
it's probabilistic instead

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.420
of deterministic.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.230
That you use CPU power
to form some consensus.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.930
I think that's what you said.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.960
I'm going to walk through
this in more detail.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.540
But does anybody want to
give another shot at it?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.390
AUDIENCE: I could say so
when a transaction happens,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.900
it is posted.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.040
And then miners get
in, and that they

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.090
try to compete in solving this.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.130
And whoever gets it first,
then he claims the award.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.560
I would also say it requires
a lot of CPU processing power.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.560
I'm quoting the [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.610
So it needs to be powered.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.350
Big computers.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.850
So there is a question
around [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.010
GARY GENSLER: So remind
me your first name?

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.420
AUDIENCE: Riham.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.656
GARY GENSLER: Riham.

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:37.940
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.460
GARY GENSLER: Riham says
it's about people called

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.560
miners or computers
called miners,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.130
which we'll talk about today,
using computer power again.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.110
But transactions were
part of that as well as

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.230
to how it comes together.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.650
I'm not going to torture you
and ask a bunch more but, Addy?

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.410
AUDIENCE: I think one of
the other important ideas

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.230
is that even though solving
the problem is really hard,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.910
validating that the
solution is correct is easy.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.010
So what is ensured is that
even though miners are thinking

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.890
about the computing power
to solve [INAUDIBLE],,

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.230
it can propagate it [INAUDIBLE]
and then validate it.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.062
GARY GENSLER: So a
key point that Addy--

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:28.020
Addy raises is that once
somebody solves the puzzle,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.870
it can be propagated
across a network.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.590
And then others on the
network can validate it.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.960
So what we'll talk
about a little bit later

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.900
is that it's a hard
puzzle to solve,

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.370
but an easy puzzle to verify.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.750
And this is an important
asymmetry in essence,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.290
that there's a lot of
resources to solve a puzzle,

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.630
but once knowing
the answer, there's

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.570
very limited resources to verify
that it's the right answer.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.870
If it was not asymmetric,
it would not work as well.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.710
So it's a key part of the design
of many cryptographic things,

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.490
but particularly, Adam
Back's sort of novelty

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.660
in the 1990s of proof of work.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.230
I don't know if that's
just a relaxed bit for you,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.908
or you have your
hands up, Derek.

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:25.616
AUDIENCE: Ah, no.

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:26.116
That's--

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:28.240
GARY GENSLER: That's
just a relaxed pose.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.640
I like it.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.660
We're going to talk about other
consensus protocols as well.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.310
Proof of work is not the
only consensus protocol,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.710
but how to address ourselves
to Byzantine fault tolerance.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.080
And then some of the
economic incentives, so we'll

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.640
talk about the native currency.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.850
What's the native currency
of the first blockchain

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.344
application?

00:05:51.344 --> 00:05:52.700
AUDIENCE: Bitcoin.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.790
GARY GENSLER: Bitcoin.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.040
How many of you in this
room have owned a Bitcoin

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.220
at some point in time?

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.400
So you've all owned
the native currency

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.560
that helps a blockchain.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.610
You got the opportunity to
read a paper that a group of us

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.590
here at MIT co-authored.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.940
I hope some of you actually
were able to download it and--

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.230
good.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.090
Apparently, even when
you write something,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.290
it still goes behind
a copyright wall.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.510
So I'm glad to know that
it was actually available.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.750
And then back to the National
Institute of Standards

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.180
and Technology paper as well--

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.460
this time the next chapters.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.980
And then a paper from
about 25 years ago

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.605
on the Byzantine
Generals problem itself.

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:49.050
So what are we
going to do today?

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.730
We're going to go back
through the design.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.690
We're going to talk about
consensus through proof of work

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.050
Bitcoin mining-- it's important.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.830
It's relevant.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.770
But it's kind of some fun
facts about that as well.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.830
The native currency-- of
course, Bitcoin of the first.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.120
But there's now at least 1600
different native currencies.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.620
What does it mean
to have a network?

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.090
And why do networks matter
particularly for blockchain?

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.910
Some of the other consensus
protocols, and then just wrap

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.560
up.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.330
So just going back
to the review,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.670
and this is what we talked
about a bit on Thursday.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.770
But I think it's relevant to
just kind of bring it back.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.200
I found when I was
first learning this,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.900
it's hard to keep
all the moving parts.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.210
Remember, there's--
that graphic,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.940
you'll see all semester.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.430
But it's all the
different blocks.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.380
And it's append only.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.910
What does append only mean?

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.560
Andrew.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.660
Why does that matter, this
word append only that we

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.875
talked about last Thursday?

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:51.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.960
So that it's immutable.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.917
It cannot be changed.

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:54.750
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.000
So it's immutable.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.350
Now, of course, because
cryptography maybe can be

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.130
broken, but we use the word
immutable that it cannot be

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.020
changed, except for
maybe as Alene so--

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.880
I like that that's in his book.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.530
You all have to see this.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.490
This is very clever.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.690
You know, a little--

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.130
how to do a flag.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.680
Maybe it's immutable
except for one out of 10

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.970
to the 40th times it could
be broken or something.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.720
AUDIENCE: Can I interject
and actually say

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.340
that it's not that
good, actually.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.770
So technically,
Bitcoin and all of

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.929
these permissionless
cryptocurrencies, one way

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.226
to attack them is to mine--

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:39.135
to get a lot of
mining power and mine.

00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:40.510
But another way
to attack them is

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.385
to just take control
over the actual network,

00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:43.419
like the internet.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.510
So if you're an internet service
provider, or if you're China,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.080
you can actually fork Bitcoin
with zero mining power

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.990
by just controlling the network.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.170
So there's actually
an assumption

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.670
behind how this
thing works, which

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.040
is that the network works.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.120
Because everybody
sees the messages.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.070
GARY GENSLER: I agree with you.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.630
But there's also
some assumptions--

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.890
let's say that China,
or any state actor,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:11.410
chose to fork one of these.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.428
If it's considerably
less than a majority--

00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:16.970
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.850
Zero mining.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.100
You can fork with zero mining.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.002
You won't get any mining charge,
if you control the network.

00:09:22.002 --> 00:09:24.460
GARY GENSLER: If you control
the worldwide network, or just

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:24.990
the network--

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.600
AUDIENCE: Not the
mining network.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.575
The actual internet.

00:09:26.575 --> 00:09:27.700
GARY GENSLER: I understand.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.410
Are you talking about
the worldwide internet,

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.250
or you're talking about
one country's internet?

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.750
AUDIENCE: Let's say
you're in China.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.500
There's 50% of Chinese
miners in China.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.130
I forbid these Chinese miners
to broadcast with blocks.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.850
They find a block
that goes here,

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.150
and they find another block
that goes here, it goes here,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.075
and it goes there.

00:09:43.075 --> 00:09:45.450
The rest of the world will
find the block that goes here.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.090
I have a fork.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.890
It goes here and here,
and I have two forks.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.020
They don't see each other.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.640
GARY GENSLER: So
we're going to talk

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.980
about forks a little later.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.145
Can we hold Alene's
point until then?

00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:55.770
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.120
Sure.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.412
GARY GENSLER: And then I'm
going to share with you what

00:09:58.412 --> 00:10:02.505
Satoshi Nakamoto wrote about
this very issue back in 2010.

00:10:02.505 --> 00:10:03.880
AUDIENCE: And he
was writing back

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.047
where you have mining power.

00:10:05.047 --> 00:10:07.340
He was assuming
the network works.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.350
Again, just to clarify.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.390
GARY GENSLER: Alene's raising
a point as to whether somebody

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.540
captures part of the internet.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.500
And if the internet itself, by
capturing part of the internet,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:27.110
you fork the blockchain.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.110
And what I was just--

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.980
said I would hold for later,
but instead I'll cover now,

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.190
is this question was
raised in an email exchange

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:42.830
with whomever Satoshi Nakamoto
was back in around 2010.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:49.050
And his answer to
Alene's question

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.670
that I'm just helping
share with you all,

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.410
is that as long as that
part of the internet that

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.910
was walled off was less than
a majority, and in fact,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.300
if it was China, because that
was in the example even eight

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.190
years ago, it would be
considerably less than 50%,

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.890
that within a reasonable
amount of time,

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.220
maybe it would take a few hours,
but within a reasonable amount

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:22.400
of time, one chain
would be where

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.910
the majority of the
mining power was.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.900
And that it could take a
while, but the other one

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.240
would probably stop,
that people would

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.830
stop investing electricity
and CPU time within China,

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.800
because they would
realize some way.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.830
Now, that was the
theory at least.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.440
AUDIENCE: And just to add onto
that, something to realize

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.630
is like if you--

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.620
I mean, like, you said
we'll go into forks.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.760
But just for people
who don't know,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.870
like if you go in one
fork, then anything

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.400
after that you go in all forks.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.840
So like if you lose connection
to the main Bitcoin network,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.730
you'll still have that, as long
as you have your private keys.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.280
So if somebody in China
realizes that they're

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.947
on the wrong chain,
it's not like you've

00:12:05.947 --> 00:12:09.050
lost your actual bitcoin.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.280
GARY GENSLER: That's correct.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.530
They won't lose it up to,
if I can use the term, prior

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:16.220
to the fork.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.470
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.970
GARY GENSLER: Was a question?

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.950
Brodush.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.940
AUDIENCE: So just to add to
Alene's point, essentially.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.340
So the way he said--

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.580
GARY GENSLER: Since you're in
the back of the room, speak up.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.205
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:29.205 --> 00:12:31.030
So to add to Alene's
point actually.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.640
So there's an assumption,
underlying assumption,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.100
for the--

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.920
that the real problem in the
context of blockchain is--

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.440
you have the assumption that
the network can actually

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.820
verify that the--

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.202
what is being--

00:12:47.202 --> 00:12:50.757
[INAUDIBLE] what the network
is actually valid information.

00:12:50.757 --> 00:12:52.590
So that is kind of an
underlying assumption.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.710
If the network is
contaminated, then the premise

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.760
on which the problem
is being solved,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.080
or the protocol that is being
given here as a solution

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.040
to the problem, is
actually not valid

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.360
if the network is contaminated.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.577
So that way, it is indeed
a underlying [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:07.577 --> 00:13:09.660
GARY GENSLER: So I think,
because I didn't pick up

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.870
every word, you're
just saying that there

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.850
is an underlying
assumption that the network

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.300
protocol, the communication
protocol of the internet,

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.880
is not compromised
or walled off.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.250
But also, that it's working.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.660
It creates a database.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.910
We've talked about it
through hash functions

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:33.900
and digital signatures,
and then consensus.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.550
So what were the
technical features?

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.340
I thought about it a little
bit from our last class

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.210
to help just thinking
through in three buckets--

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.130
the cryptography
and timestamping

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.418
that we talked
about last Thursday;

00:13:47.418 --> 00:13:48.960
what we're going to
talk about today,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.610
the decentralized consensus
protocols and the network,

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.230
of course, and the
native currency;

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.590
and then lastly, transaction
script that we're going to talk

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.690
about this coming Thursday.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.560
Now, it's not just three buckets
because it's three lectures.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.380
But it's three buckets
because they have something

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.950
to do with each other.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:13.500
The cryptography, which is at
the core of cryptocurrencies

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.650
and blockchains, and is
the core of a lot of things

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.970
on the internet today, the
consensus mechanism, and then

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.220
the transaction script itself.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.490
Cryptography, as
we've talked about--

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.280
communications in the presence
of adversaries-- also,

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.890
a form of ways to make
commitments and secure

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.540
computation.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.400
Hash functions, if you
recall what we talked about.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.160
What's the key of
a hash function?

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.660
Here.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.386
Joaquin.

00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:50.595
AUDIENCE: The key
of hash function?

00:14:50.595 --> 00:14:52.330
GARY GENSLER: One--
the elevator pitch.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.370
You just have to make sure
that your sibling knows you.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:56.870
What's that?

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.640
AUDIENCE: If you have two, the
private and the public key.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.830
That's a good--
that's cryptography,

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:03.950
but not a hash function.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:04.492
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.320
AUDIENCE: It's a
fingerprint of a fixed

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.297
length of any amount of data.

00:15:14.297 --> 00:15:15.380
GARY GENSLER: I like that.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.210
One way data compression--

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.820
a crossword puzzle.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.350
Anybody here do the New
York Times crossword puzzle

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.602
on a mobile app?

00:15:24.602 --> 00:15:26.420
Good.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.610
So if you do a Wednesday's New
York Times crossword puzzle,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.460
does it tell you whether
you're correct on Wednesday?

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.820
Or does it not tell
you you're correct?

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.810
When does it-- I don't
do the New York Times

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.770
crossword puzzles.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:39.270
But--

00:15:41.415 --> 00:15:42.040
AUDIENCE: Erin.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:42.660
GARY GENSLER: Erin.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.980
AUDIENCE: I'm actually-- I
usually do ones in the past.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.800
But I think it
will tell you maybe

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.120
either that day or the next
day, or maybe [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.060
GARY GENSLER: Stephanie.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.435
AUDIENCE: So it
tells you as soon

00:15:51.435 --> 00:15:54.530
as you finish the puzzle whether
or not you have any errors.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.540
But it won't-- but you can't
actually check what the errors

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.530
are unless you want to
invalidate your streak for that

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.140
day.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.900
So basically, you get a streak
every time you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.025
GARY GENSLER: I don't
actually know if the New York

00:16:06.025 --> 00:16:07.200
Times use hash functions.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.260
But they could.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.300
They could, because
they could stick

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.840
the whole entire crossword
puzzle into a hash,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.220
and it's a commitment scheme.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.540
And remember, if you change even
one thing in the input data,

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.850
the hash will come
out differently.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.193
So the New York Times
could use a hash function,

00:16:31.193 --> 00:16:32.860
so that Stephanie
could find out, right?

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.530
Because you can only push
to see if it's correct

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.350
when you finish the whole.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.840
And it either tells you
you have it or not, right?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.680
So I'm just--

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.190
I'm bringing it to real life
that a hash function-- just

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.020
think of the New York
Times crossword puzzle.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.450
And if you don't
remember, ask Stephanie.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.206
We talked about
append-only logs.

00:16:57.206 --> 00:17:01.390
And recall that in
blockchain, in Bitcoin, there

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.339
is a bunch of information
in the head of the block.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.349
And that which is in
the head of the block

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.319
is put together like the New
York Times crossword puzzle.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.700
And we have a chain of blocks.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:22.980
Most of the data, though, is
stored efficiently in something

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.180
called a Merkle tree.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.120
Again, it uses a whole
lot of hash functions.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.640
And so it's a way
to be efficient,

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.610
but it's also a way
to secure the data.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.090
So now, we're going to get
back to your favorite thing--

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.130
digital signatures.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.400
So what's a digital
signature do?

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.600
AUDIENCE: You can prove that
you're signing something

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.130
like a transaction
with your private key.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.928
And the other person
on the outside

00:17:58.928 --> 00:18:00.470
could prove that
you are the one that

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.120
signed it with your public key.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.230
GARY GENSLER: Perfect.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.200
So it guards against
tampering and impersonation.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.880
I didn't go through
this last Thursday,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.610
but think of digital
signatures two different ways--

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.796
a digital signature that
you use without a hash,

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:21.140
and in Bitcoin and blockchain,
often it's actually-- it's

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.150
combined with a hash.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.270
So as Joaquin just
went through, you

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.930
can have a private key that
you sign something with,

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:36.630
the sender's public key, and
a signature, and exactly that.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.620
But it's also able to do it
where you have a hash as well.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.780
You take all the
data, all the message,

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.200
and you've put it into
it with a signature.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.760
And this is a little
bit too complex,

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.350
and it was last
Thursday's lecture,

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.700
but it's important to know that
what blockchain is basically

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.500
doing, most
blockchains do, is they

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.970
take a lot of information,
a transaction for instance,

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.420
hash that information.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.740
And why do we hash it again?

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.500
Kelly?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.070
AUDIENCE: To protect it from
other users of the network,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.852
sort of like we talked
about Alice and Bob,

00:19:16.852 --> 00:19:19.490
and how one has to be
aware of each other's key,

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.720
and then back verify
the incoming message.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.760
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.950
And it also compresses
some of the data.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.800
But it's a commitment scheme.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.960
It's like this is it.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.860
This is actually the New
York Times crossword puzzle

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.750
that answers all the questions.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.000
So usually it first hashes
it, meaning it's a commitment.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.800
And then put a digital
signature on it.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.240
And there was one last thing
we talked about last week.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.710
What are Bitcoin addresses?

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.529
Isabella, can you tell me
when a Bitcoin address is?

00:19:59.529 --> 00:20:02.490
AUDIENCE: Umm.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.300
Is that what-- like,
I guess tells you

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.023
where the Bitcoins being sent.

00:20:08.023 --> 00:20:10.440
GARY GENSLER: So it tells you
where Bitcoin is being sent.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.750
Ben, you want to
help out a little.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.160
AUDIENCE: So it's the
public hash, public key?

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.800
Public hash of the--

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.480
GARY GENSLER: It's close.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.100
So it's basically that--

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.620
between Isabelle and
Ben, you've got it.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:31.170
It's basically how any
of the native currency--

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.020
Bitcoin-- can be identified.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.880
But it is a public key
with a couple extra hashes,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.150
and a little bit
other fancy footwork

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.880
to make it compressed
and smaller.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.720
But it is literally what
you can send Bitcoins to.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.890
So it's determined by the public
key, but it's not identical to.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.730
And I found a fancy
little chart to define it.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:06.800
A private key leads to a
public key through some form.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.110
And in Bitcoin, it's called
elliptic curve multiplication.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.370
But there are other forms
of public and private keys.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.780
The public key,
then it gets hashed.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:23.110
And then it goes through a code
that makes it shorter, which

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.940
is the Bitcoin address.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.968
Part of the reason
it was hashed,

00:21:26.968 --> 00:21:29.260
and part of the reason it
goes through that extra code,

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.625
is to make it even more secure.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.300
It's not the only reason.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.970
It also compresses
it a bit more.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.610
But those of you who
have ever owned Bitcoin,

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:41.630
you have a wallet.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.750
And the wallet keeps
those Bitcoin addresses.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.250
All right.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.620
So now let's talk about
decentralized networks,

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.760
the topic of today.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.067
Any questions about the
review for last Thursday?

00:21:53.067 --> 00:21:53.900
I know it was quick.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.400
Alon?

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.990
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the double hash part.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:01.660
Does that mean that it's
now less feasible to be,

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.560
like, less immutable?

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.020
Because if you take
a 24-digit hash,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:12.680
and you contract it to a 4-digit
hash, there's fewer options.

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:17.000
GARY GENSLER: I think that
you're-- the question is,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.190
is if the output of a
hash function is shorter,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.700
is it possibly more breakable?

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.260
I think mathematically,
that might be correct.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.940
However, this actually
goes through two hashes--

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:40.350
one, which is this
mechanism called SHA-256.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:47.880
And the other one, I'm going to
mispronounce, but down to 160.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.900
So I think because it's going
through two different hashes,

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.630
the answer is it's even
harder to break both.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.130
Does that--

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.250
AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.550
GARY GENSLER: Any other
questions about the review?

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.880
No.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.650
Please.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.580
Derek.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.900
AUDIENCE: So you said
hashing the public key

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.420
makes it more secure.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.250
I'm just wondering, because the
public key is for the public.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.810
So what is the-- where does
the added security come from?

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.320
GARY GENSLER: So the only thing
that you're actually showing

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.080
is a Bitcoin address.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.170
Until later-- and we'll talk
a lot about this on Thursday--

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.030
when you actually
do a transaction,

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:31.140
you have to then
disclose your public key.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:36.720
So initially, the storage
is around Bitcoin addresses.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.790
And some will advise--

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.040
and it's why many
wallets do this--

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.320
that you should never use
the same public key twice.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.100
Though, numerous people
do in blockchains.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.340
But to be most secure,
you would constantly

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.650
be creating new public
key/private key pairs.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:03.390
And once you've used it, move
on and get a new set of keys.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.890
Got it?

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.025
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:06.025 --> 00:24:07.650
GARY GENSLER: So
distributed networks--

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.380
we talked about Byzantine
Generals problem.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.810
So I found some
Byzantine generals.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:18.360
They want to all
attack that castle.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.960
Or what if only three of
them do, and two of them

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.800
say retreat?

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.730
That's the visual.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.230
That's the problem.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.340
The only way to win in
this mathematical game

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.910
theory, a paper that was
written some 25 years ago,

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.110
is if they all said attack,
or all said retreat.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:44.470
But the same thing sort
of came to computers.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.710
And the core thing about
a permissionless system

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.040
is there is no
central authority.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.210
And if there's no
central authority,

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:55.450
how does a distributed
network, like the distributed

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.530
set of generals, come
to some agreement?

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.580
Do we attack?

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.940
Do we retreat?

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:08.270
Well, it's based on a consensus
protocol and a native currency.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.750
That's the key innovation
of Satoshi Nakamoto,

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.980
is to pull it all together.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.650
But it was built on the
backs of other people.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:26.290
Adam Back, in 1997,
he proposed a way

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.330
to address email
spam and other types

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.865
of computer problems called
denial of service attacks.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.730
Now, it ultimately wasn't used.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.730
I mean, he proposed it.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.480
It was used for a short
while, and then it

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.140
wasn't subsequently used.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.930
But it's important to understand
that the proof of work

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:50.640
in the middle of Bitcoin
was created 11 or 12 years

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.390
before the Bitcoin paper.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.820
And the key was
basically require

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:04.110
a bunch of computational
work using hash functions.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.800
And so the email, or the
header of the email-- this

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.750
is Adam Back's, not Bitcoin.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.750
But the email, or the
header of the email,

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.710
went into the hash
function, creates a hash.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:24.381
But the difficulty of finding
whether it's confirmed was

00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:28.200
was it in a certain
range of hashes?

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.870
And he did that by the
quote, "leading zeros."

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:36.700
Does anybody want to guess
why he did it this way?

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.610
Or Alene's just going to tell
us probably and not guess, but--

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.520
who hasn't spoken yet?

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.522
Emily, you want to try it out?

00:26:48.522 --> 00:26:51.660
AUDIENCE: I'm not totally sure.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.380
GARY GENSLER: Daniel?

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.560
AUDIENCE: I mean, I guess just,
like, preserve some privacy

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.688
around the emails?

00:26:58.688 --> 00:27:00.980
GARY GENSLER: Well, so it
definitely preserved privacy.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:05.030
But he was trying to put
some computational work.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.430
Every email that
would be sent would

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:12.090
take one to two or three
seconds of computational work.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.918
That was in his original paper.

00:27:13.918 --> 00:27:15.085
It would take a few seconds.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:21.800
AUDIENCE: The fact that we--

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.390
earlier we were
talking about the fact

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:27.220
that we need a way
in which we have

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:33.170
to make the puzzles difficult
to solve, but easy to validate.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.290
This is exactly how the
whole thing is accomplished,

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:42.150
by setting the hash into a fixed
characteristic, like leading--

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.050
a number of leading
zeros, what you get

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:49.400
is to modify a small piece
of the whole information,

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.290
and try and try until you
get that specific hash.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.870
And that makes it really
computational intensive,

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.650
but validating is just
running one hashing function.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:01.802
So--

00:28:01.802 --> 00:28:03.010
GARY GENSLER: Do you have a--

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.302
AUDIENCE: I mean, it comes
back to what we talked about

00:28:05.302 --> 00:28:07.700
last time with the nonces.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.700
You need to try out a bunch
of different random numbers

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.040
in order to get the right
number of leading zeros.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:13.970
And it could be--

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.020
I don't know.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.440
I think it could be
like leading anything.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.490
But he chose zero
because it's nice.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.170
But you need to try to
get the numbers in order

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.620
to get the right number.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.160
GARY GENSLER: And in
the email circumstance,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.860
his thought was it will take
two or three seconds for anyone

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.130
sending an email to
do this proof of work.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.040
But it will take a nanosecond
or less to confirm it.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.980
But if you were
sending spam, and you

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.280
had a computer to send
millions of spam times

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.290
two or three
seconds apiece, that

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.090
would be too much
for the spammer.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:48.050
That was it.

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:52.600
So any one person-- any
person sending one email,

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.200
it won't be too bad.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.400
Anyone sending millions of
emails, it would be lousy.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.860
And so that's why this concept
was in the midst of emails.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.870
And it could be
efficiently proved.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.350
So back to blockchain, the
innovation was basically,

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.390
how do we do this with a chain?

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.670
How do we do this with
a chain set of works?

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.910
And remember, Stuart
Haber, that whole thing

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:21.800
about the blockchain and
what's in the New York Times

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.055
was that chain of information.

00:29:24.055 --> 00:29:25.430
But here, why
don't we do a proof

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.250
of work between the chain?

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.380
And I found a little graphic.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:39.590
But the SHA-256, that's the
formula which is used to hash

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:40.610
the header--

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:46.920
the previous hash, the
transaction hash, a time stamp,

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.450
and a nonce.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.340
Can you find a hash that has
a certain number of leading

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.720
zeros?

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.240
This was the key innovation.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.470
In a sense, or maybe
Satoshi Nakamoto

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:04.960
was just taking Adam
Back's email proof of work.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:16.120
Remember the reading
for last week of blocks?

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.190
This is colored green
because each of them

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.460
have hashes that in
this case have leading,

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.750
if I'm right-- is this
leading four zeros?

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.590
Leading four zeros.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:31.712
What if we change one thing?

00:30:31.712 --> 00:30:32.670
What's going to happen?

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.040
Is it Alfa?

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.730
GARY GENSLER: What happens
if we change one thing?

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.010
AUDIENCE: The hash
should change completely.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.030
GARY GENSLER: The hash
will change completely.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.070
So what happened?

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.260
What did we change?

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.630
Here, I'll go back and forth.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.757
AUDIENCE: You changed the color.

00:30:56.757 --> 00:30:57.840
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.132
Zan?

00:30:59.132 --> 00:31:01.090
AUDIENCE: You changed
the coinbase transaction,

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.460
so that $100, I guess
in this example,

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.800
went to you instead
of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.680
GARY GENSLER: Well,
why shouldn't I

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.670
be able to get $100 for free?

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:12.190
AUDIENCE: Well,
in this example, I

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.265
guess the coinbase is
for the miner, right?

00:31:14.265 --> 00:31:16.000
So there's one
transaction dedicated

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.420
for whoever validates
the block, gets,

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.460
right now, 12 and 1/2 Bitcoin.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.130
And so you add that in addition
to all the other transactions

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.960
that you're validating.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.670
But in this case, you're
not actually this miner.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.750
So you shouldn't be
getting that much.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.670
GARY GENSLER: So the little
18-minute video that was

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.680
assigned for last Thursday, I
just went in, and I was trying

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.180
to--

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.000
I was trying to get--

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.160
I was trying to get
the money for me.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.970
And it invalidated
the rest of the chain.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:51.250
And that's really-- that's the
sort of innovation or genius

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:55.230
is, is if you try to
go into a former block,

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.330
whether it's the last block or
a block 100,000 blocks away,

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:04.540
and change one little
whisker of information,

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.180
or one letter on that
crossword puzzle,

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:12.870
it's going to change
the entire blockchain.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.090
And I bring it back to
the crossword puzzles,

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.490
or a whisker on a cat.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:22.640
It's just any little
bit of information.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.830
So an innovation
about hash functions

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:31.080
became, and an innovation
about timestamp blocks,

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.230
all of a sudden came
together with this proof

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.120
of work innovation.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.250
So now to the chains themselves.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.610
The consensus of
blockchains-- and many people

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.340
would say that, in fact,
the reality of blockchains

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:54.680
is only the longest chain is
the one that other miners,

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.895
other people, will build upon.

00:32:57.895 --> 00:32:59.270
As I understand,
though, it's not

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.800
written into the base
computational code.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.710
It's really just a
consensus that comes about.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:09.700
This is an example--

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:16.090
the purple block and
the black blocks.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.430
The purple blocks are
kind of stale blocks.

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.770
They were mined.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.810
They were computationally
solved a proof of work.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.030
But nobody mined on top of them.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.640
And if somebody doesn't
mine on top of them, then

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.080
eventually they're ignored.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.650
Some people call
them orphan blocks.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.630
But I'll call them stale
blocks, because they

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.270
were actually created.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.690
But the information that's
in them is kind of worthless.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.960
It's not needed.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.570
In the actual
Bitcoin technology,

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.100
this happens from time to time.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.870
But it hasn't happened
in over a year.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:59.460
The technology, it's-- and you
can look on various websites

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.110
to find this out.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:05.490
Probably at the maximum,
the longest stale chain

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.360
goes out to two or three blocks.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.630
But it's very, very rare.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:17.239
So back to Alene's question
of what if China carved off

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:22.790
and had the presumption--
it may not work--

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.520
but the presumption
is, let's say,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.980
China is the purple blocks.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.620
Because China's walled
off its entire network.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.100
The presumption is there'll
be some communication

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.360
outside of the network.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.639
It might be on television.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:43.110
It might be by courier, that
the Chinese miners would

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:46.350
know that they're
not in the majority,

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.620
and they would stop
expending electricity

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.770
to even mine in
that circumstance.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.710
Because whether it's a few hours
or a few weeks or a few months,

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.500
they know that
their expenditures

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.446
would be worthless.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:05.640
Tom.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.200
AUDIENCE: In these
stale blocks, these

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:15.270
forked blocks, are the
miners receiving Bitcoins?

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:19.310
GARY GENSLER: So in the
purple blocks, there will be,

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:23.330
if I can go back to this, there
will be a coinbase transaction.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.760
But it will be worthless.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.000
Because it's a coinbase
transaction in a block

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.580
that's not on the main block.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.280
And it won't be usable later.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:47.020
But in Bitcoin itself, there's
software that says you cannot

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:51.970
use a coinbase output
for 100 blocks.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:55.870
It's written right
into the base code.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:59.250
And it has been
since the beginning.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.690
AUDIENCE: So can you
not verify though that--

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:06.360
so in the situation where
network is walled off.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.870
People start mining on top
of this segmented block.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.600
Would they not realize
that their Bitcoins

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.570
are invalid for 100 blocks, save
for some external knowledge.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.320
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.150
Let me just go back to the--

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.160
sorry-- the chain.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.960
You're saying if--
Tom's question

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.980
is, is what if the purple side
chain goes on for 100 blocks.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.460
What happens?

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.640
And in fact, we have
circumstances of that.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.160
Bitcoin has split between
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.080
It was called a
hard fork last year.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.970
And for a moment, let's call
the purple chain Bitcoin Cash.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.860
It's not only gone
on for 100 blocks,

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:57.880
it's now gone on for tens
of thousands of blocks.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.910
It is now its own
native currency.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.970
Within that community
that purple blockchain

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:09.940
is so long now, that people
have found value in that.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.060
And it is its own
native currency.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.550
And the reason I share that
is to Tom's question of,

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:21.070
well, what if China was walled
off so long, it's plausible--

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:25.640
unlikely, but plausible-- that
there would become some value

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:31.030
and call it the Bitcoin China
blockchain versus the Bitcoin

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.470
global blockchain.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:38.668
It would be-- what is money,
but a social consensus?

00:37:38.668 --> 00:37:41.000
AUDIENCE: How does
this society work?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.970
I mean, is it based on supply
and demand, the amount of forks

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:45.920
out there?

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.720
And then the other
question that I have.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.590
Who decides it?

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.730
So if it's supply and
demand, is it community?

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.540
And what is the form of reward?

00:37:57.173 --> 00:37:59.090
GARY GENSLER: The question
is, is the reward--

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:03.370
I'm going to hold a part
of it for a little bit when

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.620
we talk about native currency.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.280
But the reward is,
in nearly every

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.840
blockchain is a new native
currency of that blockchain.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.760
Bitcoin for Bitcoin.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.220
ETH, or E-T-H, for the Ethereum.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.870
XRP.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.360
For each blockchain
there's a native currency.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.930
Who-- the second question
was, who decides it?

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.120
It's generally, but
not always, hard

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:41.605
programmed into the first
release of that blockchain.

00:38:41.605 --> 00:38:42.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:47.270
So back to the question on
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.300
If the Bitcoin Cash is the
purple line that we see

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.690
on the chart here, does that
mean-- because it's shorter,

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:54.800
compared to the block--

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.940
Bitcoin chain.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.840
Does that mean that under the
assumption of the majority

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.910
consensus, the value of
which is essentially zero?

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:10.500
GARY GENSLER: So the question
is is if it's shorter, does it--

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.650
AUDIENCE: So there's no
validity in that chain.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.240
And therefore, the
value becomes zero.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.270
GARY GENSLER: So there's two--

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.430
using this chart
just as an example.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.850
There's two ways-- there was--

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:26.710
the main point of
this chart was to say

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:31.630
that the black chain,
as represented in black,

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.800
is the main chain.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.640
And that is where the
social consensus will stay.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.130
That's where the consensus is.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:42.430
And generally speaking,
the stale blocks

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:45.640
don't mean anything, and
the stale blocks go away.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.160
Occasionally, there
is something called

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.240
a hard fork, where the
social consensus continues

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.100
to maintain.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:40:00.640
And I was using this
chart as a rough answer

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.270
to Tom's earlier question
about Bitcoin Cash.

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:08.500
And if the purple chain kept
going for thousands of blocks,

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.970
and there was a social consensus
to keep both chains going,

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.900
you'd start to see
separate currencies,

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.275
as you've seen
with Bitcoin Cash.

00:40:19.275 --> 00:40:19.900
Does that help?

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.978
So I was using a graphic to
answer a separate question.

00:40:25.978 --> 00:40:27.520
I'm going to take
two more questions,

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.130
and then go to
native currencies.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.840
I haven't heard from Daniel yet.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.180
AUDIENCE: So my question
is similar to the mining.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.445
So if your transaction
is on one of the blocks,

00:40:36.445 --> 00:40:40.780
does that transaction
become void, so to speak?

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.500
GARY GENSLER: It's
not so much void.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.710
It's just-- it's meaningless.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:49.030
It's-- yes, in a sense,
effectively, it's void.

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.827
AUDIENCE: So I guess would
somebody-- if you initiated

00:40:51.827 --> 00:40:53.660
that transaction, would
you be aware of that

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.320
and reinitiate it?

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.960
GARY GENSLER: Very
good question.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:05.620
The transactions will
still be in what's

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:08.530
called the memory
pool of anybody who's

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.230
mining on the main chain.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.830
So transactions-- which we'll
talk a lot about on Thursday,

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:17.410
this coming lecture--

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.940
go in through the network.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.530
They're propagated
through the network

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:22.990
to the entire node network.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:27.010
In Bitcoin, there's
about 10,000 nodes.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:32.320
And they will receive those
coins and those proposed

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.680
transactions.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.530
So anything on the
purple chain will still

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:38.935
be in the other
chain's memory pool.

00:41:38.935 --> 00:41:40.310
One more, and then
I'm going to--

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.080
AUDIENCE: In the
case of the hash--

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.040
GARY GENSLER: Your
first name is?

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:42.820
AUDIENCE: Iash.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.720
GARY GENSLER: Iash.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.345
AUDIENCE: In the case
of the hard fork,

00:41:45.345 --> 00:41:48.390
so between Bitcoin and Bitcoin
Cash, what are the differences?

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:51.570
And what about the differences
in value between those two?

00:41:54.267 --> 00:41:56.100
GARY GENSLER: That's a
much longer question.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.933
The question is, is
what are the differences

00:41:57.933 --> 00:42:00.190
of value between Bitcoin
and Bitcoin Cash?

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:04.740
And though, I think Bitcoin
is trading around $6,300,

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.970
and Bitcoin Cash is--

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.150
AUDIENCE: It's about $435.

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.820
GARY GENSLER: --$435.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.480
Thank you, Zan.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.730
That gives you the monetary
difference of about 15 to 1.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.940
But it would take
more conversations

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:29.460
about why that happened and
background and so forth.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.300
So let me talk about
the difficulty factor.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:38.490
So proof of work, at
least in Bitcoin's case,

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:41.580
has a difficulty factor
with regard to these leading

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.560
zeros in the hash.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:49.650
And Satoshi Nakamoto said, let's
change that every 10 minutes.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:54.150
Let's ensure that every block
comes on average every 10

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.530
minutes.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:43:02.650
And to do that, define how
many leading zeros there

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:04.640
needs to be.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.380
And it adjusts about
every two weeks.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.480
Every blockchain
can be different.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.660
It doesn't have to
adjust every two weeks.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.160
This is just what Bitcoin did.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.310
This is what Nakamoto
did to maintain

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.840
an average of 10 minutes.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:22.700
So what has happened?

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.580
Currently it takes
18 leading zeros.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.900
And because this is in a 60--

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:34.750
it's in a hexadecimal
character system.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:39.940
Every decimal is-- what's that?

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.140
AUDIENCE: Four bits.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:45.780
So it's 64 leading zeros in
bits, and 18 in hexadecimal.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.100
Is it?

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.600
GARY GENSLER: So
it's 2 to the 64th.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.155
AUDIENCE: But the probability
of finding a block is 1 over 2

00:43:51.155 --> 00:43:51.780
to the minuses.

00:43:54.288 --> 00:43:55.830
GARY GENSLER: So
what Alene just said

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:59.910
was that it's a very small
chance of finding a block,

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:04.602
because this is the equivalent
of 18 leading zeros--

00:44:04.602 --> 00:44:06.240
so that's more than 64.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.448
It's 18 times 4.

00:44:08.448 --> 00:44:08.990
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.110
Yeah.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:09.480
I know.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:09.980
I'm sorry.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.380
I can't do arithmetic.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.172
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.550
PhD in computer science,
but can't do arithmetic.

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:21.540
So this is the most recent block
I grabbed off the blockchain

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.150
this morning.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:29.370
And it has 18 leading zeros,
and then all those other digits.

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:35.120
That's block number 541,974.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.880
18 leading zeros.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:43.160
The genesis block, the very
first block in January of 2009,

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.560
had 10 leading zeros.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.260
But the requirement that
Satoshi Nakamoto actually

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.030
put into the computer
code was you only

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:52.340
needed eight leading zeros.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.790
So the probabilities
have gone way up.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.810
So let me take it off of
fancy numbers like that,

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:03.800
and just say this is the actual
Bitcoin mining difficulties

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.750
on a logarithmic scale.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.250
Because if it
weren't logarithmic,

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.740
you couldn't really read it.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.380
The difficulty was set at one.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:15.080
This is all scaled to
how difficult was it

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.260
for the first year and
a half of mining in 2009

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.140
and early 2010, one.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:27.700
And now, it is at one trillion.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.230
It's actually more
than one trillion

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.340
because it's logarithmic.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.740
It's at about seven trillion.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.760
It is currently seven
trillion times harder

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:49.690
to find the answer to the
puzzle than it was in 2009.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:52.270
And that's because there's
a lot of computers trying

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.317
to hash all of this stuff.

00:45:54.317 --> 00:45:55.650
AUDIENCE: So is that where the--

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:56.483
GARY GENSLER: Kelly.

00:45:56.483 --> 00:45:59.590
AUDIENCE: --the collectors
in the pools of mining nodes

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:03.983
work to be able to achieve
this at a more efficient rate?

00:46:03.983 --> 00:46:04.900
GARY GENSLER: Correct.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.060
Correct.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:12.470
And the hash rate is now
somewhere around 50--

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.770
it's not terahashes.

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:18.870
I'm trying to
remember what the--

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:19.380
what's that?

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.280
AUDIENCE: Hexahash.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:25.150
GARY GENSLER: 50 hexahash
per second, which

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:29.350
is like 1,000 trillion hashes.

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.870
Because a terahash
is a trillion hashes.

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:32.370
Zan.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.900
AUDIENCE: I think it's worth
noting, though, it didn't

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.120
scale linearly as, like,
number of computers

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.480
got on the network.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.080
It's also the hardware
has gotten incredibly more

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:41.930
sophisticated.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.440
So it's not that
you can just assume

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.105
there's 15 trillion number of
people that are mining Bitcoin.

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:50.230
It's just the same people
that are doing it better.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:53.470
GARY GENSLER: I can't ask
for a better setup than that.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:57.940
Bitcoin mining evolution--
did you see my slides?

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.138
AUDIENCE: I just read your mind.

00:47:00.138 --> 00:47:01.930
GARY GENSLER: So what
what's the evolution?

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:04.360
So it started with
central processing units.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.750
And CPUs-- and I'm not sure
my numbers are accurate,

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.510
because I might be
using CPU power today,

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:13.270
and not CPU power in 2009.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:16.810
Apologies for those who know
CPU power better than mine.

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:20.920
You could do about 2 to
20 million hashes a second

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:26.350
on a CPU properly
geared, apparently.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.690
They didn't last that long.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.740
By 2010, some folks figured
out there was something faster,

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:36.220
and it was called a
graphics processing unit.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.570
We all use GPUs all day
long, because that's

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:42.570
what gives us all our quick
graphics if you live stream

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:45.390
something on your laptop.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.240
And graphics processing
units, somebody figured out

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.510
you can use that, and
you could hash faster.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.770
And then all of a
sudden, hobbyists started

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.177
to wire the GPUs together.

00:47:57.177 --> 00:47:58.760
And they could figure
out a way to get

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:03.260
between 20 million hashes to
300 million hashes a second.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.480
I'm told that even
today you could maybe

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:10.490
get up closer to a thousand
million hashes a second,

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:15.670
or a billion hashes a
second, if you did a GPU rig.

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:19.140
But that's yesteryear
on Bitcoin.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.220
Now there's something called an
application-specific integrated

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.140
circuit, an ASIC.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:29.460
Just think about a circuit that
the only thing the circuit does

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.830
is create hashes.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.530
In fact, the circuit is wired--

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.060
I use the word
wired, because I'm

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.380
old enough to remember wires.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:45.040
But it's-- the circuit board is
manufactured in a way that all

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:53.200
it does is the SHA-256 hash
function to Bitcoin mine.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.880
And the first ASICs, which are
dedicated circuit boards to do

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:01.480
this mining, came out in 2013.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.090
And even since then, they
have moved up the scale.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:07.270
The most expensive that sells
for about $3,000 or $4,000

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:13.060
in ASIC could do 16 terahashes
per second, or at least

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.700
that's what it's rated
for if you go on Amazon

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.080
and try to buy it.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.920
And you could do that.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:24.200
But you'd be competing with
something that looks like this.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:31.490
A modern map mining factory for
Bitcoin has thousands of ASICs.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:35.870
They have water cooling
systems to keep it cooled down.

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.360
And they're probably
buying their electricity

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:44.350
for less than 3 kilowatts,
$0.03 per kilowatt.

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:47.620
And they might even be paying
off the local government

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:51.160
officials, and not even paying
the electricity company,

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.230
and just bribing to
get their electricity.

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:53.730
Emily.

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.397
AUDIENCE: This might
be a dumb question,

00:49:55.397 --> 00:49:57.070
but is there an
economic opportunity

00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:00.130
cost of using all this
processing power just

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.350
for mining Bitcoin?

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.330
Like, is there a more
efficient allocation of that

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:06.910
processing capability in terms
of like more-- for a more

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:10.390
stable economic usage?

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:12.550
GARY GENSLER: There are
certainly trade-offs here.

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:17.350
And the aggregate electricity
for all of Bitcoin mining,

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:21.170
now that it's seven trillion
times harder than it

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:25.490
was in 2009, has been
compared to the electricity

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:28.310
use of countries like
Ireland, on the way

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.720
to the electricity use of
countries like Denmark,

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.220
I think.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.020
It's somewhere between
Ireland and Denmark.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.860
See ya, Larry.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:37.360
Alon.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.530
AUDIENCE: Well, add
to that the cost is--

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.740
let's assume it's in dollars
or whatever currency,

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:47.090
and the reward is in Bitcoin,
the volatility of Bitcoin

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:50.000
makes it hard to
answer that question.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.380
Because you don't
know if there's

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:55.460
an economic value for you,
because you don't know what

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.490
will happen to Bitcoin.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:00.390
GARY GENSLER: So I said
in our first class,

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:03.470
I'm neither a blockchain
maximalist or a blockchain

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:04.310
minimalist.

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.160
And you all will have a
chance through this course

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.130
to form your own views.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:13.910
But one of the debates is, all
right, Emily's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:18.030
Is this a good use of economic--

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:20.870
a good use of resources?

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:28.020
But I would note that all strong
currencies, strong monies,

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:33.510
for centuries have had
something to limit the supply.

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:36.060
And so now we're doing
it electronically

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.270
and through this mining.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.240
That doesn't mean
it's the best use.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.330
I'm just saying
it's another way.

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:45.820
Extracting gold out of
the ground is very hard.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:51.210
And in the 19th century, to have
big vault doors and security

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:55.980
guards with rifles was
a way to insure it.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.620
And one could even say
that having central banks

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.690
takes cost.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:04.250
So I think of it as
a trade-off of how

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:11.210
you ensure a currency as a
harder currency to create.

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.830
But it doesn't mean
that proof of work

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.530
is the best way, which
is, of course, then,

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:21.410
the setup to the question
of, are there other ways

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.240
to do consensus?

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.860
So one other thing is
all of this hashing,

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.030
how is it distributed?

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:30.470
And this, I pulled off
the internet this morning.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:32.600
You can see these
statistics every day.

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:44.620
Proof of work and mining
has formed mining pools.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.620
And these mining
pools come together

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:52.000
for simple economic reason
that it's so unlikely

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.110
to solve the riddle, solve
the puzzle of mining,

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.740
that if you can only solve it
once a year, or maybe even once

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:04.540
every 10 years, you weren't
going to invest in mining.

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:13.960
So mining pools started around
2010 to smooth out the revenue.

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:18.450
So if Amanda doesn't want to
get it once every 10 years,

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.760
she might say, well,
why doesn't all the 80

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.650
people in this room--

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:24.690
you might, Amanda,
I don't know--

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:27.130
say, why don't we
all form a pool,

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:28.950
and we'll all going
to use our laptops.

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:32.550
And now this is
still 2009 or 2010,

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.340
when you could mine
Bitcoin on your laptop.

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.352
But we could say, why don't
we all do that together?

00:53:38.352 --> 00:53:39.810
And then all of us
could say, well,

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:43.080
Amanda, that's a bright
idea, but could you

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:47.340
create the Merkle root for us?

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:48.960
Could you do some
other things so

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.060
that our computer
doesn't have to do

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.310
all that other fancy stuff?

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:56.940
So then Amanda might say, well,
I want to charge all of you

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.510
a little bit.

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:02.960
How about if I charge
you 1% of the take?

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.130
And Amanda would call herself
a mining pool operator.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:09.650
That's what's
happened, is basically

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:13.890
the economics of
mining have clumped

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:16.650
around mining pool operators.

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:20.370
And the standard fees
range from 1% to 3%.

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:24.930
That the mining pool operator
provides a number of services

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:28.920
to the miners themselves,
and those services

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.430
are compensated, as I say,
somewhere between 1% and 3%

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:33.510
of the returns.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:36.870
But mostly, it smooths out the
economics for all the miners.

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:41.710
It does some other things as
well, but that's the primary.

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.200
AUDIENCE: So I also
had one question.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.260
You laid out the
difficulty, as mining

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:49.110
has become increasing
difficult. And the cost

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.320
of the electricity--
the break even point

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.035
has actually become
lower and lower in terms

00:54:55.035 --> 00:54:56.670
of the electricity cost.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:59.770
So with that in mind, over
the next couple of years,

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:02.930
if that's the case, people
will start to lose incentive

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:05.310
in keep doing the mining.

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:09.300
And once that happens-- once
that happens, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.400
GARY GENSLER: Well, it
could go either way.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.970
As we said-- just
Bitcoin, this is--

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:20.980
Bitcoin adjusts the difficulty
of mining every two weeks.

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.980
So if there's fewer
people mining,

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.940
the difficulty will go down.

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:29.540
And if you remember, I said you
had to have 18 leading zeros.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.390
It might go back to 17 leading
zeros or 16 leading zeros.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:40.890
And every two weeks, it adjusts
based upon the prior 2016

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:42.600
blocks.

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.980
Did it average 10 minutes?

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:47.700
If it averaged, for
instance, 14 minutes, then

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.160
it will lower the difficulty.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.520
If it averages six minutes, it
will increase the difficulty.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.300
Kelly.

00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:01.090
AUDIENCE: So is this where
the proof of stake comes in?

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:05.940
Does BTC always get their 19%
because they have the largest

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.250
stake in the system?

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:10.350
GARY GENSLER: So Kelly
is asking whether this is

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:12.390
where proof of stake comes in.

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.860
What is proof of stake?

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.800
Anybody who read the
Coindesk article?

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.590
See, you when you
hide your first name,

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:23.630
I can just call
you US Air Force.

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:24.620
It's true.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:28.350
Bo's name card
says US Air Force.

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.730
AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.550
So proof of stake is the coins--

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:35.370
all the coins are already
dispersed onto the network,

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:43.230
and the verification allocation
is allocated based on--

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:46.220
GARY GENSLER: So proof of stake
is an alternative consensus

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.530
mechanism.

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:50.850
And Bo described it well.

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:54.080
But Kelly, it's not
related to this chart here.

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:57.170
This is all proof of work.

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:01.750
BTC has 19% of the hash rate.

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:05.880
That means that they
literally have about--

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:11.720
if the total hash power
on Bitcoin is 60 hexa--

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:12.860
do I have the word--

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.741
AUDIENCE: It starts
with an e-x--

00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:15.241
exa.

00:57:15.241 --> 00:57:19.342
GARY GENSLER: Exahash-- then
19% of that, or about 12.

00:57:19.342 --> 00:57:21.300
AUDIENCE: That's what
they're attempting to do.

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.640
That's not the stake
that they already have.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.050
GARY GENSLER: Correct.

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:29.360
Most Bitcoin miners
sell their coins.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.260
So the coins that are created--

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:36.460
the coins that are
created each year

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:42.880
are sold into the
broad community.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.660
Very few miners hold
onto their coins

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.313
for great lengths of time.

00:57:49.313 --> 00:57:50.480
I mean, they might for days.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.130
That might for-- they might keep
some for all sorts of reasons.

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:59.440
And as I truly believe,
but can't factually prove,

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.900
a number of the biggest
mining pools or miners

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:06.620
are in places where they're
doing illicit activity.

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.120
They're getting
their electricity

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.570
for less than what it's
really costing on the grid

00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:13.415
by bad actors.

00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:18.980
But nonetheless,
they have a choice

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:21.260
whether to sell their
coins or keep their coins.

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:23.750
Got a question over here, and
then I want to keep going.

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:26.520
AUDIENCE: If the mining
industry is like so formalized,

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.880
like you've so many
pools, what prevents

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.620
all the pools from coming
together and saying that,

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:35.120
let's just solve lesser puzzles
so that the value becomes

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.832
lower, and then the
charge is much lower

00:58:36.832 --> 00:58:37.790
for each and every one?

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:39.165
GARY GENSLER: So
the question is,

00:58:39.165 --> 00:58:42.110
is what happens if the
mining pools collude and come

00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:47.630
together, either, as
[INAUDIBLE] says, to, let's

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:55.040
say, well, why should we
have so much mining capacity?

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.210
Let's, as a cartel--

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:58.700
like OPEC, the oil cartel--

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:03.590
say we should constrain
supply and so forth.

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:08.870
I think what constrains
that is it's an open system.

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:10.040
But it's possible.

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.073
It's plausible.

00:59:11.073 --> 00:59:12.740
I think the bigger
question, and there's

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:16.280
been numerous academic
papers around this,

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.310
is what happens if the mining
pools come together and try

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:22.370
to do what's called
a 51% attack,

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:26.080
and try to take
over the blockchain?

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.280
And that's a more
interesting challenge.

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:33.600
And we'll talk about that
throughout the semester.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:37.750
It hasn't happened as of yet.

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:40.160
Let me talk about the
native currencies.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.740
Native currency
helps do all this.

00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.578
What Nakamoto said, is it
was an incentive system.

00:59:45.578 --> 00:59:47.495
There was an incentive
system, but it was also

00:59:47.495 --> 00:59:50.570
a peer-to-peer way to
create a new money.

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:56.330
And embedded in most
blockchains, not 100% of them,

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.540
there is something, I put quotes
around it, monetary policy,

00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:06.600
in essence, that limits
the supply of the currency.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:11.340
Not every blockchain has this,
but the vast majority do.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.680
And when we start talking
about initial coin offerings,

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.370
you'll find some that don't.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:18.680
But Bitcoin limits it.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.670
And I'm just going
to say what it is.

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:23.650
It's created in a coinbase
transaction in each block.

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:29.980
It was initially 50
Bitcoins per block.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:35.440
But now, because it's
halved every 210,000 blocks,

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.290
it's just 12 and
one half Bitcoins.

01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:42.040
That's the number of
Bitcoins you earn each time

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.670
if you mine a block that's
approximately $75,000 US

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:48.400
dollars in value
today, give or take,

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.340
or $80,000, roughly,
to mine a block.

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:57.380
The inflation rate for
Bitcoin right now is 4.1%.

01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:01.130
So think-- for any of you that
have taken monetary policy

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:04.340
courses or financial courses
that talk about the Federal

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:09.640
Reserve, Bitcoin is growing
about 4% a year right now.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.500
But it halves every
210,000 blocks.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.770
So the inflation rate
will go down to 2%,

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:20.640
and then later to about 1%, and
later about a half a percent.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.290
And it caps around
the year 2040.

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:28.190
So whether Satoshi was one
person or a team of people,

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:33.800
back in 2008 they put in
place a monetary policy

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.960
that is hard-coded into
the computer base code,

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.960
and is supposedly going
to be there forever

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:46.010
to cap Bitcoin at
21 million Bitcoin.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:51.700
I'm going to throw up Ether just
because it's an alternative.

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.970
Currently, that mines
three ETH per block.

01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:59.457
And the inflation
rate's about 7 and 1/2%.

01:01:59.457 --> 01:02:01.040
It's a different
stage of development,

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.440
different inflation rate.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.650
But there has been a proposal
recently to literally--

01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:09.170
it was a proposal
by the programmers,

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:12.492
we should really lower
the inflation rate.

01:02:12.492 --> 01:02:14.700
And if it's accepted, it
will be adopted in November.

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:26.890
The fees in Ethereum are largely
paid in something called Gas.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:31.150
Gas is just a small
unit of Ethereum.

01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:33.226
What's the small
unit of Bitcoin?

01:02:33.226 --> 01:02:34.020
AUDIENCE: Satoshi.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.770
GARY GENSLER: Satoshi.

01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:38.600
So Gas and Satoshi
are very similar.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.365
Brodush.

01:02:39.365 --> 01:02:42.190
AUDIENCE: I think the
limit of 21 million

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:45.143
has switched to 2140, not 2040.

01:02:45.143 --> 01:02:46.310
GARY GENSLER: It's not 2040?

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.280
AUDIENCE: It's 2140.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.090
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:50.590
Wait.

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:53.700
You think it's 2140?

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.417
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:55.417 --> 01:02:56.500
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.708
AUDIENCE: I also [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:57.708 --> 01:02:59.780
GARY GENSLER: All right.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.560
So I typed poorly.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.260
Aviva, did you have a question?

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.960
No.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.460
Alene.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.170
AUDIENCE: So this is--

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:10.260
Bitcoin is a
deflationary currency?

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.715
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:03:11.715 --> 01:03:13.090
GARY GENSLER:
Well, Alene says is

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.430
Bitcoin a deflationary
currency, depending

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:19.320
upon your use of that word.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.450
But others have
written that Bitcoin

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:24.540
is a deflationary currency
because it's not growing.

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:28.200
If the economy is
growing at x percent,

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.410
and x percent is bigger
than how Bitcoin is growing,

01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:36.900
that would sort of define
it as deflationary.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:42.390
I would just note that
those who are fond--

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:44.260
and there's a lot of
academic literature.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:47.370
And this goes back
decades, if not centuries.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:51.450
For hard currencies, where
monetary policy is absolutely

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:55.170
formula-driven, whether it's
the Taylor rule or other rules--

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:58.410
rule-based monetary
policy would have

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:02.670
a fondness for what you could
maybe put in computer code.

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:06.390
Those who think that
humans should be involved,

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:09.870
and many people
think there is a need

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:11.970
for some human
involvement, would

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:15.540
say this is too hard-coded, and
you'd want something where you

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.190
can modify it and change it.

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:20.580
And that would be
dangerous in times of war,

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.300
in times of stress, in
times of economic peril.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:30.480
Or like the 2008 crisis, that
this would make a crisis worse.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.960
And so the academic literature
and the real life reality

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.500
of the last couple of hundred
years of hard currencies,

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.830
hard monetary policies
versus human involvement

01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:44.100
and some judgment, is kind
of an interesting debate

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.975
that goes right in the
middle of all of this.

01:04:45.975 --> 01:04:47.267
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] question.

01:04:47.267 --> 01:04:49.110
Would you consider
this as being currency?

01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:51.290
Or is it an asset--

01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:54.698
it's a class of asset that
has some aspect of a currency.

01:04:54.698 --> 01:04:57.240
GARY GENSLER: So the question
is, is this is a real currency,

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:03.150
or is it just an asset that
has aspects of a currency?

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:05.550
Ben, what do you think?

01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:07.417
AUDIENCE: So there
were three roles of--

01:05:07.417 --> 01:05:09.500
well, three ways that you
could define a currency.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.310
It was the unit
of account, stored

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:15.000
value, and medium of exchange.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.920
So I guess this has all
of those attributes.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.645
So you could call it a currency.

01:05:18.645 --> 01:05:20.770
GARY GENSLER: You're saying
if it has all of those.

01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:21.810
AUDIENCE: It does
have those attributes.

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:22.380
GARY GENSLER: Oh, it does.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.070
All right.

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:25.710
So Ben thinks yes.

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:31.750
How many people are with Ben
as of September 18, 2018,

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:34.660
not 2118?

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.910
So Isabella's there.

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:38.900
Zan, Joaquin?

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:39.810
How many people--

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:40.370
Tom.

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.570
How many people think not?

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.850
I don't-- I think that you
all get to decide yourself.

01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:54.070
Mark Carney, who's the governor
of the Bank of England,

01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:57.730
gave a speech earlier
in the year, which

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:00.580
is assigned in a later class.

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.080
And he says, I don't
think we should

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.390
call them cryptocurrencies.

01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:05.350
They should be
called cryptoassets.

01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:10.490
They're not yet evidencing
all three of these.

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:13.840
So that's Mark Carney, who
I have great respect for.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.080
But there are others that say,
no, it's evidencing enough.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.520
I would say this, though.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.410
It's plausible that they will--

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:23.920
and this-- if you take
nothing else from the class,

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.760
it's plausible in my view
that they could provide.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.910
You could have digital
currency that does not

01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:33.590
have a central authority.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.900
I mean, I think that
innovation is there.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.750
Whether you call it a
cryptocurrency or cryptoasset

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.720
at this point in time,
I leave to all of you.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.540
There won't be a right answer
to that on any paper you submit.

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:50.500
You can use whichever term
you think fits your thinking.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.910
I want to talk
about the network.

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:52.910
We only have 10 minutes.

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:55.250
But the network is important.

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:57.260
And a lot of times when
you talk about Bitcoin

01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.427
and blockchain, folks aren't
going to talk about it.

01:06:59.427 --> 01:07:04.410
But I want to quickly hit eight
or nine players on the network.

01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:05.530
There are full nodes.

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:08.050
A full node is a group--

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:11.210
is a computer, I should say--

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:15.310
that stores the full
blockchain, and is

01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:17.530
able to validate
all transactions.

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:19.030
It doesn't have to.

01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:20.470
It's a volunteer thing.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:23.180
But it can validate
all transactions.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.050
A pruning node-- you're not
going to read a lot about it,

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:27.730
but I just have it.

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:30.973
It prunes transactions
once they've validated,

01:07:30.973 --> 01:07:32.140
and they have a certain age.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:35.110
They're saying, all of
those early transactions,

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:36.970
we're not going to focus.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:44.470
There's been probably six times
the number of transactions

01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:49.240
that have happened compared to
the actual extant transactions

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.110
right now.

01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:52.790
So all the transactions
that have ever happened,

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:55.450
five, six of them have
already been used.

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:56.810
They're not around anymore.

01:07:56.810 --> 01:08:00.250
Why do we have to lug it
around in our data set?

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:03.090
So you could have
a pruning node.

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:04.980
Lightweight nodes,
which if any of you

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.710
have a Bitcoin wallet
or any other wallet,

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:09.720
you probably have
a lightweight--

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.060
some form of lightweight node,
or what's called an SPV node.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:19.050
It stores just those
blockchain headers, rather than

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:24.779
all this detail underneath--
a lot less storage.

01:08:24.779 --> 01:08:26.910
But a lightweight
node has to rely

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:28.833
on the full nodes
for verification,

01:08:28.833 --> 01:08:30.500
because the lightweight
node's not going

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.109
to be doing that on it's own.

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:35.779
Miners-- we talked about miners.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.970
I want to just
mention, miners don't

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:41.960
have to be full
nodes Amanda, you're

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:48.170
running this mining operation
for the whole class.

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:51.180
And we're paying you 1% to 3%.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.960
But you're Sloan, right?

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.410
You're probably charging
at the high end, right?

01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:02.760
So do you think that Amanda,
as a mining pool operator's,

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:03.990
operating a full node?

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:07.170
Tom?

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:08.118
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:09:08.118 --> 01:09:09.910
GARY GENSLER: You're
saying it tentatively.

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:14.297
But Tom, you're paying
Amanda 2% of your fees.

01:09:14.297 --> 01:09:16.630
Don't you want to make sure
she's validating everything?

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:18.300
AUDIENCE: Just lost
a whole percent.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.479
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:20.540
AUDIENCE: She thinks 3%.

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:21.248
GARY GENSLER: Oh.

01:09:21.248 --> 01:09:22.526
She thinks 3%.

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:23.109
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:09:23.109 --> 01:09:26.050
GARY GENSLER: But any of
you who are just miners,

01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:28.180
remember Amanda's
our pool operator.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:31.660
Anybody who's-- Andrew, do
you think you need a full node

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.490
if Amanda--

01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:34.170
AUDIENCE: No.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.260
GARY GENSLER: No.

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:39.270
So a lot of miners are
not operating full nodes.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:41.250
They've got all
those racks of ASICs.

01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:43.560
They're running all
their electricity,

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.700
and they're paying
Amanda to check on it.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.434
Don't let them down.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:48.934
Alene?

01:09:48.934 --> 01:09:50.726
AUDIENCE: I think this
is a terrible thing.

01:09:50.726 --> 01:09:54.310
Because in principle, we
have 20, 30 mining pools,

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:57.430
which means you have 20, 30
computers which validates

01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:59.290
the newly proposed block.

01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:02.320
And the thing that
everybody wants to believe

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.030
is that these systems
are decentralized,

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:07.420
and you have thousands
of contributors.

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.450
GARY GENSLER: So I might start
calling you Nouriel Roubini,

01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:11.440
but I won't.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.160
But Nouriel Roubini, who's
an economist-- he's sometimes

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.770
called Dr. Doom.

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:20.020
And he likes that phrase,
because he caused downturns

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.780
in the markets.

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:24.205
There's a later
reading, and I might

01:10:24.205 --> 01:10:25.330
have even done a video of--

01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:28.240
Roubini has this view, that
it's not decentralized,

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.560
and mining pools are an
Achilles heel of the system.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.050
But the full nodes,
the 10,000 nodes,

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:36.760
actually still do validation.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.130
And there's an interesting
social construct

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:41.080
where there's a
lot of nodes doing,

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:46.240
in essence, noncompensated
work validating transactions

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.790
beyond Amanda.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:50.170
And any miner--

01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:53.890
Andrew could validate
if he wants to.

01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:56.610
So there's a lot of free
riding that goes along,

01:10:56.610 --> 01:10:59.580
and the economics
of free riding.

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:03.300
And then there's wallets,
which probably 30 or 40 of you

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.000
have on your computer somewhere.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.330
They store and view and
send all the transactions.

01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:11.595
But importantly, also
create the key pairs.

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:17.100
So a lot to cover.

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.590
There's one that's not
a node itself at all.

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:21.873
It's called the mempool,
or the memory pool.

01:11:21.873 --> 01:11:24.040
And we're going to talk
about this more on Thursday.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.870
But the memory pool stores
all the unconfirmed,

01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:31.930
but yet, already validated.

01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:33.700
So they've been
validated by somebody.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:37.000
A transaction goes
out into the network.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.200
A full node validates it, and
it's put in a memory pool.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.480
And Amanda grabs
the memory pool,

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.337
and sends it out to everybody
in this class in a block.

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:48.170
And then we mine it.

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:53.810
We're not going to chat
much about these right now.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.030
But we talked about--

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:56.740
there was a Coindesk article.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.920
How many of you actually
skimmed it, looked at it?

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.900
Did it mean anything
to you, or just meant

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:05.750
that there's some alternative?

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:06.590
What's that, Prya?

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:08.260
AUDIENCE: Just that
there's some alternative.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.885
GARY GENSLER: There's
some alternative.

01:12:09.885 --> 01:12:12.250
That's what it meant to
me the first time I looked

01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:14.260
into this about six months ago.

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.590
But I want to just mention what
the alternatives come down to.

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:22.180
They generally randomized
or delegate the selection.

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:27.220
So rather than saying
any one of 10,000 nodes

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:31.150
can prove that this
works, they use

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:33.940
various mathematical means--

01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.450
randomized or delegated.

01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:38.920
And sometimes they
do a little bit

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.340
of delegation and
randomization to pick

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:45.160
who's going to validate
the next block.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:50.180
It all comes down to who
is picking the next block.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:57.890
Is it by Adam Back's sort of, as
Satoshi Nakamoto put out there,

01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:02.320
we'll call it Nakamoto
consensus, proof of work?

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.480
And you'll have a
paper for Thursday

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.620
that talks about Nakamoto
Consensus, the Clark paper.

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:13.480
But-- or is there some other
randomized, delegated way

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.080
to do it?

01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:19.730
In some of them, they
have a second check.

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:22.870
If there's a delegated
person to validate something,

01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:24.960
they put a second check
in there that there's

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:32.300
another group that officiates
and says whether it's correct.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.510
And so there's proof of stake,
which is based on the stake

01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:37.340
you have in the
underlying currency.

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.760
There's proof of activity, which
is kind of a hybrid of proof

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.740
of work and proof of stake.

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:46.850
Proof of burn-- are you
willing to give up coins?

01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:51.960
Proof of capacity-- do
you have storage capacity?

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.360
And you might have
a tiered system.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:57.510
The major permissionless
blockchains all use proof

01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:58.570
of work.

01:13:58.570 --> 01:14:00.810
And the reason is
nobody's really solved--

01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:04.180
all of these other
alternatives, no one's

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:09.130
really solved for a couple
of problems in them.

01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:11.410
But they usually
find a way to be

01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:15.160
more efficient through
delegation and randomization,

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.190
and might have a backup
set of checks on it.

01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:21.430
DASH and NEO will say that
they use proof of stake.

01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:25.860
But they're actually kind of
using some form of masternodes

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:29.550
or set up professional nodes.

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.780
But DASH and NEO are
kind of, I think,

01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:36.820
the 13th and 15th largest
market value cryptos, which

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.620
means everything else kind of--

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.910
And Ripple doesn't--

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:43.240
Ripple's really almost like a
permission system rather than

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.080
permissionless.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.690
I mean, they would say
they're permissionless.

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:54.170
But it's a confirmed set of
nodes in the node system.

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:55.630
So that's it for today.

01:14:55.630 --> 01:14:58.780
We're going to do
transactions on Thursday.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.950
I moved that study question.

01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:04.030
And then I'm going
to ask you to read

01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:07.120
through the Clark
paper, which is really

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.500
the academic pedigree.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.790
Where is this built on?

01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:11.020
What's the background?

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.610
But I think it's a good way
to bring it all together.

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.430
And remember on
Thursday, you all

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:18.520
come in to answer this
question-- your own view

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.620
as to who Satoshi Nakamoto is.

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.810
There is no right answer.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:27.310
But if MIT's Blockchain and
Money class can answer that,

01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:31.110
I'm sure that we'll get a
write-up somewhere about it.

WEBVTT

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:18.340
PHILIP GREENSPUN: So
remember, as VFR pilots,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.890
you're actually going
to be doing stuff that

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.500
is in some ways more challenging
than what airline pilots do,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.200
because you're always
trying to keep clearances

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.750
from clouds that the IFR
pilots don't care about.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.990
And if you're flying a
low performance airplane,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.150
you're also dealing with
flying through the weather

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.290
instead of just
going on top of it.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.690
So while you're
the VFR only pilot,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.590
these non-local flights, really
pay attention to weather.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.502
Airspace, go and study this
a little bit before the exam.

00:00:55.502 --> 00:00:56.710
Here are the different kinds.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.070
Remember Class A is up high.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.770
You need an
instrument clearance.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.260
Class B is around
the biggest airports.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.019
Class Charlie's around
Manchester, New Hampshire.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.330
And D is for Hanscom.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.910
And E is everywhere else.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.740
OK.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.920
The goal for the basic
VFR weather minimums

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.360
is to make sure that an IFR
plane coming out of the cloud

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.240
has time to see and avoid
you, because the air traffic

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.200
controller's job is to separate
IFR airplanes from each other.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.990
It's not to separate
IFR and VFR traffic.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.850
They will tell you about them.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.310
But you're responsible
as a VFR pilot

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.840
for staying reasonably
clear of clouds.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.130
So just review these
cloud clearances.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.450
Class E, you can see that
this is a pretty good one

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.860
to remember for the test--

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.620
500 below, 1,000 above,
2,000 horizontally.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.540
If you're really low
in Class G airspace,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.843
you can do some crazy stuff.

00:01:57.843 --> 00:01:59.760
Again, I don't think
that this is really there

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.970
to let you go from
Boston to Chicago scud

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.750
running with one
mile of visibility

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.729
and just clear of the clouds.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.790
I think it's more to enable
people to say, take off and do

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.910
pattern work at
their home airport

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.240
in some kind of little
tiny, very slow airplane.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.990
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Pattern
work is just what

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.407
we were drawing
on the chalkboard,

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.530
flying the traffic
pattern at an airport.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.760
PHILIP GREENSPUN: OK.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.038
So again, yeah, just review the
presentation or the FAA book

00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:29.455
so you know your
weather minimums.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.433
Yeah, incredibly at
night for Class G,

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.100
getting back to that
pattern work thing,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.620
if you want to go out and
practice takeoffs and landings

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.440
at night, if you stay within
half a mile of the runway,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.520
you can go right down to one
mile of visibility and right up

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.040
to the clouds.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.500
OK.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.630
Here's that chart again.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.130
Learn it.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.000
Know it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.630
A special VFR-- actually
if you're at Hanscom

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.400
and the weather is below the
basic minimums and you say you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.130
want to do some pattern work
anyway either in a helicopter

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.860
or in an airplane,
you can request--

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.110
they can't offer it,
but you can request--

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.430
a special VFR clearance.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.850
And they'll say, OK, there's not
too much IFR traffic right now.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.010
So you take off and
land and do your stuff.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.670
If it's at night, you'll have
to be an IFR pilot basically.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.200
Cirrus publishes this good
Personal Minimum Matrix.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.250
I wouldn't say that you have to
adopt their specific numbers.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.440
But I think their way
of thinking isn't bad.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.920
So notice they're
saying if you are,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.790
let's see, an average
pilot, so you've

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.870
got 10 IFR hours within
the last 90 days,

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.050
you've done one not on
autopilot with approach

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.600
within the last 90
days, well, go over here

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.400
and go down to a
500-foot ceiling

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.548
and two miles of visibility.

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:58.840
Don't go down to the published
approach minimums, which

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.660
are designed for a two
pilot professional crew

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.670
unless you know
you're very current,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.060
you've done a whole bunch of
flying in the last 90 days.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.980
Anyway, so they
just try to fit--

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.280
they try to say, how challenging
is this flight, how experienced

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.580
are you in general, how
experienced are you recently,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.360
and come up with some numbers.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.329
So again, you can pull
this out of the slide.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.170
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
And just to clarify

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.587
what we're talking about when
we're talking about personal

00:04:22.587 --> 00:04:24.880
minimums, so there
are minimums that you

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.270
have to know for the FAA exam
like we were just talking

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.830
about in terms of the minimum
visibility that must be there

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.710
in order for you to fly in
certain classes of airspace.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.100
But then there are also minimums
that you set on yourself

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.000
to be a safe pilot and to
be knowledgeable about what

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.780
your restrictions and
what your experience

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.940
and what your currency is.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.990
So for example, we
talked about crosswind.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.020
So there isn't an
FAA reg necessarily.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.840
As long as it's within
your aircraft's operating

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.550
conditions, there's no specific
reason why a 15 or 20 knot

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.680
crosswind is a problem.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.840
But maybe you're not
very comfortable with it.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.398
You haven't done a
lot of slips recently.

00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:09.190
You're still getting
used to your aircraft.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.690
So you might say a smaller
crosswind or gusting

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.760
winds would be appropriate
for you to land it.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.260
So that's setting a personal
minimum on yourself.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.110
And this is an example
of personal minimums

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.230
based on your experience
and your currency.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.730
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, and the
FAA will never suggest this.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.540
But the appropriate escape
from a challenging situation

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.870
that you think might be
on the edge of safety

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.810
is to rent the five seat SR22
instead of the four seat SR20

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.340
and go with an instructor.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.970
So it's as easy as that.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.360
OK, remember, this
was confusing.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.570
They used category in
class to mean two totally

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.770
different things--

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.900
forgetting your
pilot's certificate.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.810
The category is
there on the left,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.230
something like an airplane
versus a rotorcraft.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.990
And the class would
be multi-engine land

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.292
versus a helicopter
category class.

00:06:06.292 --> 00:06:08.750
But then for aircraft, they do
something totally different.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.840
And they say category would be
normal category or acrobatic.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.050
And class would be airplane.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.690
So they may ask you about
this just because they

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.280
like to torture you.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.610
The four forces of
flight, remember these.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.610
Tina talked about them.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.400
If you're just bombing
along, straight and level,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.900
not accelerating,
then they're going

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.430
to all be in balance,
because F equals ma.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.380
a equals whatever--
can't remember the math.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.220
Anyway, F equals ma.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.790
I know that much.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.140
Remember these three axes.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.180
They'll ask you about
this on the test

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.710
usually in combination
with some other stuff.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.750
So rotation about the vertical
axis is going to be yaw.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.300
Rotation about the--
this is complicated.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.230
Let's see.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.620
Rotation about the lateral
axis is going to be pitch.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.940
Rotation around the longitudinal
axis I believe will be roll.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.690
So that's a little
bit confusing since--

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.500
yeah, here we have
it-- pitch, roll, yaw.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.650
So think about it.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.270
Roll is really the
lateral motion.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.840
But it's around the
longitudinal axis.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.000
So don't get confused there.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.045
Remember why Johnny Cessna can't
hover is also a limit for--

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.420
this limits
everything basically.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.780
The stalling angle of attack
is why you need a helicopter

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.400
if you want to hover.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.690
And it is why you need to
maintain a reasonable airspeed

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.890
when you're landing.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.590
And it's also-- it
limits your runway.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.703
If you had an airplane that
didn't stall till it reached

00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:46.620
some crazy angle of
attack, you could probably

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.812
take off and land in 50 feet.

00:07:48.812 --> 00:07:49.770
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Right.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.060
And remember that we talked
about even a paper airplane

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.320
can generate lift.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.800
So it's not about the
shape of the cross section

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.640
of the wing that is making
you be able to generate lift.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.590
It's the angle of
attack and your ability

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.140
to deflect air molecules down.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.730
That's what generates lift.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.330
That shape of the airfoil is
just what Philip was saying.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.823
That allows you to have
the stall speed be lower.

00:08:15.823 --> 00:08:18.240
PHILIP GREENSPUN: All right,
so remember your left turning

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.040
tendencies.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.160
Mostly you just remember
that you need right rudder.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.690
TINA SRIVASTAVA: And
a couple questions

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.670
had come up on
gyroscopic procession.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.820
So I added two videos
about gyroscopes

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.309
to help you understand
gyroscopic procession

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:38.610
and why that force is
applied 90 degrees later.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.740
And so those are really
fun videos you can look at.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.327
There's in this slide deck
called Q&A and Review.

00:08:44.327 --> 00:08:46.660
PHILIP GREENSPUN: OK, so let's
go back to the altitudes.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.710
So true altitude is your
actual height above sea level.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.890
This is what's important if you
want to get over a mountain,

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.560
because the altitude on
the chart for the mountain

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.140
is also the actual
height above sea level.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.750
Indicated is what
your altimeter shows.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.100
If you're below 18,000 feet
and it's not some insane

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.130
temperature and you've got
a current altimeter setting

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.430
from air traffic control as you
fly along with VFR advisories,

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.650
they'll keep updating
you with altitudes.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.820
If you're not talking to ATC,
you may tune in to the airports

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.270
that you're flying over to
get the altimeter there.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.340
If you have your
correctly set altimeter,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.090
it should be pretty close
to your true altitude.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.020
But and the GPS will
give it to you as well.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.120
All right, absolute
height above the ground,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.570
I don't think that's
ever really relevant.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.280
Pressure altitude is
what you see if you

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.530
tune your altimeter to 29.92.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.730
Density is critical for
determining performance of both

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.260
the aircraft and the engine.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.900
So that's a measure of how
many actual molecules of air

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.340
are there going to be in a
1-liter cylinder, for example.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.410
Know your taxiway
and runway markings.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.920
This has practical value
and also test value.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.470
One easy thing to
remember is, if you're

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.380
driving along a taxiway
in your aircraft,

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.340
you will see yellow paint
on a black paved surface.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.850
So that sign tells you what
taxiway that you're actually

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.520
on, just like the
real world experience

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.590
of yellow paint on black.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.377
Everything else is
reasonably self-explanatory.

00:10:25.377 --> 00:10:27.960
They probably-- even though if
you're not an instrument pilot,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.020
they want you to know about
this ILS hold short line.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.350
So if it's bad
weather conditions

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.330
and they're using
the ILS, they don't

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.840
want you going beyond there,
because your metal airplane

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.770
might interfere with the radio
beams that are being sent up

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.380
to landing IFR airplanes.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.580
Remember L/D MAX for
best glide speed.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.210
So all these climb speeds,
glide speeds, et cetera,

00:10:54.210 --> 00:11:02.310
are driven off of the points at
which the various drags reach

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.810
a minimum, or a minimum
per mile traveled.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.640
Thunderstorms, the
one thing you--

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.100
I hope you do remember
is that everything's

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.450
bad about convective clouds.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:17.700
Unstable air leads
to cumulus clouds.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.250
They can become
cumulonimbus clouds.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.280
And now you have a
really bad hazard

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.910
to aviation with terrible icing,
terrible turbulence, maybe

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.550
hail.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.620
So the squall line, I
think they sometimes

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.440
ask about this on the test.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.290
The frontal band
of thunderstorms

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.160
are just-- it's hard
to get around them.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.300
And you may have to go
500 miles out of your way

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.680
to get around a cold front.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.960
Or hang out on the
ground for a few hours

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.810
and wait for it to pass.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.630
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Also,
just big changes in weather

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.960
usually are not a good thing.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.590
So whether it's a big change
in the barometric pressure,

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.800
or as we saw from
yesterday to today,

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.070
a 40, 50 degree increase
in the temperature

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.980
is going to be accompanied
by massive gusting winds.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.290
Today is not a good
day to go flying.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.730
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, although
actually it might not just

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.230
be the day.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.770
It might be how are we ferrying
a helicopter from Los Angeles

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.760
back to Boston.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.710
And there was a
thunderstorm coming in.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.010
So we just landed in an airport.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.270
It was probably
gusting about 30 knots

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.870
at the time, which isn't that
bad for a Robinson, a four

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.010
seat Robinson.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.400
Put the helicopter in a hangar.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.740
There's a huge storm.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.280
And two hours later, we took
off in beautiful weather

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.230
and continued our flight.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.855
There is an airport usually
every 10 or 15 minutes

00:12:37.855 --> 00:12:38.480
of flight time.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.563
So take advantage of that.

00:12:39.563 --> 00:12:42.930
If things are getting
beyond your comfort zone,

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.005
don't just blindly continue
to your destination.

00:12:46.005 --> 00:12:47.630
So remember, the alee
side of mountains

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.205
is where you can get a lot
of turbulence and downdrafts.

00:12:50.205 --> 00:12:52.830
A little airplane doesn't have
a whole lot of climb performance

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.600
usually, especially up
at higher altitudes.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.830
So be cautious about
crossing big mountain ranges

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:05.340
unless the winds aloft forecast
is for very light winds indeed.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.520
Icing, also super bad--

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.140
again, as VFR
pilots, you shouldn't

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.170
have to worry about this once
you get into instrument flying,

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.115
as I hope a lot of you will.

00:13:14.115 --> 00:13:15.740
This is really what
limits your ability

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.920
to travel around in a
Piper Cessna or Cirrus

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.745
during the winter
and shoulder seasons.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.280
Remember how to read the METAR.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.600
So this is back to Peachtree
Dekalb Airport in Atlanta.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.820
So there sits the 16th at
1653, so about almost 5:00 PM

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.390
in London Zulu Time.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.890
Winds are variable at 4, 10
statute miles of visibility,

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.180
overcast 6,000 feet.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.310
That's 6,000 feet above the
airport, not above sea level.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.360
Temp's 14.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.220
Dew point's minus 7.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.310
Altimeter's 3015.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.830
Oh and in the remarks, it
says the rain ended 46 minutes

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.590
after the hour.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.990
There you have it.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.120
All right, human
factors summary--

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.920
so you are the weakest link.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.310
And if you develop
some personal minimums,

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.730
you'll be way ahead of the game.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.460
They should also factor in your
recent experience, not just

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.920
your overall level of flying.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.140
And always remember that it's
a big aviation community.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.390
There's a lot of people that
are happy to go flying--

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.800
can send mail to the members
of the MIT Flying Club

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.180
and just take a copilot.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:35.070
That's how the airlines have
cut risk almost to zero.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:41.430
Magnetic variation,
this is a topic

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.460
that tends to snag people
on the knowledge test.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.630
So just remember, you can
re-derive it from the VOR

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.770
if you ever get stuck.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.610
And east is least, west is best.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.240
Deviation-- then don't get
deviation and variation

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:58.750
confused.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.080
So deviation, remember, is
that tiny little correction

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.870
that's printed right
underneath the compass.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.700
Flight planning tip, you
saw this slide earlier.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.930
Even if FAR 61 and FAR 91 allow
it, it doesn't mean it's wise.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.790
So if you look at
FAR 121 and FAR 135

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.260
for charger and scheduled
airline service,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.360
they show you that there
are some extra safety

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.460
margins that can be built in.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.695
Night flying advice
you just heard.

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.320
Remember, as the
owner/operator, you're

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.990
responsible for keeping
the airplane airworthy

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.450
if you do choose to go
out and buy an aircraft.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.160
So these responsibilities
are for most of you going

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.190
to be on the flight school.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:48.630
However, you're still the
final authority as the pilot.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.730
And you can deviate from
the rules in an emergency.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.260
And you only have to report
the deviation if requested.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.780
I think the feds like to
ask this on the knowledge

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.395
test, because the natural
answer is, of course,

00:16:00.395 --> 00:16:01.770
you have to report
the deviation.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.050
And I declared it an emergency,
and I broke the rules.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.670
But you don't actually
have to report

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.200
that unless they ask you to.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.540
TINA SRIVASTAVA: But even
aside from an emergency,

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.220
you're the pilot in command.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.610
Even if someone very assertively
tells you to land and hold

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.940
short or to fly straight to the
numbers, which means don't fly

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.600
the proper traffic pattern
but land very quickly,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.000
or tells you no delay
on the go because they

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.140
want you to get out quickly,
they have other jets,

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.650
you can just say, unable.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.460
And they have to
deal with it and make

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.500
sure you're flying safely.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.810
And if you, especially
as a student pilot,

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.030
need extra time or
extra consideration,

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.450
just add student pilot to the
end of all your radio calls.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.000
And they'll give you plenty
of room to make mistakes.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.790
But they might also make you sit
there and fly a bunch of 360s

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.430
while they land everybody else
and then give you time to land.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.540
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, so
safety is not high tech.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.063
It should be probably.

00:16:54.063 --> 00:16:55.480
We should actually--
all the stuff

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.450
that Michael showed you that's
embedded in that DJI drone

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.630
should probably be in these
multimillion dollar aircraft.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.550
But it's not.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:10.650
So in the meantime,
since an airliner

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.780
isn't actually that much
smarter than a little Cessna,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.230
why is it safer?

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.877
And if you take that
perspective and just adapt

00:17:21.877 --> 00:17:23.460
all the things the
airlines have done,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.270
you can make flying that little
Cessna dramatically safer.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.360
So that means
recurrent training.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.510
Maybe go up with an instructor
every three months instead

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.600
of the every two years
that the FAA requires.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.320
The instrument flying
skills are really

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.110
important for VFR safety.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.120
They make you a much
better pilot at night,

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.310
as we've just
discussed, and even

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.560
bombing around during the day.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.480
You'll be able to
fly with about 5%

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.990
of your mental
energy instead of 50%

00:17:54.990 --> 00:18:00.190
if you are an instrument-rated
pilot on a nice VFR day.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.880
The two pilot crew and checklist
is really the cornerstone

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.920
of the airline safety system.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.980
So and you can take advantage
of that as a GA pilot

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.350
even though the FAA really--

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.670
about 5% of the FAA,
which is the one you've

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.280
seen and interacted with, is
all about encouraging people

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.300
to be single pilots.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.800
And 95% of the FAA is
about forbidding people

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.450
to operate single pilot.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.640
Every part of the
FAA that regulates

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.680
the airlines and charters of
sizable airplanes, they say no.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.430
Of course, you can't
operate single pilot.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.370
That would be
incredibly dangerous.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.830
All right, so just
remember, study

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:43.190
a little bit about the Part 61
and Part 91 for learning to--

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:47.700
now, what does it take to be and
maintain your status as a pilot

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.820
or be able to exercise
your privilege as a pilot.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.725
That certificate never expires.

00:18:52.725 --> 00:18:55.890
Part 91 is about what you can
do with an airplane operated

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.240
privately.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.070
And then there's
this little corner

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.730
over there under
Title 49, Part 830,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.270
having to do with accident
reporting and investigation.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.030
If you want to get 100 on
the FAA knowledge test,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.330
a lot of East Coast Aero Club
customers seem to over-study.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:18.810
I see a lot of 95s, 97s,
98s, and 100s, actual 100s.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.450
Just reread the FAA textbooks.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.200
I mean, they can't ask
you anything that's

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.380
not in one of their own PDFs.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.290
That includes the FAR/AIM,
though, the regulations

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.900
and the Aeronautical
Information Manual.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.170
There are test prep books
and online equivalents

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.220
that are worth it.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.570
To finish this course,
actually, you can get this--

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.830
you'll be able to get--

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.580
actually, we don't
even need to email you,

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.750
because if you have the course
homepage, you can see it here.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.380
You go to this
King Schools thing.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.750
And you say you want
to do 60 questions.

00:19:55.023 --> 00:19:56.940
TINA SRIVASTAVA: 60 is
the number of questions

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.990
on the actual exams.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.500
We're making our final
exam be the same.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.250
PHILIP GREENSPUN: And
then you Start Test.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.583
You need to send us the results.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.560
And we'll be happy.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.060
All right, next steps-- if you
want to continue your journey

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:16.687
beyond this class, maybe that's
for the one or two people--

00:20:16.687 --> 00:20:18.520
TINA SRIVASTAVA: And
can I borrow that the--

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.630
PHILIP GREENSPUN: --for whom
that applies that actually

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:20.940
want to continue their journey.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.670
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Can I borrow
the pointer for just a second?

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.760
Just for the guys that were
getting tripped up thinking it

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.290
was a river, this is exactly
what we were talking about.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.140
This is Boston Logan.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.410
These blue lines, circles that
are around it, are not rivers.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.870
It's indicating that
Class Bravo airspace.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.513
And I have it open over here
if you want to take a look.

00:20:37.513 --> 00:20:39.680
PHILIP GREENSPUN: OK, so
yeah, join the flying club.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.240
Go visit a flight school.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.680
Most of the busier US airports
have some kind of flight school

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.120
that you can do.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.320
And yeah, in the two
hours that are remaining

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.960
to me for this
presentation, I would just

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.877
like to say thank you.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.752
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Now,
we're saying thank you.

00:20:54.752 --> 00:20:57.300
But just to clarify, there's
a really cool guest speaker

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.170
coming next.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.260
But for the purposes of our
teaching, thank you very much.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.680
And we'll take any questions.

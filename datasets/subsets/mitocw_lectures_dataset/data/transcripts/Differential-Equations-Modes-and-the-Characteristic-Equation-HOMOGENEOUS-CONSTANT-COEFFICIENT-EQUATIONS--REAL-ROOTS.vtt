00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:07.570
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.050
Welcome back.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.950
So today, we're going to take
a look at homogeneous equations

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.840
with constant coefficients,
and specifically, the case

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.120
where we have real roots.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.730
And we'll start the
problem off by looking

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.687
at the equation x dot dot
plus 8x dot plus 7x equals 0.

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:26.520
And we're asked to find
the general solution

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.930
to this differential equation.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.000
And then we also
have the question,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.730
do all the solutions go to
0 as t goes to infinity?

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.730
And then for part B, we're
going to take a look at just

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.795
the differential equation
y dot equals negative k*y.

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:43.420
So this is the same
equation that we've

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.220
seen in past recitations.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.080
And we're just going to show
that we can use this method

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.620
to solve this
differential equation

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.490
and obtain the same result.
And then lastly, we're asked,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.980
or we're told that
we have eight roots

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.260
to an eighth-order differential
equation, negative 4,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.980
negative 3, negative 2,
negative 1, 0, 1, 2, and 3.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.267
And we're asked, what
is the general solution.

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:11.850
So why don't you take a moment
and try and work these problems

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.280
out, and I'll be
back in a minute.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.950
Hi, everyone.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.720
Welcome back.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.590
OK, so we're asked to find the
general solution to x double

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:40.850
dot plus 8x dot
plus 7x equals 0.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.260
And we see that this is
a differential equation,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.577
it's linear, and it has
constant coefficients.

00:01:47.577 --> 00:01:49.410
And whenever we have a
differential equation

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.250
that's linear with
constant coefficients,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.090
one of the standard ways
to generate the solution is

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.810
to seek what sometimes
mathematicians call an ansatz,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.260
but it's to try a solution
of the form x is equal

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.410
to a constant
times e to the s*t.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.030
And if we substitute a
solution n of this form,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.400
we see that taking the second
derivative of this function

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.515
pulls down two s's.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.677
One derivative pulls down one s.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.430
We have no derivatives here.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.816
And we also have, on each
term, a factor of c times e

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:38.570
to the s*t.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.800
And we want this to be 0.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.200
So specifically, c e to the
s*t can't be 0 for all time.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.080
So the only way
that this can hold

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.410
is if s squared plus
8s plus 7 equals 0.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.650
So what this means is if
we choose s to solve this

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.800
polynomial, then x equals c e
to the s*t will be the solution.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.910
And this will be the
solution for any constant c.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.910
OK, so what are the roots
to this algebraic equation.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.444
Well, we can factorize it.

00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:25.610
The roots are going to be
negative 7 and negative 1.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.260
And notice how
this whole process

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.050
has turned a differential
equation into a simpler

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.270
algebraic equation.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.117
So if we can solve the
algebraic equation,

00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:42.950
then we can solve the
differential equation.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.915
OK, so the general solution.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.440
Well, we've just shown that we
can take any constant times e

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.560
to the s*t, provided s is equal
to negative 1 or negative 7.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.070
So the general solution is going
to be some constant, c_1, times

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.260
e to the minus t, plus c_2,
can be a different constant,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.180
e to the minus 7t.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.890
So notice how
there's two constants

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.874
in the final solution.

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:20.374
And the reason
there's two constants

00:04:20.374 --> 00:04:22.810
is because we started out with
a second-order differential

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.700
equation.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.770
So, in some sense,
for each order

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.330
of the differential equation,
we always have one constant.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.760
It's almost as if for
each time we integrate,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.572
we have a constant
of integration.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.530
So at the end of the day,
we have two constants

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.529
in our general solution.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.040
As part of part A, we're
also asked for any solution

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.090
to this differential
equation, does the solution

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.830
go to 0 as t goes to infinity?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.110
Well, the general
solution has this form.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.610
So for any constant c_1
and c_2, the solution

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.810
is c_1 e to the minus t
plus c_2 e to the minus 7t.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.810
And we see that no matter
what c_1 and c_2 are,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.510
this term, as t
goes to infinity,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.870
is multiplied by e to the
minus t, which goes to 0.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.980
And the second term
also goes to 0.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:17.090
So as t goes to infinity,
both e to the minus t

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.310
and e to the minus
7t both go to 0.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.450
So that means that
any constant times

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.190
e to the minus t plus
any constant times

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.030
e to the minus 7t
must also go to 0.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:40.890
So hence, x of t goes to
0 as t goes to infinity.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.130
OK.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:51.850
For part B, we have the
differential equation y dot

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.397
equals negative k*y.

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.730
And this is the first-order
linear differential equation

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.790
with constant coefficients.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.590
And we're going to
use the same trick.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.710
We let y is equal to
c times e to the s*t.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.340
And we see that the
characteristic equation

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.440
in this case, it's
not a polynomial.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.700
It's just s, s is
equal to negative k.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.490
So we get y is equal to c e to
the negative k*t is the general

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.660
solution.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.684
And this is exactly what we
had in previous recitations,

00:06:35.684 --> 00:06:37.600
when we used, for example,
integrating factors

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.410
to solve this very same
differential equation.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.810
So this just shows that
we can use the same method

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.140
to solve first-order linear
differential equations.

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:51.990
OK.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.560
Now, lastly, we're
given eight roots

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.847
to an eighth-order
differential equation.

00:06:57.847 --> 00:06:59.430
An eighth-order
differential equations

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.425
with constant coefficients.

00:07:01.425 --> 00:07:03.050
So I'll just write
out the roots again.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.450
So we're told the
roots are negative 4,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:20.180
negative 3, negative 2,
negative 1, 0, 1, 2, and 3.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.480
And in general, the solution
to an eighth-order differential

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.960
equation whose roots to the
characteristic polynomial

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:34.270
are negative 4 through 3,
the general solution, x of t,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.640
is going to be a
constant c_1 times e

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.330
to the power of the first
root, which will be minus 4t,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.170
plus c_2 e to the minus 3t.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.270
And of course, we take different
constants for each term.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:08:02.050
c_3 e to the minus 2t, plus
c_4 e to the minus t, plus c_5.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.720
And now for this term,
it should be e to the 0t,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.430
but e to the 0t is just 1.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.920
So the zero root is just going
to give us a constant c_5.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:19.990
And we have c_6 to the
t, plus c_7 e to the 2t.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:26.920
And then plus c_8 e to the 3t.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.200
So the solution has eight
terms and eight constants.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.570
And just for fun, we can
ask, does every solution

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.130
to this differential equation
go to 0 as t goes to infinity.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.049
And the answer is no.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:47.470
In fact, although each
term with a negative root

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.620
does go to zero as
t goes to infinity,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.940
there are three terms that
go to positive infinity

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.440
as t goes to infinity,
and there's one term

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.620
that just stays constant.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.880
So in general, as t
grows, goes to infinity,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.010
these terms will
become very large

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.690
and won't necessarily go to 0.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.970
Well, they'll never go to 0.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.010
So I'd just like
to conclude there,

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.420
and I'll see you next time.

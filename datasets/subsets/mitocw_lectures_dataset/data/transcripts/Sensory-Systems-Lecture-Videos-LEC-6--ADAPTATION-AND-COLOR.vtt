00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.620
PROFESSOR: Today we are
going to discuss color vision

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.373
and adaptation.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.043
About 2/3 of it's going
to be color vision and one

00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:34.876
third on adaptation.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.820
Now, I'm going to have several
demonstrations on the screen

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.420
here for you.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.890
And I would like to forewarn
on you that for some reason,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.860
they still haven't fixed the
light bulb in this projector.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.850
And this, you see this is a
bluish color to it, speaking

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.240
of color vision?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.610
And actually, it's
supposed to be gray.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.430
But there's some loss of
balance there in this bulb.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.780
And they've promised to
replace it some 10 days ago

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.380
and it still hasn't happened.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.837
So once we come to
the demonstrations,

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:17.170
they're not going to be perfect.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.560
But they will also be
available on the internet,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.330
as well on Stellar.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.930
So you can look at them
there and maybe you'll

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.080
get a better picture of
them there than here.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.290
But we'll do the best we can.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.170
So anyway, let me
first give you a list

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.030
of things we are
going to discuss

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.980
and the questions
we're going to pose.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.300
First of all, you're going to
ask, what are the basic facts

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.870
and laws of color vision?

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.370
Now, one of the nice
things about color vision

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.180
is that their number of laws--
it's a very basic phenomenon.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.615
And its in many ways
very close to physics.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.580
The second one is, what are the
major theories of color vision

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.150
that we are going to discuss?

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.680
And then we are
going to examine how

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.370
color is processed in
the retina geniculate.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.300
Then we're going to
move on and examine

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.535
what happens in the cortex.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.940
And then we are
going to discuss what

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.200
is the nature of
colorblindness, which

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.690
I think will be of
interest to most of you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.660
because colorblindness is not
that uncommon, unfortunately,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.950
among humans.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.550
And then we're going to
look at how adaptation

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.020
is achieved in
the visual system.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.830
That's when we switch
from color to adaptation.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.450
And then we are going to ask the
question, what are afterimages?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.670
How are they produced?

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.800
And what are its effects?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.570
So let's begin, then,
with color vision.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.970
And the first thing I would
like to say about this

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.530
is that as so often happens in
the course of history, often

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.200
there had been great
misconceptions about color.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.420
And one of the
great misconceptions

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.760
was that people thought that
white light is the pure light.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.210
And that was
exemplified in the fact

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:22.540
that before the 20th century,
for example, most nuns

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.585
were required to
wear a white outfit.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.880
They were asked to
wear the white outfit

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.950
because it meant
that they were pure.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.650
So what happened
then in the 1600s,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.920
one of the greatest geniuses
of our time came along.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.300
That was Newton.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.330
And at that time-- this is just
an interesting coincidence--

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.180
it happened that the art of
making chandeliers has emerged.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.200
And the chandeliers
in those cases

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.000
consisted of little pieces
of glass cut in various ways.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.220
And people noticed, and
so especially did Newton,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.329
that when you looked
at these chandeliers,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.910
you saw all sorts
of colors there.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.926
And so Newton said, my god.

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:22.260
How can that be?

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.650
What's going on?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.820
And so he began
to analyze color,

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.320
which also came
about then for him

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.860
because that's when they also,
in addition to the chandeliers,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.485
they came up with prisms.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.390
And so what Sir Isaac
Newton did was--

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.500
let me skip this for a minute
and I'll come back to it.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.160
What he did was that he put
a little opening in a screen

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.420
and let the light come
through from the sun.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.660
White light.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.770
And then he put that beam
of light through a prism.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.160
And he discovered
that he got an image

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.950
much like what you see when
you have these chandeliers.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.600
Namely, that you get all
sorts of colors projecting out

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.425
of the prism.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.460
And then he performed yet
another little experiment.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.590
He added another
prism, same kind

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.910
of prism, where the light
was separated from the red.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.680
And then there was no
further separation.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.100
That was a remarkable
discovery on his part.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.940
And he became interested not
only in the physics of it,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.480
but he also became
very interested in how

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.630
we organize our
color perceptions.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.690
And he was the first
person to come up

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.900
with what I will talk a lot
about, the so-called color

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.400
circle.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.710
So this is what Sir Isaac
Newton then came up with.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:03.235
And he established that we have
a huge range of frequencies.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.190
And a very narrow
section of it right here

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.780
is the one that falls
into the visible range.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.870
And if you break that up
like this and enlarge it,

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.400
much like the
colors of a rainbow,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.775
you see all of these colors.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.600
And so the conclusion
to which he came

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.610
is something that
was quite remarkable.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.255
He was at that age
just 29 years old.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.990
And that was done-- to go
back here-- at the age of 29

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.150
in 1672.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.680
And so he concluded at
that time that white light

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.240
is a mixture of all the colors.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.720
It's white because
it's an equal mixture

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.530
of the different
wavelengths here.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.930
So rather than being
pure, white light

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.240
is a conglomeration of
all the little wavelengths

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.545
in the visible range
that the eye can process.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:08.060
So that was so stunning
for him at the time

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.790
that he delayed publication
of it for more than 30 years.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.160
And then when he
published this, this

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.020
was extensively debated
even 30 years later.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.920
And one of the people
who debated it a lot

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.300
was a famous German
poet called Goethe.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.330
You probably all of
you know who he is.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.490
And he said, Newton
is a charlatan.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.660
He just made this up.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.250
It can't possibly be so.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.000
White light is pure.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.580
And so what he did, he took
a prism just like Newton did.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.070
But instead of reflecting the
light, he looked into the prism

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.200
towards the light and he
didn't see any colors.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.400
And he said, Newton
is all full of junk.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.200
And so he asked his associates
at the time, Schopenhauer,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.280
who is also a very
famous philosopher,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.710
and said, why don't you
do some experiments?

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.560
Let us prove that
Newton is all wrong.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.560
And so Schopenhauer did the
experiment right and said,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.110
oh my god, Newton is right.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.240
What am I going to do?

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.950
How can I tell Goethe,
my boss, that he's wrong

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.140
and Newton is right?

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.460
So that became quite a thorn
in his hide at the time.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.270
But of course
eventually, we all came

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.460
to recognize indeed that
this is the situation,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.179
and that white light is
a mixture of all colors.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:45.200
So let me now go
back a minute to some

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.680
of the basic facts, which I
will elaborate on as we proceed.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.935
First of all, when
we talk about color,

00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:52.930
there are all kinds
of systematic things

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.352
that we are going to discuss.

00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:55.810
And you're going
to become educated

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.950
about the processing
of color as a result

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.270
because we know a lot of very
important basic facts about it.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.265
It's solid science.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.940
So when we talk about
color, we typically

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.000
make a distinction between hue,
brightness, and saturation.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.570
Hue means what is the color.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.710
Is it red, green, and blue?

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.460
Brightness is how intense
the impression is.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.230
And saturation is that every
color can be kind of washed out

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.840
or it can be very sharp.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.070
Can you see a bright red?

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.890
Or you can see a
really washed-out red

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.723
that's barely different
from the background?

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.430
This is very important.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.360
We have to make a
clear distinction

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.810
between the psychological
and physiological attributes,

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.530
or the physical, actually,
attributes of color.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.910
So what do we mean by that?

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.440
When we talk about color,
that's an impression we have.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.250
That's our own personal
psychological experience.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.240
But the scientific way to look
at it is to call it wavelength.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.850
The same thing is true for
luminance and brightness.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.065
Now before I go onto this,
let me back up for a minute.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.320
Here, let me say one
more thing about this

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.387
because it's an interesting
way to remember it

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:19.220
and also it's relevant
to what you are going

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.220
to hear in the second
half of this course, which

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.180
is going to be on audition.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.787
So here's a classic question
people have often been asked,

00:10:26.787 --> 00:10:29.370
especially when you were still
in grammar school or maybe even

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.530
in high school.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.300
It was, when a tree
falls in the forest,

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.880
and there's nobody around,
does it make a sound?

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.870
And so people debate this, and
debate this, and debate this.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.680
Well, from my point
of view, there's

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.580
no question there at all.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.425
When a tree falls in
the forest and there

00:10:47.425 --> 00:10:49.470
are all these cracks
and everything,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.850
there is no sound because sound
is a psychological attribute

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.190
that we hear and interpret.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.240
There is, of course,
the production

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.390
of wavelengths as a
result of the fall.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.280
So that's up in the air there.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:10.310
But you need a human being to
turn that various frequencies

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.560
into what we call sound.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:17.555
So now the next thing I would
like to briefly approach--

00:11:17.555 --> 00:11:20.080
I'm going to talk about it in
much more detail in a minute--

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.734
is that it's been
established by now,

00:11:22.734 --> 00:11:24.400
but initially there
was quite a debate--

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.820
I'll come back to it-- that we
have three major kinds of cone

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.500
receptors in humans
and in many primates.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.485
And actually, in some
animals and some birds,

00:11:36.485 --> 00:11:38.440
there are actually four of them.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.105
And these three are the short,
middle, and long wavelength

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:43.605
cones.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.810
Of course, we can call those--
for short, we mean blue,

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.090
for medium, we mean green,
and for long, we mean red.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.245
And then we have the rods.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.530
And these numbers here--
this one is misspelled.

00:11:59.791 --> 00:12:00.290
bb?

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.340
I don't know what bb is.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:07.010
At any rate, these are
nanometers at which they peak.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.890
And we'll come back
to that in a minute.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.080
But before I go on with that,
let's imagine for a minute--

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.220
and we can skip this.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:25.890
Suppose that you are the
emperor of the universe

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:34.240
since the beginnings of time
1,500 million years ago.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:40.770
And you decided that you're
going to create animals.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.710
And once you've
created animals, you

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.310
have decided that they're
going to have to see things.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.310
And so they have to have
an eye with which to see.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:54.290
And then you have to decide,
well, if that's the case,

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.290
color is very important.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.956
You looked around in
the world and said,

00:12:56.956 --> 00:12:58.630
oh, all these beautiful colors.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.850
How are we going to have
these animals and these humans

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.480
see all the colors?

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.736
And then you said, well,
there are hundreds of colors.

00:13:07.736 --> 00:13:08.860
So what are we going to do?

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.870
Are we going to
create the receptor

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.890
for every one of these colors
and put them in the eye?

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.700
And you said, oh dear, that's
a problem because then we

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.870
would need a gigantic eye.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.015
And so the question
became, of course,

00:13:21.015 --> 00:13:23.260
how else would you
come around this?

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.210
And so here the idea, that
here you have sensitivity,

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.170
and then here you
have wavelength.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.190
And so the idea was that
you could create hundreds

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:38.270
of very sharply tuned
photoreceptors like that

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.975
so you could get all the colors.

00:13:39.975 --> 00:13:47.590
Well, that did not seem to be a
very good way of doing things.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:53.200
And so getting more back
to the present time--

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.490
still a long ways off from
the present, actually-- people

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.520
began to hypothesize about,
they say, well, what can

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.090
we do to minimize the
number of receptors

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.340
with different
sensitivities color

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.450
and still be able to see well?

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.960
And so one theory that came
up before they knew anything

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:16.520
about the eye and the
three cone photoreceptors,

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.260
Young and Helmholtz
came up with the idea

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.220
that if you had just
three types of cones

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.560
that are broadly
tuned, they could

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.040
take care of most of the
ability to see various colors.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.470
And so that became
a very interesting,

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.680
very, very powerful theory.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.460
And actually, speaking
of theories and models,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.190
it still is in my mind
probably the greatest model

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.500
or theory that has
ever been developed

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.640
about how the brain works
because it subsequently

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.010
did turn out that
indeed, there were three

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.820
of these receptors that are
broadly tuned that can provide

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.620
all that information for you.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.710
And that actually, as you
will see, became a huge issue.

00:15:02.411 --> 00:15:02.910
Sorry.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.990
Let me go back for
a minute to this.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.040
And let me just reiterate.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:17.130
These are the nanometers for
the three types of cones.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.430
And at the end here, we have
the nanometers for the rods.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:26.170
Then as a result of
analyzing all this stuff,

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.240
people have come up with
all sorts of rules and laws.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.870
And that's what is one of the
nice things about color vision.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.460
And one of the rules is called--
actually, laws in this case--

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.490
is called Grassmann's laws.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.900
And he said every color
has a complimentary which,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.730
when mixed properly,
yields gray.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.310
And I will explain this to
you in just a few minutes.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.290
And the other is that
non-complementary colors

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.123
yield intermediates.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.880
Just keep that in your head for
me until I fully explain it.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.580
And the other law, which I'm not
going to talk too much about,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.390
is that the luminance of a
mixture of differently colored

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:08.340
lights is equal to the
sum of the luminance

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.960
of its components.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.855
So these are very, very
basic rules-- laws.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.920
So here we go
again, and move on.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:22.530
Here is what is called the
CIE chromaticity diagram.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:26.140
And it was initially
devised in 1931.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.250
And let me explain to
you how this came about.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.320
This became an
international undertaking.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.580
And it came about
because it was highly

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.100
desirable to be
able to communicate

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.500
throughout the world
your particular color

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.640
desire or experience.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:52.040
So for example, if you had a
particular hat you had bought,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.380
say a blue hat of some
sort, and then said

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.680
now I would like to get
a dress that fits it.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.420
How can I do that?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.230
Well, what you can
do now as a result

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.859
of this chromaticity diagram,
there's a scale here.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:11.220
You can see the vertical values
and the horizontal values

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.270
going from 0 to close to 100.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:19.290
And then, if you can
specify a particular color,

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.589
say you want this
color here, you simply

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:24.405
can state what that color
is by giving it the number.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.780
And then you can send that
number to China or to,

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.520
I don't know, to South
Africa or something,

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.610
to a particular
company, and say I

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.480
want to have a dress like
that with that color.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.800
And then because this
is international,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.640
they were able to
produce that color

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.064
as you specified
on this diagram.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.730
So that was a very
powerful undertaking.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:52.070
And this arrangement is such
that actually, the colors

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.620
go from the center outward,
become more saturated.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.240
Think, for example, we're
going to here to here.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.620
And the center of this,
which is about 333 333

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.320
on the chromaticity
diagram, is white,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.480
which is not that obvious
here, partly because

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.520
of the colors of the background.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.490
So that is the famous
1931 chromaticity diagram.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.940
And what one can do with
this is to superimpose

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:27.340
on this some rules
about the human or, say,

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.897
the primate color
vision abilities.

00:18:29.897 --> 00:18:32.230
And the person who came up
with this, as I've mentioned,

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.130
was Newton.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:37.030
He came up with the so-called
famous color circle.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.810
Now, the color circle
is described here.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.210
And I'll show it to you
in just a minute head-on.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.380
This is green, this is red,
this is yellow, this is blue.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.370
And of course, the
question is, why do we

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.390
have them set up
in this fashion?

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.860
And we'll explain
that in just a minute.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.620
So here is the color circle, the
two-dimensional color circle,

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.600
where things are pretty
much equiluminant across it.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.330
Now, if you go from
the center out,

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.930
you increase saturation,
as I had already said.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.405
And as you go around,
you change hue.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.345
So those are the
basic attributes.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:21.150
Now to anticipate
the issues here,

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.910
let me tell you this-- this
is yellow, this is blue,

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.130
this is green, and this is red.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.765
These are called
the cardinal axes.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.820
As long as a line goes
through the center,

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.350
that's a cardinal axis.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.170
These are the ones
which are best known,

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.420
the red/green and blue/yellow.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.750
And the fascinating
fact about this

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:49.140
is that this explains a number
of very interesting facts

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.640
about our ability to see colors.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.480
So let me tell you this--
if you mix yellow and blue,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.690
as we have talked about
the law, if you mix them

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:05.530
in equal luminances, you get
what's in the center here.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:06.500
You get white.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.140
Furthermore, and
because of this,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.270
there is no such
experience in our existence

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.040
that's called yellowish blue.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.360
And there's no such
existence in our minds,

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.030
as far as color's concerned,
that's reddish green.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.190
On the other hand, if you
don't go across the center,

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.330
but you say you had yellow
here and you have green here,

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.230
there is yellowish green.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.130
There is yellowish red.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.910
There is bluish red.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.270
And there's bluish green.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.580
So we can process those and
see those in-between colors,

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.450
but we cannot do that
along the cardinal axes.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:53.240
So this incredible
color circle essentially

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.100
explains the very essence
of how we can see color.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.980
Now, there's one more
factor here, is that we also

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.130
have to take into
account luminance values.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:09.510
And so people turn this color
circle for some purposes

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.550
into a three-dimensional
entity that's shown here.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.410
Here's a color circle.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.200
And the third dimension
going up and down here,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.240
as you go from white to black,
if you will, in the center.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.650
So here, things are brighter
and here, things are darker.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.220
So that is sort of
a complete, then,

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.760
arrangement for your
color impressions.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.530
But what we are
going to do, we are

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.770
going to concentrate on
the color circle itself

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.610
as we move along.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:44.070
So now let's next turn
to the outgrowth of this,

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.870
starting with Newton's color
circle, which has been somewhat

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:51.830
modified in the manner
that I had just shown you.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:57.280
And as a result of all this,
a number of competing theories

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.150
have emerged.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.960
And I'm going to talk
about two of them.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.970
The first one is the famous
Young-Helmholtz theory.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.580
Young initially, and he
collaborated with him

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.030
many years later,
with Helmholtz,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.400
came up with the idea that
you could experience colors

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:19.600
by just having three types of
cones that are broadly tuned.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.900
And so he said there
are three types

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.390
of broadly tuned
color receptors.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.030
The color experience
is the product

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.635
of the relative
degree of activation.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.050
Now, that's a fantastic theory.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.420
But there's a big
problem with it.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.830
The big problem
with that theory is

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.410
that he doesn't explain
Grassmann's laws.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.780
Remember what
Grassmann's law is?

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.690
That if you mix things along the
cardinal axes, you get white.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.150
And you only get
other colors when

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.775
you mix them not along the axes.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.350
So that became a problem.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:03.410
And because of that, another
famous person, Herring,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.910
came up with an
alternate theory.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.820
He came up with a theory which
said that color opponency is

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.500
based on the observation
that red and green, as well

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.040
as blue and yellow, are mutually
exclusive, just as I had said.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.630
The nervous system
probably treats

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.390
red/green and blue/yellow
as antagonistic pairs,

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.260
with a third pair
being black and white.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.260
That's where the third
dimension comes in.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.230
So therefore he argued
that we need something

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:34.380
like color opponency to be
able to see colors right.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.010
Now, the interesting
thing about this

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.440
is that he became
very famous coming up

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.230
with this incredible theory.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.310
But then if you go
back in history,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:49.250
you find that Leonardo da
Vinci had this same idea

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.700
many, many, many
years before that.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.910
And this is from
his autobiography,

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.810
with a very poor translation.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.560
It says, "Of different
colors equally perfect,

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.130
that will appear
most excellent, which

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.940
is seen near its
direct contrary,

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.730
blue near yellow,
green near red,

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:11.270
because each color is seen,
when opposed to its contrary,

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.330
than any other similar to it."

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.105
It's not written in English
really, but you get the idea.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.770
So we have a major two theories.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.880
And then numerous
experiments subsequently

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.680
emerge, especially
when it became

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.220
possible to record the
neural activity of cells

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:36.120
to determine to what degree
these theories are correct.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.820
And of course, the first
correct aspect of both theories

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.480
was that indeed, we have
three types of cones

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.337
that are selected to
red, green, and blue,

00:24:46.337 --> 00:24:47.670
and that they are broadly tuned.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.470
So to now understand
better how it really

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.960
happens in the nervous
system, let's take a look

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.690
at the basic physiology
of color processing.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.670
I showed you this
slide once before.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:12.240
I pointed out to
you that contrary

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.470
to red and green cones, blue
cones are much less numerous.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.900
Only one out of eight are blue.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.400
And furthermore,
if you look at this

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.300
in the retinal surfaces
in the fovea area,

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.280
there appear to be very few
blue ones in the fovea itself.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.635
So the blue cones
are less numerous.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.860
And consequently,
it became a puzzle

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.040
of how do they contribute
to color vision.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.750
Now, to exemplify this further,
let me show you a slide here.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.250
Here what we vary is
a spatial frequency.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.550
And what you can see
is-- I think most of you

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.480
probably don't
see anything here.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.310
But most of you
probably still see this.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.640
This is the same spatial
frequency as this.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.000
But this activates
the blue cones mostly.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And this activates
your red cones.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.205
And you can see that your
acuity is much, much lower

00:26:13.205 --> 00:26:15.080
when you only have your
blue cones available.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:20.200
And that's because only
one out of eight blue cones

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.540
exist in the retina.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.435
So there's this very,
very clear distinction.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.306
So now let's talk about
the photoreceptors.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:38.690
Here we have an
absorption spectrum,

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:42.320
or I should say a series
of absorption spectra,

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.810
for the four kinds
of photoreceptors.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.945
And the fourth one is your rods.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.020
So what you see here--
and each of them

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.625
are fairly broadly tuned.

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:56.113
Here we have nanometers.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.540
And I'm sure all of
you know this already,

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.396
that 1 nanometer is a
billionth of a meter.

00:27:03.396 --> 00:27:05.270
So we're talking about
incredibly, incredibly

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.050
high frequencies.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.390
So that the important
thing to remember here

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:17.170
is that each of these cones
is fairly broadly tuned.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.520
And so consequently, any light
that comes into the eye tends

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.710
to activate all of the cones
unless they're at the very

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.140
extremes. .

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:32.220
And so indeed, as Young
and Helmholtz had proposed,

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.920
somehow we have to derive
our color experience

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.840
from the relative
amount of activity

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.660
from these different cone types.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.912
But then as I've
mentioned to you,

00:27:45.912 --> 00:27:52.430
Herring felt that that was not
sufficient to explain our color

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.380
abilities.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:28:00.010
And so what he did then is
to move on and had people,

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:04.700
especially much more recently,
examine more closely what

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:11.030
the center-surround organization
is of the different midget

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.850
cells in the retina.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.640
And if you remember,
initially I told you

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.200
that the prime theory was
that the center comes up,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.560
is comprised in the central
retina of just a single cone

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.160
and the surround of its
color opponent cone.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.770
But then, when people began to
study this very carefully using

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:35.110
a combination of
recordings and anatomy,

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.310
they found that actually
the surround is not

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.660
specific to one
type of cone input.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.940
It's mixed.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.050
And so then people
began to model that.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.760
And they found that
this arrangement

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.220
is almost as good
as this arrangement.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.050
And this is the truth, actually.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.310
That's how it is.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.840
And so then, just to remind
you, the parasol cells

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.560
have a mixture of these
inputs, both in the center

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.870
and the surround.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:06.380
And as we had discussed, the
parasol system cannot tell you

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:06.945
about colors.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.980
This I mentioned to you before.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.510
The midget system gives
a more sustained response

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.510
than the parasol system.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.250
So now I also showed
you this diagram.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:23.490
And we established that the
green and the red cones each

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.940
give rise to an
on and off system

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.090
at the level of
the bipolar cells,

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:32.810
and then give rise to the
on and off ganglion cells.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.200
The red and green on
and off ganglion cells.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.220
Now, the blue system
is more complicated

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:46.510
because if you would have had
four different kinds of cones,

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.210
meaning a blue one
and a yellow one,

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.540
then probably would have
had a similar arrangement.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:58.090
But nature somehow had failed to
create a yellow cone because it

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.640
felt it was not necessary--
because if you have

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:07.204
an equal mix of red and
green, you get yellow,

00:30:07.204 --> 00:30:08.995
because remember,
they're not on opposites.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.900
Sorry.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.580
They're opposite.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:25.630
But if you mix them, you can
create an impression of yellow

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:29.710
because they're not along
the exact axes for the colors

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.740
themselves.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.060
So the argument was
therefore that you

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:42.400
must have blue on and
blue/yellow on ganglion cells.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.450
But whether this
is really the case

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:46.434
is still to some degree debated.

00:30:46.434 --> 00:30:47.975
People have done a
lot of recordings.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.450
And much of this
was done not only

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.282
in the retina, but also your
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:30:55.282 --> 00:30:56.740
And so the question
was, let's just

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:02.600
find out what is the
color tuning of cells

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.910
in the lateral geniculate
nucleus to understand this.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:10.440
And to do this, when we went
back to the color circle

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.690
and presented stimuli
along the color circle

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.240
through the receptive
fields of these cells

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.735
to see how they responded.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:24.950
And here's an example of
a so-called blue ON cell.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:29.285
It shows here you [INAUDIBLE]
the cell is tuned.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.020
Sharply tuned,
mostly to 90 degrees.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.420
The yellow cell is the opposite.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:41.090
And green OFF cell here
and a green ON cell here.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:45.640
So what happens then is when you
take a lot of sample of these,

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.610
huge sample of
them, what you find

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.770
is that in the lateral
geniculate nucleus,

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:56.150
you don't get any cells
that are at the diagonals.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.910
All the cells fall into
these major four categories

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:01.365
along your cardinal axes.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.680
And then if you take
a big huge sample,

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.380
you come up with the
following summary--

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.790
that you have red ON
cells, red OFF cells.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:14.390
You have green ON cells and
you have green OFF cells.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:16.420
And at least some people
claim that you only

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.250
have blue ON and Yellow ONs.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.410
You don't have blue
OFFs and yellow OFFs.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:21.725
That is still under debate.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.870
But certainly, if you
do extensive recordings,

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:29.100
if you find any OFF
blue and yellow OFFs,

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.290
they're extremely rare
if they exist at all.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:40.450
So now to try to gain
yet further understanding

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:51.720
of the role various areas
play in color vision,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.040
is that one can make lesions.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.300
And I've already
told you what happens

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.850
when you make either
parvocellular or magnocellular

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.550
lesion.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:05.650
That blocks the parasol
or the midget systems.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.290
And that the midget system is
essential for color vision.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.360
And then I showed you this.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.650
Here is a geniculate.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.930
If you take out this area,
you block the midget system.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:23.550
And if you take out this area,
you block the parasol system.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:25.970
So if you do that--
here is an overall view

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.330
of the monkey brain.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.290
Here's area V1 Here's the V2.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.990
And here's area V4, which
I've mentioned to you

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:37.210
before had been believed to
play a central role in color.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.310
So then it becomes
important to see just

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.616
what happens when you make
lesions in these areas.

00:33:42.616 --> 00:33:44.240
In this case, you
can make a lesion V4.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.500
And then we can examine
color discrimination.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.040
And I told you in
a monkey, what you

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.810
do is you use an oddity task.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.720
After fixation, you can
present the odd stimulus either

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.510
in the intact parts
of the visual field

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.425
or those that had been lesions.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.780
This is a high contrast.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.370
And if you do that
experiment-- I

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.050
showed you part of
this data before.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:17.429
I showed you that after
lesion of the parvocellular

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:21.110
geniculate, which blocks
the midget system,

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:24.159
you totally lose the
ability to discriminate

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:26.980
even these high colors,
red, green, and blue.

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:32.679
But no deficit
arises when you make

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:35.850
a lesion in the magnocellular
portion of the geniculate.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.639
And then the big
question became what

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:44.719
happens in V4, since
that had for decades been

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:50.040
declared to be a color area.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.320
And what was surprising about
that is that after V4 lesion,

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.660
there was only a
small deficit in color

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.430
for this high-contrast stimuli.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:04.450
So therefore people have to
go on and do a more careful

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.740
detailed study to
see what happens

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.300
if you use less
saturated colors.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.990
Remember that the
degree of saturation

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.520
is one of the important
factors for analyzing color.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.320
And here we have an example
of a very low saturation.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.700
And here we have a
somewhat high saturation.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.100
And you can vary
that systematically

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.160
and see what happens
after V4 lesion

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.300
and after other
kinds of lesions.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.230
And here's an example of
what happens in a V4 lesion.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.590
And this is what
happens in an MT lesion.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.990
It shows no deficit at
all with an MT lesion,

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:42.530
indicating that MT does
not play a crucial role

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.100
in analyzing color.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.410
We do get this
significant deficit here,

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:48.510
but it's a small one.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.250
So even at low
saturations, the monkey

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.670
still can do colors
reasonably well.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.550
So it's not like V4
is the color area.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.570
There apparently
are several areas

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.760
in the brain that
can process color.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.370
And V4 does that in
addition to performing

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:13.980
several other analyses
that we will discuss

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.330
in a couple of
sessions from now.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:21.700
So now we're going to turn
to another very interesting

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.525
phenomenon, which is what
is called isoluminance.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.460
What is isoluminance?

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:32.310
Isoluminance is the
presentation of different colors

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:37.940
that have the same
illumination level.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.040
So I'm going to give you
a few examples of this.

00:36:44.859 --> 00:36:46.400
If you look at this--
how many of you

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.460
can read those words there?

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.860
Pretty tough, isn't it?

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.120
This can be set up in such
a way that it's even worse.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:00.220
But because of the light bulb in
there, it's not really perfect.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.820
But just to give
you a sense of it

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.020
obviously goes to a
lot easier to read.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.450
So that's because this
is close to isoluminance,

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:13.720
at which our ability to see
objects is much impeded.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.800
Not eliminated, but impeded.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.550
So what can you do to do
this kind of experiment

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.680
systematically?

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.560
What you can do here is you
can use various capabilities.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.270
Stereopsis, motion parallax--
just motion-- and texture.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:34.460
And if you do that, and you vary
the red/green luminance ratio,

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:39.100
you can see that there's a
dramatic drop off at around

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.430
very close to a luminous
ratio of one and one.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:47.330
So indeed, our ability
to process information

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.180
in the absence of
luminance information

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.385
is greatly compromised.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.780
So then the question
came up-- I mean,

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:01.560
we're talking about here such
things as motion perception,

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.020
texture perception,
and stereopsis.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.570
And as we had
discussed before, we

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:09.590
have already established that
texture and stereopsis are

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:13.260
processed to a large extent
by the midget system.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.380
And that motion
to a large extent

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.320
is processed by
the parasol system.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.940
But all three of these
types of capabilities

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.460
are compromised isoluminance

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:31.550
So a series of experiments
had been carried out

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:37.590
in which people argued that
when you present stimuli

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:48.730
at isoluminance, you render
the parasol system unresponsive

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.360
because it gets equal input
in the center-surround,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.610
some red and green
cones and blue cones.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.240
So therefore, they
concluded, that if there's

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:05.370
a deficit in
performance like this,

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:10.280
that must reflect the fact
that the parasol system plays

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.510
an important role
in the analysis.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.860
But as I told you
before, stereopsis

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.200
is processed predominantly
by the midget system

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.830
and so is texture.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.890
So that raised quite a problem.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:24.680
And so people began to run
experiments in which they

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:31.360
recorded from the parasol system
to see what happens actually

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.670
to unit responses when
you are at isoluminance.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.450
And that resulted
in quite a surprise.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.710
So here is an example
of a magnocellular cell,

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.313
meaning a cell that gets
input from the parasol system

00:39:46.313 --> 00:39:47.740
of the retina.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.460
And you alternate between red
and green here repeatedly,

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.460
collect the data, and you
vary the red/green ratio.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:01.190
And you can see here that
throughout the whole thing,

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.895
the cell continues to respond.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.410
So that became quite a puzzle.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:10.790
We were not able to
silence the magnocellular

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.530
system at isoluminance.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.830
So the question is, how come?

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:23.120
Well, the answer is,
as you had seen before,

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.270
that the parasol system
is extremely sensitive.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.000
It gets input even in the
center of the receptive

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.175
field of each cell
for many of-- I

00:40:32.175 --> 00:40:36.490
should maybe say
several-- different cones.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.880
And because of that,
there's much more

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.800
information and excitation
coming into those cells

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.180
than into those that
are in the midget system

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.630
that most of which
only get input

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.050
from a single cone
for the center.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.980
So that being the case
then, we can move on

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.150
and ask a question
of what about if you

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:00.055
do the same kind of
experiment in area MT.

00:41:00.055 --> 00:41:01.110
Now, who remembers?

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.120
Area MT gets most of its
input from which system?

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:06.810
Good.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:11.550
Mostly from the parasol system
going through the magnocellular

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:12.090
layers.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.040
So now you can
record in the area MT

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.620
and do the same kind of
experiment I just described

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.580
to you the retina in the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.970
And so what you can do
here is you have a monkey.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.230
The monkey fixates.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:31.730
And you move a bar of light
across the receptor field

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.870
back and forth which is
isoluminant-- red/green

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.305
in this case.

00:41:36.305 --> 00:41:39.330
And then you see how
well the cell responds.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.030
And then for comparison
what you can do

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:45.680
is you can use a luminance
grading, bright and dark

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.590
in the background,
to which we know

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:57.600
that the parasol cells and
the cells in the area MT

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.270
respond vigorously.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:03.950
So now we are going to
compare what the difference is

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.550
between these two conditions,
meaning luminance grading as

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:11.400
opposed to an isoluminant
color grading.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.540
So if you do that experiment,
you're in for surprise.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.710
Here's an example of one
cell in which there's

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.850
a much more vigorous
response to luminance.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.545
Here are the various
luminance contrasts.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.670
And here is a chrominance one.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.790
And the cell doesn't
respond as well here,

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.180
but it still responds
reasonably well.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:34.550
Then you take another cell
and you get the opposite.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:37.620
And this particular
cell, still in area MT,

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.930
responds a bit more
vigorously to chrominance

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.280
than to luminance.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.210
And so if you add
this all up and record

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.790
for many, many cells, you
find that the cells in area

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.785
MT, just like in the
lateral geniculate nucleus

00:42:50.785 --> 00:42:56.000
and in the retina, respond
quite well at isoluminance--

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.650
the parasol cells and the
same cells, of course,

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:04.350
in the lateral geniculate
nucleus, and in area MT.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:11.620
So this area MT is one that
responds surprisingly well

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:15.920
to anything that's out there
that results in a change,

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.440
whether the change is produced
by virtue of chrominance

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.550
or by virtue of luminance.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:25.760
And that, in fact, is one of
the very important attributes

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:31.500
of the parasol system.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.690
Namely, and that's so
numerous in the periphery,

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.920
is to be able to detect just
about anything that happens--

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:47.680
motion, flicker, just the onset
of a single stimulus, whatever.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.730
But that system
is very sensitive

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:51.710
and can tell something
has happened there.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.300
That's what that system
is very good for.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.820
It's not that good,
obviously, for seeing

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.880
very, very fine detail.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.320
But it's very sensitive.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.990
And it's very, very
good for detecting

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:04.155
motion and appearances.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:11.010
So now we're going to move
on and talk about a topic

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.270
that I'm sure many of
you have an interest in.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:18.340
And that has to do with
deficiencies in color,

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:20.333
often referred to
as color blindness.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:26.890
And the first fact
is that if you

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:31.320
look at the incidence of
color deficits in humans,

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:37.660
8 out of 100 males among
Caucasians, 5 in a 100

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.440
in Asians, 3 in a
100 in Africans.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.070
In females, it's
much, much less.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:45.100
It's 10 times less frequent.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.400
But still overall,
that's quite a number

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:53.000
of people who have some
sort of deficiency in color.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.970
So now that we know that, we
can ask the next question-- what

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.580
kinds of color
deficits can we denote?

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.160
And the type, these are
given fancy names, which

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.860
are called protanopes,
deuteranopes, and tritanopes.

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.050
And that simply
refers to the fact

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:12.120
that protanopes lack
long-wavelength cones, which

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.670
are of course the red cones.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:16.042
The deuteranopes lack
medium-wavelength cones,

00:45:16.042 --> 00:45:17.000
if you talk green ones.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.410
And the tritanopes lack
the short-wavelength cones,

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:22.220
which are the blue ones.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.000
So that is the basic
types of deficits.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.130
Now, some people have
a combination of these.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:30.830
Some people have no color vision
at all, but that's very rare.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:37.460
Quite common are
these three types.

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:41.327
You somehow don't have one
particular kind of cone

00:45:41.327 --> 00:45:46.500
or you have very few of
them, or you have them,

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.910
but they don't function right.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:56.010
So now, how do we establish
our ability to see colors

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.050
and whether we have
normal color vision?

00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.730
Now, that's very interesting.

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.860
A number of tests
have been developed.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.465
And the most famous of
those, the oldest one--

00:46:04.465 --> 00:46:11.330
let me go back, sorry-- are
the so-called Ishihara plates.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:14.882
And the next one's the
Farnsworth-Munsell Hue Test.

00:46:14.882 --> 00:46:16.840
And the third one I was
going to tell you about

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.140
is the dynamic computer test.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.360
So let's look at
the Ishihara plates

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.720
If you look at that,
how many of you

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.270
can see what is written there?

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.006
What is it?

00:46:31.006 --> 00:46:31.900
AUDIENCE: Eight.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:32.230
PROFESSOR: Eight.

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.730
Very good.

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.560
Anybody who doesn't see it?

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.735
OK, you don't see that.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:38.550
We'll get back to
you in a minute.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:45.340
So now another test
is a dynamic one.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.740
The reason for
using a dynamic test

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:53.830
is that the
so-called isoluminant

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:56.750
point of individuals
is not the same.

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:59.440
Expect a lot of variations
from person to person.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.630
And so this test
is the dynamic one.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:03.800
They presented for
the background,

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:09.650
as you can see here, different
luminance levels in gray.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:11.630
And when the computer
starts running,

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:14.490
these keep exchanging each
other in randomized fashions.

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:15.977
It's the dynamic view.

00:47:15.977 --> 00:47:17.560
And then you have a
central area here.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.560
Everybody can read this, right?

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.520
What's the word?

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.146
AUDIENCE: Lite.

00:47:21.146 --> 00:47:21.811
PROFESSOR: Lite.

00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:22.470
Very good.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:27.570
So now instead of presenting
these letters here

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:33.070
in a high brightness overall,
we can present them in color.

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:34.930
So I'm now going to
show you an easy test.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.950
Anybody can read this?

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:39.280
Anybody who cannot read it?

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.270
Can you read it?

00:47:43.898 --> 00:47:44.971
AUDIENCE: Ish.

00:47:44.971 --> 00:47:45.595
PROFESSOR: Ish.

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:49.277
So what's the word?

00:47:49.277 --> 00:47:50.211
AUDIENCE: MIT.

00:47:50.211 --> 00:47:50.980
PROFESSOR: MIT.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:51.490
What's that?

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.795
So now I'm going to
make it more difficult.

00:47:56.795 --> 00:47:57.810
You guys ready?

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.207
What is this one?

00:48:00.207 --> 00:48:01.430
AUDIENCE: Fit.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.249
PROFESSOR: Are you having a--

00:48:03.249 --> 00:48:04.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
a little harder.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:06.290
PROFESSOR: You're
having a fit, huh?

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:08.026
Can you read that one?

00:48:08.026 --> 00:48:08.519
AUDIENCE: No, I can't.

00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:09.102
PROFESSOR: No.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.930
So now it seems like we
do have one person here

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:17.550
who has perhaps a
mild color deficiency.

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:21.330
And so now the question
comes up, even if all of you

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:24.510
want to do this, what can
you do to test yourself?

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:27.740
Well, so let me
tell you about that.

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:32.310
There is a so-called
Farnsworth-Munsell color test.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:35.200
So what you want to do here is--
can you read this down here?

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.831
Get on Google and just type in
Farnsworth-Munsell color test

00:48:45.831 --> 00:48:46.330
online.

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:51.450
If you type that in, all
kinds of things come up.

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:54.000
Click on the topmost one.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
And then what you see
here is a set of colors.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.570
Actually, there are four sets.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:00.720
And each of these has 20.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.610
And I just drew
a few of them in.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:05.490
And your task is
then-- each of these

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:09.780
can be moved-- to
arrange them in an order,

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:13.140
going from this color
to that color in order.

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.400
So you do that for
all four of them.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.100
And after did that, you
can click on the bottom.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:24.930
And it will tell you what your
score is for each of these.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.480
And so if your color
vision is very good,

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.840
it gives you sort of
a set of histograms.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.960
And if the histogram is very,
very low, then you're good.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.590
And if it's high,
then you're not.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:41.357
What you can actually do is
when this first comes on,

00:49:41.357 --> 00:49:42.440
these are in random order.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:46.570
Your task is to
put them in order.

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:50.150
But at the bottom
here, it says score.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:53.710
So if you click on
score, it will give you

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:57.290
the histograms uncorrected.

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:58.680
And they're all
going to be high.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.910
Then you do this work.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.060
And then you click
on it again and see

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.897
how good your color
vision is based on that.

00:50:04.897 --> 00:50:05.980
It's a bit time-consuming.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.790
But if you are interested in
getting a sense of just how

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:14.560
good your color vision is,
this is a rather good test,

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.655
which is readily
available on the internet.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:21.345
Does anybody have any
questions about this portion?

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:24.190
Good.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:28.220
So now as a result
of this, we're

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:34.250
going to move on and spend the
remainder of our time talking

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:40.420
about adaptation because that is
pretty closely relevant, as we

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:45.040
shall see, to color
vision as well.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.020
So I'm going to talk
about adaptation.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:50.660
First of all, again we come up
with a number of basic facts.

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:53.560
Now let me at this
point interject

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:59.850
and just tell you
that all the material

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:07.190
I'm talking about today
will be posted on Stellar.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.470
What's on Stellar now is
not an updated version.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:16.350
But what I'm talking about
today will be on Stellar

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:17.225
I think by tomorrow.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:19.940
So basic facts.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.253
We talk about overall
levels of illumination.

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:27.770
That's what's so remarkable
about the visual system.

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:28.970
It's actually unbelievable.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.385
10 log units overall.

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:36.360
But the reflected light varies
over much smaller range.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.775
In other words, you don't want
to look at directly at light.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:44.320
The reflected light
varies only about 20 fold.

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:48.285
So now the question is,
how do we handle this?

00:51:48.285 --> 00:51:51.990
Well, it turns out
that the pupil, which

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:55.220
does play a role
in this, can only

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.240
adjust over a range of 16 to 1.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:02.600
So that's a long cry
from 10 log units.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.520
And so much of the
adaptation I would

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.450
say, even more so the
adaptation that takes place,

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:09.590
occurs in your photoreceptors.

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:15.200
So here I'm saying this
again-- most light adaptation

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.790
takes place in the
photoreceptors.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:19.310
Now, how does it take place?

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:23.510
Well, the way it takes place is
that-- I mentioned this to you

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:28.340
before-- the photoreceptor
molecules, like rhodopsin

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:32.400
in the rods, comes
in two basic forms.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.590
You don't need to know
the chemistry of it,

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:39.780
but you make two or simply
that it comes in two forms.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.780
We can call it bleached
and unbleached.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.725
Some people call
it open and closed.

00:52:44.725 --> 00:52:46.475
But let's call it
bleached and unbleached.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.335
This is very dynamic process.

00:52:51.335 --> 00:52:57.800
At any level of illumination a
certain percentage of molecules

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.930
is bleached in each receptor
and a certain number

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:04.300
is not bleached.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.250
And the brighter the
illumination, the more

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:08.515
are bleached.

00:53:08.515 --> 00:53:13.600
It's dynamic, which I mean is
that the molecules constantly

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.710
keep changing.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.936
So it's the overall
percentage of the ratios

00:53:17.936 --> 00:53:19.560
between the beached
and the unbleached.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.805
So that means that any increase
in the rate of which quanta

00:53:24.805 --> 00:53:28.256
is delivered to the eye results
in a proportional decrease

00:53:28.256 --> 00:53:31.150
in the number of pigment
molecules available to absorb

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:33.150
those quanta because
they are bleached.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:41.880
Now, this arrangement happens
to be extremely clever.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.040
And this is
reflected in the fact

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.990
that the retinal ganglion cells
are sensitive to local contrast

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.540
differences.

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.039
Remember, I told you there's a
center-surround organization.

00:53:53.039 --> 00:53:55.400
This is one of the prime
reasons we have that.

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:01.110
The overwhelming
majority, like 95%

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:04.650
of the cells in the retina,
the retinal ganglion cells,

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:08.150
respond to contrast
differences, not

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.395
to absolute levels
of illumination.

00:54:10.395 --> 00:54:13.310
And that's how we often
talk about contrast.

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:16.320
And if you remember what
the contrast formula is,

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:22.330
it's the contrast level
of the stimulus itself

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.390
and the contrast level
of the background.

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:28.700
You subtract one from the other,
divided by the sum of the two,

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.250
multiplied by 100.

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.510
I showed that to you before.

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.580
So now here we are.

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.930
If you talk about light
and dark adaptation,

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:40.990
this is the basic outline
of the retinal connections

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:42.280
that we have talked about.

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.610
We have presented this
several times before.

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:47.170
And then if you
are light adapted,

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:50.910
you essentially have
non-functional rods,

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:52.490
so I took them off here.

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:55.360
But then when you darken
that, the opposite happens.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.005
And you have the rods active.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.230
But they all fit into
the same ganglion cells.

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:04.280
And that's why at night, the
receptor fields are bigger.

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.570
And you don't see color
at night because this

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:07.990
is what the picture is.

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:11.470
Now what you can do is
let's ask the question,

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:15.350
how do the neurons, like
the cells in the retina,

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:18.360
the retinal ganglion
cells how do they

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.100
fire at different
levels of illumination?

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.370
And that's quite an
interesting story

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:25.890
and a very straightforward one.

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.230
Here we have a cell
that had been adapted

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:33.990
to these different levels
of background illumination.

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:39.760
At minus 5, your
rods are functional.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.230
And what is
important to see here

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:46.140
is that as you change quite
dramatically the background

00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:50.280
level, the eye adapts.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.140
And I should say that it's the
photoreceptors predominately

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.170
that do so.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.850
And what they look at
are local differences.

00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:01.360
And so each of these
then sees a fresh,

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:06.590
the contrast that is
created, rather than looking

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:08.400
at absolute illumination levels.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.900
And that's what you
want, of course.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.740
You want to be able to
drive well at night.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:14.220
You want to be able to
drive well in the daytime.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:18.370
And by having this system,
you can look at predominantly

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:21.800
at contrast
differences rather than

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.560
absolute levels of contrast.

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.250
So that's the arrangement here.

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:27.180
And now what we
are going to do is

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:33.297
to move on and talk about
the so-called after-effects

00:56:33.297 --> 00:56:33.880
of adaptation.

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.980
So let me tell you how
this initially was done.

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:45.120
People ask the question, what
happens if I fix something

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:50.345
on your retina for
a period of time?

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.840
If that previous set of
data that I've shown you

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.260
is correct, if I present
something to the retina

00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.980
and leave it there, pretty
soon you won't see anything.

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:05.280
A famous series
of experiments was

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.660
done, by now many,
many years ago,

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:11.100
in which they-- very
clever experiment--

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.780
had subjects lie down.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.950
And they put a contact
lens in the eye.

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:22.930
And in the contact lens, they
put a miniature projector on,

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:26.940
which meant that when you
turn that projector light on,

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:30.830
it went to a fixed position
on the retinal surface.

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:32.510
Why was this necessary?

00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:35.300
Well, the reason it
happened is because it

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.850
was discovered that
your eye actually

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:41.130
is not really stable on purpose.

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:43.020
Your eye ha a
so-called eye tremor.

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:46.770
And of course, you move
your eyes all the time.

00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:51.000
So this procedure of
having a contact lens

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.870
with a projector
attached to it kind of

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:56.435
got rid of the eye tremor.

00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:04.710
So when they did
that, they found that,

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:08.070
depending on the contrast, in
a matter of a minute or less,

00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.370
maybe even 30 seconds,
you would stop

00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:16.020
seeing what was
presented to the eye

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:20.470
because you then
change the adaptation

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.570
level in your photoreceptors.

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:26.830
So then subsequently,
people had a clever idea.

00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:29.590
Said, we don't need to go
through this incredible trouble

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:33.526
of having to have people with
contact lenses and a projector,

00:58:33.526 --> 00:58:35.150
and having them lie
down because that's

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:36.500
the only way it would work.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.830
We can do this much more simply.

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:42.820
And so to do that, I'm going
to have a demonstration here.

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.990
What I would like
each of you to do

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:48.930
is to-- you see it's a light
spot here and dark spot there.

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:53.280
So I want you to fixate
here and count to about 30.

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:56.980
And be very relaxed about it.

00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:57.990
This is a Gaussian.

00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:00.730
Therefore there's no sharp
edge and the eye tremor

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:01.820
doesn't matter.

00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.270
Then after you counted
to 30, shift your gaze

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:05.370
to the bottom one.

00:59:10.675 --> 00:59:12.180
The first thing
that happens if you

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:14.340
keep looking at it,
the two on the top

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:18.660
here disappear if you
fixate very tightly.

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.600
And once they disappear,
then you can look down.

00:59:23.975 --> 00:59:25.100
Everybody see it disappear?

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:27.030
Good.

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:29.112
And what happened when
you looked at the bottom?

00:59:29.112 --> 00:59:30.028
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.840
PROFESSOR: You got
a reversal, right?

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.505
You got a dark spot here
and a light spot here.

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:38.310
And you say oh my god,
what's going on here?

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:42.440
So now let's do
another experiment.

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.290
I want you to do this again.

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:47.610
But what I want you to do is
to cover one eye up and then

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:48.210
do it again.

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:49.400
Count to 30.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:53.470
And after you did so, make
[INAUDIBLE] down the bottom,

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:54.880
but switch your eye.

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:04.790
And if you switch the eye,
cover the one that you looked at

01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:07.650
and uncover the one
that you didn't look at.

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:10.450
And if you do that, you
won't get any effect.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.240
So what does that prove?

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.690
That prove that this is
happening in the retina.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.170
Everybody agree?

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:19.290
Very clear cut.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.970
So what's going on here?

01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:25.600
So let's diagram this.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.310
Here we have the situation.

01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:28.735
You turned on these two stimuli.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.180
And then when we turn it down,
initially their sensitivity

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.350
of your photoreceptors
is pretty much the same

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.260
because it was a
homogeneous background.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:41.650
Then after you looked at this
for awhile-- no, one more

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:42.450
thing.

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:44.900
In this case, the ON cells
fired, and in this case,

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.770
the OFF cells fired, saying,
oh, dark spot, oh, light spot.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:52.030
Now, if you keep looking at
this for awhile, what happens

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:53.550
is it begins to disappear.

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:56.750
When it does, what happens
is you don't see anything

01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:01.330
and what happens also is that
the sensitivity here decreases

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:04.530
for white light and [INAUDIBLE]
increases here for white light.

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:08.470
So therefore, what happens
is once you adapted to this,

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:14.720
there is no response
in the ganglion cells.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.450
Then for the third step.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:19.930
When you've made
yourself look down,

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.950
there were homogeneous
background.

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:24.990
But this region is less and
this region's more sensitive.

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:29.790
And so therefore the
photons come into your eye

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:33.010
from those two regions hit
more and less sensitive

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:37.140
regions on the rental
surface, thereby activating

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:40.600
the opposite cells-- here
activating the OFF cells,

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.040
here activating the ON cells.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:47.864
Sorry-- right, yeah.

01:01:49.136 --> 01:01:50.740
We got a reversal.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.950
So that explains why
you see the after image.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.900
So now we're going to
continue and get back

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:05.050
to the question of
the color circle,

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.605
see what happens with
after images with color.

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:16.170
So this color circle is
unbelievably powerful

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:21.130
because it explains the after
images that you see with color.

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:23.520
And I will come
back to this circle.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.400
But what I want
you to do now again

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:32.200
is to fixate here, count
until, again, about 30,

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.600
and then fixate on the bottom.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.640
So if you do that, I think
most of you should see,

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.537
again, a reversal.

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:55.870
Here you would see some reddish.

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:57.510
Here you would see
something greenish.

01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:59.280
Does everybody see that?

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.520
Do you see that too?

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.020
Good.

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:04.490
So you have a very
minor color deficit.

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:08.250
So that's the case here.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:09.870
So now let me show
you another one.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.790
And again, do the
same experiment.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.260
And what you see here at the
after images you get-- whoops.

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:29.760
Sorry.

01:03:30.795 --> 01:03:31.420
Let me go back.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.950
The after images
you get here are not

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:38.850
going to be the
complimentaries here.

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:40.570
So what's going on?

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:42.360
So let me explain it to you.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.755
Here again is a color circle.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.170
And here the prime axes.

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:53.640
It turns out that if you
adapt to this level here,

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.077
the rule of the color circle
says if you go across,

01:03:58.077 --> 01:03:59.910
this is the after image
you're going to see.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:04.590
And if you adapt to here,
this is the after image

01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:05.650
you're going to see.

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:07.140
So let me draw that up.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.140
It looks like that.

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:14.430
And that is true everywhere, as
long as you go across the axis.

01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:18.320
You could do this horizontally
or even diagonally,

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.565
and you get this reversal.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.610
So it says that an after image
can be perfectly predicted

01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:27.530
by the rules of
the color circle.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.950
It's on the opposite
side of the image

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:34.430
that you look at,
going across the center

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:37.030
along the cardinal axis.

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:41.240
But now if you do the diagonals,
which I showed you before,

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.540
when it didn't match,
what we have here,

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.120
you have this and this.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.810
Then the after image
is this and that.

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:50.500
And so we don't have a
correspondence, of course,

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:59.490
because you're not along the
axes that would predict this.

01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:01.680
This one gives you that
and this one give you that.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.380
So if I did this and
this to begin with,

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.130
it would be the same
as that, but rotated.

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:15.020
So that then clearly enables
us to use the color circle

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:18.010
to predict not only some of the
basic effects of what colors

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.400
we see, but also to tell
you exactly what kinds

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.787
of after images you get.

01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:22.495
Quite remarkable.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.770
So now to drive
this home once more.

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:29.330
This doesn't work too well
because the colors are crummy

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:31.037
here, but we can try it.

01:05:31.037 --> 01:05:33.620
Everybody agree this is sort of
a more or less black and white

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.770
display-- a little
bluish, unfortunately,

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:38.035
here-- of a beautiful castle?

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.590
See that fixation point here?

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.840
What I want you to do
here is to fixate here,

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.210
again, count to 30, and
then I'll switch back to it.

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:52.150
And if this were
to work right, you

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:55.840
would see the original black
and white image in color.

01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:58.345
Keep fixating.

01:05:58.345 --> 01:05:59.890
Count to 20 more.

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:01.256
And then I'll switch back.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.527
Did you see the colors?

01:06:08.527 --> 01:06:09.690
Yeah.

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:13.100
So this is a very
clever demo I found.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:15.140
I'm afraid I don't
remember the person's name

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.350
who came up with this one.

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:22.230
But the essence of it is, again,
that indeed what is happening

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:28.115
is that you're creating an
after effect due to adaptation

01:06:28.115 --> 01:06:28.770
in the retina.

01:06:31.892 --> 01:06:33.350
And when you do
this very cleverly,

01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:37.430
like this particular
castle picture,

01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:40.350
you can actually create
an artificial impression

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:43.420
of colors which are in
consonance with what

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.170
the real colors would look like
in a black and white picture.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.300
So that then is
the essence of what

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.460
I wanted to cover
about adaptation.

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:56.120
And we can now
come and summarize

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.890
what I had covered today.

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:04.885
So first of all, I
told you that there

01:07:04.885 --> 01:07:08.450
are three qualities of
color-- hue, brightness,

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:09.100
and saturation.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.230
And just to go back--
hang on for a minute.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:18.230
I want to go back once
more to make this clear,

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:19.570
which I forgot to mention.

01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:22.820
If you go around the
circle, you change hue.

01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:30.240
And if you go from the
periphery to the center,

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.170
you change saturation.

01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:39.040
And the center here, if this
color circle were 100% correct,

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.805
this would be a white area.

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:49.660
Now, the basic rules
of color vision

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:53.960
are explained by the color
circle, as we have amply seen.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.200
There's something probably--
I have a color circle

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:01.162
up on my wall in my office
because I'm always fascinated

01:08:01.162 --> 01:08:03.245
by this, even though I've
been doing it for years.

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:09.360
So the three photoreceptors
we talked about in humans

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.890
and in primates, the red,
green, and blue, which

01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:13.640
shouldn't be called that.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.130
People get mad when you do
that, even though that's the way

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.010
I call it.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:18.840
But people want to call
them short, medium,

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.800
and long-wavelength cones.

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:25.010
They are broadly tuned,
as I had shown you

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:26.240
in those spectrograms.

01:08:27.939 --> 01:08:30.910
The color-opponent midget
retinal ganglion cells

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:34.230
form two cardinal axes, the
red/green and the blue/yellow.

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:41.189
And those, if you
remember I told you

01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:43.180
at the level of the
retinal ganglion cells

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:48.330
and at the level of the
lateral geniculate nucleus,

01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:51.109
fall into these two
major categories.

01:08:51.109 --> 01:08:53.029
We won't have any
under diagonals.

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:56.140
So for us to be properly
able to see diagonals,

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.390
that's done somewhere
in the cortex.

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:00.069
It's not done at the
level of the retina

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.485
or the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:05.979
Now, I also pointed out
to you several times

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:08.255
already that the midget
system's essential for color

01:09:08.255 --> 01:09:08.880
discrimination.

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:15.210
And the parasol cells can see
stimuli even at isoluminance.

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:19.620
They just cannot say
what the color is.

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.100
They don't, quotes,
"perceive" different colors.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.729
But they can see
any kind of change

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.609
that occurs in the
environment, even when it

01:09:28.609 --> 01:09:29.567
occurs at isoluminance.

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:37.229
Color is processed in
many cortical areas,

01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:41.899
lesions to any single
extrastriate area

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:44.090
fails to eliminate
the processing

01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:45.630
of chrominance information.

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:49.390
It can reduce it, but
it doesn't block it out.

01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:50.880
That's true for many things.

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:56.510
So the cortical areas
are very, very complex.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:01.950
And they do interactive analysis
for many different attributes,

01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:03.070
including color.

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:10.240
However, I can add here that
does not apply to area MT

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.080
because MT does not
seem to be specializing

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.786
in color because lesions there,
you [INAUDIBLE] any deficit.

01:10:16.786 --> 01:10:18.410
But there's several
other visual areas.

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:22.040
We went through that, V3, and
[INAUDIBLE] cortex, and so on.

01:10:23.066 --> 01:10:28.070
These areas contribute to
the processing of color.

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.300
Now, the perception
of isoluminance

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.680
is categorized for all
categories of vision.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.760
It's not selected
to only those that

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.940
are processed by the midget
or the parasol systems.

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:42.330
All aspects of vision--
and the three I

01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:46.916
showed you was,
stereopsis, motion,

01:10:46.916 --> 01:10:49.480
and what was the third one?

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.460
AUDIENCE: Texture.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:51.700
PROFESSOR: Texture, right.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:57.140
So all three of
those are compromised

01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:00.100
when stimuli are
presented at isoluminance.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.980
The most significant aspect
of luminance adaptation

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.210
occurs in the photoreceptors.

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:11.110
And it's explainable by the
relative number at any given

01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:16.930
level of adaptation of bleached
and unbleached photoreceptor

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:20.570
molecules, as in the
case of rhodopsin.

01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:24.920
Lastly, after images are
a product of photoreceptor

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:30.360
adaptation and their subsequent
response to the incoming light.

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:36.190
So that then is the essence of
what you wanted to cover today.

01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:39.740
And I hope you did
find this interesting,

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.240
because certainly
our ability to see

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.140
color is quite a
remarkable thing.

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:47.930
It's amazing to get a sense
of how the nervous system does

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:50.260
that, even though
at this stage, we

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.210
are still at a fairly
early level of having

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:54.710
gained full understanding of it.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:02.450
Now the next time,
we are going to move

01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:05.860
on to another fascinating topic,
at least for me fascinating,

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:09.180
which is depth perception,
which I had mentioned

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:15.190
before is a remarkable
achievement because images fall

01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:17.400
on a two-dimensional
retinal surface.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.140
And from that, the
third dimension

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.840
has to be reconstructed.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.410
And how that is done, we are
going to discuss the next time.

01:12:25.465 --> 01:12:29.235
Now let's make sure that all
of you had signed attendance.

01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:37.910
And the next thing is if any
of you have any questions,

01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:39.515
I will be happy to
try to answer them.

01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:46.308
So once again, I'm
crystal clear, huh?

01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:51.790
Well, thank you very
much for attending.

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:54.570
And I do hope that
your knowledge

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:58.900
has increased a bit about how
we process color information.

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.090
We now continue our discussion
of the model in which we obtain

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.170
several measurements of an
unknown random variable Theta

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.450
in the presence
of additive noise,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.500
under the same
assumptions as before.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.670
Theta and Wi are all
independent random variables.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.670
And they're also normal.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.320
We have seen that in this case,
the posterior distribution

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.430
of Theta is a
normal distribution,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.180
and it takes this
particular form.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.990
We found the mean of the
posterior distribution, which

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.450
is also the maximum posterior
probability estimate.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.050
And it is given by
this expression.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.020
Now that we have an estimate
in our hands, we can ask,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.860
how good is this estimate?

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.270
And for this, we need an
appropriate performance

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.060
measure.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.490
For estimation problems, a
reasonable performance measure

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.960
is to look at the mean
value of the squared error.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.330
But given that we have
already obtained observations,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.860
what we're interested in is the
conditional mean squared error.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.630
This is the error
that's remaining

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.910
after we have seen
the observations.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.620
Now, let us notice
something here.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.900
If I tell you the value
of the observations,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.720
then my estimator is
completely determined.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.940
The estimator is
a random variable

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.530
that processes the data and
comes up with an estimate.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830
So although it is
a random variable,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.990
once I tell you the value
of the observations,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.660
the value of this
random variable

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.590
has been completely determined.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.470
And so we can replace it with
its actual numerical value,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.930
which is theta hat.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.520
And it is given by
this expression.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.190
Now remember also that theta
hat, the estimate that we're

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.479
using, is the mean of the
posterior distribution.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.300
In this conditional
universe where

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.000
we have conditioned
on this information,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.710
theta hat is the mean
of this random variable.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.030
So we're dealing with the
square distance from the mean.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.100
And then we take
the expected value.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.670
But that's nothing
but the variance

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.920
of Theta in this
conditional universe.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.070
So what we're looking for is
the variance of the posterior

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.000
distribution of Theta,
given the observations

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.820
that we have obtained.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.040
Can we eyeball the
variance by just

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.090
looking at this formula for
the posterior distribution?

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.730
More or less, we can.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.380
Recall this earlier
fact that if I give you

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.640
a density of this form, you
recognize that it is normal.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.390
And you also recognize
that the variance

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.850
is determined by
the coefficient that

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.690
comes next to a term
of the form x squared.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.329
Now, this is a PDF
involving a variable x.

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.920
Here, we are talking
about a PDF of Theta.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.070
So what we're looking
for is the constant

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.820
that sits next to the
theta squared term.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.370
There's going to be multiple
theta squared terms.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.650
So we need to
collect all of them.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.340
And so we find that the overall
coefficient sitting next

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.430
to theta squared
terms is as follows.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.790
From this, we obtain
a contribution

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.800
of 1 over 2 sigma 0 squared.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600
And similarly from
here, we're going

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.490
to obtain a coefficient
next to theta

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.980
squared of 1 over
2 sigma 1 squared.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.350
We continue the same way.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.030
And finally from
the last term, we

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.070
obtain a contribution
of this kind.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.210
Now, we take this factor of
2, move it to the other side.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.520
So we know what
2 times alpha is.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.900
And then we need to take
the inverse of that,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.680
so as to obtain 1 over 2 alpha.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.190
And what we obtain is
that 1 over 2 alpha, when

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.340
alpha is given by
this expression,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.160
is equal to this
expression here.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.870
And so we have found the
conditional variance,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.860
the variance of the posterior
distribution of Theta given

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.940
the data that we have
available in our hands.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.990
Now, this is the
mean squared error

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.970
given that you have seen
some particular piece

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.610
of information.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.780
What about the overall
mean squared error?

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.830
This is the quantity
that you care about

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.120
before you go and make
the actual measurements.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.790
This tells you how
well you expect

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.000
to estimate your
random variable Theta.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.090
Well, we can use here the
total expectation theorem,

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.140
and write the expected
value as a weighted average

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:44.710
of the conditional expectations
under different scenarios,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.130
namely under different
measurements of X,

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.659
and average those
conditional expectations

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:56.650
over the possible values of X.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.140
Now, this quantity here
is actually a constant.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.330
It is this constant here.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.650
So we can pull it
outside the expectation.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.120
What we're left is
the integral of a PDF

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.460
over all possible values,
which has to be equal to 1.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.210
So what we're left
with is just the value

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.270
of this constant, which
is this particular number.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.440
And so we concluded that the
overall unconditional mean

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.750
squared error is also the same.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.530
This makes perfect
intuitive sense.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.180
Our mean squared error is going
to take this value no matter

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.409
what I observe.

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.860
So on the average, it will also
take that particular value.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.540
Now, this expression
that we have derived

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.800
is also quite intuitive
in its content.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.640
Let us try to understand
some special cases.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.270
Suppose that some of the
variances of the noise terms

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.490
is very small.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.220
If one term is small, this means
that the corresponding term

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.170
here is going to be big.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.170
So the sum of those
terms is going to be big.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.550
As long as one term is big,
than the sum is also big.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.620
And then 1 over that
is going to be small.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.640
So in that case, the mean
squared error is small.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.050
What this is saying is that if
just one of the measurements

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.500
has low noise, then
the uncertainty that

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.650
remains for my random variable
that I'm trying to estimate,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.370
that uncertainty will be small.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.450
I'm going to have a small error.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:48.130
On the other hand, if all of
the noise variances are large,

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.740
then this means that
all of these terms

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.290
here are going to be small.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.280
I'm adding small terms.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.159
1 over something small
is something big.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:02.860
And so the mean squared
error is going to be large.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.810
That is, if all my
measurements are very noisy,

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.440
then I do not expect to estimate
my random variable particularly

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.940
well.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.590
Let us now look at
one more special case.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.610
Suppose that all
of the variances

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.830
are the same, the noise
variances as well as

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.490
the variance of the
prior distribution.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.650
In that case, this expression
here is going to become 1 over,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.030
we have the sum
of n plus 1 terms.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.340
And each one of those terms
is 1 over sigma squared, which

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.960
is the same as sigma
squared over n plus 1.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.870
This expression makes
quite a lot of sense.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.110
It tells us that if we obtain
more and more observations,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:53.280
that is, as n increases,
we improve our performance.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.880
The variance of the
posterior distribution,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:02.350
or the mean squared error, goes
down in this particular way.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.660
Now, perhaps the most
interesting aspect

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.190
of the facts that
we have established

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.190
is this equation
here that tells us

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.460
that not matter what
this value of little x

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.660
is, the conditional variance,
the variance of the posterior

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.840
distribution of Theta,
is going to be the same.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.990
In some sense, it tells us
that no particular value of X

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:33.860
is more informative or more
desirable than any other value.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.049
In order to really appreciate
what that statement is really

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.190
saying, it's better to look
at a very concrete example.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.929
So let us revisit the
very first example

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:47.950
that we studied, in which case,
we only have one observation

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.380
and where Theta and W are
standard normal random

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.590
variables.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.350
We did go through that example.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.970
And we found that the
estimator, the maximum posterior

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:04.300
probability estimator, was
1/2 of the observation.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.400
And now we are in a
position to also calculate

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.130
the conditional mean
squared error given

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.260
any particular observation.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.950
We apply this formula.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.620
In fact, we are dealing
with this special case

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.250
with sigma equal to 1.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.890
So we use this expression here.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.640
And we see that it is 1/2.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.240
So we started with
a prior variance

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.730
for Theta, which was 1.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.640
And after we obtained
the observation,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.950
our uncertainty gets reduced and
the variance goes down to 1/2.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.980
And this is true no
matter what little x is.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.220
Pictorially, here
is what's happening.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.260
We start with Theta
being a standard normal.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.390
So it has a distribution of
this form, centered at 0.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.770
This is a plot of the density
of Theta, the prior density.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.130
Suppose that we
obtain a measurement.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:05.840
And that measurement
happens to be equal to 0.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.220
If the measurement
is equal to 0,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.850
then our estimate will
also be equal to 0.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.690
The posterior
distribution of theta

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.320
is going to be a normal
distribution whose mean is

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.900
the estimate and whose variance
is this quantity that we

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.080
have calculated, which is 1/2.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.060
And therefore, it is narrower
than the original PDF

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.650
that we started from.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.410
So initially, we had a
fair amount of uncertainty

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.610
about Theta.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.270
After we obtained
a measurement of 0,

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.420
this kind of
reinforces our belief

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.130
that Theta is somewhere near 0.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.200
And so we obtain a
narrower distribution.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.650
This is our updated
belief about Theta.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.100
But what if I happen to
obtain a measurement that's

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.000
somewhere out here?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.140
In this case, my
estimate is going

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:08.052
to be 1/2 of what I observed.

00:11:08.052 --> 00:11:09.330
It's here.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.960
And the posterior
PDF of Theta is

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.310
going to be a normal PDF that's
centered around this point

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.050
and has the same variance, 1/2.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.500
So in some sense, this
particular measurement

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.830
would be thought of as
a quite abnormal one.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.520
We're really surprised to
obtain an observation which

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.760
is so far away from 0.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.970
Because our prior
distribution told us

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.070
that Theta is somewhere here.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.970
So we have been surprised.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:49.450
But after the surprise and after
we form our estimate of Theta,

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.260
our state of
knowledge about Theta

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.960
is that Theta is
a random variable

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.730
and it has a distribution
that's normal,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.220
centered around this
point, and whose width

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.720
is the same no matter what
particular observation I happen

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.660
to get.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.840
So even though this particular
observation value is unusual,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.990
after it is obtained,
the remaining uncertainty

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.120
about Theta is the same
as if we had obtained

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.570
any other particular
value of X. So this

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.650
is a very remarkable
property that's

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.190
special to this type of
estimation problems involving

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.340
normal random variables
and linear relations.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.740
It has a very nice side effect.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.260
It means that we
can report, we can

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.780
say anything there is to be
said about the performance

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.600
of this maximum a posteriori
probability estimator.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.240
By just giving a
single number, we

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.170
can characterize
performance only

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.470
in terms of this
number, as opposed

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.980
to having to tell what this
conditional mean squared

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.850
error is for the
different values of X.

[CLICKING]

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.940
JONATHAN GRUBER: All
right, let's get started.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.370
Today, we are going to complete
our discussion of consumer

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.760
choice by actually coming
back and deriving the demand

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.890
curve that we started
the semester with,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.970
actually showing you how
from the limited set of tools

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.470
we've given you we can actually
derive the underlying demand

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.245
curves that we
see in this class.

00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:34.370
I'm going to spend the rest
of lecture then talking

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.600
about the elasticity of demand--

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.380
what determines the shape
of that demand curve.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.260
I'll talk about how changes
in income affect demand.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.200
And then, we'll
come back and talk

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.700
about the effects
of a price change,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.250
and we'll talk about
the theoretical concepts

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.010
underneath how you
analyze a change in price

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.820
in economics model.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.230
So let's start with
deriving demand curves.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.670
So we started in this class
with the demand supply curve,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.200
and I said we'd tell you
where they came from.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.960
So, basically, we're
now going to talk

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.050
about how do you derive,
from the tools we've

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.250
learned so far, the
relationship between price

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.290
and quantity demanded--

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.760
the downward-sloping
relationship

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.010
between price and quantity
demanded that we showed you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.300
in the very first lecture.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.710
So to do so, let's return to
our example from last time.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.210
Remember, our example
from last time

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.600
is utility function was of
the form u equals P times c.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.150
Your parents had
given you an income

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.520
of $72 with which you could
buy pizza and cookies, pizza

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.620
at a price of $12 and
cookies at a price of $6.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.890
That was the parameters in
are example from last time.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.310
And once again, remember, all
I've done is giving you stuff

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.330
here.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.167
Obviously, this part
is non-controversial

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:03.500
as a price for pizza in the
market, the price of cookies

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.400
in the market.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.510
There's an income that's
the amount of money

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.770
your parents give you.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.150
That's all non-controversial.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.740
And this is just a
sensible assumption

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.170
of what someone's
preferences might look like.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.290
All I'm saying is with these
four things, we are done.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.230
With these four things, we
can now derive a demand curve.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.890
And how's that?

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.200
Well, let's start by looking at
it graphically in figure 4-1.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.040
Figure 4-1, on
the left-hand side

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.490
is exactly the kind of a
difference curve analysis

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.810
that we did last time.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.010
So we start with
budget constraint bc1.

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:40.710
That is something
where you can either

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.140
get up to 12
cookies and no pizza

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.680
or up to 6 pizzas
and no cookies.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.320
And we know, from our
analysis last time,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.290
given this we showed
you last time,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.880
and you went home and practiced
and were so excited you told

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.340
your mom and
everything, we told you

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.680
how you could show
that you'd want

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.990
6 cookies and 3 slices of
pizza at a point like point a.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.712
We showed that last time.

00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:06.920
Now, we also talked about
how when the price changes.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.460
So, for example, imagine
that the price of cookies

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.330
rises to $9.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.750
Well, we know if the price
of cookies rise to $9

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.870
is that you could still, on
your budget, afford 6 pizzas.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.710
So the y-intercept
does not change,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.080
but the x-intercept changes.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.120
Now, you can only afford 8
cookies, so you move to bc2 sub

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.890
2.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.340
You used to be able
to afford 12 cookies,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.020
now you can only
afford 8 cookies.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.840
And most importantly, the
slope of the budget constraint

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.130
has steepened.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.520
Remember, what is the slope
of the budget constraint?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.710
The slope of the
budget constraint--

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.380
the slope is minus P c over Pp.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.640
That's the slope.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.490
And that steepened, because
the price of cookies has risen.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.335
So you have a steeper
budget constraint.

00:03:56.335 --> 00:04:00.590
The slope used to be minus
1/2, now it's minus 3/4.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.940
So now, that's gone from
minus 1/2 to minus 3/4

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.970
with this new higher
price for pizza--

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.970
higher price of cookies.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.470
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.350
The price cookies rose to $9.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.150
That budget constraint
has steepened.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.280
What does this do to
demand for cookies?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.720
Well, we find the highest
tangency of your indifference

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.089
curves with this new
budget constraint,

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.070
and you could solve
mathematically

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.750
to show that that will occur at
point b, where you will choose

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.250
to continue to have
3 slices of pizza

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.260
but to only have 4 cookies.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.880
That is what happens
if you take this,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.560
you do constrained
optimization--

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.070
if you change this price to 9,
re-optimize the way we showed

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.170
you last time,
you'd end up finding

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:52.790
that you would want 3 slices of
pizza and 4 cookies at point b.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.640
Now, what if instead the
price of cookies fell to $4?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.840
So cookies got cheaper.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.670
Well, in that case,
now, you could still

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.470
only afford 6 slices of pizza.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.540
So the y-intercept once
again doesn't change.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.230
But the x-intercept
now moves out to 18,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.550
because now you can
afford 18 cookies.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.860
So your new budget goes
straight is flatter.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.153
It's bc sub 3.

00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:19.070
It's the flatter, outermost
budget constraint.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.320
Your opportunity
set is much larger

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.487
because cookies are cheaper.

00:05:22.487 --> 00:05:24.653
You have the same amount
of money from your parents,

00:05:24.653 --> 00:05:27.190
but it can buy more stuff,
and you can buy more cookies.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.540
so your opportunity
set is larger.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.560
So you now can re-optimize
with a now flatter budget

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.190
constraint.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.970
The slope, instead of being
1/2, has now fallen to 1/3.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.365
When the price of
cookies is $4, the price

00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:45.110
of cookies over the price
of pizza is now 1/3.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.030
So an absolute value,
the slope is lower.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.300
So you can now-- and we say that
if you take the same utility

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.040
function and optimize
at the new price,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.950
at a price of cookies
of $4, you will find

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.150
that you will choose point c.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.590
Still 3 slices of pizza,
but now 9 cookies.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.500
So all three of those
points we simply

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.300
did by redoing optimization
I did last time--

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.690
by taking this utility
function, maximizing

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.310
it subject to a
budget constraint

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.760
dictated by these parameters.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.270
And all I did was change
this parameter twice.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.200
Once I changed it up.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.250
Once I changed it down.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.690
Questions about that?

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.557
Well, you've now
derived a demand curve.

00:06:27.557 --> 00:06:28.390
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.740
Question.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.015
AUDIENCE: Will this also
change the indifference curve?

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:34.890
JONATHAN GRUBER: No,
your indifference curves

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.070
are determined by
utility function.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.390
Your difference
curves do not change.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.848
It changes which
indifference curve

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:41.258
you end up choosing, because
the tangency point changes.

00:06:41.258 --> 00:06:43.300
But the only way to change
the indifference curve

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.850
would be to change
utility function.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.058
Indifference curves purely
come from this part of it.

00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:49.392
So indifference curves come
from here, budget constraint

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:50.830
comes from these three pieces.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.125
Yeah?

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:55.625
AUDIENCE: Is it
possible [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:58.330
logical for different
indifference curves

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.660
in a quite long-range
component, is that possible?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.800
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, no.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.950
But it is possible to take
a bunch of demand curves

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.400
and conglomerate them
to get one demand curve.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.122
And I'm going to talk
about that later.

00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:10.330
But, no, indifference curves
you can't really add up.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.290
Because, remember,
utils are not a thing.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.990
So you can't add up
indifference curves.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.657
But if we want to add up people,
you would add up demand curves.

00:07:16.657 --> 00:07:18.510
And we've now derived
the demand curve.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.427
How have we done that?

00:07:19.427 --> 00:07:20.830
Well, what's a demand curve?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.872
It's the relationship
between price and quantity.

00:07:22.872 --> 00:07:24.288
Well, I just showed
a relationship

00:07:24.288 --> 00:07:25.540
between price and quantity.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.890
When the price goes down,
quantity of cookies goes up.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.140
When the price goes up,
quantity of cookies goes down.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.180
Well, you just shift over to the
right-hand side a figure 4-1.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.880
there's a demand curve.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.682
I just graphed
these three points,

00:07:37.682 --> 00:07:39.640
I just graphed, for each
of the different price

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.390
of cookies I gave you, how
many cookies are demanded.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.170
Well, at a price of cookies
of 6, our initial price--

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.300
geez, this is really small--

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.390
6 cookies were demanded.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.360
When the price of
cookies goes up to 8--

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.580
I'm sorry, when
it goes up to 9--

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.440
only 4 cookies are demanded.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.560
When the price of cookies
falls to 4 at point c,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.720
then 9 cookies are demanded.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.690
So literally, we've just
derived the demand curve.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.585
Starting with these primitives--
your tastes, your preferences--

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:14.960
and your budget constraint,
we've derived a demand curve.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.710
And That's it.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.990
That's where demand
curves come from.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.863
And that's essentially what is
underneath the demand curve.

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:26.280
What's underneath
the demand curve

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.260
is the fact that the reason
to demand curves slope down

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.298
is that as the price goes up,
you want less of the good.

00:08:35.298 --> 00:08:37.840
Because with the given utility
functions, that price goes up,

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.923
you want less of the good.

00:08:38.923 --> 00:08:41.010
And that's why demand
curve slopes down.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.440
So we've just derived that.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.060
Questions about that?

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.760
Yeah?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.680
AUDIENCE: Is it always true
that regardless of your utility

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.837
function, you will always
want three [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:51.837 --> 00:08:53.170
JONATHAN GRUBER: Great question.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.730
Did you peek at my notes?

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:55.230
No.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.647
Because if you
had, you would have

00:08:56.647 --> 00:08:59.030
seen that's exactly the
question I would have asked you.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.613
So since you asked
me, I'll answer it.

00:09:00.613 --> 00:09:02.260
No, it is not always true.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.880
In fact, that is a feature
of this particular utility

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.440
function I've chosen.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.660
This particular utility
function I've chosen

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.500
gives the feature that
the demand for a good

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.890
is a function only of your
income and that good's price,

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.750
not of the other good's price.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.840
That's a feature of this.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.980
That's why we like
this utility function.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.490
It has that nice feature.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.760
In general, that's not true.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.220
In general, when the
price of one good changes,

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.310
it will affect the demand for
all goods, not just that good

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.013
itself.

00:09:32.013 --> 00:09:33.680
So with a more general
utility function,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.700
that would not be true.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.560
With this utility
function, it gives

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.030
what's called the flat
price consumption curve--

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.580
not a term you need
to know, but just

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.832
if you want be more technical.

00:09:41.832 --> 00:09:43.790
Which is basically, with
this utility function,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.310
demand for any good is a
function only of its own price

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.180
and your income.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.680
Therefore, when
other prices change,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.150
it doesn't affect the
demand for that good.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.710
But that is not generally true.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.140
In general, when you change
the price of one good,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.550
demand for all goods changes.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.135
Questions about that?

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:02.635
Yeah?

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.473
AUDIENCE: Is this why it shows
3 as a constant, and just--

00:10:05.473 --> 00:10:07.390
JONATHAN GRUBER: Oh, it
wouldn't have mattered

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.830
what number I'd chosen.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.363
But the bottom line
is as the price

00:10:10.363 --> 00:10:12.280
of cookies changes, the
number of pizza slices

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.540
would never change.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.800
Demand would never change.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.050
That's a feature of this
particular utility function.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.850
It's a nice feature of it.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.480
Once again, that comes to
this trade with modeling.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.470
I've chosen a simplified utility
function with this nice feature

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.910
that's almost
certainly not true.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.910
But once again it allowed us to
derive a very sensible demand

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:35.310
curve without introducing
other complications.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:41.010
Now, this demand curve's
particular shape,

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.510
what determines the shape
of this demand curve?

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.540
And that leads us to the second
topic I want to cover today,

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.690
which is the
elasticity of demand.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.110
What determines the
shape of a demand curve

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:09.390
is what we call the elasticity
of demand, which we define

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.390
the elasticity of
demand, epsilon,

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:19.430
as delta Q over Q
over delta P over P.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.990
It's the percentage change
in quantity for a percentage

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.170
change in price.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.810
So, for example,
if quantity falls

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.010
by 2% for every 1%
increase in price,

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.510
that's an elasticity
demand of negative 2.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.640
So elasticity of demand,
as long as demand curves

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.210
are downward-sloping,
is less than 0.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.960
Because the price goes
up, quantity falls.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.720
So elasticity of
demand is less than 0--

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.020
I'm sorry, less
than or equal to 0.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.520
Yeah?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.790
AUDIENCE: Is this the
change in quantity

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.817
over the new quantity
or the the old quantity?

00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:54.150
JONATHAN GRUBER: Great question.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.700
When we're doing this,
if we did it in calculus,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.645
it would be infinitesimal
epsilon change.

00:11:59.645 --> 00:12:01.770
So it wouldn't matter if
it was new or old quality.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:05.310
When you do it discreetly,
use the old quantity.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.013
So I should say, Q0 and P0.

00:12:08.013 --> 00:12:09.680
Once again, if you
did this in calculus,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.630
which is the way
we're sort of thinking

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.040
about in our
underlying intuition,

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.998
it's an epsilon change.

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.620
So Q0 and P0 are epsilon.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.890
It doesn't really matter.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.367
But if you do it discretely,
you'd want to use Q0 and P0.

00:12:19.367 --> 00:12:20.450
These are great questions.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.280
Keep them coming.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.820
Now, whenever we think
of constant elasticity,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.290
it's always useful to
think about the extremes.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.998
So what are the extremes
of this measure?

00:12:29.998 --> 00:12:34.380
One extreme would be if the
elasticity demand was 0.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:40.830
We would call that
perfectly inelastic demand.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.410
It would be epsilon equals 0.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.950
Now, extremes never
exist in the real world.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.950
But there are cases
that come very close.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.407
So can someone, without flipping
the page of the handout--

00:12:52.407 --> 00:12:54.990
don't do it, because before you
flip the page of the handout--

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.365
give me an example
of a good that

00:12:56.365 --> 00:13:00.150
might have perfectly, in a very,
very, very inelastic demand,

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.730
where no matter the price, you'd
still want the same quantity.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:04.370
Yeah.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.270
AUDIENCE: Water.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.823
You have to consume it to live.

00:13:07.823 --> 00:13:09.240
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Water-- something

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.740
that's essential
to life like water.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.280
What else?

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.210
Yeah, in the way back.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.290
AUDIENCE: Insulin.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.720
JONATHAN GRUBER: Insulin is
the classic example we use.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.220
Yeah?

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.422
AUDIENCE: Sewage removal.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.380
JONATHAN GRUBER: Sewage
removal is interesting.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.560
Although, not quite, because
we see a lot of variation

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.210
around the world
in sewage removal.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.430
But something like that--
basic essentials of life.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.200
Insulin's a class
example we use.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.653
Indeed, that's the example I
do you use in the next-- oh,

00:13:30.653 --> 00:13:32.070
I guess I didn't
list it ion here.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.503
So you could have
turned the page.

00:13:33.503 --> 00:13:35.670
We think about perfectly
inelastic demand-- someone,

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.320
once again for those
of you who don't

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.910
know about the medical
science here, basically,

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.650
if you're diabetic, you have
trouble controlling your blood

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.340
sugar.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.020
Insulin is a medicine
you need to take to help

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.228
you control your blood sugar.

00:13:44.228 --> 00:13:46.060
Without it, you die.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.100
So you'd think that's
pretty inelastic demand.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.720
Like, I want to
live, so I'm going

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.100
to want to have my insulin.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.475
And if the price
goes up, I'm not

00:13:52.475 --> 00:13:54.430
going to say, nah,
I'll just die.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.410
You're going to want to
still have the insulin.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.070
So we think in
that case, quantum

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.870
would be fixed at some Q, which
is insulin you need to live,

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.280
and it wouldn't really
matter what the price is.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.830
So your elasticity would be 0.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.840
You have a perfectly
inelastic curve.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.720
Quantity would not
change with price.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.470
Basically, that would
happen when there

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.928
is no plausible substitute.

00:14:19.928 --> 00:14:22.220
The reason water is not as
good as insulin is because I

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.230
can drink something else.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.810
And sewage removal,
I can do other things

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.460
to deal with the
sewage in my house.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.990
But insulin, there
is no substitute.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.700
I die.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.720
So basically, the
bottom line is,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.890
when there's no
plausible substitute,

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.710
demand will be
perfectly inelastic.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.690
Likewise, we consider-- yeah?

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.320
AUDIENCE: Can there be multiple
companies that sell insulin?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.103
So if one, say,
increased the price,

00:14:48.103 --> 00:14:49.270
they would shift to another.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.000
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK,
but this is a market--

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.875
that's a great point.

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:54.180
I'm just doing this as--

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.190
let's actually image
just one company for now.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.390
You're right, I'm not doing
choice across companies.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.580
So that would be inelastic.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.920
We could also do the other
extreme, perfectly elastic.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.820
So what's an example?

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:14.340
Perfectly elastic
demand is that epsilon

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.330
equals negative infinity.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.840
So what would cause
perfectly inelastic demand?

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.690
So people raise their
hand and tell me.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.810
Perfectly elastic
demand-- I'm sorry.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.771
What would cause
perfectly elastic demand?

00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:33.208
What would cause it?

00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:35.500
I'm just going to try to
spread it around a little bit.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.120
You two have been--

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.200
Yeah

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.820
AUDIENCE: Would it be something
that's very unnecessary,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.760
like diamonds?

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.250
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's interesting.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.167
I mean, that's not--

00:15:46.167 --> 00:15:47.250
I'm going to come to that.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.667
But that wouldn't-- that's
something where demand would be

00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:51.990
less elastic, but not
close to perfectly elastic.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.900
Because, basically-- well, let
me ask the question this way--

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.840
what would drive a good to very,
very elastic demand in general?

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.340
Yeah?

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.510
AUDIENCE: When it has
perfect substitution--

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:00.870
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.912
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:16:01.912 --> 00:16:02.820
Perfect substitutes.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.913
Diamonds don't have
perfect substitutes.

00:16:04.913 --> 00:16:07.080
I mean, we're increasingly
making fake diamonds that

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.550
are better and
better substitutes,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.440
but a real diamond still doesn't
have a perfect substitute.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.010
So what does?

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.200
What's an example of
something with a good--

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.148
with a very good substitute?

00:16:15.148 --> 00:16:16.159
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:17.076
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah?

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:18.808
AUDIENCE: A spork.

00:16:18.808 --> 00:16:19.850
JONATHAN GRUBER: A spork.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.060
There is no sub--

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.130
I am insulted that you would
suggest that the great spork!

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.775
You need two different
things to replace a spork!

00:16:30.775 --> 00:16:32.900
AUDIENCE: You're never
using both at the same time.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.493
So if the price
increases-- you never--

00:16:35.493 --> 00:16:36.410
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.820
But then you have to
buy a spoon and a fork.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.380
No, I reject your
spork suggestion.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.423
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:42.423 --> 00:16:43.090
I'm just joking.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:43.890
No, but what else?

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:44.910
What else?

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.350
What is something that has
really good substitutes?

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:46.510
Yeah?

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.100
AUDIENCE: Off-brand medication.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.710
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.502
Something which is an
off-brand medication,

00:16:50.502 --> 00:16:53.210
or I like to think
of a fast food,

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.270
like fast food burgers have
pretty good substitutes

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.710
with fast food pizza.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.360
Basically, once again, it's hard
to think an extreme example.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.050
Nothing's ever
perfectly elastic.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.579
But things which have
very good substitutes--

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.020
typically this works well
when we think across brands.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.250
If you think about
different brands of gum.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:11.750
Jeez.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.310
I mean, who the hell cares?

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.109
Or different brands
of fast food.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:15.626
Yeah?

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:17.501
AUDIENCE: What about
something like a $5 gift

00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:21.432
card, where after $5
nobody's going to buy it.

00:17:21.432 --> 00:17:23.140
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a separate issue.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:23.569
Let's come back.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:24.986
That's sort of a
separate-- that's

00:17:24.986 --> 00:17:27.069
like a weird, kinked
budget constraint.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.760
That's not really
about substitution.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.120
But the bottom line is-- we
don't need any more examples--

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.060
the key element-- and we
show that in figure 4-3.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.820
That's going to be a
horizontal demand curve.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.320
With a perfectly
elastic demand, you

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.612
have a horizontal demand curve.

00:17:40.612 --> 00:17:43.825
And therefore,
price never changes.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.750
It's sort of a
weird way to think

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.917
of perfectly elastic demand.

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:54.340
The way it works
is if I ever charge

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:59.140
a price 1 epsilon above someone
else, I'd lose all my business.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.970
And if I charge a price 1
epsilon below everyone else,

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.250
I would have the entire market.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.780
Because if it's
perfectly elastic,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.083
like if one pack of gum--

00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:08.750
I don't what-- these
stupid gum things--

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.640
Orbits and Ellipse
or whatever, if they

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.400
charge a penny more than
someone else, no would buy them.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.900
They'd go out of business.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.950
That's the idea here.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.798
And that's why the
price can't change.

00:18:17.798 --> 00:18:18.590
The price is fixed.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.110
So if anyone deviates
from that price, boom,

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.460
they lose the whole market.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:22.960
Yeah?

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.430
AUDIENCE: So wouldn't the
market for dollar bills

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.160
be perfectly elastic?

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.110
Like--

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.540
JONATHAN GRUBER:
There's not really

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.623
a market for dollar bills.

00:18:30.623 --> 00:18:31.457
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:31.457 --> 00:18:32.530
AUDIENCE: --dollar bills.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.260
JONATHAN GRUBER:
There's not really--

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.930
I mean, you could say the
demand for cash in general

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.180
might be fairly elastic,
because you have credit cards

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:38.810
and things like that.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:39.980
That's an interesting idea.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.880
Yeah.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.910
So, basically, when you have
perfectly elastic demand,

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.860
you end up with sort
of this constant price,

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.270
and quantity changes but
price doesn't change.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.760
So that's kind of the extremes.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:59.060
Now, in general, we have goods
that are more and less elastic.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.900
In general, we end up with this
range between perfectly elastic

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.960
and perfectly inelastic.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.600
The bottom line is-- here's the
intuition I want you to have--

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.870
what determines elasticity
is substitutability.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.640
The more substitutable
goods are,

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.260
the more elastically
demanded they are.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:21.310
So now, I want to go on to
another topic which is related.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.300
Which is, we talked
in our example

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.890
about what happened
when I change prices.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.100
What about when I change income?

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.050
So the third topic
I want to talk about

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.680
is what happens
when income shifts,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.230
and how does that
affect demand curves?

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.400
When income shifts, how does
that affect demand curves?

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.947
Well, we could do the same
exercise we did before.

00:19:43.947 --> 00:19:45.030
We did an exercise before.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.680
We said, well, let's
just use the tools

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.040
we used before to solve
for you new choices

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.170
at different prices.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.880
Let's just solve for you new
choice at a different income.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.963
So let's go to figure 4-4.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.280
Figure 4-4, once again
we start with bc1.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.670
Same parameters as before--
same setup as before.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.770
We choose point a.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:14.100
Now, let's say I raise your
income from $72 to $96.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.880
You've done well.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.547
Your parents are
giving you more money--

00:20:16.547 --> 00:20:17.610
$96.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.230
Well, in that case
you will choose

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.800
to have both more
pizza and more cookies.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.475
Given this utility function,
you will choose the point b.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.180
You will choose point b.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:40.190
Likewise, if I lower your
income from $70 to $48,

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.330
then you will choose point c.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.580
So as your income goes up,
you'll choose more of both.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.270
As your income goes down,
you choose less of both.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.237
Now, once again,
you'll notice this--

00:20:53.237 --> 00:20:54.320
well, let me come to that.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.380
So basically, what that
says is I can trace out

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.130
the relationship between
how your income changes,

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.690
how you demand for
cookies change.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.450
I can then graph that
on the next graph

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.030
and generate what's
called the Engel curve.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.520
The Engel curve is
the relationship

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.700
between income and
quantity demanded.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.112
And we'll come back
to why this matters.

00:21:15.112 --> 00:21:16.570
The Engel curve is
the relationship

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.420
between income and
quantity demanded.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.015
Now, here the Engel
curve is linear.

00:21:19.015 --> 00:21:20.390
Once again, that's
just a feature

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.140
of this utility function.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.002
In general, it doesn't
have to be linear.

00:21:24.002 --> 00:21:25.460
But here the Engel
curve is linear.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.835
That's just because of the
way we structured this utility

00:21:27.835 --> 00:21:30.030
function.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.650
And the slope of
the Engel curve is

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:40.060
what we call the income
elasticity of demand, gamma,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.915
which is delta Q over Q--

00:21:42.915 --> 00:21:46.080
Q0 once again, if we're
doing it discreetly--

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.210
over delta y over y0.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.610
That's the income
elasticity of demand.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:01.380
Now, let me just say one
comment here about this.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.720
Because there's
sort of a big cheat

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.850
that I'm doing
here with all this

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.550
that I need you
guys to be aware of,

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:12.970
which is constant elasticity
versus linear curves.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.785
We know a constant elasticity
curve will not be linear.

00:22:16.785 --> 00:22:18.660
If it's linear, it's
not constant elasticity,

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.940
because if it's
linear, the elasticity

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.400
will change along the curve.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.940
So the demand curve.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.020
I just drew in
figure 4-1, that was

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.910
a constant elasticity
demand curve.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.790
That's why it was curved.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.070
This Engel curve I
drew here would not

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.070
be constant elasticity,
because it's linear.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.100
You can calculate for yourself
that the percentage change,

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.350
the income elasticity will shift
as you go along this curve.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.910
And you can show yourself that.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.930
What we're going
to do in this class

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.630
is we're going to draw linear
constant elasticity curves,

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.810
which is, of course,
technically wrong.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.450
Just think of them as blown
up versions of a large demand

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.950
curve.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.370
Everything is locally linear.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.440
Once again, for an epsilon
change, everything is linear.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.140
So the truth is we'll
cheat a little bit

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.540
and often draw a linear
constant elasticity curves.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.550
And I want to own
that that's a cheat.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.310
But if everything
is really local,

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.660
it's not that bad a cheat.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.035
So that's kind of
how we're going

00:23:17.035 --> 00:23:19.035
to-- that's a cheat we're
going to do constantly

00:23:19.035 --> 00:23:19.980
through this course.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.697
And we'll be very clear--

00:23:21.697 --> 00:23:23.280
we make clear any
problems or anything

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.390
if we need you to
deviate from that.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.530
Now, what we have here, in
addition to a linear Engel

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.800
curve, is we have an
upward-sloping Engel curve

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.840
or positive income elasticity.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:45.150
We call goods with a positive
income elasticity normal goods.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.790
Goods where the more money
you have, the more of them

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.120
you want, we call normal goods.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.130
Because that's sort of normal.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.480
However, it is also true that
a number of goods in the world

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.850
actually have gamma less than 0.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.730
And we call those
inferior goods.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.350
Why would a good be inferior?

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.437
Why, when your income
goes up-- yeah?

00:24:07.437 --> 00:24:11.138
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:11.138 --> 00:24:12.180
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.800
Any examples anyone
can think of?

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.300
Yeah?

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.130
AUDIENCE: Maybe at a
fast food restaurant.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.120
The minimum amount of
food you have to eat.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.032
And then, like,
[INAUDIBLE] your fast food,

00:24:21.032 --> 00:24:22.490
and then I have to
get more money--

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.930
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:23.590
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:24.173
Great example.

00:24:24.173 --> 00:24:25.000
Yeah, in the back.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.055
AUDIENCE: Omega watches
versus Rolex watches.

00:24:29.055 --> 00:24:31.180
JONATHAN GRUBER: I wouldn't
think of either of them

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:31.800
as inferior.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.502
Relative they may be inferior.

00:24:33.502 --> 00:24:35.210
But, obviously, when
your income goes up,

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.700
you're not going to suddenly--

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.190
you're going to
want more of both.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.500
Whereas fast food you
actually would want less of it

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.550
as your income goes up.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.602
Literally, you will
eat at McDonald's less

00:24:44.602 --> 00:24:45.310
if you're richer.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.890
You're not going to have fewer
watches if you're richer.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.408
So the bottom line is
that inferior goods,

00:24:51.408 --> 00:24:52.450
you're actually getting--

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.400
it's a bit subtle.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.150
You have different
goods of the same kind.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.370
Let's think about classes
of goods rather than brands

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:57.912
of goods.

00:24:57.912 --> 00:24:59.620
Once you get across
brands, you're right.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.078
Let's think about
classes of goods.

00:25:01.078 --> 00:25:03.020
Watches-- luxury
watches, in general--

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.960
are clearly not inferior.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.210
Fast food may be inferior.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.420
Literally richer people may
eat probably less fast food

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.380
than poorer people.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.588
Yeah.

00:25:13.588 --> 00:25:15.880
AUDIENCE: Would something
like your refrigerator count,

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.740
where after you buy one you
don't really need more of them.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.740
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's like a quan-- that

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.690
could be right.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.790
But yeah.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.320
I think not, because
the bottom line

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.090
is rich guys are much
more likely to have

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:29.800
two refrigerators than one.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.360
So it's a discreteness problem.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.352
It's too discrete to
really use as an example.

00:25:33.352 --> 00:25:35.060
But I think fast food
is a great example.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.080
The class example
we use is potatoes.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.540
Where in the old days,
before fast food,

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.500
that was the cheap, filling,
shitty-tasting food stuff

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.960
that guys sort of
ate all the time.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.850
And now, when they
have money, they say,

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:52.390
I'm going to move on to steak,
and they eat less potatoes.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.802
So something where
essentially you'd

00:25:54.802 --> 00:25:57.010
rather shift to something
else if you have more money

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.750
is inferior.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.090
Now, moreover, within
that, within normal, we're

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.010
going to draw a
distinction between what we

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:08.870
call luxuries and necessities.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.310
Luxuries are going to be good
where gamma is greater than 1.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.260
And necessities,
gamma is less than 1.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.370
So we're going to say--

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.800
essentially, the
question is, proportional

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.450
to your budget, what happens
if your income goes up?

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.540
In other words, do you
spend more and more--

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.800
they're both normal goods.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.900
The richer you are,
the more you buy of it.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.960
But a luxury good is you
spend even larger share

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.390
of your budget on that
good as you get richer.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.810
So that would be luxury,
like watches, boats, maybe

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.937
refrigerators, et cetera--

00:26:41.937 --> 00:26:44.270
things where the richer you
get, the more of your budget

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.940
you spend on it.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.480
Necessities are
things like food,

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.470
where clearly rich people spend
more on food than poor people.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.650
But they spend a smaller
share of their budget on food

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.570
than poor people.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.782
So it goes up, but doesn't
go up proportionally

00:27:00.782 --> 00:27:01.490
with your income.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.323
It goes up less in
portion with your income.

00:27:03.323 --> 00:27:04.010
Yeah?

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:09.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] for as
some sort of human necessities,

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.013
in the sense of if
you're more wealthy,

00:27:12.013 --> 00:27:14.430
you might buy more name brand
food or something like that,

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:15.250
instead of more--

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:15.490
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.698
Once we get into brands,
you can absolutely see that.

00:27:17.698 --> 00:27:20.230
You can think of luxury
brands and necessity brands.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.890
Absolutely.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.010
But if we stay with
categories of goods,

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:28.240
then let's think of jewelry as
the [INAUDIBLE] example here

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.280
and food as the
canonical example here.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:32.945
Yeah?

00:27:32.945 --> 00:27:34.820
AUDIENCE: Do you have
an example of something

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.842
that's near the border between
luxuries and necessities.

00:27:37.842 --> 00:27:39.300
JONATHAN GRUBER:
You know, there is

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.247
a huge industry in estimating
these elasticities of demand.

00:27:42.247 --> 00:27:43.830
So I'm sure there's
an answer to that.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.890
I don't have it off of my head.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:46.390
All right.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.690
So now I've given you
the underlying tools

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.370
of consumer demand theory.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.940
I've told you how to decide
what quantity a consumer wants.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.310
I've told you how you can use
that to derive demand curve.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.840
I've explained the shape
of the demand curve.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.890
I then talked about what
happens as your income changes

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.300
and talked about the shape
of the income elasticity.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.800
Now, I'm going to
put this together

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.500
to come back to revisit
something you think you already

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.820
know the answer to.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.490
Which is, what happens
when a price changes--

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.440
the effects of a price change.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.750
Now, you might say, well,
that's sort of silly.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.730
We already did that
once this lecture.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.660
We already did, when we
derived the demand curve--

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.975
the effects of price change--

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:32.350
we did some price
changes, right?

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.767
I showed you what happened as
the price of cookies change.

00:28:34.767 --> 00:28:36.760
But, in fact, we
cheated a little bit.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.030
We didn't cheat-- we gave
you sort of the bottom line

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.820
but didn't get into
the elements of why

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.590
people react the way
they do to price changes.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.733
Now, we're getting in
some sort of deep theory.

00:28:48.733 --> 00:28:50.400
Now, I'm going to
talk about something--

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.900
it's deeply theoretical
in the sense

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.710
that in some sense
if all you care about

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.513
is what happens
in the real world,

00:28:55.513 --> 00:28:57.680
they just care about when
a price change happens how

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.263
does quantity change,
I'm going to use

00:28:59.263 --> 00:29:01.100
some theoretical
concepts, which are going

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.300
to become very powerful
later on in the course, which

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.700
are important understand now.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.060
Which is, how is the
underlying decision calculus

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.470
changed by price--

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.420
changed when the price changes?

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.100
And the way we're
going to do that

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.550
is that we're going to decompose
your response to a price change

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.190
into two effects--

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:25.500
the substitution effect
and the income effect.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.760
We're going to separate your
response into two effects.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.770
So the separation is going to
become very important later on.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.390
The substitution
effect, we're going

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:44.980
to define as the change
in the quantity of a good

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.720
when the price changes
holding utility constant.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.760
So it's delta Q--

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.440
d Q d p for shorthand-- but
holding utility constant

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.280
at some fixed level u bar.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.800
The change in quantities
price changes--

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.270
so it's the
elasticity of demand--

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.860
but at a constant
level of utility.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:15.100
The income effect is the change
in quantity of a good as income

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.240
changes.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.890
Change in quantity, dy.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:21.210
Which is the income
elasticity we talked about--

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:24.330
the change in quantity
as the income changes.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.190
And this is actually multiplied
by the initial level of income.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:32.990
We'll learn about
this in a section.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.170
But that's technically how
the income effect is defined.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.590
And you'll come into a
section about why that is.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.320
But we're going
to decompose this.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.650
So that's sort of confusing.

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:45.440
So let me start with
graphically to understand it.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.140
So let's go to figure 4-5,
one of our more complicated

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.570
figures.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.970
We start at budget
constraint 1--

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.980
same parameters as always.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.240
All the math here--

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.220
all this graphic stuff
follows from the math

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.960
using that utility function
and these price and income--

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.060
same as before.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.020
So we start, as
before, at point a.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.570
Your tangency is the best
package you can have,

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.720
given that utility
function, is 6 cookies

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.200
and 3 slices of pizza.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:20.510
Now, let's imagine the price
of cookies rises to $9.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:26.840
The price of cookies in our
example goes from $6 to $9.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.190
That's the example
we're going to analyze.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.340
Now, we know from before
that will ultimately

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.170
move you from 6
cookies to 4 cookies

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.150
while holding pizzas
constant at 3.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.500
So we know where you'll end up.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.510
You'll end up at point c.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.310
We did that before.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:44.460
But actually two things are
happening to get you there.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.880
The first thing that's happening
is the substitution effect,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.925
which is the change in
prices with utility constant.

00:31:50.925 --> 00:31:52.050
And how do we measure that?

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:55.670
We want to ask, given
that the price changed

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.480
but the utility is
constant, what's

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.650
the new quantity you choose?

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.110
What does utility constant
mean in this graph?

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.940
What does it mean to
hold utility constant?

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.700
Let's get some other
folks involved here.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.060
What is it mean?

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.740
Yeah?

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.620
AUDIENCE: Same
indifference curve.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.328
JONATHAN GRUBER: Same
indifference curve.

00:32:09.328 --> 00:32:12.540
So what we want to do is
ask, given the new prices

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:17.240
but the old indifference curve,
what quantity would you choose?

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.590
Well, the way we do that
is we find the tangency

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:24.580
between the new slope
of the budget constraint

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.560
and the old indifference curve.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.050
And we do that by drawing
sort of an imaginary budget

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:30.910
constraint bc prime.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.160
bc prime is a sort of
imaginary budget constraint.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.810
It's not a real
budget constraint,

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.380
but it has the slope of
the new budget constraint,

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.170
but it's tangent to the
old indifference curve.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.750
That's the key thing. bc
prime, the imaginary budget

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:47.470
constraint, the dashed line,
has the slope of the new budget

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.300
constraint, same as
the new price ratio.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.180
So the slope is the
new price ratio.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:58.060
The slope is at the
new price ratio,

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.870
but it's tangent to the
old indifference curve.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:07.010
So bc prime is basically going
to the tangent [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.380
indifference curve at point b.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.700
So what we're saying is the
substitution effect moves you

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.920
from point a to point b.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:22.260
That is holding utility constant
but at these new prices,

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:28.010
you would choose to have
fewer cookies and less pizza.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.130
We call this notion
compensated demand.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.370
That is, I'm compensating you.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.200
I'm holding utility constant.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.132
I'm saying price of
change sucks for you.

00:33:43.132 --> 00:33:43.840
You're worse off.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.520
Your opportunity
set's restricted.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.780
But I'm going to
compensate you by holding

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.015
your utility constant.

00:33:49.015 --> 00:33:50.620
So call this compensated demand.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.540
Your compensated
demand would mean

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.220
that when the price
goes up, you would

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.950
choose to reduce your
consumption of cookies

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:01.510
from 6 to 4.89.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.720
Now, here's the key thing
about substitution effects--

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.730
we can sign them definitively.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.120
They are always negative.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.250
The substitution effect
is always negative.

00:34:15.527 --> 00:34:17.110
The income effect
could go either way.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:17.777
We'll show that.

00:34:17.777 --> 00:34:20.242
The substitution effect
is always negative.

00:34:20.242 --> 00:34:21.409
We can see this in two ways.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:24.110
Graphically, think
about it this way--

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.659
you have to be tangent
to the same indifference

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:29.960
curve with a higher
sloped line, so you

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.114
have to move to the left.

00:34:31.114 --> 00:34:32.989
If you get a tangent to
the same indifference

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.230
curve with a line
with the higher slope,

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.313
it's go to be to the left.

00:34:35.313 --> 00:34:37.370
So that's a graphical intuition.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.650
Mathematically, it's worth
writing out the steps,

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:40.517
because it helps.

00:34:40.517 --> 00:34:42.350
That's why we teach
this, it helps remind us

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:45.530
of our consumer theory.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.780
Step 1, you're at
this new tangency.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:57.530
Step 2, we know that at any
such tangency that's optimized,

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.280
the marg utility of cookies
over the marg utility pizza

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.950
equals the price of cookies
over the price of pizza.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.450
We know that's true
with any tangency,

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.560
because that's the
optimal choice.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.840
Step 3, we know P
c over P p is up.

00:35:17.752 --> 00:35:18.460
I just said that.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.470
And this assumption is
the price cookies up.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.690
Therefore, that leads to step 4.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:28.390
Which is that M Uc
over M Up must be up,

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:31.130
because it's still equal.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.820
Well, how do you raise the ratio
of the marg utility of cookies

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.500
to marg utility of pizzas?

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.710
How do you accomplish that?

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.540
By having fewer
cookies and more pizza.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.950
So that means-- that implies--

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.210
that cookies are down
and pizzas are up--

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.520
and/or pizzas are up.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.200
How do you get that
ratio to be higher?

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.650
Well, remember, this is
why do this math here.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.620
Remember the key intuition--
more cookies means

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.402
lower marg utility of cookies.

00:36:03.402 --> 00:36:04.860
The more cookies
you have, the less

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.270
you care about the next cookie.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.180
So I want the marg utility
of cookies to be lower.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.680
If the marg utility of cookies,
I'm sorry, to be higher,

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.400
I've got to have
fewer cookies, or I've

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.430
got to have more pizza, or both.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:21.700
So the substitution
effect is always negative.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.560
If I'm going to hold
utility constant,

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.048
and change prices,
and raise the price,

00:36:27.048 --> 00:36:28.590
you'll always want
less of that goods

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.223
on the substitution effect.

00:36:31.223 --> 00:36:32.890
Question about the
graphics of the math?

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.510
Now, let's come to
the income effect.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:45.952
The income effect says,
holding prices constant--

00:36:45.952 --> 00:36:47.160
so I shouldn't put this here.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.930
The income effect is
this at a constant price.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.030
I should have added that.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.600
So the income
effect is the change

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.940
in quantity demanded
as income changes

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.480
holding prices constant.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.890
So now we're saying--

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:02.530
the income effect is saying,
look, the price changed.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:06.280
So therefore I shifted my
consumption away from cookies.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.070
But the other thing that
happened is I got poorer.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.570
Maybe I'd say you
didn't get poorer,

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.237
your parents didn't
send you less money,

00:37:12.237 --> 00:37:14.760
but remember your
opportunity set restricted.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:20.158
You effectively are poorer
because this price went up.

00:37:20.158 --> 00:37:21.200
How do we represent that?

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.160
Well, we can exactly represent
that by the shift from bc

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:32.590
prime to bc2 Because bc prime
and bc2 have the same slope.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.256
That shift is just
the income effect.

00:37:35.256 --> 00:37:37.650
So that's holding
the prices constant.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:42.380
The price ratio for bc
prime and bc2 is the same.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.870
But you're now
effectively poorer,

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.170
because at the same income
you can afford fewer cookies.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.820
So you're effectively poorer.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.440
So now your income's
effectively fallen.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.060
And at that new
budget constraint

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.870
with that new lower effective
income and higher price ratio,

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.290
you choose point c.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.340
So we go from a to c, just
like I told you before,

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.550
but we actually get
there in two steps.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.130
One step is sort of
the relative change

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.505
in prices caused
you to say, ooh,

00:38:09.505 --> 00:38:11.287
I want to get away from cookies.

00:38:11.287 --> 00:38:13.620
The other say, I'm poorer,
so I want less of everything,

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.460
including cookies.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.650
So one is the price effect,
one's the income effect.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.110
And these two effects matter.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.610
Now, in this case,
they don't matter,

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.290
because they work together.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:30.610
In this case, you might say,
well, look, why do I care?

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.090
The bottom line is, the
number of cookies fell by 2.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.660
Substitution effect work
together, why do I care?

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:42.040
Well, you might care, because
if the good is inferior, then

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.740
the income and substitution
effect work against each other.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.600
If the good is inferior, then
the income substitution effects

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.910
work against each other
rather than with each other.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.410
To see this, let's
go to figure 4-6.

00:38:55.567 --> 00:38:57.525
Now, we're going to
totally change our example.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.710
Now, we're going to be choosing
between steak and potatoes.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.320
Totally different example--
steak and potatoes.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.570
You start a budge
constraint bc1.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.460
Potatoes are $1,
and steak is $5.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.882
So in our new example--

00:39:13.882 --> 00:39:14.840
I'll put this up here--

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:23.180
we've got the price of steak
is $5, the price of potatoes

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.620
is $1, and your income is $25.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.020
That's our new example.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.122
In that case, you will choose--

00:39:32.122 --> 00:39:33.830
and this is a different
utility function.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.493
This is a totally new example.

00:39:35.493 --> 00:39:37.910
I'm not going expect you to
understand the underlying math

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:38.410
here.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.480
I'm just showing an example of
something that might be true.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.010
So you choose point a.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:47.500
You choose 7 and 1/2
potatoes and 3 and 1/2 steaks

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.660
given those prices.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.690
Now, we're going to
say, what happens

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:58.120
if the price of potatoes
goes from $1 to $3?

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.270
The price of potatoes goes up.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.100
Well, two things happen--

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.720
first of all, the change
in compensated demand

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.397
moves you from
point a to point b.

00:40:10.397 --> 00:40:11.230
How do we know that?

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.600
Because you draw a new
imaginary budget constraint

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.940
that has the new
price ratio, but it's

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.000
tangent to the old
indifference curve.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.840
So you're point a to point b.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.450
So the substitution
effect lowers your demand

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:27.050
for potatoes from
7 and 1/2 to 4.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:32.610
But the income effect raises
your demand for potatoes.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:38.598
Now, the income effect means you
actually move back from 4 to 5.

00:40:38.598 --> 00:40:40.390
On net, you're still
having fewer potatoes,

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.460
but the substitution
effects went opposite ways.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.030
Why?

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.860
Why did the income
effect cause you

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.350
to want to have more potatoes?

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.100
The substitution, you
wanted have to less.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.761
Yeah?

00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:52.342
AUDIENCE: Because the price of
potatoes went up [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:52.342 --> 00:40:53.300
JONATHAN GRUBER: Close.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.470
Price of potatoes went up.

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:55.730
So you're effectively what?

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.643
Poorer, right?

00:40:57.643 --> 00:41:00.185
And when you're poorer, how does
that affect your consumption

00:41:00.185 --> 00:41:01.220
of inferior goods?

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.340
You want more of them.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.330
So price of potatoes went up.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.490
So effectively you're poorer.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.070
Now, when you're poorer, in our
previous example with cookies

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.903
you wanted fewer cookies
than a normal good.

00:41:13.903 --> 00:41:16.430
But potatoes are
an inferior good.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.410
So as you're poorer,
you want more of them.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:20.260
The income effect
goes the opposite way

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.210
of the substitution effect.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.120
That's where this starts
to get interesting.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.400
If the income effect
always goes the same way

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.942
as substitution effect, this is
sort of just a purely useless

00:41:27.942 --> 00:41:29.020
theoretical exercise.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.645
It gets interesting when income
effect goes the opposite way

00:41:31.645 --> 00:41:32.770
of the substitution effect.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:32.980
Yeah?

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.415
AUDIENCE: Isn't it
like the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:41:34.415 --> 00:41:34.810
JONATHAN GRUBER: Hold on.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:35.560
I'm getting there.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.450
I'm getting there.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.020
OK.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.180
Yeah?

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.792
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:40.792 --> 00:41:43.250
JONATHAN GRUBER: Utility-- well
different utility functions

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.485
will give you--

00:41:45.485 --> 00:41:47.360
you have to have a
different utility function

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.490
to get the good to be inferior.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:50.630
So you utility of steak and
potatoes is not going to square

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.230
root of--

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.828
you won't get inferiority
with square root of p times s.

00:41:53.828 --> 00:41:55.370
So it's a different
utility function,

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.430
and I mentioned that I think.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:57.290
It's a different
utility function.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.880
Yeah?

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.810
AUDIENCE: It's the
different functions

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.298
that makes potatoes be an
inferior good mathematically.

00:42:03.298 --> 00:42:04.340
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.080
So basically, your intuition--

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.230
I give you intuition
why they're inferior.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.110
But, mathematically, it
would occur because we'd

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:09.860
have a utility function.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.220
The utility function
would generate

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.723
an inferior would be a different
looking utility function.

00:42:13.723 --> 00:42:16.597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:16.597 --> 00:42:18.430
JONATHAN GRUBER: Not
off the top of my head.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.730
But we'll do it in section.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:22.948
So the bottom line is-- yeah?

00:42:22.948 --> 00:42:24.990
AUDIENCE: When you're
setting that price of steak

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.110
and potatoes, is it
that they both provide

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.810
similar nutritional value?

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:30.437
So one potato does
not necessarily

00:42:30.437 --> 00:42:31.270
equate to one steak.

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:34.540
But the price that are
setting, $5 worth of steak

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.960
is equivalent, in
terms of my health,

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.397
and will fill me up as much as--

00:42:38.397 --> 00:42:39.730
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, no, no, no.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:40.690
I'm not saying that at all.

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.190
I'm not writing down
a health function.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:43.220
I didn't write it down.

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.345
This is a utility function.

00:42:44.345 --> 00:42:46.930
So it's about filling
up, it's about taste.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.418
Steak may leave me hungrier,
but it's way better.

00:42:49.418 --> 00:42:50.710
So it's about what fills me up.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.200
Literally, all I'm saying is,
given my utility function--

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.260
and I don't have the utility
function written down--

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.555
I was choosing a balance of
mostly potatoes and some steak.

00:42:59.555 --> 00:43:01.180
Now that the price
of potatoes goes up,

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.148
I end up wanting fewer
potatoes, but not

00:43:03.148 --> 00:43:05.440
as few as you might think
from the substitution effect,

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.160
because potatoes are inferior.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:07.660
Yeah?

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:13.492
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the price
is more constant [INAUDIBLE]??

00:43:13.492 --> 00:43:14.630
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, no.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.460
What I'm saying--
the income effect

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.843
is holding the price constant.

00:43:17.843 --> 00:43:19.010
What happens to your demand?

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.510
So holding the price
constant-- what

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.720
I mean by that is moving
from bc prime to bc2

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.030
is the income effect,
holding your price constant.

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:28.320
So the price change is
reflecting the substitution

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:28.820
effect.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.992
That's reflected in moving
for bc1 to bc prime.

00:43:31.992 --> 00:43:33.950
The income effect is
holding the price constant

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:36.408
that is, given that same slope
of that imaginary new budget

00:43:36.408 --> 00:43:38.460
constraint, you're now poorer.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.080
So that's why.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.690
So once again, it's a hard
thing to wrap your mind around.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:42.410
It's theoretical.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.530
But the notion is when a price
changes two things happen--

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.130
it changes the relative
desirability of two goods,

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:51.330
and it changes your income--

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:53.900
your effective income,
your opportunity set.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.090
Two things are happening.

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.870
Yeah?

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.180
AUDIENCE: First, when
the price first changes,

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.030
you needed a substitute,
so you keep--

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:03.030
JONATHAN GRUBER: Oh, no.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:04.200
They both happened
at the same time.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:04.890
Let's be clear.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.120
This isn't sequential.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.630
This happening in real time.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:08.620
It's not like you said
the price went up,

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:09.690
I'm going to compute
my, you know--

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:11.160
it's happening in real time.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.560
It's just we're decomposing
into two effects.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.690
And the reason
we're doing that is

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.120
because once goods are
inferior, this decomposition

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.070
becomes interesting.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:24.148
So I like to think about this
in sort of a simple table

00:44:24.148 --> 00:44:25.940
to help remind you how
to think about this.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.300
So let's think about
a simple table.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.550
Here we have the price change.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.490
so the price can go up
or the price can go down.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:40.780
Up and down.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.930
Here we have the
substitution effect,

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:47.230
here we have the income effect,
and here, we have the total.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.020
Well, in the case
of a normal good--

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:56.490
if a good is normal--

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:04.120
then we know the substitution
effect when the price goes up

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.750
leads you to want
less of a good.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:10.390
The income effect also leads
you want less of a good.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:13.410
So you definitely
want less of the good.

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.530
These are all equals.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:15.990
There's always corner cases.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.540
Likewise, when the price
falls, the substitution effect

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.550
makes you want more of the good.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:26.352
When the price falls,
you're effectively richer.

00:45:26.352 --> 00:45:28.560
So the income effect makes
you want more of the good.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.130
So you clearly want
more of the good.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:33.200
That's the easy case.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.870
The more interesting case is,
what if it's an inferior good?

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.140
Now, if the price goes up,
the substitution effect

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:46.670
is the same.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:49.050
Substitution effect
is always negative.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.480
Higher price means you
substitute away from the good.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.600
But the income effect
is now positive.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.340
So the net is unclear.

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:04.308
Likewise, if the
price goes down,

00:46:04.308 --> 00:46:06.100
the substitution effect
is always positive.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.140
You always want more of the
good if the price goes down.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.520
But the income effect is now
you want less of the good.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.020
Why?

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.580
Because you're richer.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.620
If the price of a good
falls, you're richer.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.030
Richer means you want less
of that inferior good.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:20.050
So the net effect is unclear.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:22.210
So the interesting case
becomes inferior goods.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.450
Questions about the table?

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:33.760
So this raises the
question, are there goods--

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.320
what does this imply?

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:39.430
If the income effect dominated
the substitution effect,

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.940
you could get what?

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:41.563
Yeah?

00:46:41.563 --> 00:46:43.480
AUDIENCE: The higher
prices, the more you buy.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.355
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes.

00:46:44.355 --> 00:46:47.570
You could get an
upward-sloping demand curve.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.580
You could actually,
theoretically,

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.350
get an upward-sloping
demand curve.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:54.530
And we call this a Giffen good.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.960
A Giffen good is a good where
you get an upward-sloping

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.840
demand curve, where actually
the inferior income effect is

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.582
so large it dominates
the substitution effect,

00:47:07.582 --> 00:47:09.790
and you actually get an
upward-sloping demand curve--

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:13.330
that a higher price leads
people to want more of the good.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:17.110
Now, in fact, this is named
after some guy, Giffen,

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:17.850
I guess.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:21.018
And it probably was a
guy, because it's old.

00:47:21.018 --> 00:47:22.810
But, in fact, it's
convenient, because it's

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:23.890
close to where gryphon.

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:27.640
And gryphons are imaginary,
and so are Giffens.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.500
It's actually hard
to find examples

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.380
in reality of Giffen goods.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.890
It's actually pretty hard to
find examples from reality.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:40.663
But there was one interesting
experiment that was run,

00:47:40.663 --> 00:47:42.580
which is sort of the
first convincing evidence

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.250
that in some situations
Giffen goods could exist.

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.410
So I ran the follow experiment.

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:53.630
They run a study in China, where
very, very poor households--

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:55.090
most households
in China are poor,

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.298
but they divided it into
super poor versus moderately

00:47:57.298 --> 00:47:59.380
poor households.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.930
And they basically
gave them coupons

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:06.070
which lowered the price of rice,
which was their staple good.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:09.190
Basically, they eat rice, and
that's sort of their basic good

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.150
they eat.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:13.250
And they basically
lowered the price of rice.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.770
What they found is
that for families

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:18.020
that weren't super
poor, they found

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.210
a typical downward-sloping
demand curve.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:23.090
Giving them the coupon off rice
meant they bought more rice.

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:25.070
But for the very,
very poor families,

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.613
they actually did find an
upward-sloping demand curve.

00:48:27.613 --> 00:48:29.780
Giving them a discount on
the price of rice actually

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.170
caused them to have less rice.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.822
Because, literally, that's
all they ever ate, was rice.

00:48:36.822 --> 00:48:39.030
So by definition they could've
had more, because they

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:40.320
didn't eat anything else.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.490
Now that you're
essentially saying,

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:43.710
look, you used to eat all rice,
you'd spend your whole budget

00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:45.752
right, now I've basically
giving you extra money.

00:48:45.752 --> 00:48:48.293
Because all that rice you used
eat, you can now have cheaper.

00:48:48.293 --> 00:48:50.120
Are going to spend
that to buy more rice?

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.150
No, you're buy something else.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.572
And that's a Giffen good.

00:48:53.572 --> 00:48:55.530
So if you think about
sort of a corner solution

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.070
where people are buying all
the good that's inferior, then

00:48:58.070 --> 00:48:59.820
by definition if you
give them more money,

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.350
they're going to move
on to another good.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:02.800
Or there's at least
a possibility.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.260
And that's the
Giffen good example.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.570
But we have to search
pretty darn hard.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.550
Typically in the
demand context, we

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:11.070
think that demand curves
are downward-sloping.

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.497
However, when we get
to other contexts,

00:49:13.497 --> 00:49:15.330
we're going to find
it's more normal to find

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:16.360
that these income
and substitution

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.950
effects fight against
each other and lead

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:18.992
to strange-shaped curves.

00:49:18.992 --> 00:49:22.590
And we'll come back to
that later in the course.

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:25.160
OK, I'll see you all Wednesday.

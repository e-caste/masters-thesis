00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.458
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, so this is
the second part of the class,

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.861
and this the last
for the semester.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:33.694
So I think we've traveled a lot.

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:35.235
We see many difficult
issues I think.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.037
And I want to give
you credit, I think,

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:41.508
for-- during the semester for
being so open, and honest,

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:45.245
and being able to engage
into difficult issues.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.213
And each time that you
guys were presenting you

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.916
might remember me
liking you to you

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:52.786
to get deeper into
personal issues

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.054
and not just the abstract.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.890
And the reason is because
I think you make a better

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.759
case where everyone is
of use you can bring

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.628
your own narrative into it.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:05.131
And I think it's-- overall I
think it has worked and myself

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.701
learned so much from the
semester from listening to you,

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.905
some of your own personal
discoveries about yourself,

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.775
about issues of race,
language, gender, sexuality.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:18.111
And I give you
lots of gratitude.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.847
It's risky, and because
when you came here,

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.782
you didn't know each
other, most of you right?

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:26.286
And yet to be able open yourself
to the difficult questions

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.021
and to give answers
that were so thoughtful.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:33.193
And so-- many of them I
didn't expect some of you

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:36.628
to literally come out
in this class, in a way.

00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:37.729
Right?

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.100
So I thought that very
well in this class.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.503
So I give you my
respect for that.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:48.475
So I'm going to
end passing to you.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.709
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.544
MICHEL DEGRAFF: You get
a little while more,

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:55.315
maybe you've got
things that you feel

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.417
you take with you
to the next steps

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.119
so that you feel that
all this will come

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.322
after you this class might
benefit from anything that you

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:05.191
want share, in terms
of your learning

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.294
experience in this
class, and how you think

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:12.532
can bridge those gaps
that we've seen because

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:15.168
of our societies, our families?

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.670
So I wasn't here last
Thursday but I watched

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.667
the video of the whole
class. [inaudible] too,

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:24.277
actually really impressed
by how you guys brought up

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.612
your personal issues.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:28.748
And so but these are
going to have worked on.

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.350
I assume you have to make some.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.988
For this class-- for this
class 40 minutes or so

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.557
you have to be
something to bring out.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.260
We'll go to Nicky.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.427
You're going to take a pass?

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.329
OK we'll go to Edna.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.797
AUDIENCE: She's
quicker with words.

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:49.636
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.491
AUDIENCE: So I'm not sure
if I fully understand what

00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:53.740
I'm supposed to say, but I'm--

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.841
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Anything.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.242
AUDIENCE: --going to
say what I was thinking.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.045
So for me personally throughout
this class I think I realized--

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:02.443
I explored myself and
my identity way more,

00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:04.984
and I think I was forced to ask
questions about myself that I

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.853
hadn't.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.388
And for me the main
thing I realized

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:12.444
is like how uncomfortable I
am with being multiracial.

00:03:12.444 --> 00:03:14.027
I enjoy being
multiracial but I didn't

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.629
realize that there's parts
of me that don't necessarily

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.867
fit together, and how I don't
really see myself as one

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.702
certain race, or whatever.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:28.374
And I think the things that with
that were our personal essays,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.644
and definitely free
writing assignments

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.147
that one of the guest
professors had us do,

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.409
that got pretty deep.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.783
And I was kind of
like, oh crap I

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.949
have to write at 9:30 in
the morning, when she first

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:39.619
said that.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.589
But then I really enjoyed it.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:47.393
And I think like maybe bringing
out more multi-racial topics

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.996
next year would be
beneficial to people

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:55.134
to know that that was a
problem with themselves.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.103
And I think also a
really interesting topic

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.471
that we went over was--

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:00.106
I think-- What did we call it?

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:01.241
Faking?

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.444
Passing, passing-- and
how it's a privilege.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:08.281
And talking about like all the
controversial issues on that

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.550
and don't think I really
also thought about that

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.618
before this class.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:14.120
So that was something
I benefited from.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.490
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So you say
faking instead of passing?

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.858
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.461
And it reminded of a comment
Cynthia made back then, right?

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.996
That often, when
we think of passing

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:26.599
we think of it as something
which is negative--

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.834
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:28.968
MICHEL DEGRAFF: But contained
in that point, which

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:30.884
I remember very well, I
thought very important

00:04:30.884 --> 00:04:33.606
that passing should not be
viewed from that perspective.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.508
I say to that point
that we can think

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:39.812
of passing as a normal
survival strategy in a way.

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:40.380
So maybe--

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.781
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:46.772
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That's a nice
segue to think of [inaudible]..

00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:48.688
AUDIENCE: I actually
have another one I think.

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:49.789
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Say it again?

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.539
AUDIENCE: Nothing, can
I have another one?

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:59.475
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Sure of
course. [inaudible] [laughter]

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:01.100
AUDIENCE: So I guess
it's sort of hard,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.369
I think it sort of takes
a lot of reflecting--

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:04.771
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah.

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.707
AUDIENCE: Sort of think about
all that that we've discussed.

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:11.344
Sort of a quick note, one of
things that this class has

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:16.215
sort of solidified for me is
the importance of conversations.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:20.653
And so I think most of learning
that I've done in this class

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:24.957
and other sort of seminar
based classes sort of pales

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.460
in comparison-- or what I've
learned in my technical courses

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.834
pales in comparison
to the things

00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:32.031
that I learn in
classes like this

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:35.268
because at the end of the day,
I think most of the learning

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:37.136
comes from those around you.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.471
Class needs this.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.741
So, experiences that
they have more so

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.144
than what you learn in
these technical classes.

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:47.880
There's a saying that says
five years after you graduate

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.484
you won't remember 90%
or whatever of what

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:52.885
you learned in college.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:55.455
But I think what
you do remember is

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.724
these sort conversations
that boil down

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:01.060
to personal experiences.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.430
And so I think, again,
there is a challenge

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.966
in this world of
sort of approaching

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:12.171
people who aren't really willing
to have these conversations.

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.874
But sort of changing
yourself is the first step.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.577
And I think if everyone
sort of makes this, or has

00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:21.914
this realization, takes a step
toward making this change,

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.483
It's very idealistic,
but I think

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:24.984
the world be a better place.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:28.054
And so I think that's
probably one thing that I've

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:31.858
gotten from this class.

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:34.360
AUDIENCE: Go man.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.033
AUDIENCE: Bouncing
off of what Burk said,

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:44.604
I think one way in which I would
like to see his class grow is

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:49.175
the integration of having some
sort of conversation like open

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:54.280
discussion instead of debate
with someone who does not come

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.385
from a similar theological--
not theological--

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:00.319
AUDIENCE: Ideological.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.421
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.289
Ideological background
as opposed to people

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.261
in this class, to try to see
and sort of gain practice

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.730
in having a session
with someone who

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.201
is a lot different from you,
and developing a common trust,

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:18.371
and come to see each
other's viewpoints

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:24.177
in a way that would be
more informative than what

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:30.516
one could do among a set
like-minded individuals.

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.617
AUDIENCE: Let's see.

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:35.588
So one thing that I
enjoyed about this class

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.623
I can distinctly
remember one class

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:40.626
that literally blew my mind
I think I turned to Sonny

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.562
and was like, oh my gosh.

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:44.997
And that was when
we interrogated

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.666
what MIT was as an
institution and where

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:51.571
we sit in this
hierarchy of social--

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:55.107
in the social
hierarchy in the US.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:57.844
And I think when
coming to MIT I was

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:00.947
willing to give the
institution a free pass a lot

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:03.216
because I felt
that I was getting

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:05.017
a lot from the experience.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:07.854
But I think now that I'm
senior and all the seniors here

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:10.685
graduate-- last day
of class with you

00:08:10.685 --> 00:08:13.226
guys-- now that I'm at this
point where I can think back

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.862
on what MIT has
done for me and what

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:18.064
and how it functions
I think I'm better

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:24.470
poised to think more critically
about the institutions I choose

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:32.477
to join future for postgraduate
education and after.

00:08:32.477 --> 00:08:34.480
AUDIENCE: So I took this
class as a challenge

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.115
to myself because
at the beginning,

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:39.217
I knew about the
prejudices and stereotypes

00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:42.488
that I had been taught, and
I wanted to get rid of them.

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:44.891
And I think this has
helped a lot with that

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:47.527
just by hearing everyone else's
perspectives from the readings,

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:51.831
from looking at the world,
by taking a step back

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:54.267
and looking at
things as they are

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:58.504
and not how we were specifically
taught that they are.

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:00.940
And I really appreciate that.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.444
I want to- from here on
I want to move forward

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:11.017
and try to figure
out how to be an ally

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:12.785
from an asian-american
perspective

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:16.923
because a lot of the times
asian-american families

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:19.625
try to be the status quo.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:23.262
Like my parents have
always taught to try to be,

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:27.934
not explicitly, but implicitly
try to be as white as you can.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:31.704
And I think that that was
a really difficult lesson

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:34.407
to go through, and then come
to a place like MIT which

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.109
is so diverse and which has
so many different backgrounds.

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:39.445
And so come in thinking
there's a hierarchy where

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.213
there isn't and
now going forward,

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:47.553
trying to break that down.

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:49.655
AUDIENCE: Related to
what you said actually

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:53.759
is this concept of being
multi-racial, and interrogating

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:55.261
that for yourself.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.931
But also within a context
of being in a society

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:03.836
of multiple races, and
understanding the spaces that

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:06.906
exist for meaningful
conversations

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:10.176
across cultural, and
ethnic, and other sometimes

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:13.145
just socially
constructed boundaries

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:16.315
that don't necessarily
need to be boundaries.

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:21.454
And I remember in one
conversation Cynthia actually

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:27.727
really challenged this idea of
forming alliances especially

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:31.030
between historically,
systematically

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.299
oppressed groups.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.868
And in a class
like Black Matters

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:41.140
I think that we actually think
about people who don't identify

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.909
as black, and who may not
be read as black in society,

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:46.445
and we've engaged
critically with the issues

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:49.115
that they face as well.

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:53.285
When we talked about immigration
from Mexico, and in other times

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:56.555
where I insist upon
interjecting indigenous

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:59.325
North American issues
into the conversation.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.327
But there seems to be
space for all of that,

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:05.097
and so what I want to take away
from all of these discussions

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:11.404
is how can we create meaningful
alliances, and be allies,

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.973
and how can we
collaborate between groups

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:19.111
who are distinct and different,
and face similar challenges

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:24.617
in this society, but also have
really specific perspectives

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:27.153
and experiences,
and future goals.

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.922
So the idea of
collaborations, especially

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:31.524
among historically
oppressed groups

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.259
is one that I want
to continue thinking

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:37.697
about outside of this class.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.532
AUDIENCE: A lot of what
I was thinking about

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.268
during this class
for me personally

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:47.139
was comparing and contrasting
because I come from a very--

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:48.074
I'm from Zimbabwe.

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.875
So there's not a
lot of diversity,

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:52.672
and this is an entirely
new experience to me,

00:11:52.672 --> 00:11:54.046
so a lot of what
I were doing was

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:57.383
comparing my past, my
history, my experiences

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.920
with you guys experiences
and everything around me,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.589
and thinking about for
instance, in the readings

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.224
how they analyzed
different situations,

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:07.827
the situation in America,
the situation in Haiti.

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:10.329
And thinking about where
these things are connected

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:11.697
how they are different.

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:13.966
What could have been
done what should be done?

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:18.504
And I think I rarely thought
about issues like this

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:20.272
before this class,
and now I'm starting

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:23.042
to think about it more,
especially in education.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:27.646
I'm really interested in
education, and how we can help

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:31.283
teach people in the future how
to use their skills that they

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:34.186
learn, how to think about, how
to approach certain problems

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:38.390
in a way that challenges them,
and also challenges the status

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.327
quo, and challenges the
hierarchies that are set up.

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:44.396
So personally, I think
that this class definitely

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:46.832
helped me think
a lot more, and I

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:49.201
hope that in future it will
help a lot more people think

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:52.238
about their actions, think
about what they're saying,

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.073
think about what
they're doing, and think

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:56.175
about how they can
help and how they

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:58.110
can engage their communities.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.578
For instance, I
remember when we're

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:04.150
talking about how we came
to MIT we might graduate,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.352
and then what are we
going to do would we

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:08.873
go back to the communities
where we come from?

00:13:08.873 --> 00:13:10.289
How we are going--
how do you plan

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.324
to affect those communities?

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:15.661
Do you go back as experts, or
do we go back as one of them,

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:17.196
do we to fit in?

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.697
Questions like
that are definitely

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:22.168
things that we should
think about, and I think

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:24.539
are very important.

00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:26.205
AUDIENCE: Yeah I think
the biggest thing

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:30.109
for me was learning about
what we were learning,

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:33.846
but then thinking back to how I
grew up in a really white area,

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:36.849
and I was always taught there
is one correct way to speak,

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:41.654
there is like one correct
way to teach kids.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:45.391
And thinking back now
with all this information

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:48.961
how damaging that really
is, and how it it's

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.797
not really about the language,
and it's not really about

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:54.733
how we speak it's more
about marginalizing groups

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:56.936
that might speak that way.

00:13:56.936 --> 00:14:02.441
And it's just thinking about
how my entire school system was

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:07.379
based on what they thought was
correct, and was telling us

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:08.981
what we should think
is correct, and I

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:13.652
think coming out
of this hopefully

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:17.923
we can try to change some of
that in the school systems

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:21.393
because it can really
affect how kids

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:25.731
view the world as they grow up.

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:28.033
AUDIENCE: I think one thing
I gained from this class

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:35.040
is, I guess, verification of
the idea that listening is very

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.943
important, and there's
kind of various ways

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:39.011
you can think about it.

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.479
Just in the context
of this class,

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:45.384
whether it's listening to other
people share their experiences,

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:48.621
and really taking
in and understanding

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:52.558
how they fit in within
whatever social hierarchy,

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.827
or whatever kind of
issue we're discussing.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:57.663
And seeing how it's kind of
played a role in their lives,

00:14:57.663 --> 00:15:00.766
and kind of seeing how you
could apply it to either better

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:04.670
someone else's life,
improve your own interaction

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.871
with the world in some way.

00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:09.041
Or whether it's listening
in terms of language.

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:12.177
We talked a lot about
language and how

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:15.247
certain modes of speaking
are somewhat marginalized.

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:18.784
So ensuring that as you
go forward you really

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:21.987
listen to people regardless of
how they present their ideas,

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:24.523
or present their
thoughts, or whether it's

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:26.625
listening as far as
engaging people who

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:29.161
have opposing opinions as you.

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:31.090
Really understanding
that in order

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.464
to strengthen your
own positions,

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:35.067
and really understand why it is
that you think the way it is.

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:37.202
You have to be able to
listen to people who think

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:39.271
in a different way than you.

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:41.740
So yeah, I've just seen
a lot of different things

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.445
in this class that speaks to
the importance of listening.

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:47.980
AUDIENCE: I think
what this class

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.451
has made me call into question
a lot is my lack of analysis

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:57.909
of my racial background
because I'm Japanese-American.

00:15:57.909 --> 00:15:59.325
It's not really
something that I'm

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:03.595
forced to address all the time
because no one's really calling

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:05.731
that much attention to
it because neither one

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:12.071
of those groups is really that
attacked in modern society

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:14.173
for being a racial group.

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:17.343
And something I didn't
really even think,

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:18.544
my mom is an immigrant.

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:20.045
I didn't really
address that ever

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:25.184
because no one was calling in to
question her immigration here.

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:28.120
And that also leads
to a lot relating

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:34.426
to how the opinions of
other people, and especially

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:36.595
my very conservative
extended family,

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:40.232
and how their opinions
about certain things

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:43.168
such as immigration are
relying on people being

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:46.071
of certain races, and being
from certain places because it

00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:49.608
isn't something that
they've ever seen negatively

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:50.943
about my family.

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:54.146
But it is something that's
a cornerstone of why

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:57.016
my family exists.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:03.255
So I think things like
that, having people address

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:06.759
their own identities,
and their own backgrounds

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:08.394
and how that's
affected how they see

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:10.695
everything else in their
interactions with other people

00:17:10.695 --> 00:17:15.060
I think is a really great
part of this course.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.435
AUDIENCE: I'm having trouble
just to lay everything down,

00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:19.938
but I guess one big
takeaway from this class

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:23.675
was accepting that
there is no one right

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:30.182
way to exist as a human across
individuality, race, and class,

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.116
and things like that.

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:33.752
And that was a
realization that I

00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:37.089
think I came to in this class.

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:38.824
And it all goes back
to the importance

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:40.592
of interrogating
your beliefs, and why

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:42.561
you think the ways that you do.

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.330
And it's really
eye-opening and I think

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.465
that it's really important.

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:49.268
You have to open
yourself up to that

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:51.737
and it takes a certain
level of vulnerability.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:56.975
I wasn't expecting to come
out in this class at all,

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:59.645
but I did because this was
a place where I felt safe,

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:01.547
and it was really
surprising that I felt

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:04.116
so safe in this environment.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:08.987
And I think that's something
we need to recreate elsewhere.

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:11.690
A lot of people I would like
to take for this in the future

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.326
is therapy who are
seniors taking this class,

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:15.794
what do you do now?

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:18.430
What class do you take
next, or what actions

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.233
can you take because of what
you've learned in this class?

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:22.868
I think something
that maybe they

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:25.104
could have it in this is
thinking about concrete ways

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.738
to actually do stuff.

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:29.942
Because we had Professor Chomsky
in here on Tuesday and he said,

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:32.811
almost anything, is the
answer to what do we do.

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:36.895
So maybe having some sort of an
initiative coming out of this

00:18:36.895 --> 00:18:40.547
class is to make tape just
at MIT for just impulsive

00:18:40.547 --> 00:18:46.058
[inaudible]..

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:48.026
AUDIENCE: So kind
of piggybacking off

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:49.995
of what Chris said,
I think the most

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:52.297
those meaningful
conversations and talks

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:58.737
that we've had for me, where
when we talked to professors,

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:01.907
people all over
Cambridge who were using

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:06.178
their own backgrounds,
their own field of study,

00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:08.380
and they're making
tangible changes.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.581
It's Christmas day.

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:13.318
So for example, when we
watch the virtual reality

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:18.223
kind of simulation in terms
of the Israeli-Palestinian

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:19.825
conflict.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.895
And I feel like those
conversations and the fact

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:25.264
that I have had the
privilege of taking

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:28.967
this class in my semester
has really kind of driven me

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:35.507
to really to take
action outside of MIT,

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:38.177
and hopefully in the
future back at MIT.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:42.014
And to really take that
with me in my specific field

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:48.720
of medicine, and how these
various identities can really

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:57.596
affect people's health care,
and that's life or death.

00:19:57.596 --> 00:20:01.800
And so I feel like that is
really been eye-opening for me

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.605
and that's driven me to action.

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:10.576
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
for me, from this class

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:14.780
has made me more aware of how
many things they go through.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.717
Compared to what I didn't know
about the Haitian Revolution

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.586
as it occurred.

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:24.756
And I didn't really know how
to question during the time.

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:28.160
But it's all things
that we are taught just

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.195
because a lot the
history that we

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:34.533
learn is taught from a very
westernized perspective.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:36.668
So I feel like
it's very important

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:40.305
that this class teaches that
there's always many ways

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:44.910
to view certain things, and
there's many things that aren't

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:52.618
necessarily taught just because
society just doesn't want us

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:54.653
to know about these
things, so that we

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:58.457
could learn from this, yeah.

00:20:58.457 --> 00:21:00.993
AUDIENCE: I think similar
to what Hermann was saying,

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:04.062
I think this class is
really about the idea

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:05.697
of taking action.

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:11.270
In a lot our readings passivity
was just there all the time.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.373
People I remember it,
the need to settle down,

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:19.711
or afternoon it's just like,
oh that's really strange

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:22.347
but I guess the way things are.

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:25.651
He noticed that things were
wrong but he didn't anything,

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:29.321
so I think just
trying to take action,

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:33.425
and Megan you mentioned
interrogating yourself

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.960
is an important way to do it.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.461
And I really liked
first assignment,

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.330
which was the linguistic
autobiography,

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.634
and I felt that just thinking
of my whole life in terms

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:46.438
of the languages I grew
up with, reading, writing,

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:48.473
and how they were
presented to me

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:53.779
was a really good way just
to look into my own self.

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:56.348
What I think would have
been, would be better,

00:21:56.348 --> 00:22:00.552
in future versions of class
would be maybe talking together

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:02.254
in smaller groups.

00:22:02.254 --> 00:22:02.982
Would be harder.

00:22:02.982 --> 00:22:04.523
I guess I think it's
just easier just

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:08.827
to talk about yourself
that way for some people

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:11.163
are more comfortable, I think.

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.965
The only time we got to
that was last Tuesday we

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:19.271
had Professor Olive ub here, and
we worked in groups of three,

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:20.572
and that was really cool.

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:22.774
AUDIENCE: OK, thank
you, thank you.

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:27.713
I think so what's adjusted also,
you mean like a [inaudible]..

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:30.482
So what Chris said
we can try together

00:22:30.482 --> 00:22:34.263
because this class I hope
will be often many, many,

00:22:34.263 --> 00:22:38.990
many, many times again
here, [inaudible] I hope.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:43.722
Actually thinking of next
year, I might do it with

00:22:43.722 --> 00:22:44.296
[inaudible]..

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:47.299
So from that perspective
maybe you guys

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:49.835
could share with
me what you think

00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:51.837
will be done to implement
what you guys think

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:55.901
in terms of taking this
knowledge into action.

00:22:55.901 --> 00:22:57.275
Because throughout
the semester I

00:22:57.275 --> 00:23:00.879
was struggling with what
kind of project do I assign?

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.814
Because I often
felt that it would

00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:06.084
be so nice to do a project that
puts you guys in the world,

00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:08.687
not just writing an essay.

00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:10.749
And I try to see what--

00:23:10.749 --> 00:23:12.290
Something could come
up spontaneously

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:16.161
from you that could
bond in to out of space.

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:19.765
So how would you advise me
in next cycle of this course

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:21.400
to make that happen?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.937
To do projects, maybe
throughout the semester only

00:23:25.937 --> 00:23:28.440
or optional projects
that would really

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.075
turn knowledge into action?

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:34.379
OK so it's getting
that, and then that.

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:35.781
AUDIENCE: So,
maybe some things--

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:37.783
I still think you should
have the essays because

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:41.086
at least for me they were pretty
beneficial in exploring myself,

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:43.321
but maybe instead of
having the essay revision,

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:45.290
although I think revising
essays is important,

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.559
I think that can be done
throughout your essay process

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.420
instead.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.128
And maybe like putting
in a project where

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:53.965
you have to create a policy,
or like a lesson plan,

00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:58.336
or something like that,
and then present that.

00:23:58.336 --> 00:24:00.305
And maybe even have a
plan of action of who you

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:01.907
would go to talk to about this?

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.775
I think if you just
come up with a plan it

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:07.512
can be pretty philosophical,
or just an idea

00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:09.181
and will never be
done with it, what

00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:11.216
would be your next step
now you have an idea,

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:12.884
how do you implement it?

00:24:12.884 --> 00:24:15.153
And then also, something
I forgot mention before,

00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:17.255
but I thought I was really
useful about this class

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:19.458
was when we went
to go to the movies

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.460
all together on a Saturday.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.096
At first I was like, oh crap,
now I have to like allot time,

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:27.199
but I actually
really enjoyed that

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:30.068
and was hoping the
conversation would keep going.

00:24:30.068 --> 00:24:34.239
So maybe having more
things outside the class,

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:37.375
because I think it's really
hard to explore all the things

00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:40.345
that we want to do in
an hour and a half.

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:42.280
So maybe having somewhere--

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.748
I don't know what
types of places

00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:45.750
you can go to-- but maybe
going to an inner city

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.453
school in Boston together, and
seeing how it's taught there,

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:49.654
and what you would change?

00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:51.654
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, that's
good to hear actually

00:24:51.654 --> 00:24:54.092
because one thing I'm toying
with the Fox, Mr. Harald,

00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:56.528
is to see whether we could
change the format, instead

00:24:56.528 --> 00:25:00.332
having a hour and a half to add
once a week from three hours.

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:03.502
In the past I tried that
because of the schedule for MIT

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:06.505
it's hard for students to
enroll with a three hour class.

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:07.666
when they graduate.

00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:09.207
So we stepped away
from that, but now

00:25:09.207 --> 00:25:11.710
I don't whether
we should do that.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.313
In admitting with three hours
we could go someplace else.

00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:17.482
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I that
might be beneficial.

00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:21.052
I know negotiation at Sloan
does it at Thursday at 5:00

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:22.387
or something like that.

00:25:22.387 --> 00:25:24.055
So it's hard to schedule a
three hour class during the day,

00:25:24.055 --> 00:25:25.624
but if you do it
as a night session.

00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:28.093
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, OK, OK.

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:29.427
Thank you for saying that Alisa?

00:25:29.427 --> 00:25:32.430
I will report back to
Colton and see what--

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.342
So it goes Dana, then
Sarah then Jackie.

00:25:34.342 --> 00:25:35.800
AUDIENCE: Well its
related directly

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.883
she just said about time--

00:25:36.883 --> 00:25:37.936
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, OK.

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:39.070
AUDIENCE: It's just
like a short thing,

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.944
but having a class at
5:00 would be difficult

00:25:40.944 --> 00:25:42.474
because there is
a lot of athletes

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:45.977
who participate because they
practice from 5:00 to 7:00.

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:47.546
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
I see, I see, OK.

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:49.514
AUDIENCE: Yeah there's
another section at 7:00

00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:50.315
I'm pretty sure.

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:51.060
So.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.018
AUDIENCE: Closing class
are from 7:00 to 10:00.

00:25:53.018 --> 00:25:54.519
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
7:00 to 10:00, yeah.

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:55.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.354
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK.

00:25:56.354 --> 00:26:00.325
AUDIENCE: Yeah we were
talking about projects.

00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:02.827
And I think that could
definitely work in this course,

00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:07.858
and I think one thing that I've
really wanted is to be able

00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:10.368
to affect change in this--
within the context of this

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:15.874
course and sort of have a reason
to do so based on everyday's--

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:17.642
I would like to go
into school and say,

00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:20.946
let me try my at
teaching kids in this way

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:23.949
and see if it
actually works there.

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:26.818
So if you wanted to
organize that sort of thing

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:29.521
it could be cool to also
work in small groups

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:31.189
and we diversify the--

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:35.060
I mean we have a ton
of courses in here,

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.862
but I think there's a
lot of working, going out

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:39.831
into the real
world and I think--

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:41.166
I mean this is just me agreeing.

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:45.036
I think a three hour
course could be good.

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:48.006
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK.

00:26:48.006 --> 00:26:49.474
Sarah?

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:51.676
AUDIENCE: So I just
think add stems

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:53.111
from what Colin
said about talking

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:55.880
to someone with a different
ideological perspective

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.516
than yourself, so
maybe having students

00:26:58.516 --> 00:27:01.820
go in groups of two [inaudible]
out into world and maybe

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.489
interview someone, or share
some of the information

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:06.458
about the Haitian
Revolution should have,

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:09.928
it was like one of visionary
revolutions to have.

00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:11.463
[interposing voices]

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:12.597
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:14.180
AUDIENCE: Something
along those lines.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.467
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, OK, OK.

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:16.929
So going back to the last point.

00:27:16.929 --> 00:27:18.470
So in terms of going
into the schools

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.182
I have some good
news, which is that, I

00:27:20.182 --> 00:27:22.807
think I should have [inaudible]
with you about this new program

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:25.243
that has been launched in
the Boston public school,

00:27:25.243 --> 00:27:26.444
this new program.

00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:29.981
And Vindlam Khan actually
she's I think Chinese,

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:33.018
and she actually, she
launched-- she had launched

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:34.452
the program in
Chinese and English

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:36.254
can be introduced as
going reasonable well,

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:37.555
from what I hear.

00:27:37.555 --> 00:27:41.793
And then she's also responsible
launching this Creole

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:43.261
to English learning program.

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:45.430
And she has offered
that if there

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.599
are students in this
class and other classes

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:52.103
at MIT if they want to come and
volunteer, and take advantage

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:55.874
of that new program in terms
of doing research that's

00:27:55.874 --> 00:27:57.742
socially based, or
empirically based,

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:59.110
or even like [inaudible].

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.512
Measuring students
learning games

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:03.014
she would be happy
to work with you.

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:05.583
There's one student
in the other class

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:08.463
posted it's [inaudible]
with the [inaudible] twice,

00:28:08.463 --> 00:28:11.632
and was to be going
on a weekly basis

00:28:11.632 --> 00:28:14.631
to the meetings who try
understand how they are

00:28:14.631 --> 00:28:17.589
creating this new program
where there would be I

00:28:17.589 --> 00:28:19.942
think half kids who
speak creole and half who

00:28:19.942 --> 00:28:21.499
don't speak creole.

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:23.234
And this would be
truly bilingual,

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:28.139
so you get American or other
of these kids learning creole

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:30.175
and get the Haitian creole kids.

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:32.711
We've got to include both the
English and bigger English,

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:36.848
so I think it's really I
think very radical move

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:37.949
for the government school.

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:39.573
They've had other
programs of that sort

00:28:39.573 --> 00:28:42.353
but never one involving
the non-imperial language.

00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:46.591
Typically it's Spanish-English,
French-English,

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:48.526
Chinese-English, but
it's the first time

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:50.829
that they are doing
one that includes

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:53.732
a language like Haitian Creole
that's been over the years

00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:56.334
as you know [inaudible] history.

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.503
So we're excited, we've
hit some push back

00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:02.307
including push back back from
Haitian parents, some of them

00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:05.310
would prefer to have it in
French, as you can imagine.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:10.749
They don't speak French,
it's a difficult neo-colonial

00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:15.487
[inaudible] into an imperial
language, so to speak.

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:18.022
But I think there has been some
good progress on that front.

00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:21.192
Noam Chomsky was
here, Tuesday he

00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:23.795
had an interview which I
put on my Facebook page--

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:27.165
I can show it to you--
where it goes me,

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:35.707
him, and I think that's
[inaudible] together

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:38.743
from Mexico, but he
grew up in California.

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:41.513
And this was a very interesting
exchange between the two of us.

00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:45.216
Where Chomsky might be
important of promoting these so

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:46.851
called [inaudible]
support for really

00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:50.421
of duration of the [inaudible].

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:53.124
So, I think those
are good suggestions,

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:55.627
those are very good suggestions.

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:59.197
And since Harrell is from a
background in computation,

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:02.967
and as we saw doing the project
on involving virtual reality

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:09.107
that might be another part where
we can do action in the course.

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:11.743
AUDIENCE: With the-- just
based off like the Fox Harrell

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:15.113
computation part, I thought it
was really interesting learning

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:16.381
about what he was doing.

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.835
I think if there was--
but I don't know if this

00:30:18.835 --> 00:30:20.084
is where you're going, but it.

00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:21.820
I think there was a
more of a requirement

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.822
to do more computation based
things I probably would

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:25.072
straight away from this class.

00:30:25.072 --> 00:30:26.043
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK.

00:30:26.043 --> 00:30:28.459
AUDIENCE: Because, so I'm not
like the stereotypical major

00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:30.195
here, I'm a business
major, I think

00:30:30.195 --> 00:30:31.963
I would been slightly
intimidated if there

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:34.666
was a CMS type project in here.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:37.620
So maybe making that one of
the facets of what you can do,

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.536
but not a requirement.

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:39.804
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, that's OK.

00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:40.429
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:40.429 --> 00:30:42.345
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah,
good for you, thank you.

00:30:42.345 --> 00:30:43.141
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:45.810
CYNTHIA: I think also taking
advantage of the learning

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.446
styles of the students in the
class could be interesting.

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:50.682
So maybe doing more
creative projects,

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:52.784
or doing projects
that people feel

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:56.688
like allows them to
use their best skills

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.156
and actually have
fun I feel like--

00:30:58.156 --> 00:31:00.124
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So tell
me Cynthia if you could

00:31:00.124 --> 00:31:03.661
a project that was creative
what would you have done?

00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:08.166
Just to the extent of what you
could think of in the future?

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:09.901
CYNTHIA: Just off
the fly I maybe would

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:15.907
have made a fucking 10 foot
tall papier-mache person

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:21.579
and written stuff all over it
and then put it in lobby 10.

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:22.647
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, OK.

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:24.396
AUDIENCE: Like negative
comments or like--

00:31:24.396 --> 00:31:26.851
CYNTHIA: Anything, just like
stuff that's interesting.

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:28.253
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
OK, and then they

00:31:28.253 --> 00:31:30.889
would have to the part
that includes communication

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:32.557
of some sort.

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.158
So how would do
that, so you do that

00:31:34.158 --> 00:31:36.728
and have a paper
describing why you did it,

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:39.163
the mission of what you've
done and the objective

00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:40.331
it's trying to accomplish?

00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:42.233
CYNTHIA: I mean if it
just like a black body

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:44.135
or like a brown
body of some sort

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:46.204
I would even just to
leave markers and stuff

00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:48.172
for other people to
put messaging on it

00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:49.874
I feel like would be giving--

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:51.709
I think art is a great
way to give people

00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:54.979
an entry into having
this conversation.

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:56.281
It would be an artifact.

00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:57.949
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Excellent, excellent I'm

00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.612
so glad this is being recorded
so that way we have this.

00:32:00.612 --> 00:32:02.153
No really, so that
way we have this--

00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:03.855
I can watch it with
Fox, Carol and we

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:06.991
then we can play around with
the idea, it's great too.

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:11.062
Actually, anyone has concrete
suggestions like that?

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:11.949
So they told you--

00:32:11.949 --> 00:32:14.032
AUDIENCE: So my class one
of those I don't-- maybe

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:17.035
you've taken it, Psychology
of Gender and Race?

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:17.535
No?

00:32:17.535 --> 00:32:18.803
OK.

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:22.740
This [inaudible] psychologist
who works in local area,

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.043
I think her first name is
Shiby I forget her last name.

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:30.381
But part of the class is
training or doing mock training

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:33.851
on how do you present cultural
awareness presentations.

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:36.721
Where you go with--
you basically

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:39.043
form a group of students
and kind of teach

00:32:39.043 --> 00:32:42.593
the other students her role
play and how to college frat,

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:45.573
members of a college
frat or sixth graders

00:32:45.573 --> 00:32:48.032
out of a local
Boston public school

00:32:48.032 --> 00:32:53.671
about how some things
that they could be doing

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:56.007
may be disparaging
to minority groups,

00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:58.443
and it could be interesting
having a conversation with her

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:00.011
to see what things
she incorporates

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:01.946
into those presentations
and if that would be

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:03.281
useful inside of Black Matters.

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:07.285
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, that would
be useful, be very useful.

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:07.952
Dana?

00:33:07.952 --> 00:33:09.787
No I was-- I'm done.

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:14.659
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK. [laughter]

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.627
AUDIENCE: With the
wiki that I think

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:18.596
was a new thing this
semester, I think,

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:21.299
it's another way for us to
communicate as students,

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:23.162
it would be great because
just maybe someone

00:33:23.162 --> 00:33:25.203
said something to you that
was really interesting

00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:26.804
and you only have their email.

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:28.206
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Right.

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:30.808
AUDIENCE: It's hard to get in
contact so maybe an opt-in way

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:32.043
to have--

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:35.513
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So the wiki
didn't really work, huh?

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:36.914
Why does the wiki not work?

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:37.849
AUDIENCE: It's hard.

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:39.317
AUDIENCE: It's not
a good platform.

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:41.319
MICHEL DEGRAFF: The wiki
is not a good platform,

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:44.660
all because we have you
here. [laughter] The wiki not

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.517
a good platform, I heard that
as well in my other class,

00:33:48.517 --> 00:33:50.495
the students say, we
don't like the wiki.

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:51.429
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:53.424
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
[interposing voices]

00:33:53.424 --> 00:33:55.132
AUDIENCE: What about
like a Slack Channel

00:33:55.132 --> 00:34:00.316
or something like where you
be more-- [interposing voices]

00:34:00.316 --> 00:34:02.607
AUDIENCE: Or like a Facebook,
something that we already

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:04.742
all use and wouldn't have
to go out our way to use.

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:05.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.012
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:09.781
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Who
had their hand raised?

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:11.349
Was there a hand
raised over here?

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:13.985
Was it Shope, was
your hand raised?

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.719
Oh, OK.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.021
AUDIENCE: Yeah sure.

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:20.324
So first, you were asking
what kind of projects right?

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:23.027
So from the teaching
perspective,

00:34:23.027 --> 00:34:26.197
I think after the
classes last week I'm

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:30.735
learning about open
and fixed mindset.

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.804
Something that would
have been interesting

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:36.139
as the project would be to
create a curriculum, just

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:40.645
a lecture or a workshop for
an age group, whatever age,

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:43.748
it could be college,
it could be lower

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:48.119
and try to implement
the like teaching

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:53.224
techniques that we learned to
foster a more open mindset.

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:55.793
That would have been a
school project to explore.

00:34:55.793 --> 00:34:56.893
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, great.

00:34:56.893 --> 00:34:59.664
OK so, Fenny, Dana and Edna.

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.632
AUDIENCE: But mine
is off of that.

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:02.834
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK.

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:05.369
AUDIENCE: OK, so I think
that would be a good idea.

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:08.061
Also we can still enlist the
help of the professors who

00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:11.943
made these lectures because
I think that will give us

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:15.613
a little more-- when we
actually go into these schools

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:20.685
and say we'd like to bring
this plan to you because have

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:23.154
professor backing, we
have this whole slew

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:27.325
of research behind us.

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:29.494
AUDIENCE: Another cool thing
that you could do about

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:34.866
community outreach, is I know
one time a couple weeks ago

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:39.604
in Amphibious Achievement we
had a bunch of people from

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:44.492
Chocolate City come in, and
also it's-- there's a group--

00:35:44.492 --> 00:35:46.844
it's like something
something Latinas.

00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:50.047
And I don't know--
[interposing voices] Yes!

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:52.517
And so they came in and
Chocolate City came in and--

00:35:52.517 --> 00:35:55.330
AUDIENCE: But you have to give
some background about Chocolate

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:58.890
City and Amphibious Achievement,
make it self-contained.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.983
[interposing voices] So
Amphibious Achievement

00:36:01.983 --> 00:36:07.632
is we-- it's a program at MIT
and we work with Boston public

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:11.702
high schoolers and it's an
academic mentorship program,

00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:13.289
but also we just
work with them to try

00:36:13.289 --> 00:36:14.872
to build their
confidence, and we also

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:19.076
help them apply to college,
and things like that.

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:23.430
But, and then Chocolate
City is just like it's

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:30.172
a living group here on campus,
and it's African-American men

00:36:30.172 --> 00:36:33.224
and then-- say it again?

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.625
AUDIENCE: Mujeres Latinas.

00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:38.763
AUDIENCE: That's a-- [laughter]

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:42.700
AUDIENCE: --group
of Latina women,

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.871
and so they came in to
talk to the high schoolers

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:52.243
in Amphibious Achievement and we
just had a discussion about how

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:56.047
they feel about what they've
been told they can and cannot

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:59.183
do because of who they are.

00:36:59.183 --> 00:37:03.120
And it was really, really
interesting for everybody.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.423
And I think that would
be something cool to do--

00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:07.358
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Do you
have a Facebook page?

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:10.928
AUDIENCE: We do, it's called
Amphibious Achievement.

00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:11.862
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Right.

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:14.065
That's great.

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:16.701
Thank you, thank you.

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:18.803
Actually, so which Facebook
would be a better way

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:21.606
to communicate instead the wiki.

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah way better.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.342
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Way better.

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:26.842
So maybe next year we create a
Facebook page for the course.

00:37:26.842 --> 00:37:28.913
AUDIENCE: Yeah, a
page for the course

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:31.916
and then a messaging
group for the students.

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:34.752
OK, OK.

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:37.588
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, OK that
was good idea, good idea.

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:38.522
All right.

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:40.091
I should maybe
[inaudible] a page,

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.460
a Facebook page for this
group, and that way you guys

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.327
can keep in touch.

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:46.864
And if there are ways that--
even what [inaudible] has

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:49.527
explained and then we should do
other projects that might bring

00:37:49.527 --> 00:37:51.235
your strength and your
knowledge together

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:52.903
to bring actual
change, that might be

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:54.338
something we could figure out.

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.674
But you would have be
responsible for it.

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:57.535
Colin?

00:37:57.535 --> 00:37:59.243
AUDIENCE: Bouncing
off of your idea here,

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:01.445
I think it would be really
interesting to actually

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:06.512
have one part of that would be
a [inaudible] support literacy

00:38:06.512 --> 00:38:12.189
class, or presentation
or something like that.

00:38:12.189 --> 00:38:14.992
Where you going to take a
certain section of literature,

00:38:14.992 --> 00:38:17.094
maybe just one book
like Madam Bovary,

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:21.732
and dissect the ways in
which the society in which it

00:38:21.732 --> 00:38:24.935
is embedded create
the themes within it.

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:26.437
A major thing inside
of Madam Bovary

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:29.273
is centered on this
one woman who's

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:32.743
married in countryside of
France back in 1900s or 1800s,

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:35.913
and she gets really depressed
because she has nothing to do.

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:39.617
And just explaining that she
has no options for employment,

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:43.387
and is stuck at home because
that's what was expected

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:44.655
of women back in that day.

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:48.893
And dissecting both
that cultural phenomenon

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:55.433
and then examining how that
may play out in today's terms

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:58.069
with different
patterns in society.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:59.837
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, good, goo.

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:04.175
SO a statistic fact, you
may have the last word.

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.810
AUDIENCE: Wow, OK.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:08.612
So something that I
was thinking about

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:12.594
was what you had about
having an art project,

00:39:12.594 --> 00:39:14.885
and I realized I'm not artistic
at all, so I was trying

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.821
to figure out what I would do
if there was an art assignment.

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.989
And I was thinking about
something that's in a show,

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:21.659
where like you put yourself
up, you stand up there

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:23.260
and then you have
a projector screen,

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.662
and you write
words on it of what

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:26.097
you don't like about yourself.

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:27.483
And that could be
instead of what

00:39:27.483 --> 00:39:28.899
we don't like of
ourselves, things

00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:31.440
we've been told about ourselves
based of our race, or gender,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.871
or sexuality, and also having
things you would rather

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:37.375
have been said, because what I
really liked about this class

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:38.743
was the self-exploration, so.

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:39.877
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Good, good.

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:43.053
All right guys so
thank you so much.

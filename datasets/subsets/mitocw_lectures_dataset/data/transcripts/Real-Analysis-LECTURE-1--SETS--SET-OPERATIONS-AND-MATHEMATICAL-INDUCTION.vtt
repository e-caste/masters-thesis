[SQUEAKING]

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.180 align:middle line:90%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: OK.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So I have to admit this
is extremely awkward,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.998 align:middle line:90%
lecturing to an empty room.

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So I have to imagine
there's somebody

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
on the other end actually
listening to me at some point.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is what YouTube
stars have to go through

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:90%
at some point in their career.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So what is the purpose
of this course?

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is for 18
100A, Real Analysis.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose of this
course is twofold.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Really, I think the first
primary purpose of this course

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.685 align:middle line:84%
is to gain experience
with proofs.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:21.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So that means being
able to read a proof,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.180 align:middle line:90%
being able to write a proof.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And the second statement,
or the second purpose,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
which is supposed to be a way
to obtain the first purpose,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:57.815 align:middle line:84%
is to prove statements about
real numbers, functions,

00:01:57.815 --> 00:01:58.315 align:middle line:90%
and limits.

00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So the second part, this
is the analysis part, OK?

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So for the first
few lectures, we're

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
going to do what maybe to
some will be kind of review.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.652 align:middle line:84%
And for most of you,
a lot of this material

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.360 align:middle line:84%
in the first few
lectures will be review.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's a nice way to
ease into the material.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And things will most definitely
pick up after a few lectures.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So the first set
of objects we're

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:84%
going to define and try to prove
some statements about are sets.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So definition-- and because
I use a lot of shorthand,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I will mostly write
Dfn from now on instead

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.470 align:middle line:90%
of the entire word, definition.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:84%
So a set is a
collection of objects

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:90%
called elements or members, OK?

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, this course
is supposed to be

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
probably the first really
rigorous course in math

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:90%
that many of you will deal with.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, everything
that we talk about

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
will be rigorously and
unambiguously defined.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But we do have to
start somewhere.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe you
think this word,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
"collection," is a
little ambiguous.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And perhaps you should.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But to actually build up set
theory from the ground up

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
would take us quite beyond the
scope of this class and too far

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
afield of the things
that we want to do,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.290 align:middle line:84%
or at least that
what I want to do.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, so a set is just a
collection of objects

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.475 align:middle line:90%
called elements, or members.

00:04:45.475 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:84%
There is the simplest
set to define:

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:84%
the empty set is the
set with no elements.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And we denote it by this symbol
here-- a circle with a dash

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:90%
through it.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, so with new math
typically comes new notation,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:90%
new symbols that you use.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
So let me introduce a few
shorthand notations we'll

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:90%
use throughout the course.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, quite honestly,
this is a little bit

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:90%
of the fun of doing higher math.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:90%
You get all these funny symbols.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.787 align:middle line:84%
And a very accomplished
mathematician

00:05:48.787 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Chicago, one time

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
said, you're really only
interested in the math

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:84%
where that has the
symbols you like

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:90%
to write over and over again.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So some notation--
a and this symbol

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
which this symbol,
which looks like a e-S

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
means a is an element
of S. A with a dash

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.170 align:middle line:84%
through this little e
means everything here but.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:90%
So a is not an element of S.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:84%
This upside down
A means for all.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:90%
It's shorthand for all.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Backwards E means there exists.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:90%
And a couple of more--

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
if you see an arrow like
this, this means implies.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:90%
So I've written down one thing.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:90%
This implies the next statement.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:90%
I'll put an arrow between them.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And an arrow going both
ways means if and only

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
if, meaning if I have a
statement P if and only if Q,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.200 align:middle line:84%
that means statement P implies
Q and statement Q implies

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:90%
P, all right?

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you need a quick
refresher on basic logic,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
you can find that in the
appendix of the textbook.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's the basic
definition of set, empty set.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So set A-- another
definition to set

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:84%
A is subset of B, which we
write A, this little symbol

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that looks like a C, B
If every element in A

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is an element in B.
Little a's in capital A

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:90%
means little a is in capital B.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:90%
So two sets are equal--

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:90%
we write A equals B--

00:08:51.430 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:84%
if A is a subset of B
and B is a subset of A.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And A is a proper subset
of B if A is a subset of B

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and A does not equal
B. And we typically

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
write that by A and
with a dash going

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:84%
through a line underneath the C
to signify that it's not equal.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So think of it as not,
so less than or equal to,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:84%
but not equal to is one
way to think about it.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:57.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let me say
something since I'm now

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3 definitions in.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So definitions are a fact of
life when it comes to math.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning of
any subject, there's

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:84%
going to be a lot of definitions
because we have to have objects

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:90%
we want to talk about.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And we have to have these
unambiguously defined objects.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So it may seem
like there's going

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.320 align:middle line:84%
to be a lot of definitions
now, but this will let up.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And we will start proving
some theorems, which

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.185 align:middle line:90%
are facts, about these objects.

00:10:34.185 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
that we're really after.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
We're not really after
just making up definitions.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Definitions are meant
to be a rigorous way

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
of defining an object we're
interested in studying.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.146 align:middle line:84%
We're interested in proving
theorems, facts about them.

00:10:52.146 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:01.055 align:middle line:84%
So again, a lot of this
is just probably review.

00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
When we describe sets,
we will use these braces

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and maybe list the
elements in here.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Or we will describe
it as x in some set A,

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:90%
satisfying some property P of x.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Or we won't write
this x and A part.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll just write all
objects x satisfying

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.650 align:middle line:84%
x, as being an element of
whatever universe we're in,

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.316 align:middle line:84%
that satisfy
property P of x, OK?

00:11:51.316 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So again, you should read this
as all satisfying property

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:90%
P of x.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:90%
So the basic examples--

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and this is-- you
should expect this

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
after seeing any
non-trivial definition.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
If you were here, I would
ask you to call me out,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:90%
so I'll have to police myself.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But after every
semi-interesting definition,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:90%
you should see examples, OK?

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:84%
This is how you actually
learn about these things,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
or at least digest
what these things are.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
natural numbers, which

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.930 align:middle line:84%
everyone is familiar with
since they started to count--

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:84%
We have the integers, which
is 0, 1, minus 1, 2, minus 2.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So all the natural
numbers, along

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
with their additive inverses,
along with the 0 element,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:84%
an additive identity, we
have the rational numbers.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is written as m over n
such that m and n are integers

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and n does not equal to 0.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And we have R, the real numbers,
which I, as of right now,

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
cannot actually write down
what they are in terms

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:90%
of set-building notation.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this will be our
first goal of the course,

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:84%
is to give a proper description
or definition of what

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:90%
R actually is.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:84%
But you can think of this
as you did in calculus,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:90%
as Q along with--

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
so rationals and irrationals,
like pi and 2 and these things.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is fine to
think about for now.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I didn't
have to use these.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm interested
in odd numbers.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:84%
That's a set of numbers
of the form 2m minus 1,

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:90%
where m is a natural number.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is just 1,
3, 5, and so on, OK?

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And so note that we
have the inclusions.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Natural numbers are contained
in the integers, which

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:84%
are contained in the rational
numbers, which are contained

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:90%
in the real numbers, OK?

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.767 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the history
of why these things were

00:15:03.767 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:84%
thought up in the
first place, I mean,

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:84%
they were thought up to
solve polynomial equations

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't solve in
the number system before.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Integers were created
because I could not

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
solve the equation
x plus 1 equals

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.450 align:middle line:90%
0 in the natural numbers.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Rationals were thought
of because I could not

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
solve the equation 2x plus
1 equals 0 in the integers.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And the real numbers were
thought of because I cannot

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
solve the equation x
squared minus 2 equals 0

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:90%
in the rational numbers.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't solve the equation
x squared plus 1 equals 0

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:84%
in the real numbers,
which led to the creation

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:90%
of complex numbers.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But we will not deal with
complex numbers in this class.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Although hopefully, if you
keep studying analysis,

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
you go on to complex
analysis, which

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:84%
is really a beautiful
subject of study to this day.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:08.615 align:middle line:90%
So as I said--

00:16:08.615 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:90%
let me write this here--

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.662 align:middle line:84%
our first goal, real goal
of the class-- and this

00:16:18.662 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:90%
is something to keep in mind.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
do it right now.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Our first real goal is to
describe what R is, OK?

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we're going to
be proving statements about

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
the real numbers, functions
of real numbers, and limits,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%
whatever-- those limits that
you learned in calculus--

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.748 align:middle line:84%
then we have to be
able to really describe

00:16:49.748 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
what we're starting
with, the real numbers.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.385 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's get back to
sets, to our review of sets.

00:17:00.385 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:90%
So there were some examples.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:90%
We have a few more definitions.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:24.720 align:middle line:84%
The union of two sets, A and
B, is the set which we write--

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:84%
so this is how we
denote it, A U B. This

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.671 align:middle line:90%
is the set of all elements x.

00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:90%
x is in A or x is in B.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:90%
The intersection of A and B--

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.570 align:middle line:90%
so this was defining the union.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:84%
This was defining
the intersection--

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:84%
is the set A cap B. And
this is a set of all

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
x's so that x is
in A and x is in B.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So the union is take
all the things from A,

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
take all the things from
B, and put them together

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:90%
in one big basket.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:84%
The intersection is
just take the things

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.235 align:middle line:90%
that A and B have in common.

00:18:35.235 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:84%
The set difference of
A with respect to B

00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
is the set A
backslash B. This is

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:84%
the set of all
elements in A such

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that x is not in B. The
complement of A is the set A--

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
so this is how I'm
denoting the set.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:84%
The next part is how
I'm defining the set.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:44.601 align:middle line:84%
This is a set of all elements in
our universe that is not in A.

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I say universe, I don't
mean this universe necessarily.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we're
looking at subsets of R,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
the complement is generally
with respect to R.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.085 align:middle line:84%
Or if all of our sets
are subsets of Q,

00:20:03.085 --> 00:20:06.070 align:middle line:84%
then our universe would
be Q, the rationals.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.035 align:middle line:84%
And we're taking the
complement in there.

00:20:08.035 --> 00:20:12.565 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.565 --> 00:20:28.805 align:middle line:84%
Two sets are disjoint if their
intersection is empty, OK?

00:20:28.805 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So it took me quite a
long time to figure out

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.585 align:middle line:84%
this compliment has an E in
the middle as opposed to an I,

00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:84%
as in the compliment
you would give a friend.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I had to do a lot of
spell-checking in my thesis

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:84%
when my advisor
pointed that out.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is just something
to keep in mind.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
This complement has an
E in the middle of it.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.544 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.544 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let me just
draw a quick picture.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So this blob over
here is A. This

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
is a set B. This is a
set C. In fact, let's

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.590 align:middle line:90%
make this a little more--

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's keep C there.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Then what I have here, that's
A intersect B. This bit

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:84%
over here, with the
lines going this way

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:38.280 align:middle line:84%
but not including this, this is
A take away B, A backslash B.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And OK, so that
was not meant to be

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:49.770 align:middle line:84%
along the same direction as
this one, so let's go vertical.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And everything with a vertical
line is A intersect B, OK?

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So A backslash has the
lines going this direction.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:84%
A intersect has the lines
going this direction.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
A union B has the
lines going vertical.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And C is way over here not
touching any of A and B.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So A and C are disjoint
and B and C are disjoint.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.487 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.487 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, they have nothing in common.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this was a
lot of definitions.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
We have not proven a
single statement yet,

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:90%
so it's about time we do.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.300 align:middle line:84%
This is probably one of
the most basic theorems

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.060 align:middle line:84%
one can prove at the start
of a Real Analysis class

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.030 align:middle line:90%
or any class about proofs.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
This is analogous to when you
write your first Hello World

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:90%
program in a programming class.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So let me state the theorem,
which is DeMorgan's Laws.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And the statement
is the following.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:46.455 align:middle line:84%
So if A, B, C are sets, then I
have several things I can say.

00:23:46.455 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.520 align:middle line:84%
The union of B and C,
taking their complement,

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:84%
this is the intersection
of the complements.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So the complement of the
union is the intersection

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:90%
of the compliments.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:84%
If I take their intersection
and take the complement,

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.510 align:middle line:84%
this is the union
of the complements.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So the complement
of the intersection

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:90%
is the union of the complements.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are complements,
meaning I am, in some sense,

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
taking a set difference with
respect to the entire universe.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
But I can make these things
relative to some set A.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So A take away B union
C, this is the same

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
as A take away B intersect A
take away C. Really, again,

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.465 align:middle line:84%
you should think of this
as a special case of one.

00:24:48.465 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Or at least if you were
to write the proof--

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.413 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
because it's all

00:24:56.413 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:84%
going to be contained
in the first two--

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:84%
then you would see it's really
just a proof of this guy.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:12.210 align:middle line:84%
A take away B intersects C
equals A take away B union A

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:90%
take away C, OK?

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So again, for a quick
refresher about logic

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I would look at the
appendix of the textbook.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
In general, so let
me make a few remarks

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.260 align:middle line:84%
before we move on to the
proof about typically

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:90%
how this is going to look.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.480 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.940 align:middle line:90%
So this is some remarks.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Typically, a theorem
is a statement

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:51.770 align:middle line:84%
of the type P implies Q. Let
me write this out in English.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:56.900 align:middle line:84%
If some statement
P holds, then Q--

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
for us, it's if I
have any three sets,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
then I have these equalities
between these operations

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:90%
of sets.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:08.350 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.405 align:middle line:84%
So the general structure
you'll see of the class

00:26:10.405 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:84%
is I have objects which
I define unambiguously.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I want to prove theorems
now, meaning true statements

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.830 align:middle line:90%
about these objects.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And the real meat
is the proof part.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So what is in this
mysterious guy, the proof?

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.575 align:middle line:90%
It's quite simple.

00:26:29.575 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You start with-- you assume P,
meaning what you were given,

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:84%
the hypotheses, the
hypothesis, P, and--

00:26:49.660 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put dots here--
through logic and most

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:84%
definitely, most of the
time some calculations,

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:90%
you arrive at Q is true.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And most proofs are ended
with this little box here, OK?

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So most proofs have
this structure.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:90%
I take my hypotheses.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And these hypotheses
mean something

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
definitions I have given.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And now, I need to use these
unambiguous definitions,

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:84%
along with logic and
maybe some calculations,

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:84%
to conclude that
statement Q is true.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.520 align:middle line:90%
That is the essence of a proof.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:90%
That is all there is to it.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't mean
it's a simple thing

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to do.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the point of this course.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:06.245 align:middle line:84%
But distilled down, that's
what a proof is, OK?

00:28:06.245 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And Q-- so I said P usually
means something in terms

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:90%
of the definitions we have.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But also, Q will usually mean
something in the definitions

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:90%
that we've given.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And so our job is to
verify Q. So let's

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:28.370 align:middle line:90%
go with proving this theorem.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I'm only
going to prove property 1.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Property 2, 3, and 4 I'll
likely put on the homework.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:90%
So let B and C be sets.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, this is the
only hypothesis I get.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to prove
that B union C

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:84%
complement equals
the intersection

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:90%
of the complements.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.680 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:90%
So we want to prove.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:04.483 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- it's quite
helpful, especially

00:29:04.483 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:84%
when you're first
starting to do proofs,

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.100 align:middle line:84%
to write down what you're
actually trying to prove.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So even though I have
this statement here,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.150 align:middle line:84%
it's an equality
between two sets.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Equality between two sets means
something specifically, right?

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.710 align:middle line:90%
We have that in our definition--

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:84%
where is it-- over
there that two sets

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.230 align:middle line:84%
are equal if one is a subset
of the other and vice versa.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we have to prove.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:39.460 align:middle line:84%
We have to prove that the left
side, B union C complement,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.940 align:middle line:84%
is a subset of B complement
intersect C complement and vice

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:90%
versa.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:56.685 align:middle line:84%
So we want to prove that
is a subset of B and--

00:29:56.685 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.512 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the
equality means.

00:30:11.512 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what we have to prove.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to prove those
two statements now, OK?

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's as distilled
down as far as we can go.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.200 align:middle line:90%
So let's prove this.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll prove this
using, again, logic and what

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.040 align:middle line:90%
these things actually are.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's prove this
first statement here.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So I have to show that
every element in this set

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:90%
is an element of this set.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'll even write
this down as WTS.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:90%
That means Want To Show.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.250 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
thing we'll show.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.390 align:middle line:84%
As we go on, I'm
not going to write

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.650 align:middle line:90%
as much as I'm doing right now.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.070 align:middle line:84%
But this is the first theorem
and proof you're seeing,

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:06.470 align:middle line:84%
so I should write
down quite a bit.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
we want to show

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.410 align:middle line:90%
is we have this inclusion, OK?

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.940 align:middle line:84%
That means every element
here is an element here.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So let x be in B
union C complement.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going to
trace what this means.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And we'll eventually
arrive at x as in this.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So then x is not in B
union C. That's just

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:84%
the definition of
the complement.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, x is not in B union C means
x is not in B and x is not in C

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.160 align:middle line:90%
because the union is--

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.160 align:middle line:84%
something's in the
union if it's in B or C.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So something's not in the union
if it's not in B and not in C.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, this implies, simply
again by the definition

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.880 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to
be in the complement,

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
x is in B complement and
x is in C complement.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:90%


00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But this, again, is
simply the definition

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:84%
of x being in B complement
intersect C complement, OK?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So you see, we started off
with an element in this guy

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and we showed that it's also an
element of the right-hand side.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So thus, B union C complement
is contained in B complement

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:54.140 align:middle line:90%
intersect C complement.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.945 align:middle line:84%
Now, we want to do this
other inclusion here.

00:32:56.945 --> 00:33:10.976 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.976 --> 00:33:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is one of those
rare situations where

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.968 align:middle line:84%
you get to essentially
reverse the entire argument

00:33:19.968 --> 00:33:20.885 align:middle line:90%
and get what you want.

00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:25.050 align:middle line:90%


00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:28.965 align:middle line:84%
But let's just go through
it in a linear fashion.

00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's take something from
here and show it's in here.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So let x be in the intersection
of the complements.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Then that means x
is in B complement

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:90%
and x is in C complement.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.790 align:middle line:90%
That means x is not in B--

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.410 align:middle line:90%
so that's this statement.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition of
being in the complement--

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and x is not in
C. That's, again,

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:84%
the definition of being
in the complement.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, just like we used
here in this step,

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.489 align:middle line:90%
this is equivalent to--

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:90%
so really, I should--

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:21.139 align:middle line:84%
in this statement, I
should have written

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.570 align:middle line:84%
this statement is equivalent
to this statement,

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.520 align:middle line:90%
but we'll remove that.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So x is not in B
and x is not in C.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:36.030 align:middle line:84%
This means x is not
in their union, which

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:46.429 align:middle line:84%
implies that x is in the
complement of the union, OK?

00:34:46.429 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So thus, we've proven
is a subset of B.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And since we've
shown both sets are

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.400 align:middle line:84%
a subset of each
other, that means,

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:12.440 align:middle line:84%
by the definition of two sets
being equal, they are equal.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Again, this box
means really nothing.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:84%
It just means that's
the end of the proof.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's move over here.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:54.142 align:middle line:90%


00:35:54.142 --> 00:35:54.850 align:middle line:90%
This is terrible.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:13.175 align:middle line:84%
And not everybody uses that
little box to finish a proof.

00:36:13.175 --> 00:36:15.910 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Some people don't put anything.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.350 align:middle line:84%
When I was in
graduate school, I was

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:25.110 align:middle line:84%
a TA for this guy
named Paul Sally who

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:84%
was a fantastic teacher
and really loved math,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.630 align:middle line:90%
who would end--

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So amazing story about this
guy is, when I was his TA,

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.890 align:middle line:90%
he was in his 70s, I think.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:47.170 align:middle line:90%
But he had also had diabetes.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So he had lost both of his
legs beneath his knees.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:90%
He was also legally blind.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.260 align:middle line:90%
And he had a patch over one eye.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So he himself often
referred to himself

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:90%
as the a pirate mathematician.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But he would end
his proofs with--

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.160 align:middle line:84%
at least in his
textbook-- he didn't

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.260 align:middle line:84%
ask me to do this on
the board, thankfully.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
He would end his proofs
with a picture of himself

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.800 align:middle line:84%
with this cob pipe
that he had, very much

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:90%
in the pirate fashion.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, OK, moving on from
things that end proofs,

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:45.070 align:middle line:84%
let's go on to a next
subject, induction.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So induction is a way to prove
theorems about natural numbers,

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:01.800 align:middle line:84%
The theorem itself is
more of a tool rather

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:07.260 align:middle line:84%
than an interesting
fact on its own, OK?

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.088 align:middle line:90%
So let me state the theorem.

00:38:10.088 --> 00:38:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go over
a couple of examples

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.530 align:middle line:90%
on how to use induction.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:20.940 align:middle line:90%
So let me recall from--

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.650 align:middle line:90%
I think I just erased it.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.000 align:middle line:90%
N is the natural numbers.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And it has an
ordering, meaning--

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:84%
so we'll precisely define
what ordering means.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But just in your head, this
means the usual thing--

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.215 align:middle line:84%
1 is less than 2 is less
than 3 is less than 4.

00:38:42.215 --> 00:38:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So a property of
the natural numbers,

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:56.550 align:middle line:84%
which will take as an axiom,
is the well-ordering property.

00:38:56.550 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So an axiom is not
something you prove.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.830 align:middle line:84%
You assume this
about the objects

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that you've defined or are
studying up to this point.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the statement
is if I take

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:33.930 align:middle line:84%
a subset of natural
numbers, which is non-empty,

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:44.100 align:middle line:84%
then S has a least element
or smallest element.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does this mean?

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Let me write this
last statement out.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:51.360 align:middle line:90%
i.e.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.502 align:middle line:90%
There exists an x in S--

00:39:56.502 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:84%
"st" I will often write,
meaning such that or so that--

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:84%
such that x is less than or
equal to y for all y in S, OK?

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So every non-empty subset
of the natural numbers

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.720 align:middle line:90%
has a smallest element, OK?

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.030 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
that as an axiom,

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.240 align:middle line:84%
as just a property of the
natural numbers, which

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:90%
we'll assume.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, using this axiom,
we're going to prove--

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:36.200 align:middle line:84%
it's not really often
you hear it called

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.780 align:middle line:84%
as a principle of
mathematical induction,

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.870 align:middle line:84%
but this will state it as a
theorem instead of a principle,

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.700 align:middle line:84%
whatever a principle
is supposed to be.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:41:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So induction, so this
is due to Pascal.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Or at least in its first
rigorous formulation

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:26.940 align:middle line:84%
is let Pn be a statement
depending on natural number n.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so maybe we
have some equality

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:84%
between two quantities that
involves a natural number n,

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:37.020 align:middle line:84%
That could be our
statement P of n.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're going to assume--

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.550 align:middle line:84%
so what are our hypotheses
about this statement?

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.470 align:middle line:90%
What's our if?

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Assume that this statement
satisfies two properties.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:55.665 align:middle line:84%
This first property is usually
referred to as a base case.

00:41:55.665 --> 00:42:01.200 align:middle line:90%


00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.640 align:middle line:90%
That is that P of 1 is true.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.845 align:middle line:84%
And the second property is
called the inductive step.

00:42:10.845 --> 00:42:18.350 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So this statement satisfies
the following property

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that if you assume
P of m is true,

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.950 align:middle line:84%
then you can prove that
P of m plus 1 is true.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:39.140 align:middle line:90%


00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So I have a statement
which satisfies

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.630 align:middle line:90%
both of these properties, OK?

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.145 align:middle line:84%
In particular, since I'm
assuming P of 1 is true,

00:42:47.145 --> 00:42:50.500 align:middle line:84%
by the second property,
P of 2 is true.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And then again by the second
property, P of 3 is true.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And then P of 4,
and then P of 5.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And so if you followed that
last line of reasoning,

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.740 align:middle line:84%
this means you should
be able to guess

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.010 align:middle line:84%
what the conclusion
of this theorem is.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Then P n is true for
all natural numbers, OK?

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:26.540 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we're going to
use the well-ordering property

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.940 align:middle line:84%
of the natural numbers
to prove this theorem

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.710 align:middle line:90%
about the induction.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we have our assumptions.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to--
although, I said over

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.110 align:middle line:84%
there let B, C be
sets, I'm not going

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to rewrite the assumptions that
we have about our statement

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.520 align:middle line:84%
P. We're just going to
start trying to prove P of n

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.870 align:middle line:90%
is true for all n.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So let me write our conclusion
slightly differently.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.200 align:middle line:90%


00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Let S be the set of all natural
numbers such that P of n

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:17.310 align:middle line:90%
is not true.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to show is
that P of n is true for all n.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's equivalent
to saying we want

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:34.960 align:middle line:90%
to show that S is empty, OK?

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.940 align:middle line:84%
The set of natural numbers
where P of n is not true,

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:38.710 align:middle line:90%
this is empty.

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:84%
This is equivalent to saying
P of n is true for all n.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And the way we're
going to do this

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:57.600 align:middle line:84%
is another staple of
mathematical proofs

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:12.880 align:middle line:84%
is trying to prove this
by contradiction, OK?

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.830 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Let me make a few comments
about what that means,

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.690 align:middle line:90%
proof by a contradiction.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:46:01.760 align:middle line:90%


00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in a proof
by contradiction--

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.420 align:middle line:84%
so this is-- what I'm
about to write down

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.980 align:middle line:90%
is not part of the proof.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.735 align:middle line:84%
This is commentary not to
be included in the proof.

00:46:13.735 --> 00:46:16.430 align:middle line:90%


00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.290 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
to say we're going

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:23.180 align:middle line:84%
to prove S is equal to the
empty set by contradiction?

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:28.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to assume that
the statement we want to prove

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:29.600 align:middle line:90%
is false.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Or not false, but
we want to assume

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that the negation of the
statement we want to prove

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:43.170 align:middle line:84%
is true and then arrive
at a false statement, OK?

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:46.740 align:middle line:90%
So we want to assume--

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.593 align:middle line:90%
this is what we're going to do.

00:46:48.593 --> 00:46:50.010 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
assume the negation

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:84%
of the statement we
want to prove-- namely,

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:58.850 align:middle line:90%
S is non-empty, OK?

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And from this, we want to
derive a false statement, OK?

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:17.710 align:middle line:90%


00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And so if we are to do-- if we
were able to do that, then--

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:27.490 align:middle line:84%
let me just say, again, you
can check in the appendix

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:34.210 align:middle line:84%
or you can just believe
me that the rules of logic

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:48.340 align:middle line:84%
then say that our initial
assumption, that S was not

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:52.680 align:middle line:84%
empty, is false
to begin with, OK?

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So rules of logic, meaning
I cannot start from a true

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:02.130 align:middle line:84%
assumption and derive, in
a logically consistent way,

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:06.630 align:middle line:90%
a false statement, OK?

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:09.630 align:middle line:84%
That is, if we believe that
the rules of logic we're using

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:19.070 align:middle line:84%
are consistent, which that's a
little bit hairy to talk about.

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But for our purposes
of our class,

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:28.340 align:middle line:84%
you can believe me that
the rules of logic we use--

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.590 align:middle line:84%
or at least accept
that the rules

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of logic we're going to use
are consistent and sound.

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, so back to
the proof at hand.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.770 align:middle line:84%
We have this set
of natural numbers

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.520 align:middle line:90%
where the statement is not true.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.103 align:middle line:90%
We want to show it is empty.

00:48:46.103 --> 00:48:48.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do it by
contradiction, meaning

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.450 align:middle line:84%
we're going to assume the
negation of the statement

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:51.350 align:middle line:90%
we want to prove--

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:53.000 align:middle line:90%
namely, S is non-empty.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
derive a false statement

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:58.790 align:middle line:90%
from that assumption, OK?

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:00.170 align:middle line:90%
And by the rules of logic--

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:02.360 align:middle line:84%
that means that our
initial assumption--

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.970 align:middle line:90%
that S is non-empty--

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:09.360 align:middle line:90%
is, in fact, false, OK?

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:16.450 align:middle line:84%
All right, so towards
a contradiction,

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:21.220 align:middle line:90%
suppose that S is non-empty, OK?

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to use
the well-ordering property

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.540 align:middle line:90%
of the natural numbers.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:37.870 align:middle line:84%
By the well-ordering property
of the natural numbers,

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:48.190 align:middle line:90%
S has a least element, x, OK?

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:52.100 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do we know about x?

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.510 align:middle line:90%
So first off, x cannot be 1, OK?

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.970 align:middle line:84%
S is a set where this
property does not hold.

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:90%
x cannot be 1 because--

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:84%
let me again rewrite this fact
that S has the least element.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Let me just reiterate that S has
a least element in the set, OK?

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, x cannot be 1 because
we're assuming the base case,

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:24.700 align:middle line:90%
meaning P of 1 is true.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So since P of 1 is true,
that means 1 is not

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:39.750 align:middle line:90%
an S, which means x is not 1.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:45.052 align:middle line:90%


00:50:45.052 --> 00:50:47.580 align:middle line:84%
In particular, x must
be bigger than 1.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So x is some magical natural
number out there bigger than 1

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:56.990 align:middle line:84%
that's the least
element of this set S.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:09.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, since x is the
least element of S--

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.140 align:middle line:90%
so let me draw.

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.520 align:middle line:84%
On the number line,
we have 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Out there is some
magic point x, which

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:25.600 align:middle line:84%
is the least element of S.
And the rest of the subset S

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:30.790 align:middle line:84%
lies to the right of
this number x, right?

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
least element of S.

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, x minus
1 cannot be in S.

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So since x is the least element
of S and x minus 1 is less than

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:56.350 align:middle line:84%
x, this means that x minus
1 is not in S. Otherwise,

00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:05.220 align:middle line:84%
it would be a smaller
element than x in S. So thus,

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:08.640 align:middle line:84%
what does it mean
to not be in S?

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It means that P of
x minus 1 is true.

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:15.296 align:middle line:90%


00:52:15.296 --> 00:52:20.400 align:middle line:84%
By the definition of S,
this means P of x minus 1

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:25.040 align:middle line:90%
is true, OK?

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.560 align:middle line:90%


00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But by the second property we're
assuming about our statement P,

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:44.120 align:middle line:84%
this means that the next guy
in line, x minus 1 plus 1,

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:58.650 align:middle line:84%
is true, which is just x, which
means that x is not in S, OK?

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So from the assumption--
so let me just recap.

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:06.390 align:middle line:84%
From the assumption
that S is non-empty,

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.640 align:middle line:90%
we've derived two facts.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:16.380 align:middle line:84%
1, x has the least element in
S. And that element is also not

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.670 align:middle line:90%
in S.

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So written out,
we've concluded there

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:41.840 align:middle line:84%
exists a natural number which
is both in S and not in S.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.030 align:middle line:90%
And this is a false statement.

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have an object and
member that's both in the set

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:53.070 align:middle line:90%
and not in the set, OK?

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
contradiction arguments,

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I'll usually put two
arrows hitting each other.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's a contradiction.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, our initial
assumption that S is non-empty

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.455 align:middle line:90%
has to be false.

00:54:04.455 --> 00:54:10.480 align:middle line:90%


00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, S is
the empty set, OK?

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So I encourage you to
go through that proof

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:24.540 align:middle line:84%
a little slowly because
maybe you got turned around

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:30.940 align:middle line:84%
by taking the complements
or the general scheme of how

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:33.810 align:middle line:90%
a proof by contradiction works.

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But don't spend too much time
on it because, as I've said,

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.860 align:middle line:84%
this theorem itself and its
proof are not the thing we're

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:44.820 align:middle line:90%
really interested in.

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Or at least, it's not
the most interesting.

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a tool
that we'll use to prove

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.620 align:middle line:90%
more interesting statements.

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how do we actually
use this theorem, induction,

00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:59.210 align:middle line:90%
to prove other statements?

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I should
include this here.

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:06.130 align:middle line:84%
This falls under the
umbrella of logic,

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.227 align:middle line:84%
meaning we're going
to approve previous--

00:55:08.227 --> 00:55:10.060 align:middle line:84%
we're going to use
previous statements we've

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:13.060 align:middle line:90%
proven to prove new statements.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.075 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so how do we
use induction in practice?

00:55:16.075 --> 00:55:27.340 align:middle line:90%


00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to
prove some statement--

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:39.480 align:middle line:90%


00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.610 align:middle line:90%
for all n, Pn is true--

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:47.730 align:middle line:84%
in the print then, this
theorem about induction--

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:49.710 align:middle line:84%
this theorem of
induction-- tells us

00:55:49.710 --> 00:56:02.280 align:middle line:84%
we just have to
do two things, OK?

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:08.230 align:middle line:90%
We have to prove the base case.

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is usually easy.

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:12.530 align:middle line:90%


00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:14.560 align:middle line:84%
You just stick the number
1 into the statement

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.120 align:middle line:90%
that you want to prove.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:21.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end of the story.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:27.600 align:middle line:90%


00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.950 align:middle line:90%
And the second step is usually--

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:30.450 align:middle line:84%
or the second thing
we have to prove

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:33.450 align:middle line:84%
is the more involved
part, which is

00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:50.400 align:middle line:84%
we have to prove that the
statement that if PM is true,

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:56.580 align:middle line:90%
then P of m plus 1 is true, OK?

00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.040 align:middle line:84%
If we want to do a
proof by induction,

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.540 align:middle line:84%
there's two smaller
proofs we have to do.

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:04.170 align:middle line:84%
First, we have to
prove P of 1 is true.

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to
prove this statement.

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:09.540 align:middle line:90%
If P of m, then P of m plus 1.

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is usually
referred to as the base case.

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:16.580 align:middle line:90%
This is the inductive step.

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:19.135 align:middle line:84%
So let's try and
actually do this.

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:29.850 align:middle line:90%


00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:39.970 align:middle line:84%
All right, so-- so another
question I get at the beginning

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:42.460 align:middle line:84%
of a course, especially
about proofs--

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:45.387 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of
uncertainty about what you

00:57:45.387 --> 00:57:47.470 align:middle line:84%
can assume is true, what
can you use, what can you

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:51.820 align:middle line:84%
not use, right now,
at this point, you

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:57.040 align:middle line:84%
can use whatever
you know about any

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.460 align:middle line:84%
of the algebraic properties,
you know about the real numbers,

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.860 align:middle line:90%
the rational numbers--

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and by algebraic properties,
I mean if a plus b equals

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.510 align:middle line:84%
c, then a plus b times
d equals c times d--

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and what you know
about inequalities.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go much
more in depth into ordering,

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:27.090 align:middle line:84%
which is what
inequality is a part of.

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But you can use
all the properties

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:33.420 align:middle line:84%
you know about solving
inequalities or manipulating

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:37.530 align:middle line:84%
inequalities, meaning if I
have one number is less than

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:39.780 align:middle line:84%
or equal to another number,
then when I multiply

00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.300 align:middle line:84%
both sides by a
positive number, that

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.600 align:middle line:90%
doesn't change the inequality.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So you can use all of
these algebraic properties

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:55.890 align:middle line:84%
of rationals and real
numbers from here on out.

00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so we're going to be
proving things about calculus.

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So you certainly cannot use
anything about continuity,

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:07.060 align:middle line:84%
differentiation, or
anything like that.

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But for now, you can use all the
algebraic properties you know.

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So the first statement
we're going to try and prove

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:24.740 align:middle line:84%
using induction is the statement
that for all c not equal

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:30.650 align:middle line:84%
to 1, for all n, a
natural number, 1

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:37.820 align:middle line:84%
plus c plus c squared plus c to
the n equals 1 minus c to the n

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:41.510 align:middle line:90%
plus 1 over 1 minus c, OK?

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So this here is our
statement P of n.

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:53.036 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
natural number n, OK?

00:59:53.036 --> 00:59:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do this by
induction, which means we're

00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:59.618 align:middle line:90%
going to do those two things.

00:59:59.618 --> 01:00:01.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to prove
the base case, P of 1,

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:02.710 align:middle line:90%
which I said is easy.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
prove the second case,

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.470 align:middle line:84%
the second property, the
inductive step, which

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:12.150 align:middle line:84%
is a little more involved,
but not so much involved,

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.860 align:middle line:90%
at least in the beginning.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So let me call this
inequality star.

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:27.140 align:middle line:90%


01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to prove
star by induction.

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So first, we will
do the base case.

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:41.120 align:middle line:90%


01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, the
base case is usually you

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:50.460 align:middle line:84%
just plug in n equals 1 and
verify that P of n is true.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:53.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do.

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
1 plus c to the 1, which is the
left-hand side, does, in fact,

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
equal 1 minus c to the 1 plus
1 over 1 minus c because this

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.885 align:middle line:90%
right-hand side--

01:01:05.885 --> 01:01:11.390 align:middle line:90%


01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
1 minus c squared is 1
minus c times 1 plus c--

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.880 align:middle line:90%


01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.050 align:middle line:90%
the 1 minus c's cancel.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.870 align:middle line:90%


01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the base case
is proven, all right?

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:31.120 align:middle line:90%


01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do the
inductive step, OK?

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to assume that
star holds for n equals m

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:48.430 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to assume P of m.

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So assume that 1 plus
c plus c to the m

01:01:57.090 --> 01:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
equals 1 minus c
over 1 minus c, OK?

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, we want to show--

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.330 align:middle line:84%
again, let's write out what we
want to do, what's our plan.

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:15.004 align:middle line:90%


01:02:15.004 --> 01:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
We want to prove that this
equality, that this line

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:33.690 align:middle line:84%
star holds for n
equals m plus 1, OK?

01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So again, what I
wrote here, this

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:47.370 align:middle line:84%
is basically star
for n equals m, OK?

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And let me call this
second inequality--

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:53.310 align:middle line:90%
the second equality 2 star.

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is my assumption
for m, n equals m.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.690 align:middle line:90%


01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's take the left side
for n equals m plus 1 and see

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:15.630 align:middle line:84%
if we cannot massage it to
get the right-hand side for--

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I should say the right-hand
side for n equals m plus 1.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:23.700 align:middle line:90%


01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.630 align:middle line:90%
So here is the calculation part.

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have 1 plus c plus c to
the m plus c to the m plus 1.

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the m plus 1 case of
the left-hand side of star,

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
which we want to
show is to the--

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the n equals n plus
1 case of the right-hand side.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is equal to--

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:53.620 align:middle line:84%
now, we already know what this
is equal to by our assumption.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
This is by the second
star there, which

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:middle line:90%
is what we're assuming is true.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to 1
minus c n plus 1 over 1

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:12.340 align:middle line:90%
minus c plus cm plus 1.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we just do
a little bit of algebra.

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:18.080 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to
1 over 1 minus c

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
m plus 1 plus c m plus 1 minus
c m plus 2 over 1 minus c.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Those cancel and I'm left with
1 minus c to the m plus 2.

01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'll write it just so that
you can see this is really

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:39.910 align:middle line:90%
the m plus 1 case, all right?

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:46.100 align:middle line:90%


01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So again, we arrived
at this first step

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
by our assumption, the
second starred equation, OK?

01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:00.660 align:middle line:90%


01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So thus, star holds
for n equals m plus 1.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So by induction-- or really,
I should say the theorem

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.635 align:middle line:90%
of induction that we proved--

01:05:18.635 --> 01:05:23.660 align:middle line:90%


01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:29.840 align:middle line:84%
our equality between those two
objects, or two expressions,

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:38.910 align:middle line:90%
is valid for all n, OK?

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:58.390 align:middle line:90%


01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:50.980 align:middle line:90%


01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's do one more
example of using induction.

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's prove if C is
a real number bigger

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:16.135 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to minus
1, then for all n,

01:07:16.135 --> 01:07:22.340 align:middle line:84%
a natural number,
1 plus c to the n

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:30.240 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal
to 1 plus n times c, OK?

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.830 align:middle line:90%


01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:37.780 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we're going to
do this by induction again.

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.568 align:middle line:84%
That means we need to
prove the base case

01:07:39.568 --> 01:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and we need to do
the inductive step.

01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:43.710 align:middle line:90%


01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:46.160 align:middle line:90%
So base case, as always, will--

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%
so this is just right here.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
this by induction.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see,
the base case is,

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
again, n equals 1 is clear
just by looking at it.

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:12.200 align:middle line:84%
1 plus c to the 1, in fact,
equals 1 plus 1 times c.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's certainly bigger than
or equal to 1 plus n times c.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the last
stars I'll use for this lecture.

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So our statement, our
inequality star star star,

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.985 align:middle line:90%
holds for n equals 1.

01:08:40.985 --> 01:08:42.859 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's
our base case.

01:08:42.859 --> 01:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to assume
that this inequality holds

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:49.939 align:middle line:84%
for n equals m and
try to prove that it

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:51.484 align:middle line:90%
holds for n equals m plus 1.

01:08:51.484 --> 01:08:59.390 align:middle line:90%


01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're assuming
this when n equals m.

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So 1 plus c to the m is bigger
than or equal to 1 plus m times

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:15.270 align:middle line:90%
c.

01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And we want to prove
this inequality with n

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:21.390 align:middle line:90%
equal to m plus 1.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:26.859 align:middle line:84%
And we're just
assuming this guy, OK?

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get the statement
for n equals m plus 1.

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:34.760 align:middle line:84%
One way to do that
is this left side.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.130 align:middle line:90%
I want to get--

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
let's look at the n
equals m plus 1 side

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.660 align:middle line:90%
and see what we can do with it.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:47.109 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is a
calculation part and logic.

01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have 1 plus
c to the m plus 1.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's the n equals
m plus 1 side of this.

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.220 align:middle line:90%


01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:03.920 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to 1 plus c
times 1 plus c to the m.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're assuming,
again, this inequality.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.230 align:middle line:90%
This is the n equals m case.

01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:10.620 align:middle line:90%
So we can use it.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.810 align:middle line:90%
So we're assuming it.

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:13.820 align:middle line:90%
We use it.

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And since C is bigger than
or equal to minus 1, 1 plus C

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:18.790 align:middle line:90%
is non-negative.

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So this thing is bigger
than or equal to this thing.

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So if I multiply both
sides by 1 plus c,

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.820 align:middle line:90%
I preserve the inequality.

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is bigger than or
equal to 1 plus mc, OK?

01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, this just follows from
essentially the assumption

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
multiplied through
by 1 plus c, OK?

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:49.800 align:middle line:90%


01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm going
to finagle this.

01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:57.690 align:middle line:90%
So let me just--

01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:01.660 align:middle line:90%


01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing anything
different here.

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
rewrite this over

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:12.700 align:middle line:84%
here so that I can have
a chain of inequality.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So I have 1 plus c to the m plus
1 is greater than or equal to 1

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:20.760 align:middle line:90%
plus c 1 plus mc.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now, this is
bigger than or equal to this.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And this here-- so
when I write equal,

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I do not mean that
this left side is now

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.310 align:middle line:84%
equal to what I'm
about to write here.

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
That means the previous thing on
here is equal to what I'm about

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:46.250 align:middle line:84%
to write here, OK/ this is a
typical fashion and writing

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
down inequalities--
or I guess, practice.

01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:51.650 align:middle line:90%
So this is equal to 1--

01:11:51.650 --> 01:11:54.440 align:middle line:90%
so just doing the algebra--

01:11:54.440 --> 01:12:01.760 align:middle line:84%
m plus 1 times c plus
m times c squared, OK?

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:07.925 align:middle line:84%
Now, this part is exactly the
n equals m plus 1 side of this.

01:12:07.925 --> 01:12:10.470 align:middle line:90%


01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And I have a little room
to give because now this

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:17.130 align:middle line:84%
is plus something
that's non-negative.

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:21.930 align:middle line:90%


01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
rewrite this again.

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:27.840 align:middle line:84%
This means that 1
plus c to the m plus 1

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.880 align:middle line:84%
is greater than or
equal to 1 plus--

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:34.910 align:middle line:90%


01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:37.490 align:middle line:84%
so again, I'm kind of
writing a lot here.

01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I will stop writing as
much as the course goes on.

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:44.308 align:middle line:90%


01:12:44.308 --> 01:12:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But I encourage you,
especially in the beginning,

01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
to write all the
steps and logic, OK?

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'm not
rewriting anything.

01:12:56.530 --> 01:13:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm just summarizing
what I've done here.

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, this right-hand side--
so I have this as bigger than

01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:05.080 align:middle line:90%
or equal to this.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And this right-hand
side, since I

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.820 align:middle line:84%
have a number plus
something non-negative,

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:12.550 align:middle line:84%
m times c squared--
m's a natural number.

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
This is bigger than or
equal to 1 m plus 1 times c.

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:22.250 align:middle line:90%


01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Thus, 1 plus c to the m plus
1 is greater than or equal to,

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
which is the n
equals n plus 1 case.

01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:46.540 align:middle line:90%


01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So by induction, this inequality
triple star holds for all n.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:13.720 align:middle line:90%


01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.390 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:22.000 align:middle line:90%

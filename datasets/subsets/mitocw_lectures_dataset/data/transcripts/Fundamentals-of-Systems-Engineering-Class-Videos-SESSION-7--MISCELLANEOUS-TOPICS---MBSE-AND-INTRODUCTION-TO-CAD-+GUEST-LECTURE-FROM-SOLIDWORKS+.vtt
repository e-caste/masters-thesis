00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.000
OLIVIER DE WECK: Seven
miscellaneous topics, and you

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.700
may be wondering,
well, what are those?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.720
So I'd like to start with
a general status update,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.610
and then we'll go
over the master

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.390
solution for the online quiz
that you took this week.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.050
And then, I think,
in about 10 minutes,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.020
we're going to have an
interactive discussion

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.210
with the INCOSE
board of directors.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.300
And so, we'll probably not get
through all the master solution

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.970
discussion by the time they
dial in, and that's OK.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.844
You know, we'll just have a
15, 20 minute chat with them.

00:01:01.844 --> 00:01:03.760
The reason we're doing
this is because they're

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.950
at MIT right now for
a three day meeting,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.110
so INCOSE's the
International National

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.180
Council of System Engineering.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.760
And so we thought it would be
a nice thing since, you know,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.090
this is a systems engineering
class, to tie in with them

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.160
and hear a little bit
of their perspective

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.270
on what's happening in
industry and in, sort of,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.140
the bigger picture.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.690
And hopefully, some
of you have got

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.760
a couple of questions
prepared, so we can have

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.080
sort of a dialogue with them.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.280
That's the general idea.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.400
And then we have a
presentation prepared.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.240
The Octanis I project will be
presented from EPFL, to us,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.440
and I think you'll
find it very exciting.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.010
And so, as we listen
to that presentation,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.500
put on your system
engineering thinking hat,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.090
and then hopefully we'll have
time for discussion as well.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.040
Let me just remind
you briefly where we

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.260
stand in terms of the class--

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.030
in the V-Model, in particular.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.260
We made great progress,
and we've essentially

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.530
covered the whole
left side, the bottom.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.780
And what we'll do
starting next week,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.789
is really climb up
on the right side.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.790
So next week's topic
is System Integration

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.590
and Interface Management.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.220
Then we'll cover Verification
Validation, Commissioning

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.250
and Operations.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.085
And then our final
official lecture

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:23.050
is Lifecycle Management.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.660
We do have a 12th lecture on
Prototyping and Manufacturing.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.760
That window is
optional because this

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.120
is after the official
end of classes at MIT.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.490
So you're not expected
to participate,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.860
but you're invited to.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.620
So basically, the focus
in the next month or so

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.952
is covering the right side of V.

00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:49.700
So let me start talking
about the midterm exam.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.120
And we'll sort of go
question by question,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.580
and please stop me if you have
any comments or questions.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.240
Let's make this interactive.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.830
So question one, if a complex
electromechanical system has

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.810
1,850 individual part numbers--
this is at the lowest level--

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.440
how many levels do you expect
the drawing tree to have?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.230
Everybody provided the
same answer, four, right?

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.170
This is basically a
straight application

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.230
of the magic number seven rule.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.700
And in practice, not
everybody will go exactly

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.420
for four levels, but
that's the basic idea.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.750
If you decompose the system with
this human cognitive bandwidth

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.830
in mind, for a system of
that level of complexity,

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.100
you should expect, roughly,
a four layer decomposition.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.630
So I'm very pleased that
everybody got this answer.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.830
But with the caveat
that there may

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.660
be deviations from
this rule, and you

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.050
can go for a flatter
tree with fewer levels.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.840
But you have to be aware
of the implications

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.890
that that may have.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.560
OK, so that's great.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.100
The next question was--

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.170
OK, so you're attending
a cocktail party--

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.590
and cocktail parties, I don't
think that's-- that maybe

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.940
that's very 20th century.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.300
I don't think we have cocktail
parties anymore, so maybe more

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.260
like a Google Hangout or
the 21st century equivalent.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.840
But the basic idea
here is, how would you

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.910
explain what system
engineering is

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.780
to somebody who is not
a technical person, not

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.130
an engineer?

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.510
And I think most of you--

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.770
I looked through all the
answers, and most of you

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.760
basically provided a definition
of system engineering

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.680
that we would use in
this class, right.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.720
So it was like, OK, well, not
quite what I was looking for

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.730
but not incorrect.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.980
So I pulled out two
examples that I kind of

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.840
liked because they brought in
analogies from other fields

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.910
as to what system
engineering is.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.720
So the first one here is, OK,
so system engineering represents

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.400
a method but also a mindset
that enables the design and so

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.510
forth of successful systems,
but systems engineering

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.030
is like cooking
a delicious cake.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.934
OK, so it's like cooking
a delicious recipe.

00:05:19.934 --> 00:05:21.850
You've got your ingredients
which is your part

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.042
numbers, or your parts, right?

00:05:25.042 --> 00:05:29.040
You have a process
that you're following.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.860
And at the end of it you
should have something special,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.140
something delicious,
something wholesome,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.100
something that is greater
than the sum of the parts.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.960
I don't know if any of you
watch the Food Channel?

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.170
Anybody watching the
Food Network here?

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.250
Yeah?

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.970
OK.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.160
We actually like to watch it.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.540
It's kind of fun.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.130
And what's fun is when you give
the same ingredients to, like,

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.750
half a dozen different people--

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.320
and same ingredients,
same amount of time,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.150
and the result that comes out
of it is vastly different.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.900
Now, why is that?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.790
Of course, you can say
skills and so forth,

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.950
but it is fundamentally,
because those ingredients--

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.280
that details matter.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.450
The way in which the
ingredients get combined.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.960
And you know, did you
use the right heat?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.040
Did you did you take
it off the heat?

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.780
30 seconds too soon or too
late, those little details

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.590
make a huge difference
to the final product, OK.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.850
And that's what I think what's
cool about the Food Network

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.820
and cooking in general.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.530
Cuisine, it's an art.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.410
It's not just follow the recipe.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.070
And so, I think that's
a great analogy.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.520
I like that.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.680
And then the other one is--

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.750
so you're talking
to Cher, the singer,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.260
and explain to her that system
engineering is like a concert.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.610
So in a concert you have
all your specialists, right?

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.200
You have your choir maybe.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.390
You have your strings section.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.370
You have your trumpets.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.230
And I think it's
kind of similar.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.020
You could have great
individual musicians,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.450
but if the conductor is not
bringing everybody into harmony

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.340
then you get a cacophony.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.120
It's not a great result.
So a great orchestra

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.950
is not just a bunch of
great individual musicians,

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.500
but it's the idea that
you're orchestrating--

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.050
there's something
special that emerges

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.860
if you synchronize everybody in
a way-- and you motivate them,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.740
and you synchronize them,
and something really special

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.230
happens.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.630
I think that's another
great sort of example

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.360
of what we mean by
system engineering

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.130
in the technical world.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.610
This idea of a conductor
bringing everybody in harmony,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.930
and the end result is
something really special.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.550
That's a little bit what I was
looking for in this answer,

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.050
and I like both
of these examples.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.680
The third question
was about the V-Model.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.670
And I think, based on what I
looked through the answers,

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.370
I think most people
really understood that.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.900
And just to summarize, again,
in a very, very simple way what

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.640
the V-Model is all
about-- so here's

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.390
the V. If you wanted
to really simplify it,

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.330
we start at the upper
left with a vision.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.000
You know, what is it that
we're trying to accomplish?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.100
And that's where you
need to understand,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.580
who's the stakeholder,
who are the customers,

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.780
the thing that you're about
to create doesn't exist yet.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.480
In some projects you actually
start with an initial system,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.410
and you need to improve it.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.780
So you're starting with
generation N of a product,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.770
and the goal is to create
generation N plus 1, which is

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.910
better in several dimensions.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.850
So that's possible,
but let's just

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.640
say we have a clean
sheet situation.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.240
And you have a vision
that you're developing.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.610
And then you [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.316
TINA: Hi, Ollie, is that you?

00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:12.970
OLIVIER DE WECK: Aha, OK.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.580
TINA: All right, you are
now connected on speaker

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.830
with the INCOSE
Board of Directors.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.850
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Fantastic, can you hear me?

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.630
GUEST SPEAKER: No.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.190
TINA: Yes, we can.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.840
GUEST SPEAKER: Loud and clear.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.910
OLIVIER DE WECK: All
right, this is great.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:32.970
So I was just going over the
midterm exam that we just had,

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:39.870
and so I will stop doing that
because we're very glad that we

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.760
can spend time with you.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.130
So let's make this
bigger on our end.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.230
And do you have a camera
on your end, Tina?

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.330
DAVID: Let's say no because
of the demographics here,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.770
so we'll have to
go on voice, Ollie.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.840
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
Tina, can we see you?

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.375
Can we see one of you at least?

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.538
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.702
[INAUDIBLE] can stand
there at look presidential.

00:10:20.702 --> 00:10:22.160
GUEST SPEAKER:
We're working on it.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.760
TINA: How about I figure it
out while you give the intro?

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.593
DAVID: There you go.

00:10:25.593 --> 00:10:28.211
Thank you, Tina.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.570
GUEST SPEAKER: Multi-task.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.950
OLIVIER DE WECK: It
would be helpful to see

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:31.991
at least who is speaking.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.360
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:10:54.304 --> 00:10:55.970
DAVID: I know, we've
got a problem here.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.570
TINA: All right, you
stand over there.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.023
I'll point this to you.

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:03.460
DAVID: Well, shall we go ahead
and kick off here, Ollie?

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.710
I know your time is valuable.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.570
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.660
Ryan can we make
the INCOSE Board

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.860
of Directors the
main screen here?

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.480
Just give me one
second on our end.

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:37.370
GUEST SPEAKER: Ollie,
can I suggest we just

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.300
press ahead despite the desire
to see David's shiny face?

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.730
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.640
All right, so David, it's
great to talk to you.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.990
So let me just give you a
little bit of background here.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.800
We have about 20
students here at MIT.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.930
Currently, we're
taking the Fundamentals

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.660
of Systems Engineering class.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.130
We're roughly midterm, a
little bit past the midterm.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.780
And then we have about 20
students, maybe 15 students,

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.660
and staff at EPFL
in Switzerland,

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.930
and we're teaching this class
in the form of the SPOC, Small

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.000
Private Online Course.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.850
And so, welcome to MIT, to
the INCOSE Board of Directors.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.760
I know you've already had
very productive times.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.630
And we're really excited to
hear from you as to not just

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.420
what is INCOSE, but
where do you see

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.990
Systems Engineering as a field
of study and practice stand.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.480
You know, what are the
exciting things happening?

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.090
What are the challenges?

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.480
And whatever you would
choose to share with us.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.200
So, David.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.250
DAVID: Very good.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.070
Thanks, Ollie.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.340
And thank you for making
the time available.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.690
It is always great to talk
with the next generation.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.220
I'll give you just a
few comments up front

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.080
and then really open it up.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.540
For those who aren't
familiar with INCOSE,

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.550
it's the International Council
on Systems Engineering.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.830
It's about 25 years old, about
10,000 members worldwide.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.200
And the value of
INCOSE, fundamentally,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.760
is to serve as a connector
across the systems community,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.490
across organizational
boundaries,

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.580
across geographic boundaries,
so that we can connect

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.270
the practice in the US to
Europe to Asia and beyond--

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.010
they are applied differently--

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.700
and across domain boundaries,
from military and aerospace,

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.900
where we have our foundation,
to automotive to medical devices

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.790
and beyond.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.730
If you look at it as
systems engineers,

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.950
that's perhaps the most exciting
thing of what's going on.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.350
If you look at how complexity
continues to emerge and grow,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.200
the problems that we are
being asked to tackle,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.330
the technologies
at our disposal,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.290
the opportunities for
wonderful outcomes,

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.000
the dangers and risks of
unintended consequences--

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.070
the challenges that
the world faces are,

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.810
absolutely, System's challenges.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.380
And they are far beyond
the traditional aerospace

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.510
and defense domain.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.480
They are everywhere.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.730
I was with GM earlier this week,
looking at automated driving

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.410
and auto assist.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:19.100
I was with medical devices
in iRobot yesterday.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.790
And wherever you look,
whatever domain you work in,

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.510
we see complexity, we
see systems challenges,

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.870
and we see tremendous
opportunities for us,

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.630
as professionals,
but more than that,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:37.700
for systems professionals to
have a profound positive impact

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.170
on the world.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.590
So it's going to be a
very challenging journey.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.830
We are still working to
solidify our foundation

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.080
to advance our theories,
to advance our practice.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.680
But it is a very fruitful
time, I think, as well.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.550
So those were the comments
that I will offer at the start,

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.940
and then open it up to the
class to ask the questions

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.100
of this board of directors.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.800
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
David, that was great.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.410
And so, who wants to be first?

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.510
Don't be shy-- either
here at MIT or at EPFL.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.560
Sam, go for it.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.540
SAM: I was wondering when
you're creating, I guess,

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.800
INCOSE standards for systems
engineering processes,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.340
what considerations do you
take into account in order

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.330
to make them applicable for
such a wide range of disciplines

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:32.895
or domains?

00:15:36.615 --> 00:15:38.490
DAVID: Introduce yourself
for whoever speaks.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.906
PAUL: this is Paul
Schreinmarkers.

00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:41.210
I'm the technical director.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.750
Thank you for asking.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:48.690
Well, actually, INCOSE is
not a standard setting body,

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:54.480
but we are supporting a lot
of standards like ISO 15288.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.610
And what we at
least try to achieve

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.260
is that the standards are being
applied in multiple domains

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.110
as much as possible.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.530
Does that answer your question?

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.240
SAM: Yeah, thanks.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.740
OLIVIER DE WECK:
OK, and just so you

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.750
know we do have
15288 as one of the--

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.420
in the class here, we covered,
sort of, three standards.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.350
One is the System Engineering
Handbook, the [? NASA, ?]

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.981
of course, the INCOSE
Handbook, and then 15288.

00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:25.730
So I think the students
should be familiar

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.200
with [? 15288, ?]
so that was good.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.170
OK, can we have a
question from EPFL?

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.720
Are you still with us, guys?

00:16:49.376 --> 00:16:50.640
- Hello, do you hear me?

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.856
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yes, good.

00:16:51.856 --> 00:16:53.040
- OK, yes.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.620
[INAUDIBLE] just have a question
about the complexity of systems

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.650
with new systems being more
and more complex over time,

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.579
would system engineers,
or engineering itself,

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.740
have to reinvent
itself in the future?

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.836
And what would be the direction?

00:17:09.836 --> 00:17:10.609
Thank you.

00:17:13.102 --> 00:17:15.060
ALAN HARDING: Hi there,
it's Alan Harding here.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.450
I'm president-elect at INCOSE,
but more importantly, I

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.480
co-chair our system and
systems working group.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.050
I think the answer
is no to reinvention

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.300
because I'm confident
all the principles stand.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.950
But what we've been
doing as a working group,

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.770
is identifying where
engineering a system and systems

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.710
are different.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.270
We constructed a paper,
which has been published,

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.400
on the pain point to
the system of systems,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.420
looking at the managerial and
the technical differences,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.450
and therefore, helping people,
when planning their work,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:52.170
see in which cases they can
pick up their traditional ways

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.200
of looking--

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.540
and where, if you, like,
experienced practitioners,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.360
see problems or
challenges in other areas.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.430
So that working group
is helping develop--

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.015
so understand and develop
the state practice

00:18:04.015 --> 00:18:06.810
for complex system of
systems, and that's

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.940
proved quite influential.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.930
And in fact, if you all using
the latest edition of the SE

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.490
handbook, in the section
on system of systems,

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.070
it does highlight
those pain points.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.420
So they are there helping
shape what people do.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.596
Hopefully, that's of use?

00:18:24.596 --> 00:18:25.970
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Thank you, Alan.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.580
Very good.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.870
I think we've only mentioned
system of systems in the class

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.370
so far.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.040
We haven't really deep
dived into that topic,

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.230
but it's a great point.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.320
OK, and back to MIT.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.220
AUDIENCE: Hi, my question is
about the systems engineering

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.750
vision you have on the
web site about 2025.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:52.490
What has been done about the
protocols or languages that

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.280
could be developed to
facilitate the communication

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.130
between the systems
engineering professionals

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.409
and different stakeholders?

00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:02.950
MIKE: That's a really
good question--

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.040
you know, this idea of
having the same language.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.250
By the way, I'm Mike Celentano,
deputy technical director

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:10.540
of operations.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.532
The idea of having a common
language is really important.

00:19:14.532 --> 00:19:16.990
One of the things that I've
struggled with in health care--

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.820
that's my industry--

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.560
is trying to convince people
to speak the same language,

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.510
and I've since given that up.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.790
What I'm teaching people
now is to understand

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.010
the other people's
language, so that they

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.330
can communicate better.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.520
And so when you go
from domain to domain,

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.710
it's important that you
spend some time learning

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.810
the language, a lot like
it's important to learn

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.540
how to say hello and goodbye
in the language of the country

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.890
that you're visiting.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.490
It's important to understand the
domain that you're exploring,

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.530
so that you can make
the interpretation

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.500
and help those people
with systems engineering.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.640
Does that answer your question?

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.957
AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you.

00:19:54.957 --> 00:19:57.290
DAVID: Ollie, if you don't
mind, I'm going to follow up,

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.360
and then Art will as well.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.460
What that question
calls out, and what

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.470
I think Mike's
answer calls out, is

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.090
there are two very important
dimensions, in my opinion,

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.590
of systems engineering.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.750
We are the glue to
the project team,

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.640
but we are the glue in
two different dimensions.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.060
There is the engineering
aspect of what we do,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.330
and there is very real
engineering analysis that needs

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.100
to occur at the systems level.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.290
We unify the subject
matter experts,

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.710
and we bring those
understandings together

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.160
whether it's in medical, whether
it's in aerospace, regardless.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.730
But the other aspect that
we cannot avoid as systems

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.670
engineers, is the
communication role.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.440
Because we are
working with people

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.480
who do not speak the
same common language,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.590
whether that's speaking
between aerospace and medical,

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.990
or whether that's on
an aerospace project

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.360
speaking between
computer science,

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.640
reliability,
mechanical, electrical.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.260
As systems engineers, we must
embrace the communication

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.070
aspect and the translator
aspect that Mike called out,

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.990
because each of us speak
a different language

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.920
for a particular reason.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.420
Art?

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:11.240
ART: And to help in that
regard, one of the products

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.230
that INCOSE has helped create
is a systems engineering

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:21.380
body of knowledge, which is
available on a website, which

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.780
Ollie is quite familiar with--

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.300
which has several
hundred articles

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.550
about systems engineering.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.120
But one of the projects
that we are going to be--

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.250
and it's its domain
neutral, so it's not

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.830
tied to a specific
business sector.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:41.630
One of the projects that we are
expecting to begin in 2016 is

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.890
to create a variant of
that, in some fashion,

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:50.270
for the health care community--
tying it to the unique way they

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.160
talk about things--

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.130
their approaches, but tie it
back to the common underlying

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:56.400
principles.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.180
And if we are successful
in that, as we expect,

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.660
I can imagine us spinning
up ones for transportation,

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.720
for telecommunications,
et cetera.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.920
So that that can become a
glue, in essence, for people

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.130
across many different
business sectors.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:14.780
OLIVIER DE WECK: Very good.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.270
So I will make sure
that we provide

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.910
the link to the body of
knowledge, which I know

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.330
was a very big effort
to put together.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:27.370
We'll provide that information
for the students as well.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.530
TINA: Great, that's excellent.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.090
Unfortunately, for
time, I'm going

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.270
to have to ask Art
to give us a wrap up.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.940
But let me just say one
thing because I'm not sure

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.520
how well you can see
the video over here.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:45.400
But you guys are talking to
a group of about 20 people

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.400
from around the world.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.170
We have people here from
France, Sweden, Australia.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.120
And the people that
you just talked to

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:58.840
are also senior engineering
leaders that Airbus and BAE,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.130
and so they kind of arrange a
broad spectrum here-- and also

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.510
rose from different industries.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:09.610
So I'll hand it over to Art
to give you a good summary,

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.414
but I hope that you continue to
keep in touch with this group.

00:23:13.414 --> 00:23:14.830
GUEST SPEAKER:
Well, this is where

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.430
I'm going to make my small
pitch for membership.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:24.250
So as students, you have an
opportunity for only 38 dollars

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:30.340
US annually to be members of
INCOSE, which gives you access

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.420
to all of our products,
which includes videos

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.030
that are recorded
every month, handbooks,

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.940
all sorts of documents.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.920
And I'd really like
to encourage you

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.710
to consider that as an option.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.610
It's great.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.150
It's something like a
quarter of what you'd have

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.920
to pay as a full professional.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.869
And so I'm going to
let it go with that.

00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:57.910
OLIVIER DE WECK: No, Art,
I think that was great.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.920
And I'll just say
from my perspective,

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.760
I first got involved in INCOSE
a little more than a decade ago,

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.900
and I think both the
industry-academic mix,

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.120
the conferences-- you
know, this is real.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.100
This is not a community
that's living in a bubble,

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.860
and so I would I would
fully endorse, Art.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.800
All right, well, I think we're
at the end of this interview.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.820
You know, this is cool.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.680
I mean, that technology
has gotten to the point

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.720
where, certainly, the
audio part of this

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:37.930
was very clear for all of
us, and that's terrific.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.580
So we want to thank
you for your time.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.420
Have a great continuation
of your board meeting,

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.905
and we're going to keep
learning over here.

00:24:46.905 --> 00:24:48.000
DAVID: Very good.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.189
Thank you so much, Ollie.

00:24:49.189 --> 00:24:50.230
GUEST SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.720
OLIVIER DE WECK: Take care.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.290
All right, well, I hope
you found that useful.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.490
And I'll provide you a link
to the body of knowledge.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.980
I think that's one thing that
we haven't sort of pointed out.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.830
So let's go back to--

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.140
EPFL, are you still with us?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.367
GUEST SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:16.450
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.190
Thank you.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.520
So let me just sort of
finish on the midterm.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.240
Yes, Veronica?

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.896
VERONICA: [INAUDIBLE] can I
ask, a question I would have

00:25:24.896 --> 00:25:26.077
asked to the board, to you?

00:25:26.077 --> 00:25:26.910
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

00:25:29.772 --> 00:25:30.666
VERONICA: Thank you.

00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:32.290
When I was looking
over their web site,

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.970
I see a lot about
kind of communicating

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.200
for the sake of engineers
and everything else.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.410
But I think that systems
engineering, in particular,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.550
has an ability to shape the
way that we kind of regulate

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.490
policy developments.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.531
I feel like a lot of times
scientific advancement

00:25:45.531 --> 00:25:48.250
is working against international
regulatory standards, where

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.990
I feel like an
entity like INCOSE

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.200
has an ability to kind of shape
international collaboration

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.570
in a way that can help
scientists achieve more

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.920
together.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.370
And so I was kind of wondering
what the role they might have

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:01.930
seen-- or what you
might see as kind

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.030
of an international
collaboration,

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:08.920
like that, taking, in terms of
shaping the ways in which we

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.340
engineer together-- not just the
ways in which we kind of create

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.260
in systems engineering
naturally, but kind

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.150
of more collaborative.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.250
OLIVIER DE WECK: I think
it's a great question.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.440
And I think the system
engineering is sort

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.180
of evolving and broadening.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.700
The classic view of system
engineering is you know,

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.170
that's what a company
or a big project

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.680
that's producing a physical
deliverable, a new airplane,

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.320
a new computer, health care
device, a new software system.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.210
That's the out-- you
know, and then that's

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.370
a capability that you
put out into the market

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:43.960
and to the field.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.820
And regulations and
policies are given to you--

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.870
you know, their constraints,
their requirements.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.230
I think what you're saying is,
well, the policies, themselves,

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.895
are something to be designed--

00:26:54.895 --> 00:26:55.770
VERONICA: I think so.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.186
OLIVIER DE WECK:
--and negotiated.

00:26:57.186 --> 00:26:59.860
And that's a broadening
of the system boundary

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.200
and the mandate for
system engineering.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.760
And so here, at MIT, over
the last 15 years or so,

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.520
the word we've used for that
is, engineering systems.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.560
So we kind of flipped
the two words,

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.710
and say that system engineering,
in a more traditional sense,

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.980
is scope, scope, smaller.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.730
And then when you
internalize the externalities

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.910
like economics, policy,
and you consider

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.970
that part of the
design space as well,

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.300
then you're in the world
of engineering systems

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.790
or complex
sociotechnical systems.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.352
And so, absolutely, there's a--

00:27:36.352 --> 00:27:39.790
and you heard the answer
that Alan Harding, who's

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.540
the President-elect of INCOSE.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.620
He will take over from
Dave Long next year.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.480
When he started talking
about system of systems--

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.420
well, you know, what
our system of systems?

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.390
For example, air
traffic management.

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.370
Let's take an example,
air traffic management,

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:55.970
air transportation.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:28:00.100
In North America, there's
this project called next-gen--

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.080
right, next generation--

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.690
that's a very complex
system of systems.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:08.370
And in Europe, the equivalent
is a project called SESAR.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.690
It's essentially the
Unified European airspace.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.590
Well, you've got-- it's not
just about flight controllers,

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.490
and radar stations, and
GPS-enabled navigation.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.890
A lot of it has
to do with policy.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.080
And how do you do the hand offs?

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.730
Who is responsible to
report any anomalies?

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.830
How do you do backup operations?

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:30.590
And so forth.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.820
So a good example when
that came to the fore is--

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.340
I don't know if you remember
the Icelandic volcano

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.660
a few years ago?

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.440
The volcano erupted, and then
there was this big ash cloud.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.340
And then the question
was, well, is it

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.410
safe to fly through
this ash cloud?

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.720
And who actually
has the authority

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.414
to decide which part of the
airspace is closed and is open?

00:28:54.414 --> 00:28:56.080
And then you've got
the airlines saying,

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.960
you know, open up the
airspace because we're losing

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.700
a lot of business every day.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.030
And the regulators
are saying, wait,

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.430
we need to be cautious here.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.220
So I think what you're saying
is that's a system engineering

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.490
problem that we could
sort of address.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.750
And so things are
moving that way,

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.870
but I think our
methodologies for doing

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.000
that work in a rigorous way
are not quite there yet.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.940
It's still evolving,
but great question.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.440
VERONICA: Is that
a type of advocacy

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.160
that a group like INCOSE
could move toward?

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.710
I can see from their mission
statement and everything,

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.210
that's something
they are doing now.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.552
But is that a place that you
see that they could fill?

00:29:33.552 --> 00:29:34.760
OLIVIER DE WECK: It could be.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.180
And I think I think
they're moving that way.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.040
VERONICA: Thank you.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.956
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

00:29:38.956 --> 00:29:41.140
OK, any other
points anybody wants

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.220
to add from the discussion?

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:44.720
OK.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, one
question from our side--

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:47.413
OLIVIER DE WECK: Go ahead.

00:29:47.413 --> 00:29:49.630
AUDIENCE: --if I can.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:51.560
So I think that's a very
good point, Veronica,

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.620
in terms of how do you transfer
this to policy or business

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.097
management?

00:29:56.097 --> 00:29:58.430
Some time ago, I was trying
to see if there are actually

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:01.730
jobs or careers that are
called systems engineer,

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:05.900
but besides IT, there's
really not a profession.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.260
For example, if you're doing
this in the policy domain,

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.890
could you just be the systems
engineer of, say for example,

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.036
the Swiss energy--
you know, what

00:30:15.036 --> 00:30:17.160
I'm working on currently--
kind of the Swiss energy

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.650
transition-- you know,
the systems engineer,

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:20.920
and that would be your role.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.740
Are their careers
and career names

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.780
that are explicitly, like,
designing the systems

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.090
and engineering them?

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.840
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's
a question, right?

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.540
Katya, I think the mic is off.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.315
Go ahead.

00:30:44.315 --> 00:30:45.761
AUDIENCE: Hear me now?

00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:48.066
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yes.

00:30:48.066 --> 00:30:50.960
AUDIENCE: Are there
jobs that do this?

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.930
Are there systems
engineering jobs,

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.224
or is that project management?

00:30:55.224 --> 00:30:56.890
OLIVIER DE WECK:
That's a good question.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:02.560
So the job profiles of system
engineers have been broadening.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.690
There is also,
system architects.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.030
When we talk about
concept generation here,

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.400
concept selection,
that's, in a sense,

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.440
a specialty within
system engineering

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.920
known as system architecture.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.190
So you'll have more and
more people hand you

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:22.190
a business card that says,
I'm the system architect.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.700
And what that means is they're
in charge of the high level

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:30.480
decisions, the upper left side
of the V that's shown here.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.110
So system architect,
system engineers.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:35.810
And there's also a very--
this didn't come up

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.730
in the discussion with
INCOSE, but there's

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:39.890
a very active discussion
going on right now

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:44.120
between INCOSE, that
has about 10,000 members

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.990
and is 25 years old,
and an organization

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:52.340
called PMI, Project Management
Institute, which is older

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.800
and has about 400,000
members globally.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.450
And that's the people
running big projects.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.640
So those job
descriptions are still

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.950
coming from different
angles, but we

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.500
do see this bigger
discussion emerging.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.920
And I think the organizations
that are enlightened,

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.010
that really understand that
these big system decisions are

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:17.330
critical-- and that you can't
just make those arbitrarily.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.680
You need people who actually
think about the whole system,

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.000
who model and simulate
the whole system, who

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.590
look at different scenarios.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.660
You need dedicated
people for that.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:31.250
Who not just have the education
and the experience to do it,

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.490
but have the job title to do
it as well, and the authority.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.190
And so, I think we're
seeing a transition

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:41.420
to those new kinds of jobs,
especially in the enlightened

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.130
organizations.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.550
OK.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:46.130
Yes?

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.380
VERONICA: One more, I promise.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.830
OLIVIER DE WECK: One more
and then we'll move on.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.330
Yep?

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:50.290
VERONICA: So when
you say that someone

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.539
needs to have a designated
title of a systems engineer

00:32:52.539 --> 00:32:56.230
to really do it well, is there
an advantage or disadvantage

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.774
to having everyone be a systems
engineer with a specialty,

00:32:59.774 --> 00:33:01.690
so that you're training
an entire organization

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.620
to think about the big picture?

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.900
Because I can see pros and
cons, but I'm wondering,

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.781
is there a hard
answer either way.

00:33:07.781 --> 00:33:09.280
OLIVIER DE WECK:
My position on this

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.350
is-- you remember, we
talked a little bit

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:14.230
about the value of
system engineering,

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.570
like how much should you
invest in system engineering?

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.760
And we'll come back to
this at the end of term.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.820
But generally, you
can see that there's

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:26.140
empirical data that says you
should spend roughly 10% to 20%

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.090
of your budget--

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:30.760
maybe 15% is sort
of the sweet spot--

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.510
on systems engineering, system
architecture type activities,

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:38.260
which happens to be 1 in 7.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.470
1 over 7, that's
15% roughly, right?

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.310
So if you're going to,
on average, decompose

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:51.010
your systems into seven chunks
at each level of decomposition

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:55.300
then you need about one
out of seven people--

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.060
or one out of eight or
one out of seven people--

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.480
their primary focus should be
on how the chunks fit together,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.811
not designing the
individual chunks.

00:34:03.811 --> 00:34:05.560
And so there's a lot
of empirical evidence

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.850
that suggests that if you spend
a lot less effort on system

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:13.239
integration than about
15% of your total budget,

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.190
you're going to
have real problems.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.719
You will miss requirements.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:18.670
You'll have poorly
managed interfaces.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.250
You'll have surprises
during testing.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:24.639
If you spend a lot more than
15% on system engineering

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:28.580
activities, the project
will be very heavy,

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.570
too much bureaucracy,
too many processes.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:32.949
It gets slower.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.710
So we'll come back to that.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.920
But everybody should
have some understanding

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.010
of what system engineering is
even if you're a subject matter

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:45.699
expert specialty person,
if you do cost modeling,

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:50.320
or if you do control
systems, propulsion,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.239
in the medical field,
biocompatible materials.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:56.320
Whatever it is you do,
everybody should know something

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.000
about system engineering.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.750
But then you do need, that's my
opinion, the dedicated people

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.770
who really focus on the
integration, the interfaces,

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.260
how the chunks fit together.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.780
And if you don't have
that for projects

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.080
that are of a certain
level of complexity,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.850
you're going to
have big problems.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:21.060
OK, Katya, was that
was that reasonable?

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.110
All right.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:26.730
So let's move on here with the
exam because we have a very,

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.400
I think, exciting, interesting
presentation to get to.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.520
So the V is essentially--
you have this vision.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.450
You then decompose
requirements, subsystems.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.910
And then the bottom of
the V is the details.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:42.270
Every little detail
needs to be defined.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.960
And then the right side is we
go and then integrate everything

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.700
together, and we
go to operations.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:53.460
So I think most of you really
explained that quite well.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.060
Question four, what is
the most important aspect

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.405
of the V-model that is not
shown explicitly in the V?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.670
There are two answers here,
and I think both are correct.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:07.980
The iterative nature
of design, we'll

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.280
hear about this in
the Octanis project.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.790
So the V-model does not imply
that you're automatically doing

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.710
a waterfall stage gate process.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.610
You're only doing
trade studies once.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.530
You're only testing once.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.920
That's not what it means.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.970
It just means that
there's a logical sequence

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.920
to the activities,
but you could actually

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.670
spiral through the V multiple
times, so the iterative nature

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.240
of design.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.600
And then the possibility of
schedule and cost overruns,

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.650
this is the programmatic side,
is not shown in the V-model,

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.000
but it's implied.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.050
So both of these are correct,
so this is very good.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.530
Question five, at which of
the following milestones

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.620
should the main concept, or
architecture, of the system

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.660
selected-- so here
we have a little bit

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.970
of a spread of answers.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:02.250
The correct answer here should
be PDR, Polygyny Design Review.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.070
That's when the concept, the
architecture, the high level

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.910
decomposition of the system,
the assignment of functions

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:14.410
to those chunks at level one or
level two, should be defined.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:17.560
SRR, it's too early.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.130
All you're trying to do at
the SRR, System Requirements

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.380
Review, is agree on what
the requirements are,

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.270
what the system should achieve,
but not necessarily how

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:28.770
that will be achieved.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.070
And then at CDR, I
would say it's too late.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:35.160
The CDR is where you
lay out all the details

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.860
of how the system will be
built, operated, the software.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:42.420
So that the high level design,
the concept, the architecture,

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.740
should have been decided and
agreed upon way before the CDR,

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.000
and it's the PDR where
that's happening.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.980
So I think about 3/4 of
you got it right here.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:58.074
The next one was a
little subtle question.

00:37:58.074 --> 00:37:59.740
What are the following
attributes should

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.250
a set of requirements meet?

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.460
And I put check marks here
between what were the--

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.740
so there were multiple
correct answers.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.820
The set of requirements
means multiple,

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.800
an ensemble of
requirements, as opposed

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.590
to just a single
requirement in isolation.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:21.300
So, feasible, verifiable,
and unambiguous,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:25.830
those three answers are correct
for individual requirements.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:29.190
Each individual requirement
should be feasible, verifiable,

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.960
and unambiguous.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.940
But when you look at
a set of requirements,

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.830
that's when these other
three come into play,

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.530
absence of redundancy.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.460
So what this means is that
you shouldn't replicate

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.110
the same requirement,
essentially,

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:47.190
across multiple requirements
in your requirements set.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:48.780
And one of the
reasons for that is

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.840
if you change a requirement
then you might miss it

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.910
somewhere else, right.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:57.390
This redundancy is-- keep it
as simple, as straightforward

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.950
as you can.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.380
Completeness, that
basically means

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.630
that the requirements
set that you develop

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.190
should cover all
the requirements.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:08.640
You shouldn't have big holes
and missing requirements.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.060
And then the last point
is absence of conflicts.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.820
If you have requirements
conflicts, essentially,

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:19.510
what this means is there's
no feasible solution.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:22.440
So if you think
about optimization,

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.450
you have an
over-constrained problem.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.330
Basically, that's
what that means.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.450
OK?

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:30.500
Any questions about these two?

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:35.250
AUDIENCE: Yes, I have a
question for question five.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.870
I think the question
is a little bit

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:40.850
ambiguous because if
the main concept is

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.530
selected on the PDR--

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:47.330
on a timescale on the CDR,
you have the main concept.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:52.860
So you can say that
on the CDR, it's

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.610
also the main concept
selected already.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:40:00.000
OLIVIER DE WECK: Ah, I
see what you're saying.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.790
Yeah, so maybe I
should have said,

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:07.110
what is the earliest milestone
at which the concept--

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.750
that's really what
I meant, is what's

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:14.400
the milestone where the concept
has to be agreed upon, and then

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.450
of course, at the CDR--

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.930
unless you had to overturn
your concept selection,

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.060
which happens sometimes--

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.500
you should stick with the same.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.400
But the intent here was
to say, this is PDR.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.160
OK, go ahead.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.980
AUDIENCE: For this
question, number five,

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.200
I think I got concepts
of operations confused

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.770
with the concept architecture.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:42.050
So just to be clear about
that, the concept of operations

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:46.880
is what the system
does, and architecture

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.996
just a list of the subsystems
and what are the mass, energy,

00:40:49.996 --> 00:40:50.870
and information flow?

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:51.920
Is that correct?

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.170
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's right.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:56.060
The concept of operations,
that's actually an SRR type.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.200
The concept of operations--

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:57.650
AUDIENCE: That's what I put.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.200
OLIVIER DE WECK: --how will
the system be used, right?

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.900
And then the concept,
the architecture

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.050
is, given this
concept of operations,

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:08.330
what are the functions
that have to happen,

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:10.910
and then which
chunks in your system

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:13.010
support or enable
what functions?

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.201
That's essentially what it is.

00:41:15.201 --> 00:41:16.464
Yep.

00:41:16.464 --> 00:41:20.870
OK, anything else?

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.540
All right, question seven.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.040
I think most of
you got this right.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.670
We're going to get to
verification and validation

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.880
in a lot more detail, but
there is a distinction.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.150
Some people use verification
and validation interchangeably.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.850
They think it's the same.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:39.530
It's different words
for the same thing.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.810
That's not quite the case.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.970
So here you've got
your verification loop

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.080
and your validation loop.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:55.070
To put it very succinctly,
in verification,

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.900
you're answering the
question, did you

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.890
satisfy the requirements
as they were written?

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.390
That's the inner loop.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.370
You've got your
requirements set,

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.130
and then you do
verification, or inspection,

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.350
or there's different
ways of checking that.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.440
But you check, do we
meet the requirements

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.200
as they were written?

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.230
That's the inner loop.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:19.640
And then validation is the
outer loop where you say,

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.510
go back to the stakeholders,
and then you say the CONOPS,

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:26.450
right-- can we actually
execute the CONOPS--

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.420
and does the system
meet the expectations

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.320
of the stakeholders?

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.570
Does it deliver value to them?

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.590
And so it's quite
possible-- and there

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:38.300
are examples of systems that
actually successfully pass

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.200
verification.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.080
You can check every
requirements, say, yup, yup,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.740
yup, we can do that.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.760
And then you demonstrate
the product, or the system,

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.690
to the stakeholders, and they
say, oh no, that's not at all

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.340
what we were looking for.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.480
And then the question is,
well, did you change your mind?

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.510
You know, customer,
beneficiary--

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:02.660
did you change the mind from
today to when we started this

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:08.510
project, or was there some
error in translation going from

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:09.246
the stake--

00:43:09.246 --> 00:43:11.120
or the stakeholders
didn't change their mind.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.480
You know, their use
cases, their CONOPS,

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.300
the value they want
to get from the system

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.310
hasn't changed since
you started the project,

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.380
but there was some
error in translation

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.410
between those high level
stakeholder expectations

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.990
and then the requirements.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:28.040
No, maybe you missed
a requirement.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.250
So that's the key idea
here between V and B,

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:36.410
and we'll talk a lot more about
this in the next few weeks.

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.420
All right, now comes
the one you've all

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.730
been waiting for, I know.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.220
Question eight.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.490
So here's the rocket equation.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.520
Delta v, the change in velocity
of a rocket that you can

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.770
achieve is equal to gravity
times the specific impulse

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.770
times the log of
your initial mass--

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:01.490
so this is your rocket
on the launch pad--

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:06.080
and over M i, which is the
final mass after the burn

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.120
has happened.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.970
And so, one thing
that's important

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.340
is to define those masses.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.760
And we got a lot of emails.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.090
Right, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:18.830
Would you say this
was probably the most

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.922
emails we've gotten
all semester-- is

00:44:20.922 --> 00:44:21.755
about this question?

00:44:21.755 --> 00:44:24.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.820
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
a bunch of questions

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.000
were just about the
definition of mass fraction.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.620
What is the mass fraction?

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.840
And there are really two
different interpretations

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.524
of it.

00:44:33.524 --> 00:44:34.940
And it turned out
it didn't matter

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.700
which one you used because
the answer was the same.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.560
So the one that I'm
showing you here

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:46.060
is that the initial mass
here is 1 plus alpha times M

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.320
f, your mass of fuel,
plus your payload.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.850
So in this case, alpha
is the percentage

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:55.430
of the mass that
you're launching,

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:57.080
the fuel and the payload--

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.580
that's made up of
structure, which

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:02.600
includes tankage, support
structure, the engines

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.220
themselves, et cetera.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.820
The other definition you could
use which is equally valid,

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:11.090
you just have to define it,
is that alpha is only applied

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:12.950
to the fuel mass, right.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.650
That you've got the
fuel, which in this case

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.830
is liquid oxygen,
liquid hydrogen.

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:21.500
And then you have your
tanks and your engine.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.610
That's your mass fraction.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:24.830
And then the
payload sits on top,

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.290
and there's no overhead
for carrying the payload.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.830
And either way, it didn't
matter in this question

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:32.670
because the answer was the same.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:36.440
So here the initial mass
is 1 plus alpha times

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.350
the mass of the fuel,
which is unknown,

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:44.780
and the mass of the payload,
which is given, 20 metric tons.

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:49.040
And then M1 is simply alpha
times mass of the fuel and mass

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.430
of the payload.

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:53.780
So you can slightly rearrange--
there are different ways

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.210
of solving this problem.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:57.440
A simple way is this.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.660
You just basically
bring the constants

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.410
over to the left side.

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:07.760
So delta V over g i s p, and
then basically, the right side

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.080
has to be larger than that.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.670
So this is essentially your
1 plus alpha divided by alpha

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.880
because the M f plus
M p term falls out,

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.860
if you formulated that way.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.080
So you can just plug
in the numbers that

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.970
were given in the
problem, and you

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:26.450
can see that the left hand side
does not match the right hand

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.500
side, right?

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.010
And the conclusion from this--

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.110
some of you tried to
solve for the fuel mass.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.610
You know, there's
all kinds of ways.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:39.480
And it's super frustrating,
and I know a lot of you

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.210
spent a lot of time trying
to solve this problem.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.350
And no matter what way,
you get negative fuel mass.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:47.790
You get all kinds
of weird things

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.260
trying to make this work.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:55.550
The bottom line is
infeasible requirement.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:59.150
It's not possible
with the required--

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:02.960
this is an example of an
infeasible requirement.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:08.120
And I did this on
purpose to show you

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:13.870
that just because somebody
writes a requirement down,

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:16.640
it doesn't mean it's feasible.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.960
So I think many of you got
this and were frustrated by it,

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.950
but I want to show you a real
project where this happened.

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:27.980
So you could then ask,
well, what would we

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.870
have to do to make it feasible?

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:33.410
So some of you said, well, maybe
we can achieve less delta V?

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:37.070
Or we need even better
propulsion, higher i s p.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:41.810
Or-- which is maybe a little
bit more straightforward, what

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:44.570
would be the mass fraction,
the alpha, that you would have

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.890
to achieve to make this work?

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:50.360
And the answer is
somewhere around 8%,

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.970
depending on which definition
of mass fraction you used,

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:56.120
it's 7% to 8%.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:00.170
So it means that if you want to
achieve single stage to orbit

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:05.570
flight with no staging, which
is the current way we do it,

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:09.950
you have to get the
mass fraction below 8%.

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:14.820
And that includes everything,
the tanks, the support

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.890
structure, the engines.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:19.350
And that's really,
really, really tough.

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:23.400
So I know you were frustrated
by this problem many of you,

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.940
but let me tell you this story.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:29.710
Those folks were
really frustrated.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.280
So there was actually
a program here

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:39.480
in the US in the late '90s
that tried to as a small scale

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.080
technology demonstrator
demonstrate the technologies

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.930
required to get to orbit
with a single stage vehicle.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:50.460
And that program was called the
X-33, run by Lockheed Martin--

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.340
so, single stage to orbit,
reusable launch vehicle

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:54.910
demonstrator.

00:48:54.910 --> 00:49:00.710
The target mass, this is your M
0, total mass, 130 metric tons.

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:03.990
The target mass
fraction was 0.1.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:10.350
And fuel was just the same as
in this problem, LOX hydrogen.

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:16.860
And the project basically
was canceled in 2001

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:21.810
after about $1.3 billion
had been spent on it,

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:25.350
and the thing that eventually
really led to the cancellation

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:27.300
was the fuel tank.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.850
There was a composite
material fuel tank

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:33.740
that was embedded inside the
wing here, inside this body,

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.910
has very complex shape.

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:39.330
And those of you that know
about-- hydrogen atoms

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:40.470
are very, very small.

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:47.890
It's very tough to contain
hydrogen. It wants to leak.

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.130
Its natural tendency
is to leak out.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:53.220
So this composite
fuel tank basically

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.210
couldn't be built and
tested under pressure

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.190
to be leak proof, and
they really tried.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:02.430
They spent a lot of money
on it, a lot of effort,

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:03.660
couldn't be done.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.270
And so NASA
concluded, you know--

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:11.700
and the goal was to achieve,
essentially, this mass fraction

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.940
of 10% or below.

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:18.720
And at that time, in the
late '90s, early 2000s,

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.450
this was just not feasible
with the state of technology.

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:25.900
And so, think about
how frustrated--

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.040
I know you spent an hour
or so trying to solve this,

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.620
and we're not happy about it.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.040
But think about how they
felt. So the purpose of this--

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.080
I think most of
this midterm exam

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:42.227
was kind of a gift up
until this question.

00:50:42.227 --> 00:50:44.310
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
about the mass fraction.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:48.550
I read the text over there,
and it says it's suborbital.

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:52.290
So was the plan to reduce the
mass fraction even further

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.400
if this was a success?

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.260
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right,
so this would not

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.110
have achieved orbital velocity.

00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:59.580
So it's not a
complete one to one

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:03.030
map because I gave you also
a higher delta V, right?

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.820
I gave you 11
kilometers per second,

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:11.010
which is escape velocity, and
you need to achieve about 7.5.

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:13.590
But with drag and
gravity losses,

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:16.900
you really needed
achieve about 9, 9.5.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:22.050
So it's not a one to one map,
but you sort of get the idea.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:24.300
Any question about this at EPFL?

00:51:28.621 --> 00:51:29.370
Did you hear this?

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:31.980
Was it was it fairly clear?

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think everything

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:34.495
is clear on our side.

00:51:34.495 --> 00:51:35.328
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

00:51:35.328 --> 00:51:36.130
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:37.671
OLIVIER DE WECK:
All right, so if you

00:51:37.671 --> 00:51:40.100
want to read more
about the X-33,

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.830
the Wikipedia article is
pretty good and there's a lot.

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:46.120
So just to say,
you know, I think

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.690
we're going to try this again.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:49.730
I think there's going
to be new efforts.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:52.070
Composite materials
have come a long way--

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:55.980
composite manufacturing,
15 years later,

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.280
we might try this
again pretty soon.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.960
OK, question nine.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.500
So this was a little
bit of computation here.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.650
So the intent of
this question was

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:11.840
for you to think about
competing objectives.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.310
Right, the Pareto frontiers,
we talked about this

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:18.030
in the concept selection.

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:23.480
So this is the idea of, you're
designing a can or container

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.280
for containing liquids.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.060
The shape is cylindrical
as shown in red.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.580
And so the two things
you care about is volume.

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:34.880
How much liquid can you
carry inside the can?

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:39.530
That's simply pi r-squared h--

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:42.530
and then your
surface area, which

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:44.780
you could say that's the
cost of the container, right.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:48.980
That's the amount of material
you need to use, is 2 pi r.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.840
Those at the top and bottom.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:55.490
And then 2 r pi h, which
is your circumference.

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:59.750
And if you then plot four
different combinations

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:04.760
of radius and height, what
is the volume and surface

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.280
area, which is shown
in this plot here?

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.990
Surface area as the y-axis
and volume on the x-axis.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.570
The idea is you want
to maximize volume

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:21.920
while minimizing
surface area by changing

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.920
the radius and the height
subject to these constraints

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.470
shown here, you should
have gotten something that

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.570
looks like this blue curve.

00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:33.050
This is the Pareto frontier,
and the question was, well,

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:35.150
where's the Utopia Point?

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:38.660
The Utopia Point is
down to the lower right.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.330
Maybe you plotted it
differently, and that's fine.

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:43.610
So you want as high
a volume as you

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:50.100
can with minimum surface area,
but the best you can achieve--

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.200
there's nothing in
this white space here.

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.090
The best you can achieve is
this blue curve and above it.

00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:00.750
And so then I'm plotting
to a small and a big one.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:04.160
So the Coca-Cola can is shown.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.720
The soda can is in
the lower left corner,

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.200
and you can see it's pretty
much on the Pareto front.

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.120
And then this is the standard
55 US gallon oil barrels.

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:19.070
You know, if you go to like
a junkyard or a refinery,

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:22.430
you'll see these barrels of oil.

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:25.082
Actually, it's not exactly
on the Pareto front,

00:54:25.082 --> 00:54:26.165
but it's very, very close.

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:31.270
So that was the intent here.

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:32.870
Any questions about this?

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:33.543
Yes?

00:54:33.543 --> 00:54:35.709
AUDIENCE: Are you trying
to determine whether or not

00:54:35.709 --> 00:54:39.952
the oil and the soda can
were on the Pareto front,

00:54:39.952 --> 00:54:46.990
didn't that depend on how
you defined the assumptions?

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:49.690
OLIVIER DE WECK: Not really,
one of the key assumptions

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:53.860
that was given was that you
should assume zero thickness.

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:56.120
Right, so it's just a
volume versus surface.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.890
There's no actual thickness.

00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:00.342
AUDIENCE: In terms of the--

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.590
I need to double check the--

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:11.980
so when I looked at the
height of the different cans,

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:14.710
were we supposed to leave
the problem as defined

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:19.300
in terms of the original units?

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.880
If you updated the units
as the maximum height

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:26.530
to be within a more reasonable
range, not 2 meters versus 900

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:32.140
millimeters, neither point
was on the Pareto front.

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:35.000
It just depended on how well you
defined your upper limit to be.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:35.390
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, I see.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:36.730
AUDIENCE: And I was
wondering if we were expected

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:38.680
to maintain the
original upper limit,

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.440
or if we were
allowed to change it.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.564
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, if
you change it, that's fine.

00:55:42.564 --> 00:55:43.880
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.880
OLIVIER DE WECK: The basic
idea of this question

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.170
was to understand what
is a Pareto frontier.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.910
And you know, to actually
think about something

00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:00.430
we use almost every day.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:03.610
You know, we drink a soda
or something like that,

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:07.240
and that shape is not a
randomly selected shape.

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.160
It's actually based
on a trade off

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:15.250
between volume and efficiency--
right, volume and surface area.

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:19.030
And here you go, here's where
it falls on the Pareto frontier.

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:20.770
That's sort of the general idea.

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:22.870
Well, we haven't
graded the exams yet,

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:26.900
but I think we'll be fairly
generous on this question.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.840
OK, so then the last
one was really the--

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.380
that's very recent happenings.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.510
If you read the article,
you realized, wow,

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:39.562
there's kind of a
prehistory here.

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:41.770
This is not just something
that happened a month ago.

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:46.000
There's a long history leading
up to this emissions scandal,

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.070
and the key table in the article
is this table shown here.

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:56.230
It's essentially
these n o x numbers

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:59.410
for emissions where you had
the different-- so these

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:00.520
are requirements.

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.010
These are regulatory
requirements.

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:06.820
And a big part of the story
is that the requirements--

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.730
this is just for diesel
engines, the supplies

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:15.610
for diesel engines in the US
and in Europe are different.

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:18.670
And so you can see that
the limit is essentially

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:20.750
the regulatory requirement.

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:23.920
The dyno shown in green
here is demonstrate--

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.220
this is verification.

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:30.220
Did you satisfy the
requirement as written?

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:35.350
And you can argue that because
these vehicles had software

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:38.320
in them, the purpose
of the software

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.350
was to detect whether
or not the vehicle is

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:43.240
being tested for emissions.

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.720
And the reason you can do it
is because the drive cycles

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.160
are very tightly prescribed.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.160
So if the vehicle
is operating exactly

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.960
at the speeds and
velocities that

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.830
correspond one to one to
those test drive cycles,

00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:00.190
the software knew, ah, I'm
being tested for emissions.

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.520
And you know, it's like
knowing that you're

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.230
being watched as
a kid, and you're

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:11.950
behaving because you know
you're being watched.

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.230
And then whenever you think
you're not being watched,

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:15.700
you do something very different.

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.420
That's the general idea.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.830
So the green was
basically the dyno results

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:25.690
with the cheating, essentially,
with the software embedded.

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:29.470
And then the West Virginia
University results,

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:31.960
which were this
independent testing,

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:36.760
showed that the actual emissions
during regular operations

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:41.780
were about 30 times
worse than this.

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:45.670
And the trade off here is, of
course, with fuel efficiency.

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:47.950
That's the big trade off.

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:52.900
And so, we haven't read your
answers yet to this question,

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.810
but it's extremely relevant
to system engineering

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.000
and in particular,
to the distinction

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.900
between verification
and validation.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:05.200
So you can argue that
verification was passed here

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.170
because it passes the dyno test.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:11.830
These are the regulatory
tests that are prescribed,

00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:14.290
but it fails,
essentially, in the field

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:16.120
to satisfy the requirements.

00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:22.390
And of course,
Volkswagen has admitted

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:24.880
that they cheated in essence.

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:29.050
But I'll be very interested to
see how the legal side of this

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:34.920
works out because if you
interpret this very narrowly--

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:39.130
and you cannot say that those
vehicles failed their emission

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:43.740
standard tests because they've
performed properly on the dyno.

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:47.370
So to what extent are
these requirements,

00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:50.790
these environmental
requirements, which are very,

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:52.950
in a sense, narrowly
defined in terms

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:57.040
of how these requirements
are verified legally binding

00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.570
in terms of being able to
perform at those levels

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:03.570
outside of the drive
cycle test cases

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:05.100
that are prescribed by law?

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.670
Did you see what I'm saying?

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:10.890
So even though morally,
people generally

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:15.030
say that Volkswagen has cheated
because they're essentially

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:17.580
reconfiguring the vehicle
depending on whether it's

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.280
being tested officially or not.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:24.660
But from a legal
perspective, I'm

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.600
not sure this is fully
done yet, so we'll

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.710
have to see how the lawsuits
and all these things play out.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:33.060
Go ahead [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.950
AUDIENCE: Would you
would you say that,

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:38.130
looking at it from the
regulators perspective,

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:41.850
that they had set up
an expectation that

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:43.660
didn't flow into a requirement?

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:48.400
And if it was a requirement,
it was unverifiable until WVU--

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.770
it was an unverifiable
requirement in a sense.

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:53.520
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's
one way to say it.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.020
And you know, what is
the response to this?

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.790
Well, one response could be
that a whole bunch of more test

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:00.390
cases--

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.910
you know, the
actual drive cycles

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.440
that are going to
have to be tested

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.580
are going to be much more--

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.060
I don't know.

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:09.560
We'll see.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.740
This is a big deal not
just for Volkswagon,

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:16.760
but I think it's a very big deal
in the bigger picture of how

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.390
do regulatory requirements
and standards apply

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:25.960
to all kinds of products,
and how do you check them.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.310
Let's see real quick if
there is a question at EPFL.

01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:31.090
Any comments, questions?

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.400
AUDIENCE: Regulation,
actually, in Europe,

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.920
it was forbidden and
explicitly forbidden

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.296
to introduce a [? defect ?]
device in the car.

01:01:42.296 --> 01:01:45.460
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, and
there's penalties for that,

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.594
right?

01:01:47.594 --> 01:01:48.710
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.226
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

01:01:50.226 --> 01:01:52.815
Nathan, you had a point?

01:01:52.815 --> 01:01:54.190
NATHAN: I was
wondering if you've

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:58.600
seen any analysis on like WVU
doing tests on other vehicles

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.217
to compare what they show on
their dyno results versus what

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.550
they're admitting in real
life, even though it might not

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:05.150
be this extreme.

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:06.400
OLIVIER DE WECK: I don't know.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.734
I don't know what tests
they've done internally.

01:02:08.734 --> 01:02:13.567
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it's
like a result [INAUDIBLE]----

01:02:13.567 --> 01:02:14.400
what do you call it?

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.880
The test being so different from
the actual real life driving

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.570
because nobody accelerates
from zero to 30 in 30 seconds.

01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:23.660
That's what they've
been testing.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.290
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:28.050
So there's a real,
real strong connection

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:29.550
here with system engineering.

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:33.000
And that was the purpose of this
question, is to sort of push--

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.920
this question was not a gift.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.860
This sort of really
required you to dig in,

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.420
and it was very timely, I think.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.200
So cheat to meet requirements
failed validation.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.750
That's what I would
say as a quick summary.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:54.610
Any final questions,
comments about the online--

01:02:54.610 --> 01:02:57.052
the quiz, the midterm quiz?

01:02:57.052 --> 01:03:00.760
OK, we've had we've had
our interactive discussion

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.690
with the INCOSE
board of directors,

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:04.600
so hopefully you enjoyed that.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:12.100
And we are now right on time
to hand it over to Octanis.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:16.170
And Rafael will present this--

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:17.500
Rafael Fabian Tychui.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:21.160
So essentially, you'll hear it's
about the design manufacturing

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.280
and deployment of a rover
for extreme environment--

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.330
Antarctica, in particular.

01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:29.830
And so, we look forward
to Rafael's presentation.

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:31.870
And as you listen
to Rafael, think

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:33.790
about what you
learned in this class

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:35.920
so far, how does it connect.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.950
And I think Rafael also tried
to gear the presentation a bit

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:41.680
to the system
engineering concepts.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.105
RAFAEL: So I'm Rafael.

01:03:43.105 --> 01:03:46.390
I'm just going to
present myself quickly.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:51.640
I'm studying here at my master's
in nano and micro-electronics,

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.340
and I'm speaking on
behalf of Octanis.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:57.670
So just in case, the image
quality wouldn't be perfect,

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:05.360
you can find this presentation
at MIT and on tiny.cc/octanis

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.370
just to see the picture.

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:10.610
And well, Octanis
is an association

01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:13.730
that was just recently founded.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:15.890
We have certain key values.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.330
So fascination is one of them.

01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:26.600
We set in-shop goals and then
get very passionate about this.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.510
We want to build
affordable products,

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:34.260
so we use open source software,
we 3D print parts, and so on.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:37.040
We use off-the-shelf components.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.280
And we want to do open design,
so we share our code on GitHub.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.410
We share our mechanical
designs to the community.

01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:49.850
And one point is also
education, so we, ourselves,

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:53.420
want to learn from
what we're doing

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.060
and want to make others
benefit from our learning,

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.870
and try to help them, as
well, with their projects.

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:05.630
And how we tackle things is kind
of summarized in this statement

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:11.210
from Tom Chi from Google X.
So we minimise the time to try

01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:15.750
things and maximize
the time of learning.

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:19.500
That means we iterate very fast.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.880
We do a prototype very fast.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.660
We go on with the
idea, with a prototype,

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.360
with a sketch, a
design, and so on.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.250
And we try it.

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.920
If you fail, just move,
try the next thing.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.250
And you know, that's
basically how it is.

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:40.970
And the first project that just
emerged out of this procedure

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:45.750
is Octanis I, so that's what
I'm going to talk about today.

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:48.570
So maybe quickly
about the team--

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.920
so the rule 7 plus minus 1--

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.840
plus minus 2 applies
here as well.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.240
So we are eight members
now working on that rover--

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:03.720
from different fields,
from engineering, physics,

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.560
life science as well.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.950
And the story began actually
when Sam was here as well.

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:13.360
For the QHN, just in case.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:17.330
And Anna found about this
competition or that call

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:22.610
from Ecuador that
was about building--

01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:28.160
or sending a student project,
or whatever, to Antarctica.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.620
And they thought, well,
let's [INAUDIBLE] take

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:35.740
this challenge, and we're going
to put a rover on a weather

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:39.610
balloon, send it from South
America to Antarctica,

01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:43.370
deploy it there, let it
drive around for one summer.

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:45.600
And let's see what happens.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.350
And well, they
started immediately

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:51.380
with doing simulations.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:55.830
There's the online tool that
allows to kind of predict

01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:59.890
the optimal time for a
trajectory in the air, so

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:02.390
a particle or an
object in the air that

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:05.300
will have a desired trajectory.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.630
And you can kind of find out
the best moment in the year

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:09.810
to do this.

01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:13.500
And it was actually
demonstrated, kind of,

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:19.240
to show that this is possible
to have this trajectory.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:22.460
Well, I heard about this
later, and they asked me

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.630
if I could do the
electronics design of this--

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:27.560
so the main board and so on.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:30.450
And I was fascinated
by the project,

01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:32.952
so I joined immediately,
but at the same time,

01:07:32.952 --> 01:07:35.410
I saw all the challenges that
we're going to have to solve.

01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:38.750
So I thought about all
the problems we have.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:42.600
For instance, what happens if we
lose the balloon in the ocean?

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.040
What happens if we run out
of power and the temperature

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.030
drops--

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:53.130
if an arm breaks, and you
know, we cannot get up anymore?

01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:55.850
But at some point,
I just realized

01:07:55.850 --> 01:08:00.380
that, well, all we do is
we just send a balloon

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.020
with the rover to
Antarctica, and we're

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.750
going to deploy it there,
and it will drive it down.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:07.490
And I think that
that's something

01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:10.010
we saw also in this
class because I'm

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:15.800
following this class passively
on WebEx and with the videos.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.640
So yeah, the thing
that you have to see

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.970
is the big picture as a
system engineer, right.

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:25.310
You see the whole
mission, and you

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:29.202
don't care about the
details at this level.

01:08:29.202 --> 01:08:30.910
But you're going to
decompose the problem

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:34.160
into specific sub-problems
and have groups of people

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.859
working on this, and that's it.

01:08:37.859 --> 01:08:40.580
So it just looked easy to me.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.979
In the end, we're
just going to do it,

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:45.380
and we started with
the first problem.

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.300
And just to give
you an idea, that's

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:48.910
one of our last prototypes.

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:52.800
So that's how the rover
is going to look like.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:58.670
We see two struts with wheels
on each side, solar panels

01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:03.790
and 3D printed parts for 3D
printed wheels and struts.

01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:08.050
And you see the
balloon in our logo.

01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:10.949
And we're not going to
do the balloon right now,

01:09:10.949 --> 01:09:14.990
but the first mission will
just be the rover itself.

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:18.380
And that slide basically
summarizes the goal.

01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.689
So the mission of Octanis I is
to build a reusable autonomous

01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:27.279
solar powered and open source
for outdoors, and in this case,

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:31.819
for an extreme environment
like Antarctica.

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:34.420
So let's go down
to V-model, right.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.370
We'll start with the
stakeholder analysis.

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:40.430
In our case, it's pretty simple.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:44.950
It's the Antarctic
Institute from Ecuador,

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:48.520
which we contacted and
showed our project,

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:53.410
and they were pretty happy about
this, and I want to learn more.

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:54.880
So we presented our project.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.670
We sent in a proposal
and are right now,

01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:01.410
writing the final
documents for them.

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:03.400
And what we basically
have to provide

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:08.980
is just the goals of the mission
and the scientific findings

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.080
we're going to have, so
we will produce a paper

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.630
at the end of this and
write about what we found.

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:21.160
And further down, the V-models,
will be the requirements.

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.800
So we can look at some
Shall requirements.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.950
So the power system of the
rover shall provide 10 watts

01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:35.540
on average, so we
figured that out after

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:36.940
like riding on a power budget.

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:42.080
Should We want to drive around
that will cost that much power,

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:47.260
and that will be that much
time during the day, and so on.

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.656
So that was the number
we came up with.

01:10:50.656 --> 01:10:53.020
Oh, and the interior
temperature shall not

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:56.890
drop below minus
20 degrees Celsius,

01:10:56.890 --> 01:11:00.400
so about 10 Fahrenheit.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:06.160
That's basically the point where
you cannot charge the battery

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:12.110
any more because of the
chemical composition of it.

01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:13.810
So standard batteries,
you shouldn't

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:16.270
go below minus 10 degrees.

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:19.840
That's really a hard
requirement we have to provide.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.050
The total weight shall
not exceed 2.5 kilograms.

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:26.770
Basically, we look already for
the mission, for the balloons--

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:30.730
so it shouldn't be too
expensive to put the helium--

01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:33.010
like, to buy the
helium and so on.

01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:36.480
And the rover shall be
able to communicate to us

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.090
from any point of the Earth.

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:42.820
For that, they basically
used the Iridium Network,

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:47.140
which you can pay like
for a text message.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:51.250
You can pay something and
you can send your message

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:52.350
from any point as well.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:55.630
There's a bunch of satellites
covering the whole planet

01:11:55.630 --> 01:11:57.850
basically.

01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:02.260
And [INAUDIBLE] managed to climb
the slope, a certain slope.

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:08.050
That's just to assure
that we can not just

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:10.027
drive on flat terrain.

01:12:10.027 --> 01:12:11.610
There's also some
should requirements.

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:13.371
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Rafael, quick question.

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:13.870
RAFAEL: Yes?

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:16.150
OLIVIER DE WECK: Where did
the 14 degrees come from?

01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:19.020
Did you do like a terrain
analysis on Antarctica,

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.870
or how did you come up with
14 degrees as the requirement

01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:26.670
for this hill climbing?

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:29.940
RAFAEL: We basically
looked at the motors

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.990
we would have in mind to
take, and then figured out

01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:35.940
that that's basically
what they can do.

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:37.117
And we tested it.

01:12:37.117 --> 01:12:38.700
So I'm going to talk
about this later.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:45.450
We didn't do this up, down only,
but we looked at what we have

01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:46.400
and what we can do.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.900
And that's what we
figured out would

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:51.420
be a reasonable kind of choice,
but yeah, good question.

01:12:54.717 --> 01:13:00.410
So the should requirements
cover reproducibility,

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:03.675
so any non-expert should
also be able to build

01:13:03.675 --> 01:13:09.570
this rover without being
an engineer user as well.

01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:12.780
The cost should
stay below $1,000,

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:16.710
so the material costs only,
of course, not the R&D.

01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:19.840
The range should be
around 1 kilometers a day.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.310
That's kind in the order of
magnitude of the Curiosity

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:26.150
Rover, so we're not stressed.

01:13:26.150 --> 01:13:27.360
We don't have to go fast.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:33.030
We have weeks or months to be
there, so one kilometer per day

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:35.510
is just fine.

01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:38.810
There should be for
a scientific payload.

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:42.180
Room means physical
space and also

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:46.080
certain conditions like
temperature, humidity inside,

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.540
depending on the experiment.

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.740
And well, it should survive
one Antarctic summer,

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:54.390
so that implies
also the conditions

01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:59.500
that we have there like
the weather and the sun,

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.800
the radiation, and so on.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.210
So with all of this done,
we had our first diagram,

01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:07.790
so pardon the [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:11.170
Our representation is not
what we learned in this class,

01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.840
but that's what we had, right?

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.650
So this graph is mostly
on the electronics.

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:18.400
It's focused.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.379
There's a main
board in the middle.

01:14:21.379 --> 01:14:22.920
I'm not sure if you
see that clearly,

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:27.090
but a main board with a
bunch of sensors up here,

01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:32.200
and also a camera, and RF
modules for communications,

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.040
and maxillary board for
the scientific payload,

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.336
for instance.

01:14:36.336 --> 01:14:42.450
And we kept going with this,
and we basically designed a PCB

01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:43.620
with all these components.

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.400
And most of it worked as well.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.200
We also thought about
the mechanics of course.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:56.310
This design is inspired
from a NASA project that

01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:59.400
was, in the end,
abandoned because it was

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.290
too high in cost, but still--

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:05.610
this manner of
[INAUDIBLE] was kind

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:08.580
of having the same
structure-- so two struts

01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:12.570
that would allow to flip the
rover entirely around if it

01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:16.950
gets clipped by the wind,
and also put it more flat

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:19.920
or align it to the
sun, so that it

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.990
gets the maximum of the energy.

01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:25.520
And yeah, that's what we had.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.200
And we went out with
our first prototype.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.210
It's pretty cute, right?

01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:33.390
We went to Sweden with that.

01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:37.710
It has a bunch of cheap Chinese
solar cells from the eBay.

01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:41.320
And the rules and everything
are already 3D printed.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.520
Printed It has our
first main board,

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.860
and it was just capable of
driving around somewhere

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.800
on the snow.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.660
And we [INAUDIBLE] testing
the parachute, so [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.130
came back.

01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:56.820
And it worked a few
times, but in the end,

01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:01.390
it had kind of an incident.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:06.050
So we could really test it
and analyze what happened,

01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:09.170
and so really what
we can improve

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:13.170
for the further iterations.

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:15.340
And I stopped before
at the remodel.

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:18.420
I want to go down a bit
deeper there and show everyone

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.230
a few examples.

01:16:19.230 --> 01:16:21.936
So that that's the
electoral power system.

01:16:21.936 --> 01:16:25.920
And I want to summarize again,
that the relevant requirements

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.400
that are 10 watts on average
that should be produced

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:34.620
and the temperature that should
be held inside the rover.

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:39.030
So we have this choice of
having the small, one chip

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:42.900
solution on the left.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:43.740
That was cheap.

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.156
It was easy.

01:16:45.156 --> 01:16:48.192
It was reliable.

01:16:48.192 --> 01:16:51.000
Or we could have that
more complex system

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.980
where we have more flexibility.

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:59.490
We have, actually, more power
output than the small chip,

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:04.410
and it's basically adaptable
to what we need exactly.

01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:08.370
And we, in the end,
went for the second--

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:14.100
for the right option mainly
because of the power output

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.000
because the 10 wants imply--

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.330
a few amps, actually, of output
and a solar powered input

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:22.930
that would have to be managed.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:25.200
And that's just not
possible for the small chip

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.080
we had in our first
prototype actually.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.770
So we had a concept
that was inspired

01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:35.120
from the Swiss [? Cube ?]
Satellite because I remember

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.560
going to work there
for his masterpiece,

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:42.690
and he got inspired from
his concept of having

01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:47.000
this particular
architecture that implies

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.250
having a shared VSS buss.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:54.800
So you had your 3 volts
that was feed [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.540
to your system, and
directly to that,

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:00.390
connected to solar
panels and the battery.

01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:04.936
And if the power bus would
drop below the 3.3 volts,

01:18:04.936 --> 01:18:08.100
it will get regulated or
stabilized by discharging

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:12.990
the battery or by solar power,
but you cannot kind of steer

01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.490
this.

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:16.700
And if it will be too
high then 3.3 volts,

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:20.590
it will [INAUDIBLE] it again
with charging the battery.

01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:23.310
And that was basically
the main concept

01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:27.060
that he implemented then.

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:30.810
And the next steps,
if you go further,

01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:33.386
would be the component
selection, the PCB design,

01:18:33.386 --> 01:18:33.885
right.

01:18:33.885 --> 01:18:36.460
The [INAUDIBLE]
materials-- right now,

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.510
we're programming the framework.

01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:41.400
And testing, that's
also ongoing.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.820
And at the same time,
optimized for having cheaper

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.570
components-- components
with the smaller footprint,

01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:52.100
so you save space on
your PCB and so on.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.060
So that would be really at
the bottom of the [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:57.370
right now.

01:18:57.370 --> 01:19:01.800
Also, maybe, a good example
that shows this trade space

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.700
exploration would be
the mechanical design.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:09.934
So the driving mechanism,
that could be--

01:19:09.934 --> 01:19:11.850
well, wheels like we had
it, but it could also

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:18.540
be like caterpillar or any
other kind of mechanism.

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:23.580
The motors could be cheap
ones from eBay for $3 a piece

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:27.016
or like high end Maxon motors
we all love here in Switzerland,

01:19:27.016 --> 01:19:29.150
right?

01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:33.320
And well, you could
print that with a 3D

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.190
printer, the structure.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:37.920
Even the gears, you
can print them out,

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.795
actually, yourself,
with plastic.

01:19:39.795 --> 01:19:41.115
It works actually.

01:19:41.115 --> 01:19:43.350
Or you could select
metallic parts.

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:44.910
We have also a few--

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:48.930
like, the worm guy for instance,
we need to take a metallic one.

01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:56.340
In the end, we had a combination
of all of these things.

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.930
So we had the struts.

01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:01.753
We also have the Maxon motors
that were sponsored luckily,

01:20:01.753 --> 01:20:04.080
so the price isn't too high--

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:08.790
and the metallic worm guy,
as I said, 3D printed struts,

01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:11.082
3D printed wheels.

01:20:11.082 --> 01:20:13.430
And in the end, there was
a trade off between costs,

01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:18.510
reproducibility, reliability,
the range of the robot as well,

01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:22.750
and the maximum slopes
you could do as well.

01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:27.260
So what we could have
done was this [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:32.370
metrics, or the further points,
to optimize this design,

01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:36.540
but we figured out that
kind of without this,

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:39.950
we just decided, kind of, to
take one of these options,

01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:40.450
I think.

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:47.070
So that was what we learned
from the prototype one.

01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:49.890
And then the second one,
we had a few adaptions.

01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:52.750
So we changed our
main microcontroller.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:57.035
We changed the RF module
to a standard that

01:20:57.035 --> 01:20:59.370
is now emerging called LoRa.

01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:02.450
And we also added that
power system I talked about.

01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:07.500
But mainly, it remained
the same on that diagram.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.920
And just to show
you how we actually

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.115
are looking at that goal that
we are having the rover that

01:21:15.115 --> 01:21:17.630
is reproducible by someone.

01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:19.450
This looks pretty much
like a kit, right?

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:22.620
Its all 3D printed parts.

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:26.300
You can just assemble them,
the solar cells and you

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:29.130
know, the structure
to build the body.

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:35.090
And looking at this, you might
see that it's not many parts.

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:39.300
It's almost, as we
discussed, within the range

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:43.570
of a non-complex systems that
could be managed by one person.

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:47.970
But in the end, for instance,
the solar panels that are,

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:50.390
again, decomposable
in separate parts.

01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:56.010
We manufactured them ourselves
taking blemished cells

01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:58.990
from eBay, putting
them into arrays,

01:21:58.990 --> 01:22:00.550
soldering the connection.

01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:03.930
So in the end, you have a
lot of individual parts--

01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:06.320
also, all the parts
on the PCB and so on,

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:11.330
so it quickly explodes in size.

01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:13.270
The second prototype
had more power

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:15.610
because of the solar cells--

01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:17.310
and also improved
mechanical design,

01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:21.540
so that the wheels were
lighter and more stable--

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:22.950
also, the struts and so on.

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:25.890
And we tested that again,
this summer, on a glacier

01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:28.800
here in Switzerland.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.000
And to wrap that all
up, just a few points,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.180
we didn't maybe do
like an industry

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:40.040
or like we saw it in this class.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:43.120
So as I talked earlier
about this before,

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.140
we mainly had this
bottom up approach.

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.880
We also had a global
vision, at first,

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:54.820
to define the subsystems and
so on, but we didn't strictly

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:59.340
iterate from the top of
the model to down part

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:02.610
because sometimes we just
saw that great components--

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:04.835
for instance, the RF module--

01:23:04.835 --> 01:23:08.780
that will provide us with all
a lower power consumption,

01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:10.920
a higher range, and
was just perfectly

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:14.130
adaptive for our mission.

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:17.700
So we are stuck with this
one, and integrated it

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.490
in the design, and built
the rest of the components

01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:22.330
around it.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.775
There's also, of course-- we
didn't have like formal PDR

01:23:25.775 --> 01:23:30.960
or CDR because we were a small
team and also because we're not

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.840
doing this--

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.000
let's say, as a main--

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.630
well, yes, it is kind
of a main occupation,

01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:40.970
but we're still studying
next to it [INAUDIBLE]..

01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:46.600
Also, we may change our
design decision on the way,

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:51.510
not like the complete design
but minor, minor things of it.

01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:54.720
And we mainly focus
on this approach

01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:01.050
to do rapid prototyping and do
a lot of iterations on one thing

01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:04.260
instead of making
first concept studies,

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:06.900
and then select the
best one, and only then

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:12.750
really go to build
it, and cut metal--

01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:15.360
that's [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.360
That we can do
because we basically

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:22.020
have all these low cost
components, so it doesn't cost

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:25.420
us a lot to build one
prototype because everything

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.000
is 3D printed,
everything is electronics

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.920
that is pretty cheaply
doable right now.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.930
And yeah, we can do this.

01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:41.760
And to motivate us, or
to give us some pressure,

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.620
we set these
artificial deadlines.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:47.320
So we put the design
freezes in our calendar.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.650
So from this point
on, we will not

01:24:49.650 --> 01:24:52.950
change these parts of
the systems any more.

01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:57.330
That allows us to kind
of move on on this

01:24:57.330 --> 01:25:00.810
and get some things
custom, for granted,

01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:03.720
so we don't have to adapt
other things because something

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.730
else changed again.

01:25:05.730 --> 01:25:08.640
And we have these field
tests like I talked about

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.220
in Sweden and on the
glaciers, so that gives us

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.810
kind of pressure as well.

01:25:12.810 --> 01:25:17.590
Because I remember before
the week in Sweden,

01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:22.560
we basically relayed in the
lab, and we spent the night

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:26.700
to keep the 3D printer running.

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.030
And as soon as the part was
done, put the next one on,

01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:34.630
and you know, changing our--

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:38.400
being there in shifts
to keep it running.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.430
And that was a great experience
because you really have that

01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:44.040
thing to be done because
it cannot be 3D printed

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.272
in [INAUDIBLE] method.

01:25:45.272 --> 01:25:46.980
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Rafael, so why don't you

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.440
go one more minute
because we want

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.360
to do a couple of
questions also, yeah?

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.340
RAFAEL: Yeah, I'm
almost done actually.

01:25:55.340 --> 01:26:00.040
So how we structure all this
data is basically on the Wiki.

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:04.260
That allows you to go deeper
into the different parts,

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.430
and we use Trello for
defining milestones.

01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:08.980
It's an online tool--

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.800
can use for free.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.260
And the major
systems engineering

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:17.790
challenges I saw here was
especially the time management,

01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:20.730
and human factor as well
because you kind of need

01:26:20.730 --> 01:26:23.317
to have this boundary
between someone who's

01:26:23.317 --> 01:26:24.900
doing the mechanical
design, someone's

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:27.360
who is doing the
electronics design.

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.000
Don't cross the boundary
because that person

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.264
is an expert in his field.

01:26:32.264 --> 01:26:33.930
And if you just come
up with something--

01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:35.965
hey, why don't you
do this with this?

01:26:35.965 --> 01:26:37.590
First of all, it will
annoy the person.

01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:40.740
And second of all
it's like, that person

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.400
has made a lot of
thought in this,

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.440
and you shouldn't just
come with your thing

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:49.150
you have done in five minutes.

01:26:49.150 --> 01:26:50.150
Ask the right questions.

01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:54.683
And [INAUDIBLE] thought,
it's difficult to just put

01:26:54.683 --> 01:26:57.450
the design on paper
for components

01:26:57.450 --> 01:27:00.200
you haven't even tested before.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:06.070
So just like a few
seconds left for this.

01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:07.560
We go out to
[INAUDIBLE] as well.

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:10.718
So we're going to test
this rover in February

01:27:10.718 --> 01:27:14.100
in Antarctica.

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.960
We can only send
one person to there,

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.490
so we have this
agreement within 30 days.

01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:24.630
And they allowed us to send
one person in February 2016

01:27:24.630 --> 01:27:29.190
to Antarctica, and it's none
of us who's going to go.

01:27:29.190 --> 01:27:32.330
But it might be someone
or someone else.

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:36.660
And you have that chance to go
there, all expenses covered,

01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:40.590
and you will be there
as a field scientist,

01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:44.400
collaborate with the bases,
and basically produce

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.260
a paper at the end of this.

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:50.630
If you're interested,
octanis.org/apply.

01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:52.790
You'll find all the
information's there.

01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:56.370
And the deadline is
tomorrow actually.

01:27:56.370 --> 01:27:58.800
OLIVIER DE WECK: All
right, just in time.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.400
Thank you, let's
give Rafael a hand.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:07.720
OK, so we have like three to
four minutes for questions,

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:10.800
so let's start with
questions at EPFL

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:13.572
and then one question--
we'll go back and forth.

01:28:17.765 --> 01:28:19.690
AUDIENCE: And just maybe
a critical question,

01:28:19.690 --> 01:28:24.270
why did you choose to switch
from your first communication

01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:25.400
[INAUDIBLE] after?

01:28:28.354 --> 01:28:30.020
RAFAEL: [INAUDIBLE]
thing we had before?

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:33.220
AUDIENCE: Yes, and
why did you change?

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:37.270
RAFAEL: Before we had
kind of a DIY component

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:41.380
that was called AHX 1 that
there you basically had

01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:43.900
to modulate the
signal that you're

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:47.170
going to transmit yourself, and
it was just way too complex.

01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:50.830
The new component, you can
just send zero commands

01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:54.550
by [INAUDIBLE],, and it
will just do its job.

01:28:54.550 --> 01:29:00.320
And it's higher range, as well,
and lower power consumption.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.920
AUDIENCE: And how you shoot
to have a [INAUDIBLE]??

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.730
RAFAEL: Oh, sorry,
yeah, that component's

01:29:06.730 --> 01:29:10.660
only to communicate from
the rover to the base,

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:13.460
so that will be
like 20 kilometers.

01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:19.131
For the coverage to the land,
we'll use the Iridium network.

01:29:19.131 --> 01:29:21.365
Any questions at MIT?

01:29:21.365 --> 01:29:22.240
OLIVIER DE WECK: Sam?

01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:26.710
SAM: This is really
interesting, thanks.

01:29:26.710 --> 01:29:28.510
So I was wondering,
with your focus

01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:32.860
on openness and
affordability, I guess, do

01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:37.060
you foresee any participation
by the public in terms

01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:42.280
of like prototyping and testing
or even improving the design--

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:45.540
and/or data analysis?

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:48.130
RAFAEL: Yeah, well,
we're completely open,

01:29:48.130 --> 01:29:51.880
so we are based here in
[INAUDIBLE] in a place

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:55.575
called [INAUDIBLE] hacker
space, maker space,

01:29:55.575 --> 01:29:57.066
whatever you want to call it.

01:29:57.066 --> 01:30:01.150
We have open nights over
Wednesdays, so anyone can come.

01:30:01.150 --> 01:30:04.330
And all our design is
on GitHub, so if there's

01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:06.207
going to be remote
collaborations,

01:30:06.207 --> 01:30:07.540
we would really appreciate that.

01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:09.810
So anyone who is
interested in the project,

01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:13.500
you can go on our
website, octanis.org/join,

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:19.927
and we [INAUDIBLE] to
collaborate, of course.

01:30:19.927 --> 01:30:21.900
Does that answer your question?

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:23.690
SAM: Yes, thank you.

01:30:23.690 --> 01:30:25.690
OLIVIER DE WECK: I'd like
to ask you a question.

01:30:25.690 --> 01:30:28.450
So you know, I think one of
the things that was quite--

01:30:28.450 --> 01:30:30.850
first of all, the enthusiasm
that you guys have

01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:32.686
is infectious.

01:30:32.686 --> 01:30:34.060
It's very clear
you guys are very

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:38.420
passionate about this mission,
and it's very exciting.

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:40.450
The fact that you didn't
do these milestones,

01:30:40.450 --> 01:30:42.610
you didn't do a
formal PDR or CDR,

01:30:42.610 --> 01:30:45.940
but you're doing essentially,
kind of spiral development.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.980
So two questions,
one is how many

01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.770
more spirals do you think
you'll be able to do before you

01:30:50.770 --> 01:30:53.680
actually deploy the rover?

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.520
Because you said
you did two spirals.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.310
It sounds like so far.

01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:58.690
So how many more spirals?

01:30:58.690 --> 01:31:04.050
And how will you know whether
your mission was successful

01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:04.630
or not?

01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:07.890
So what are the success
criteria in the end?

01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:12.780
When you look back at
the actual operation,

01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:17.260
how will you decide whether
you were successful or not?

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:18.176
RAFAEL: OK, thank you.

01:31:18.176 --> 01:31:22.580
So for the first one,
we had our design freeze

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:25.143
for the last iteration already.

01:31:25.143 --> 01:31:29.480
The truth is we're still
adapting some points of it

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:33.290
because technically, we
decided on all the parts,

01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:35.810
and we're just
implementing it right now,

01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:38.660
and refinding it, and
correcting the bugs.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.400
So that was actually done.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.330
And we're now building
the last prototype

01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:49.100
or the last, actually, robot
that is going to go there.

01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:51.210
And on the thing about
achieving our goal,

01:31:51.210 --> 01:31:55.520
so what are the
mission criterias,

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.880
that's going to be written
down in the project proposal,

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:02.980
or the paper, that we're going
to give to our stakeholders.

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:06.450
So the Antarctica
Institute of Ecuador.

01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:15.110
So one part will be the
power autonomy and also

01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:17.350
the communication--

01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:21.070
like, it has a
reliable communication.

01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:24.720
And one part will be also
the scientific payload,

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.860
there will be insights
of conducting experiments

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:28.460
on the field.

01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:32.857
You want to add something, Sam?

01:32:32.857 --> 01:32:39.000
SAM: Yes, 100 meters
per day [INAUDIBLE]

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.720
Very concrete
goals, can we drive

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.350
100 meters per day, yes or no?

01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:47.720
Can we log every
minute, every data point

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.190
that we collect temperature
pressure, et cetera?

01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:53.700
Can we log that, and can
we send that to the base?

01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:57.650
Like, does the 15
kilometer range of the LoRa

01:32:57.650 --> 01:32:59.730
is that [INAUDIBLE] or not?

01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:01.220
Does that work?

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:04.670
And of course, does the
satellite communications work?

01:33:04.670 --> 01:33:08.720
So once they will send
back a summary of the data,

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.122
and we want to
see if that works,

01:33:11.122 --> 01:33:12.830
if we can calculate
all the stuff that we

01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:16.030
want, on the rover,
and if we get

01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:18.246
that stuff back [INAUDIBLE]?

01:33:18.246 --> 01:33:20.300
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Good, thank you.

01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:21.150
One final question?

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.940
Anybody at EPFL?

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:26.530
Here at MIT?

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.990
OK, Sam has one more.

01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:34.350
SAM: I just have
a question about--

01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:36.920
because it's going to be, I
guess, situated near our base,

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.230
is there any thought
about, sort of like,

01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:43.340
how maintenance would work
when it's in operation

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.340
or if something happens?

01:33:49.675 --> 01:33:51.762
RAFAEL: Well, the person
who is going to be there

01:33:51.762 --> 01:33:54.250
will be in charge of
doing maintenance,

01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:57.027
so if something happens,
if it gets stuck somewhere,

01:33:57.027 --> 01:33:58.460
he will rescue it.

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:03.090
And if some parts fall, he'll
provide the replacement parts,

01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:06.120
of course, so we will not
just send that thing there

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.290
and hope it works.

01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:13.497
Yeah, we have some
backup plans as well.

01:34:13.497 --> 01:34:14.330
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:14.829
SAM: Great.

01:34:14.829 --> 01:34:17.210
OLIVIER DE WECK: Sounds
like Sam is interested.

01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:19.500
RAFAEL: We have another
question here at EPFL as well.

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.520
OLIVIER DE WECK:
OK, do one more,

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.190
and then we'll
close the session.

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:24.201
Go ahead.

01:34:24.201 --> 01:34:25.700
AUDIENCE: Well, I
was just wondering

01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:29.270
if you believe-- if you had
followed all what we have seen

01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:32.300
here in this class about
the procedures, PDR, CDR,

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:36.320
and so on, would that
have hindered you

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.540
in being so reactive?

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:41.555
Or do you feel that you
can be reactive while still

01:34:41.555 --> 01:34:43.695
following all those procedures?

01:34:46.365 --> 01:34:49.935
RAFAEL: A good
question, thank you.

01:34:49.935 --> 01:34:53.635
Certain points of the
concepts that we have seen

01:34:53.635 --> 01:34:58.030
would have improved,
especially the efficiency

01:34:58.030 --> 01:35:00.550
in the design procedure.

01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:05.350
So going down step
by step would help

01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:11.320
us to exactly create
what we defined before

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:14.770
and not go too much into
different directions.

01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:19.650
But on the other hand, the fact
that we explore our traits,

01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:21.600
those [INAUDIBLE]
in the beginning,

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.470
makes that we might have an
even better solution because we

01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:28.570
wouldn't have thought
about this before when

01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:31.940
we were in the upper
part of the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.150
So it's kind of a mix.

01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:38.560
I think a mix of this is
really the perfect approach

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:40.700
for our project.

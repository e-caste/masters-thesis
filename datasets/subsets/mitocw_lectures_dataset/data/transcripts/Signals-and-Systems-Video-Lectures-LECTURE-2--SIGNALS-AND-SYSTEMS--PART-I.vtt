00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.110
PROFESSOR: In the last lecture,
I introduced and

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.610
illustrated the kinds of signals
and systems that we'll

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.010
be dealing with throughout
this course.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.820
In today's lecture I'd like to
be a little more specific, and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.080
in particular, talk about some
of the basic signals, both

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.430
continuous-time and
discrete-time that will form

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.020
important building blocks as
the course progresses.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.420
Let's begin with one signal, the
continuous-time sinusoidal

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.550
signal, which perhaps
you're already

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.650
somewhat familiar with.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.790
Mathematically, the
continuous-time sinusoidal

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.500
signal is expressed as
I've indicated here.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.750
There are three parameters,
A, omega_0 and phi.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.760
The parameter A is referred
to as the amplitude, the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.150
parameter omega 0 as the
frequency, and the parameter

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.950
phi as the phase.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.010
And graphically, the
continuous-time sinusoidal

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.440
signal has the form
shown here.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.759
Now, the sinusoidal signal
has a number of important

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.160
properties that we'll find it
convenient to exploit as the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.800
course goes along, one of which
is the fact that the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.250
sinusoidal signal is what is
referred to as periodic.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.920
What I mean by periodic is that
under an appropriate time

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.380
shift, which I indicate here as
T_0, the signal replicates

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.110
or repeats itself.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.820
Or said another way, if we shift
the time origin by an

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.690
appropriate amount T_0, the
smallest value T_0 being

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.190
referred to as the period,
then x(t) is

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.420
equal to itself, shifted.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.630
And we can demonstrate it
mathematically by simply

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.700
substituting into the
mathematical expression for

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.630
the sinusoidal signal t
+ T_0, in place of t.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.310
When we carry out the expansion
we then have, for

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:20.040
the argument of the sinusoid,
omega_0 t + omega_0 T_0 + phi.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.350
Now, one of the things that
we know about sinusoidal

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.080
functions is that if you change
the argument by any

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.630
integer multiple of 2 pi,
then the function

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.320
has the same value.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.110
And so we can exploit that
here, in particular with

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.400
omega_0 T_0 and integer
multiple of 2 pi.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.700
Then the right-hand side of this
equation is equal to the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.040
left-hand side of
the equation.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.880
So with omega_0 T_0 equal to 2
pi times an integer, or T_0

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.420
equal to 2 pi times an
integer divided by

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.280
omega_0, the signal repeats.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.700
The period is defined as the
smallest value of T_0.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.750
And so the period is 2 pi
divided by omega_0.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.190
And going back to
our sinusoidal

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.160
signal, we can see that--

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.100
and I've indicated here, then,
the period as 2 pi / omega_0.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.990
And that's the value under
which the signal repeats.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.710
Now in addition, a useful
property of the sinusoidal

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.070
signal is the fact that a time
shift of a sinusoid is

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.290
equivalent to a phase change.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.670
And we can demonstrate that
again mathematically, in

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.610
particular if we put the
sinusoidal signal

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.540
under a time shift--

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.710
I've indicated the time
shift that I'm

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.680
talking about by t_0--

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.570
and expand this out, then we see
that that is equivalent to

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.760
a change in phase.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.640
And an important thing to
recognize about this statement

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.260
is that not only is a time
shift generating a phase

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.890
change, but, in fact, if we
inserted a phase change, there

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.570
is always a value of t_0 which
would correspond to an

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.420
equivalent time shift.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.630
Said another way, if we take
omega_0 t_0 and think of that

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.190
as our change in phase, for any
change in phase, we can

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.900
solve this equation for a time
shift, or conversely for any

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.810
value of time shift,
that represents

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.740
an appropriate phase.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.820
So a time shift corresponds to
a phase change, and a phase

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.970
change, likewise, corresponds
to time shift.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:11.160
And so for example, if we look
at the general sinusoidal

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.530
signal that we saw previously,
in effect, changing the phase

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.090
corresponds to moving
this signal in time

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.990
one way or the other.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.110
For example, if we look at the
sinusoidal signal with a phase

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.820
equal to 0 that corresponds
to locating the time

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.950
origin at this peak.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:41.820
And I've indicated that on
the following graph.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.980
So here we have illustrated a
sinusoid with 0 phase, or a

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.650
cosine with 0 phase,
corresponding to taking our

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.890
general picture and
shifting it.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.730
Shifting it appropriately
as I've indicated here.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.370
This, of course, still has the
property that it's a periodic

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.520
function, since we simply
displaced it in time.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.580
And by looking at the graph,
what we see is that it has

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.540
another very important property,
a property referred

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.070
to as even.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.180
And that's a property that we'll
find useful, in general,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.970
to refer to in relation
to signals.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.860
A signal is said to be even if,
when we reflect it about

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.170
the origin, it looks
exactly the same.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.600
So it's symmetric about
the origin.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.670
And looking at this
sinusoid, that, in

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.010
fact, has that property.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.550
And mathematically, the
statement that it's even is

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.570
equivalent to the statement that
if we replace the time

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.630
argument by its negative,
the function

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.070
itself doesn't change.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.660
Now this corresponded to a
phase shift of 0 in our

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.990
original cosine expression.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.350
If instead, we had chosen a
phase shift of, let's say,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.275
-pi/2, then instead of a
cosinusoidal signal, what we

00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:14.770
would regenerate is a sinusoid
with the appropriate phase.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:22.260
Or, said another way, if we take
our original cosine and

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.120
substitute in for the phase
-pi/2, then of course we have

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.540
this mathematical expression.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.900
Using just straightforward
trigonometric identities, we

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.799
can express that alternately
as sin(omega_0*t).

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.990
The frequency and amplitude,
of course, haven't changed.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.750
And that, you can convince
yourself, also is equivalent

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.500
to shifting the cosine by an
amount in time that I've

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.600
indicated here, namely a
quarter of a period.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:00.160
So illustrated below is the
graph now, when we have a

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:07.290
phase of -pi/2 in our cosine,
which is a sinusoidal signal.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.270
Of course, it's still
periodic.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:15.220
It's periodic with a period of
2 pi / omega_0 again, because

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.690
all that we've done by
introducing a phase change is

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.940
introduced the time shift.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.420
Now, when we look at the
sinusoid in comparison with

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.730
the cosine, namely with this
particular choice of phase,

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.960
this has a different symmetry,
and that symmetry

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.020
is referred to odd.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.590
What odd symmetry means,
graphically, is that when we

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:50.230
flip the signal about the time
origin, we also multiply it by

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.410
a minus sign.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.110
So that's, in effect,
anti-symmetric.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.880
It's not the mirror image,
but it's the mirror

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.390
image flipped over.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.420
And we'll find many occasions,
not only to refer to signals

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.610
more general than sinusoidal
signals, as even in some cases

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.950
and odd in other cases.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:14.240
And in general, mathematically,
an odd signal

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:22.190
is one which satisfies the
algebraic expression, x(t).

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:29.660
When you replace t by its
negative, is equal to -x(-t).

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:35.640
So replacing the argument by its
negative corresponds to an

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.910
algebraic sign reversal.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:39.900
OK.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.610
So this is the class of
continuous-time sinusoids.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.470
We'll have a little more
to say about it later.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.720
But I'd now like to turn to
discrete-time sinusoids.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.790
What we'll see is that
discrete-time sinusoids are

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.070
very much like continuous-time
ones, but also with some very

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.650
important differences.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.920
And we want to focus, not only
on the similarities, but also

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.040
on the differences.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.530
Well, let's begin with the
mathematical expression.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:16.740
A discrete-time sinusoidal
signal, mathematically, is as

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:22.040
I've indicated here, A
cos(omega_0 n + phi).

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.050
And just as in the
continuous-time case, the

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:31.360
parameter A is what we'll refer
to as the amplitude,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:39.820
omega_0 as the frequency,
and phi as the phase.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:46.420
And I've illustrated here
several discrete-time

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.480
sinusoidal signals.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.000
And they kind of look similar.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.720
In fact, if you track what
you might think of as the

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.670
envelope, it looks very much
like what a continuous-time

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.090
sinusoid might look like.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.720
But keep in mind that the
independent variable, in this

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.890
case, is an integer variable.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:13.050
And so the sequence only takes
on values at integer values of

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.810
the argument.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:19.540
And we'll see that has a very
important implication, and

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.000
we'll see that shortly.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.950
Now, one of the issues that
we addressed in the

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.500
continuous-time case
was periodicity.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:33.150
And I want to return to that
shortly, because that is one

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.085
of the areas where there is
an important distinction.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.880
Let's first, though, examine the
statement similar to the

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.170
one that we examined for
continuous time, namely the

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:51.730
relationship between a time
shift and a phase change.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.490
Now, in continuous time, of
course, we saw that a time

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.360
shift corresponds to a phase
change, and vice versa.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.460
Let's first look at the
relationship between shifting

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.470
time and generating
a change in phase.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.400
In particular for discrete time,
if I implement a time

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.480
shift that generates
a phase change--

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.160
and we can see that easily
by simply inserting a

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.300
time shift, n + n_0.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.860
And if we expand out this
argument, we have omega_0 n +

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.670
omega_0 n_0.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.300
And so I've done that on the
right-hand side of the

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.900
equation here.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.300
And the omega_0 n_0, then,
simply corresponds

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.360
to a change in phase.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:51.390
So clearly, a shift in time
generates a change in phase.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:57.650
And for example, if we take a
particular sinusoidal signal,

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.050
let's say we take the cosine
signal at a particular

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:06.830
frequency, and with a phase
equal to 0, a sequence that we

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:12.370
might generate is one that
I've illustrated here.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.510
So what I'm illustrating
here is the cosine

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.230
signal with 0 phase.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.570
And it has a particular behavior
to it, which will

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.600
depend somewhat on
the frequency.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:34.310
If I now take this same sequence
and shift it so that

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:39.230
the time origin is shifted a
quarter of a period away, then

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.140
you can convince yourself--

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.780
and it's straightforward to
work out-- that that time

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:49.030
shift corresponds to a
phase shift of pi/2.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:57.580
So in that case, with the cosine
with a phase of -pi/2,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:05.410
that will correspond to the
expression that I have here.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.900
We could alternately write
that, using again a

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.080
trigonometric identity,
as a sine function.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.790
And that, I've stated, is
equivalent to a time shift.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:23.360
Namely, this shift of pi/2 is
equal to a certain time shift,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.470
and the time shift for this
particular example is a

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.560
quarter of a period.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.210
So here, we have the sinusoid.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.700
Previously we had the cosine.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.590
The cosine was exactly the same
sequence, but with the

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.520
origin located here.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.310
And in fact, that's exactly the
way we drew this graph.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.120
Namely, we just simply took the
same values and changed

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.330
the time origin.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.070
Now, looking at this sequence,
which is the sinusoidal

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:01.120
sequence, the phase of -pi/2,
that has a certain symmetry.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.440
And in fact, what we see is that
it has an odd symmetry,

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.790
just as in the continuous-time
case.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.190
Namely, if we take that
sequence, flip it about the

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:15.080
axis, and flip it over in sign,
that we get the same

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.380
sequence back again.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:22.050
Whereas with 0 phase
corresponding to the cosine

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.330
that I showed previously, that
has an even symmetry.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:31.070
Namely, if I flip it about the
time origin and don't do a

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.650
sign reversal, then the sequence
is maintained.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:40.650
So here, we have an odd
symmetry, expressed

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.840
mathematically as
I've indicated.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.980
Namely, replacing the
independent variable by its

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:52.370
negative attaches a negative
sign to the whole sequence.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:17:00.660
Whereas in the previous case,
what we have is 0 phase and an

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.230
even symmetry.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.240
And that's expressed
mathematically as x[n]

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.490
= x[-n].

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.900
Now, one of the things I've
said so far about

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.849
discrete-time sinusoids is that
a time shift corresponds

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.140
to a phase change.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.960
And we can then ask whether the
reverse statement is also

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.950
true, and we knew that the
reverse statement was true in

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.160
continuous time.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:38.920
Specifically, is it true that
a phase change always

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.580
corresponds to a time shift?

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.100
Now, we know that that is
true, namely, that this

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.160
statement works both ways
in continuous time.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.300
Does it in discrete time?

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:54.040
Well, the answer, somewhat
interestingly or surprisingly

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.480
until you sit down and think
about it, is no.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.460
It is not necessarily true in
discrete time that any phase

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.830
change can be interpreted
as a simple time

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.430
shift of the sequence.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.210
And let me just indicate
what the problem is.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:17.880
If we look at the relationship
between the left side and the

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.660
right side of this equation,
expanding this out as we did

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:27.950
previously, we have that omega_0
n + omega_0 n_0 must

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.370
correspond to omega_0 n + phi.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.200
And so omega_0 n_0
must correspond

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.630
to the phase change.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:43.200
Now, what you can see pretty
clearly is that depending on

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.730
the relationship between phi
and omega_0, n_0 may or may

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.950
not come out to be an integer.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:56.400
Now, in continuous time, the
amount of time shift did not

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.350
have to be an integer amount.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.520
In discrete time, when we talk
about a time shift, the amount

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.760
of time shift-- obviously,
because of the nature of

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.270
discrete time signals--

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.640
must be an integer.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.570
So the phase changes related
to time shifts must satisfy

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.580
this particular relationship.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.380
Namely, that omega_0 n_0, where
n_0 is an integer, is

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.145
equal to the change in phase.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.480
OK.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.350
Now, that's one distinction
between continuous time and

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.290
discrete time.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.530
Let's now focus on another
one, namely the issue of

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.190
periodicity.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.930
And what we'll see is that
again, whereas in continuous

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.930
time, all continuous-time
sinusoids are periodic, in the

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.220
discrete-time case that is
not necessarily true.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.960
To explore that a little more
carefully, let's look at the

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.750
expression, again, for a general
sinusoidal signal with

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.520
an arbitrary amplitude,
frequency, and phase.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.590
And for this to be periodic,
what we require is that there

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:15.850
be some value, N, under which,
when we shift the sequence by

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.150
that amount, we get the same
sequence back again.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.000
And the smallest-value
N is what we've

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.050
defined as the period.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.870
Now, when we try that on a
sinusoid, we of course

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:35.460
substitute in for n, n + N.
And when we expand out the

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:41.910
argument here, we'll get the
argument that I have on the

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.210
right-hand side.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.960
And in order for this to repeat,
in other words, in

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:55.630
order for us to discard this
term, omega_0 N, where N is

00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.100
the period, must be an integer
multiple of 2 pi.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:06.720
And in that case, it's periodic
as long as omega_0 N,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.550
N being the period, is 2
pi times an integer.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.550
Just simply dividing this out,
we have N, the period, is 2 pi

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.900
m / omega_0.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.880
Well, you could say, OK
what's the big deal?

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.690
Whatever N happens to come out
to be when we do that little

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.010
bit of algebra, that's
the period.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:35.910
But in fact, N, or 2 pi m /
omega_0, may not ever come out

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.270
to be an integer.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.970
Or it may not come out
to be the one that

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:39.850
you thought it might.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.340
For example, let's look at some

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.895
particular sinusoidal signals.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:49.430
Let's see.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:53.160
We have the first one
here, which is a

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.880
sinusoid, as I've shown.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.110
And it has a frequency, what
I've referred to as the

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:05.130
frequency, omega_0
= 2 pi / 12.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:11.720
And what we'd like to look at
is 2 pi / omega_0, then find

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.070
an integer to multiply
that by in order

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.740
to get another integer.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.110
Let's just try that here.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:24.760
If we look at 2 pi / omega_0, 2
pi / omega_0, for this case,

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.130
is equal to 12.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.530
Well, that's fine.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.890
12 is an integer.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:35.030
So what that says is that this
sinusoidal signal is periodic.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:39.990
And in fact, it's periodic
with a period of 12.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.820
Let's look at the next one.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.810
The next one, we would have
2 pi / omega_0 again.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.060
And that's equal to 31/4.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:57.080
So what that says is that
the period is 31/4.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.440
But wait a minute.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.730
31/4 isn't an integer.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.820
We have to multiply
that by an integer

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.730
to get another integer.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:09.680
Well, we'd multiply that by 4,
so (2 pi / omega_0) times 4 is

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.790
31, 31 is an integer.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.290
And so what that says is this is
periodic, not with a period

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:22.130
of 2 pi / omega_0, but with a
period of (2 pi / omega_0)

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.950
times 4, namely with
a period of 31.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.310
Finally, let's take the example
where omega_0 is equal

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.030
to 1/6, as I've shown here.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.330
That actually looks, if you
track it with your eye, like

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.970
it's periodic.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:47.660
2 pi / omega_0, in that case,
is equal to 12 pi.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:53.070
Well, what integer can I
multiply 12 pi by and get

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.400
another integer?

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.350
The answer is none, because pi
is an irrational number.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:03.860
So in fact, what that says is
that if you look at this

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.380
sinusoidal signal, it's not
periodic at all, even though

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.120
you might fool yourself into
thinking it is simply because

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.830
the envelope looks periodic.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.510
Namely, the continuous-time
equivalent of this is

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.580
periodic, the discrete-time
sequence is not.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.180
OK.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.860
Well, we've seen, then, some
important distinctions between

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.780
continuous-time sinusoidal
signals and discrete-time

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.730
sinusoidal signals.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.900
The first one is the fact that
in the continuous-time case, a

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.830
time shift and phase change
are always equivalent.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.210
Whereas in the discrete-time
case, in effect, it works one

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.400
way but not the other way.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:58.060
We've also seen that for a
continuous-time signal, the

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.990
continuous-time signal is always
periodic, whereas the

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.850
discrete-time signal
is not necessarily.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.640
In particular, for the
continuous-time case, if we

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.320
have a general expression for
the sinusoidal signal that

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.650
I've indicated here,
that's periodic for

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.440
any choice of omega_0.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:30.880
Whereas in the discrete-time
case, it's periodic only if 2

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.740
pi / omega_0 can be multiplied
by an integer

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.020
to get another integer.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.470
Now, another important and,
as it turns out, useful

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.940
distinction between the
continuous-time and

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.370
discrete-time case is the fact
that in the discrete-time

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:56.550
case, as we vary what I've
called the frequency omega_0,

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:02.390
we only see distinct
signals as omega_0

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.900
varies over a 2 pi interval.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.940
And if we let omega_0 vary
outside the range of, let's

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:15.130
say, -pi to pi, or 0 to 2 pi,
we'll see the same sequences

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.870
all over again, even though at
first glance, the mathematical

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.870
expression might
look different.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:26.980
So in the discrete-time case,
this class of signals is

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:33.340
identical for values of omega_0
separated by 2 pi,

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.890
whereas in the continuous-time
case, that is not true.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.020
In particular, if I consider
these sinusoidal

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:48.260
continuous-time signals, as I
vary omega_0, what will happen

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:53.200
is that I will always see
different sinusoidal signals.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.210
Namely, these won't be equal.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:27:00.970
And in effect, we can justify
that statement algebraically.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:04.410
And I won't take the time
to do it carefully.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:09.670
But let's look, first of all,
at the discrete-time case.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:15.130
And the statement that I'm
making is that if I have two

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.700
discrete-time sinusoidal signals
at two different

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:24.980
frequencies, and if these
frequencies are separated by

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:30.170
an integer multiple of 2 pi--
namely if omega_2 is equal to

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:35.650
omega_1 + 2 pi times
an integer m--

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:40.070
when I substitute this into this
expression, because of

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:46.330
the fact that n is also an
integer, I'll have m * n as an

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.270
integer multiple of 2 pi.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.520
And that term, of course, will
disappear because of the

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.370
periodicity of the sinusoid,
and these two

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.350
sequences will be equal.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:03.450
On the other hand in the
continuous-time case, since t

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.560
is not restricted to be an
integer variable, for

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.230
different values of omega_1 and
omega_2, these sinusoidal

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.770
signals will always
be different.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:17.650
OK.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.540
Now, many of the issues that
I've raised so far, in

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.550
relation to sinusoidal signals,
are elaborated on in

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.240
more detail in the text.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.890
And of course, you'll have an
opportunity to exercise some

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:36.150
of this as you work through
the video course manual.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.550
Let me stress that sinusoidal
signals will play an extremely

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:44.260
important role for us as
building blocks for general

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.770
signals and descriptions of
systems, and leads to the

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:51.870
whole concept Fourier analysis,
which is very

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.755
heavily exploited throughout
the course.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:02.870
What I'd now like to turn to is
another class of important

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:03.780
building blocks.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.820
And in fact, we'll see that
under certain conditions,

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.970
these relate strongly to
sinusoidal signals, namely the

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.580
class of real and complex
exponentials.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.810
Let me begin, first of all, with
the real exponential, and

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:23.420
in particular, in the
continuous-time case.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.980
A real continuous-time
exponential is mathematically

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:36.000
expressed, as I indicate here,
x(t) = C e ^ (a t), where for

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.320
the real exponential, C and
a are real numbers.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.900
And that's what we mean by
the real exponential.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.010
Shortly, we'll also consider
complex exponentials, where

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.240
these numbers can then
become complex.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.120
So this is an exponential
function.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:59.220
And for example, if the
parameter a is positive, that

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.320
means that we have a growing
exponential function.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.410
If the parameter a is negative,
then that means that

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:13.760
we have a decaying exponential
function.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.750
Now, somewhat as an aside, it's
kind of interesting to

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:23.160
note that for exponentials, a
time shift corresponds to a

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.950
scale change, which is somewhat
different than what

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.700
happens with sinusoids.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.380
In the sinusoidal case, we saw
that a time shift corresponded

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.940
to a phase change.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.850
With the real exponential, a
time shift, as it turns out,

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.070
corresponds to simply
changing the scale.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:45.730
There's nothing particularly
crucial or

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.300
exciting about that.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.050
And in fact, perhaps stressing
it is a little misleading.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.620
For general functions, of
course, about all that you can

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.430
say about what happens when you
implement a time shift is

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.720
that it implements
a time shift.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.060
OK.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.890
So here's the real
exponential.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.600
Just C e ^ (a t).

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.160
Let's look at the real
exponential, now, in the

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.480
discrete-time case.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:21.550
And in the discrete-time case,
we have several alternate ways

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.910
of expressing it.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:29.020
We can express the real
exponential in the form C e ^

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:35.120
(beta n), or as we'll find more
convenient, in part for a

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.810
reason at I'll indicate shortly,
we can rewrite this

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:44.820
as C alpha ^ n, where of course,
alpha = e ^ beta.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.610
More typically in the
discrete-time case, we'll

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:53.720
express the exponential
as C alpha ^ n.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.690
So for example, this becomes,
essentially, a geometric

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:01.920
series or progression
as n continues for

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.740
certain values of alpha.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:11.070
Here for example, we have for
alpha greater than 0, first of

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:15.010
all on the top, the case where
the magnitude of alpha is

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:21.430
greater than 1, so that the
sequence is exponentially or

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.420
geometrically growing.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.770
On the bottom, again with alpha
positive, but now with

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:32.517
its magnitude less than 1, we
have a geometric progression

00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:38.360
that is exponentially or
geometrically decaying.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:38.650
OK.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.350
So this, in both of these
cases, is with alpha

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.070
greater than 0.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:48.480
Now the function that we're
talking about is alpha ^ n.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.310
And of course, what you can
see is that if alpha is

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:57.910
negative instead of positive,
then when n is even, that

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.620
minus sign is going
to disappear.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.320
When n is odd, there will
be a minus sign.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.610
And so for alpha negative, the
sequence is going to alternate

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.500
positive and negative values.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:15.870
So for example, here we have
alpha negative, with its

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.230
magnitude less than 1.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:21.130
And you can see that, again,
its envelope decays

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.320
geometrically, and the values
alternate in sign.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:29.310
And here we have the magnitude
of alpha greater than 1, with

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.600
alpha negative.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.360
Again, they alternate in sign,
and of course it's growing

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.740
geometrically.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:42.910
Now, if you think about alpha
positive and go back to the

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:48.640
expression that I have at the
top, namely C alpha ^ n.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.670
With alpha positive, you can
see a straightforward

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:58.440
relationship between
alpha and beta.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.830
Namely, beta is the natural
logarithm of alpha.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.830
Something to think
about is what

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.070
happens if alpha is negative?

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.230
Which is, of course, a very
important and useful class of

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:16.190
real discrete-time exponentials
also.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.560
Well, it turns out that with
alpha negative, if you try to

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:25.020
express it as C e ^ (beta n),
then beta comes out to be an

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.659
imaginary number.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:30.889
And that is one, but not the
only reason why, in the

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:36.389
discrete-time case, it's often
most convenient to phrase real

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:42.420
exponentials in the form alpha ^
n, rather than e ^ (beta n).

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:47.650
In other words, to express them
in this form rather than

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:48.900
in this form.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.699
Those are real exponentials,
continuous-time and

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:57.960
discrete-time.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.710
Now let's look at the
continuous-time complex

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.130
exponential.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:09.910
And what I mean by a complex
exponential, again, is an

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:15.750
exponential of the
form C e ^ (a t).

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:21.050
But in this case, we allow the
parameters C and a to be

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:22.970
complex numbers.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.850
And let's just track this
through algebraically.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.820
If C and a are complex numbers,
let's write C in

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.350
polar form, so it has a
magnitude and an angle.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.800
Let's write a in rectangular
form, so it has a real part

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.950
and an imaginary part.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:43.060
And when we substitute these
two in here, combine some

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.680
things together--

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.100
well actually, I haven't
combined yet.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:52.160
I have this for the amplitude
factor, and this for the

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.960
exponential factor.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.597
I can now pull out of this the
term corresponding to e ^ (r

00:35:58.597 --> 00:36:02.320
t), and combine the imaginary
parts together.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.760
And I come down to the
expression that I have here.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:12.800
So following this further, an
exponential of this form, e ^

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:19.640
(j omega) or e ^ (j phi), using
Euler's relation, can be

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:28.150
expressed as the sum of a cosine
plus j times a sine.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:31.560
And so that corresponds
to this factor.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.290
And then there is this
time-varying amplitude factor

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:36.420
on top of it.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.390
Finally putting those together,
we end up with the

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:42.580
expression that I show
on the bottom.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:49.010
And what this corresponds to are
two sinusoidal signals, 90

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.733
degrees out of phase, as
indicated by the fact that

00:36:51.733 --> 00:36:54.220
there's a cosine and a sine.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.560
So there's a real part and
an imaginary part, with

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:03.210
sinusoidal components 90 degrees
out of phase, and a

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:07.140
time-varying amplitude factor,
which is a real exponential.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.670
So it's a sinusoid multiplied by
a real exponential in both

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.870
the real part and the
imaginary part.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:19.070
And let's just see what one of
those terms might look like.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:29.290
What I've indicated at the top
is a sinusoidal signal with a

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.330
time-varying exponential
envelope, or an envelope which

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:37.780
is a real exponential, and in
particular which is growing,

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.960
namely with r greater than 0.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.430
And on the bottom, I've
indicated the same thing with

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:46.240
r less than 0.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.300
And this kind of sinusoidal
signal, by the way, is

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.730
typically referred to as
a damped sinusoid.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.110
So with r negative, what we have
in the real and imaginary

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:01.130
parts are damped sinusoids.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:07.270
And the sinusoidal components of
that are 90 degrees out of

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:12.260
phase, in the real part and
in the imaginary part.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:12.560
OK.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:17.040
Now, in the discrete-time case,
we have more or less the

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.350
same kind of outcome.

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:26.220
In particular we'll make
reference to our complex

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.860
exponentials in the
discrete-time case.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.200
The expression for the complex
exponential looks very much

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.430
like the expression for the real
exponential, except that

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.460
now we have complex factors.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:46.040
So C and alpha are
complex numbers.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:53.050
And again, if we track through
the algebra, and get to a

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:57.740
point where we have a real
exponential multiplied by a

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:03.930
factor which is a purely
imaginary exponential, apply

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:10.430
Euler's relationship to this, we
then finally come down to a

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:16.980
sequence, which has a real
exponential amplitude

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.480
multiplying one sinusoid
in the real part.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.120
And in the imaginary part,
exactly the same kind of

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.560
exponential multiplying a
sinusoid that's 90 degrees out

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.150
of phase from that.

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:37.750
And so if we look at what one
of these factors might look

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.510
like, it's what we would expect
given the analogy with

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.580
the continuous-time case.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:53.140
Namely, it's a sinusoidal
sequence with a real

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.060
exponential envelope.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.500
In the case where alpha
is positive, then

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.250
it's a growing envelope.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.050
In the case where alpha
is negative--

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.990
I'm sorry--

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:08.200
where the magnitude of alpha
is greater than 1, it's a

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.070
growing exponential envelope.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.700
Where the magnitude of alpha
is less than 1, it's a

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.570
decaying exponential envelope.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.370
And so I've illustrated
that here.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:24.050
Here we have the magnitude
of alpha greater than 1.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:27.510
And here we have the magnitude
of alpha less than 1.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.960
In both cases, sinusoidal
sequences underneath the

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.920
envelope, and then an envelope
that is dictated by what the

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.710
magnitude of alpha is.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.200
OK.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.900
Now, in the discrete-time case,
then, we have results

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.080
similar to the continuous-time
case.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:53.170
Namely, components in a real and
imaginary part that have a

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.370
real exponential factor
times a sinusoid.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:07.240
Of course, if the magnitude of
alpha is equal to 1, then this

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.010
factor disappears,
or is equal to 1.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.350
And this factor is equal to 1.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.250
And so we have sinusoids
in both the real

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.620
and imaginary parts.

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:22.660
Now, one can ask whether,
in general, the complex

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:26.580
exponential with the magnitude
of alpha equal to 1 is

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.640
periodic or not periodic.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:34.450
And the clue to that can be
inferred by examining this

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:36.680
expression.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.600
In particular, in the
discrete-time case with the

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:44.600
magnitude of alpha equal to 1,
we have pure sinusoids in the

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.250
real part and the
imaginary part.

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:51.240
And in fact, in a
continuous-time case with r

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:56.910
equal to 0, we have sinusoids
in the real part and the

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.570
imaginary part.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.520
In a continuous-time case when
we have a pure complex

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.580
exponential, so that the terms
aren't exponentially growing

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.410
or decaying, those

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:13.420
exponentials are always periodic.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.630
Because, of course, the real
and imaginary sinusoidal

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.640
components are periodic.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.100
In the discrete-time case, we
know that the sinusoids may or

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:28.150
may not be periodic, depending
on the value of omega_0.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:31.390
And so in fact, in the
discrete-time case, the

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:38.630
exponential e ^ (j omega_0 n),
that I've indicated here, may

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:42.780
or may not be periodic depending
on what the value of

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.030
omega_0 is.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:47.660
OK.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:53.410
Now, to summarize, in this
lecture I've introduced and

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:58.000
discussed a number of important
basic signals.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.710
In particular, sinusoids and
real and complex exponentials.

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:07.660
One of the important outcomes of
the discussion, emphasized

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.190
further in the text, is that
there are some very important

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:13.060
similarities between them.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.700
But there are also some very
important differences.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.770
And these differences will
surface when we exploit

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:26.220
sinusoids and complex
exponentials as basic building

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.350
blocks for more general
continuous-time and

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:32.160
discrete-time signals.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.900
In the next lecture, what I'll
discuss are some other very

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:40.070
important building blocks,
namely, what are referred to

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:43.230
as step signals and
impulse signals.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:47.970
And those, together with the
sinusoidal signals and

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:52.160
exponentials as we've talked
about today, will really form

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:57.300
the cornerstone for,
essentially, all of the signal

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.270
and system analysis that we'll
be dealing with for the

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.780
remainder of course.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.030
Thank you.

ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Greetings, everyone.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So before I start
sharing my screen,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.880 align:middle line:84%
let me ask if there
are any questions

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.110 align:middle line:90%
from the last lecture.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So, where are we
in terms of class?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:90%
We have a review session today.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:84%
The exam is next Thursday,
and it covers material

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:90%
from lectures 8 through 15.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take
questions on those,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
or scroll through them,
or review, or something.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's the main
thing that's happening.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So the overview of that
is we did the theory,

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and then we started
in risk-sharing,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:84%
with two applications,
including production.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:90%
We went to financial modeling.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Then we went to contracts to get
at obstacles, like information

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:90%
and moral hazard problems.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
We did a theory lecture of
sorts, links to Bitcoin,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and ledgers, and then
another application lecture.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:84%
We went to international trade
in the context of all raising

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:84%
equilibria, and we did two
trade lectures, including

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:90%
the one we did last time.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's the overview.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Some words about the exam,
again, even though in principle

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:84%
the thing is
comprehensive, that's

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's building on
material that had previously

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:90%
been covered.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But the focus will be on
the material from lectures 8

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:90%
through 15.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, because it's
limited to 80 minutes,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
there's no way I can ask a
question about everything

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:90%
you might be anticipating.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully, the
questions themselves

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
are reasonable, and fair,
and not terribly surprising

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
if you've been following the
lectures, doing the p-sets,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.465 align:middle line:90%
and keeping up to date.

00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have all the review
session material, as well.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the best guide
to the lectures,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:84%
or there was review
questions we do

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of each class.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Which brings me
to the next thing.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:90%
So here's the study guide.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And let's start with what we did
last time, focusing on the US.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
I talked about China shocks and
accounting identities, which

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
led up to this question using
the lens of the accounting

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:90%
identities.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:84%
What is the preliminary
evidence for the impact

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
of China shocks on the variables
of the current account?

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, I'm in the mood to take
volunteers, rather than call

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:90%
on you.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Any volunteers for that?

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:90%

AUDIENCE: Oh, let's see.

00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I think I haven't got around
to watching your last lecture

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:90%
recording yet.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not exactly sure.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:90%
But oh, yeah.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.415 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Is it this one?

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah it's in and out,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:90%
synchronous and asynchronous.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
How about is someone
ready to volunteer?

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
China shock financial
accounts and what did we find?

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I can try.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm also very unsure.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
But is this about looking
at the current account,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.905 align:middle line:84%
and how the trade balance
would be negative.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:03.805 align:middle line:84%
And then that's kind of
giving us evidence about how--

00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:06.812 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
the China shock was about how
since low-skilled workers,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
we have less of that
commodity and more

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:90%
of high-skilled workers.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So then we're like
low-skilled workers are

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.949 align:middle line:90%
going to be losing in trade.

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.323 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.323 --> 00:04:24.740 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
That's also true.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So I was in part
looking for this thing

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
about the current
account deficit.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, it's
interstate trade and states

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:84%
that are hit the
worst by China shock,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
meaning that their local
manufacturers had to compete

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:90%
with these Chinese imports.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Those states export
less to other states,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and also to some
extent, import more.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone remember what
else is on the left-hand side

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:90%
of the current account?

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Current account consists of the
trade balance plus something.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Net income?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Net income,
yeah, so meaning gifts incoming

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:84%
or remittances for
factor payments

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:90%
earned in other states.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And does anyone remember?

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.501 align:middle line:90%
Did it go up or down?

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say that I
think transfers were positive.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, good.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So this linked up
to risk-sharing.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if I
emphasized it last time.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But given that it's
quote, a "shock," a China

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
shock, or at least
an adverse trend,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
the question is,
what arrangements

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:90%
would cover these shocks?

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Public transfers
in principle could

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
have done that through
fiscal taxes and transfers.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
But what we found
in the data was

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that it was the private
transfers that seemed

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.010 align:middle line:90%
over a 10-year period to go up.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So it definitely relates to
all the risk-sharing stuff

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:84%
we did in the last few
lectures and that we

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:90%
are about to review today.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And what about the other
side of the current account,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:84%
financial stuff,
anyone remember?

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these financial
accounts are tricky.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll review it today.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't find
very much adjusting.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:84%
On the right-hand side, we
should see a given state,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
losing--

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:84%
losing its claims on foreigners
in this other states,

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
running a deficit.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So they should be running
down their savings accounts,

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But so far, we haven't
found that in the data.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's still good to know what
was the financial adjustment

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
on the right-hand side, because
the accounts have to balance.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's do one more.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
What in practice in the
US is the difficulty

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:84%
in reconciling income flows
with the change in the balance

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:90%
sheet?

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
That is to say explain what
accounting identity ought

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to hold, and what in
contrast we actually

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.950 align:middle line:84%
have in integrated macro
accounts and household surveys.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I think I could take
a shot at what identity might--

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I think I know what
the identity is.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly how
it might feel though.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.787 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Go ahead.

00:07:54.787 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Isn't like, the
identity should probably

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
be something like
the expenditures

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:84%
by households which
should be matched up

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:84%
by the incomes to whatever
firm is selling the goods

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Those two sides of
the balance sheets

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:84%
should match up if it's within
a country within the country.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.593 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
like that, is it?

00:08:22.593 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well,
it has to do more

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
with what is the relationship
between flows and the income

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.235 align:middle line:84%
statement, and assets
in the balance sheet?

00:08:31.235 --> 00:08:38.947 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:90%

ROBERT TOWNSEND: Anyone else?

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.790 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Sure, but
basically I think it all

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.410 align:middle line:84%
should be able to
match in a sense

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.535 align:middle line:84%
that we should be able to
account for these dollars

00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
on both sides, in both the
flows and in the assets.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But because of the way that
the data is structured,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.300 align:middle line:84%
there's no basically
central accounting place

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.147 align:middle line:84%
where all of these are accounted
for on a regional level

00:09:06.147 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
in a way that just like
has all of the data.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And so basically
nothing matches up.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.365 align:middle line:84%
But we had that table
with errors in the--

00:09:14.365 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:90%
I forget what it was.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.218 align:middle line:84%
Like 20 plus or percent
or something like that.

00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yes, that's correct.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Great answer.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So the logic of it is you have
flows in the income statement.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
You have revenues less
expenses equal profits,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:90%
or for households net income.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And what they don't eat
or pay out as dividends,

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.360 align:middle line:90%
they should be saving.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So the changes in the balance
sheet, some balance sheet items

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
ought to go up if households
or firms are saving.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And in practice, since
as was just said,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:84%
the balance sheet
and income statements

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.440 align:middle line:84%
are not collected
at the same time,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:84%
we see very big discrepancies
between the two.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So the rest of the class last
time, almost up to the very end

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:84%
was about what this
discrepancy means

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
for attempts to
measure inequality,

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
or the impact of
COVID, and so on.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just say
what I was trying

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to do in the class is not
to get you to memorize

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
financial account identities,
but rather to think creatively

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:84%
about how to use financial
account data, and so on.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Which brought me to
the very end, where

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I talked about trying
to fill in those gaps,

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and gathering detailed level
information from households

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:90%
in West Virginia, and so on.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.974 align:middle line:90%
But I won't ask about that.

00:11:00.974 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, that may come up
again today, actually.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to the
review from lecture 8

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:90%
on, so I will try to highlight.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
We did risk sharing in
India, in the villages,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and also in medieval England in
terms of dividing up the land.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I talked at the
beginning of the lecture

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
about the high-risk environment
and the way households could

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:84%
respond to it, either
by diversifying

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:84%
or by helping each other
out with financial gifts

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and transfers, and
then ways to test.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So in India, we decided
to test by looking

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
at incomes and consumptions, and
not looking at the mechanism.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And in contrast, with
medieval England,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
we focus more on whether
or not the mechanism

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:84%
of dividing up land could
achieve an optimal allocation.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So then we went
through characteristics

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:90%
of village economies.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And the main thing
here was the risk.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:84%
In particular, in
village India, we

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:84%
looked at the risk
of harvest yields

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:84%
on various crops, of crops by
soil type, of income by type.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And we uniformly
saw a very high risk

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:84%
on all these categories, as
well as some diversification

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:90%
possibilities.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So for income, not everyone
has the same income sources,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:90%
and there's high risk of each.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But the covariances are
sometimes relatively low.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So the focus here
was on the fact

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that households are not
completely diversified.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
If all the households
did the same thing

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.720 align:middle line:84%
if, they planted the same
crops in the same soil,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and have the same
income sources then

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
their initial outcomes would
be essentially the same.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And if that's true, then
there's not much left to share.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:90%
But we see the opposite.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:84%
We see they're not diversified
over all these various crops,

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and soils, and activities.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
idiosyncratic risk.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was what was clear
from this picture of what

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:84%
we call the Rocky Mountains,
where the ups and downs are not

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
together, not going up together
across households in a given

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:90%
year, and so on.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, they do achieve
a lot of smoothing.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So something is
happening in the villages

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that whatever mechanism it is,
is allowing them to smooth.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Now one question that's come up
in Piazza are these profiles.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean so this is
a bit of a review,

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:90%
but kind of interesting.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:84%
We see this income
profile from low to high.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Households with a lot
of land are consistently

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:84%
getting higher income,
despite the fluctuations.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
compression here.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So something is
transferring income

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
from the landed households
to the landless.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But a little bit of this
profile does remain.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.707 align:middle line:90%
So it's not equal treatment.

00:14:14.707 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though
everyone is getting

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:90%
the same amount of everything.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.510 align:middle line:84%
There is heterogeneity
in the treatment.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:84%
What that mechanism
is, is not so clear.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
It's some kind of, at
least over these 10 years,

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:84%
redistribution of income
from the wealthy to the poor.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't work perfectly.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.790 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't completely
equalize things.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So this lecture was
featuring something

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:84%
we had done in the
previous one, which

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
is to determine the pareto
optimal allocation of risk,

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
we maximize lambda weighted
sums of expected utilities,

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
subject to the
resource constraint.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And this way of
dealing with problems

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
generalizes considerably and
in the subsequent lectures.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So when we solved
this problem, we

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
looked at the first
order conditions.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We could see that weighted
marginal utilities should

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:84%
be equalized to a common
Lagrange multiplier.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can do the
algebra, and actually

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:84%
solve for the consumption
that's supposed to result,

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and get these kinds of
closed form solutions

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:29.110 align:middle line:84%
having to do with consumption
moving with the aggregate,

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and not moving at all
with idiosyncratic shocks,

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.605 align:middle line:90%
if the risk sharing is optimal.

00:15:37.605 --> 00:15:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So here is another
version of it,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
individual consumption co-moves
with aggregate consumption

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:84%
for all the households,
but should not

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:84%
move with things like
individual incomes

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
once we control
for the aggregate.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So we tested this model to see
whether these coefficients were

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:90%
0 or not, and largely they are.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean there is some
residual risk that

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:84%
is being borne by
the households,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:84%
depending on the village
and the source of income.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.253 align:middle line:84%
But the benchmark
was doing quite well.

00:16:10.253 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.550 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I
would be delighted.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean here, we assume--

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I see the sample.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:84%
There was about 40
households in each villagers.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But in this model, we
assume that the households

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:90%
should be large amount.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
If not, then the
idiosyncratic risk

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:90%
might not be shared, right?

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And for example, if there was
just two households and two

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
situations, then although they
face the idiosyncratic risks,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
but there was like 0.25
probability both of them

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.670 align:middle line:84%
were facing negative
shocks and/or both of them

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:90%
face the positive shock.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:90%
So they cannot share the risks.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So in this model, we assume
the sample is large enough.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:84%
That is why we think that the
idiosyncratic shocks will not

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:90%
affect people's consumption?

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.667 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, each household
consumption.

00:17:25.667 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's a great question.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
What can we test if we only
have a subset of the households,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.060 align:middle line:90%
and are we being misled?

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually you
could think about it

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:90%
as testing for subsets.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle line:90%
And the theory holds.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.835 align:middle line:84%
Of course, what is aggregate
consumption for two

00:17:48.835 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
households would be different
from what it would be

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:90%
if you had data on all of them.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.185 align:middle line:84%
But the theory still works
for two, or three, or just

00:17:57.185 --> 00:17:57.685 align:middle line:90%
a handful.

00:17:57.685 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
If they are bearing
risk optimally,

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.815 align:middle line:84%
then they should be bearing
risk optimally in any subset.

00:18:05.815 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Let me put that a different way.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.680 align:middle line:84%
The aggregate consumption within
the group may be moving around.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Individual consumptions in the
group should move with that.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
The group consumption
actually could

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:84%
look like an
idiosyncratic shock if we

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.450 align:middle line:90%
considered the whole village.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So yet more
restrictions are implied

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
when we and if we had data
from the larger sample.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But you can still
test the theory

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:84%
with a small number
of households.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it's
not as powerful.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:90%
You could reject, however.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.657 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:48.657 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:90%
It was a great question.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So then the next
thing we did was

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.010 align:middle line:84%
to take the same theory to
different applications, back

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
to medieval villages, and the
landholding patterns which

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:84%
are spread out all over
the different fields.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, does
that make sense or not,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and would dividing up the
land in that way exactly

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:84%
achieve an optimal allocation
of risk bearing or not.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So we took the
different types of land

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:84%
to have a different
vector of yields.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.970 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
endowment, so to speak,

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
the yields of land type
k across states epsilon.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
capital K types of land

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:90%
and capital S types of shocks.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:84%
We can look at the
covariance and the risk, just

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:90%
the way we did in India.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So again, we get this
picture, very, very

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.880 align:middle line:84%
risky with some
covariances pretty low.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I took you through
a series of examples

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:84%
to see how close we could get
to an optimal allocation of risk

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.530 align:middle line:90%
bearing.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
The first was household
1 is all of land type 1.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Household 2 has
all of land type 2.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But these returns
do not co-move,

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:16.150 align:middle line:84%
hence this would not constitute
an optimal allocation

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:90%
of risk bearing.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.210 align:middle line:90%
Household 1 would go 10, 6.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Household 2 would go 2, 4.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So although the
aggregate is going down,

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I should say, from 12 to 10,
household 2's consumption

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:84%
if they ate all their own
crops would be going up.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's a restriction.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Then we considered a
different way of doing it.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Give those household shares.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Household j say
having a share alpha j

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:90%
of the two different crops.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, this thing goes in
the aggregate 12, 10, 7.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Obviously whatever
household 1's share

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:84%
is, if it's like one third,
it's 1/3 of that aggregate.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Household 2's shares would
be 2/3 of that aggregate.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So now they're each
bearing a constant share

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.320 align:middle line:84%
of the aggregate and
their consumptions

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:90%
are moving with the aggregate.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
So that might actually work.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:90%
That's this.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we looked at
special utility functions,

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and started fussing about
intercepts, and risk aversion,

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But then we come
to the general idea

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that we have as many land types
with independent return vectors

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:90%
as we have states of the world.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a target
optimal consumption allocation.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to achieve
this allocation that

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:84%
came from maximizing a lambda
weighted sums of utilities

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:84%
by dividing the different
land types into shares.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Except now we have
even more power,

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:84%
because we do not require
that household j have

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:84%
the same shares and all
of the land types k.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
We have this alpha jk for
household j in the land type k.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's not perfect.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
But in general, since
this vector of endowments

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:84%
is non-singular, you can
solve for the consumptions.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And one hopes that the shares
will be positive in the end.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So if there are as
many types of land

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:84%
as there are states
of the world,

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:84%
they have a shot at achieving
the optimum by entirely

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
dividing up the
land, and not having

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.340 align:middle line:84%
to give gifts or transfers to
one another after the fact.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:90%
So then we come to--

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:84%
we put in particular
utility functions,

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and we assumed that
we're going to solve

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:84%
this problem, maximizing lambda
weighted sums of utilities,

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:90%
by the shares alpha jk.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
assume that there

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
are fewer land types than
there are states of the world,

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
namely only two types
of land, and a larger

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.190 align:middle line:90%
number as states of the world.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, we know we in general
cannot achieve an optimum.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But we were trying to describe
this constrained optimal

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:90%
arrangement.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I guess what I want to emphasize
is despite the restrictions,

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
we're still solving this
programming problem.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:84%
We're maximizing
lambda weighted sums

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:84%
of utilities subject
to constraints,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.410 align:middle line:84%
namely the shares
have to add up.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So the method of
achieving characterizing

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
pareto optimal
allocations is the same.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we looked to see
with those particular utility

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:84%
functions how far off we would
be from achieving the optimum.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And here you can actually see,
as the aggregate endowment

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:90%
moves the adjustment.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, even if they
did as much as they could

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:84%
by dividing up the two land
types, it would not be perfect.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And there should be incoming
or outgoing transfers

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
to try to make up the difference
to get to the full risk sharing

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:90%
optimum.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
end of this lecture.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Are there questions
about what we did

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.525 align:middle line:84%
or what we were trying to
accomplish in lecture 8?

00:24:07.525 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So then the second of the
two application lectures

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
included production
in lecture 9.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And the main difference
between what we did just now

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and this lecture, is we actually
have physical production,

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:84%
rather than treating
output as an endowment.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But we still solve this
programming problem.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're maximizing
lambda weighted sums

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:84%
of expected utilities,
just as before,

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
subject to resource
constraints, just as before.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:84%
The choice variables now include
the transfers, just as before,

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:84%
but we also are
choosing which projects

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:84%
to fund and by how much
capital investment.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So the reason that transfers
are the same as before,

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
is because we have
transfers or consumption.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:84%
You can move consumption
around by moving transfers.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's arbitrary choice
whether to solve for c or tau.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The more interesting
part, because it's

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:84%
new to this lecture,
are these capital

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.550 align:middle line:84%
stocks, which has to
do with deciding what

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:84%
to do with the current wealth,
namely eat it or invested

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:90%
in projects for tomorrow.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Here is the starting
point, w, which

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:84%
is the trees and the
fruit from the trees.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And this was the ending point,
what to do, either eat or save.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh then, back to the
accounting identities,

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:84%
you either eat something or
save something, as in the flows.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So we got two first order
conditions out of this problem,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
one very familiar, lambda
weighted marginal utilities

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:90%
are equated to each other.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
We also got a new
equation having

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:84%
to do with the marginal
utility of consumption today,

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and the marginal utility
of consumption next period.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And those typically will
balance each other off

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:90%
for any project they're running.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
There was an issue that this
thing could have been negative,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.342 align:middle line:84%
in which case that project
would not be implemented,

00:26:16.342 --> 00:26:18.800 align:middle line:84%
because they would actually
not want to put stuff in there.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:90%
They'd want to take stuff out.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:90%
But they hit zero.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So the rest of it was
to take expressions

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.440 align:middle line:84%
for these first
order conditions,

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.630 align:middle line:90%
and start manipulating them.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
review that today.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.800 align:middle line:90%
It's algebra.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:90%
It's straightforward.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:84%
We can even make
some assumptions

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:84%
about linear technologies,
subject to risk,

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:90%
and quadratic utility functions.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we did that, we
got two expressions directly

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:84%
from the theory that we
could take to the data.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:84%
One, we can measure
from the data

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
how household j returns
are moving with the village

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:84%
aggregate return,
this beta being

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:84%
a measure of the covariation
of household j's return

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:90%
with the village average.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Then having used the panel
data to get these beta j's, we

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.620 align:middle line:84%
look in the cross section to
see how the betas are related

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:84%
to each other, and in particular
to the overall average

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.530 align:middle line:90%
or expected return.

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So the main empirical
finding here

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:84%
was that returns
have to be higher

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:84%
when the betas are
higher, because

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:84%
those particular activities
from household j co-move

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:90%
move a lot with the aggregate.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So in effect, it's very risky,
not so many diversification

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:84%
possibilities come from
including household

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:90%
j in the village portfolio.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And so if they're
going to be running

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
those projects of
household j, there

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:84%
has to be a compensating
differential,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's the higher
expected return.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:06.035 align:middle line:84%
So then we started adopting this
language of risk premia, which

00:28:06.035 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
is the difference between
the expected return

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:90%
and the risk-free rate.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
The risk premia has to
compensate for the risk.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So then we went
to the Thai data,

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:84%
where we have
everything we need.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
We have the income
and the balance sheet.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, so here
are these accounts.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:84%
This, I think,
was the first time

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:84%
the accounts started
to come up explicitly.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:84%
We used the Thai monthly
data over 13 years,

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and I featured net
income to be profits,

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:90%
to be revenue minus costs.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we looked
at the assets to be

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
assets of various
kinds, typically

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.830 align:middle line:90%
physical tangible assets.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So here you have the income
statement and the balance

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:90%
sheet.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't call
it that at the time,

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:90%
but that's what we're using.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So then we tested
the model, and found

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:84%
that the betas, the
expected returns,

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
are indeed higher when
the betas are higher,

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.190 align:middle line:90%
just like the model predicted.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And here, we are back to
idiosyncratic and aggregate

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.820 align:middle line:84%
risk, which was a
theme I mentioned

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:90%
in the previous lecture.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
We can decompose the aggregate
variation of household j,

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and explain the
unexplained part.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:84%
The explained part has to
do with the covariation

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:90%
with the village average.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And the unexplained part is just
there were some idiosyncratic

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%
risk.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And we decompose
the risk premium

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:84%
as well into the
part that's coming

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
from the village as a whole,
through the beta j, as well as

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:84%
the sigma square sigma
j on that epsilon.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And then got another
decomposition.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So it turned out that,
as a quick review,

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.470 align:middle line:84%
idiosyncratic risk was
the largest contributor

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.260 align:middle line:84%
to total risk, and
aggregate village level

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:90%
risk was a small part.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So there were a lot of
idiosyncratic shocks

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.650 align:middle line:84%
in these villages,
just like we imagined

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that there were in
medieval England,

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and also that we documented
there were in village India.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But when you looked
at the risk premia,

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:84%
it went the other way,
namely most of the risk

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
aggregate risk.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's consistent
with them finding a way

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:84%
to diversify their
idiosyncratic shocks.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was evidence
that I presented

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.730 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing that
by gifts, and borrowing,

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:90%
and lending.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's the mechanism.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:84%
We started out talking
about how we weren't

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.570 align:middle line:90%
going to test for mechanisms.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Then we looked at
ex-anti-division of land.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Now we're looking
at ex-post gifts

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and borrowing as a way of
getting from their, quote,

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
"production endowments" to
their ultimate consumptions.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And most of the shocks are
covered, not all of them.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So they're not
completely following

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.620 align:middle line:84%
the full risk-sharing
program, but they definitely

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.960 align:middle line:90%
diversified mostly 90% of it.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So then we got to
particular health shocks,

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and specific Illnesses,
and I showed you

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that again those illness shocks,
not production shocks, per se,

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:30.130 align:middle line:84%
also covered by gifts largely,
although not entirely.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
not covered, they

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.920 align:middle line:84%
spill over into
the labor network

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
with less hiring
of employed labor,

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and also less purchasing
of intermediate goods

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:90%
from other households.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.850 align:middle line:90%
So this was documenting that.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is about
kinship groups and risk

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:84%
sharing in village
villages in Thailand.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:84%
It also was about an
illness as a shock.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:84%
It was not about COVID,
although it was about illness.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The illness was idiosyncratic
and not aggregate.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:84%
The closest we could get in
the Thai data to an aggregate

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:84%
was watching those shrimp
ponds suffer catastrophe

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:90%
in one of the four provinces.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And because it becomes an
aggregate shock rather than

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.540 align:middle line:84%
idiosyncratic shock, it's the
gifts didn't come in as much,

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
harder to diversify.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's a theme I
keep mentioning now

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.960 align:middle line:90%
for the last 10 or 15 minutes.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Idiosyncratic stuff, in
principle, you can diversify.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Aggregate stuff you cannot.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.330 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing I want
to draw your attention to

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.070 align:middle line:90%
is this network stuff.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So the issue is not just
in Thailand or India,

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, but do these
networks exist in the US.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on with COVID?

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So that inter-state
risk-sharing stuff

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:84%
suggests that networks
are not necessarily local.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.220 align:middle line:90%
They could be global.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But your relatives or
other family members

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
are engaged in risk
sharing when you

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.620 align:middle line:90%
experience a shock back home.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And then this project in
West Virginia, well Michael,

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I hope you don't
mind mentioning it.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But Michael, thinking
about networks,

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.440 align:middle line:84%
wondered about
networks in the US

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and the advantage of
collecting our own data,

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:22.800 align:middle line:84%
indeed would be to better
measure the networks

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:84%
among relatives,
or friends, and so

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:84%
on, in towns in rural
areas in West Virginia.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we've been
doing featuring Thailand,

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:84%
because we have all
that data, could

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.220 align:middle line:84%
be done in other
contexts like the US,

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.470 align:middle line:90%
if we can add that data.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And we've definitely
decided to try

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.180 align:middle line:84%
to measure these
networks as a suggestion

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.350 align:middle line:90%
that Michael had from last time.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So any questions
on this lecture 9?

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:84%
In the slides 19 data, when
we're decomposing the risk,

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:90%
yeah, here.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:84%
I remember before we
have R [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that was represented
the risk-free return.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:28.420 align:middle line:84%
But why here, we just have
beta and the idiosyncratic?

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:84%
That is because we
both subtract the alpha

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.679 align:middle line:84%
from left-hand side and
the right-hand side,

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:41.380 align:middle line:84%
or because the
results we get before

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:48.673 align:middle line:84%
that alpha is not significant,
so we don't care about it?

00:34:48.673 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
another great question.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So there are two ways to do it.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.780 align:middle line:84%
We should have been thinking
about the rate of return

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.600 align:middle line:90%
minus the risk-free rate.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, in the Thai
data, we took the position

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.350 align:middle line:90%
that the risk-free rate was 0.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
kind of dropped it.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.095 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:10.095 --> 00:35:11.720 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: It's
like having rice.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.000 align:middle line:90%
You can put rice in storage.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to get back
more or less what you put in,

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
rationale for it.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.870 align:middle line:90%


00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So that was all the
stuff on risk sharing.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Then in lecture 10, we
started to introduce

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:39.790 align:middle line:84%
these ledgers, and
financial accounts,

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:90%
and other measurement issues.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's a lot
going on in this lecture,

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:90%
as I'll review with you.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.850 align:middle line:84%
We did the wealth planner
stuff, looking at the balance

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.410 align:middle line:90%
sheet and the income statement.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Then I went to the
other statement,

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:57.640 align:middle line:90%
the statement of cash flow.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And we thought about
Bitcoin as an example,

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.820 align:middle line:84%
having the balance sheet, and
the cash flow in one place.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And with Bitcoin, that motivated
a review of distributed

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:84%
ledgers, and how it works with
currency, physical currency,

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to the ledgers.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we touched
on Sweden and Kenya.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So this lecture
introduced Bitcoin.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:23.650 align:middle line:84%
It also introduced distributed
ledgers as financial accounts,

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.320 align:middle line:90%
and also value transfer.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about this
statement of income.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:34.310 align:middle line:84%
By now, you may or not remember,
it doesn't really matter.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:37.810 align:middle line:84%
This household A appears
twice subsequently.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.480 align:middle line:84%
This was the first
time we introduced it

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
as an example of the
income statement,

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and also household
A's balance sheet.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we started to talk
about the wealth planner.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So we implemented
this in Thailand,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.990 align:middle line:84%
maximize discount expected
utility over the lifetime,

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.590 align:middle line:84%
even allowing for
bequests to their kids,

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.250 align:middle line:84%
subject to the stocks
and flows constraint,

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.130 align:middle line:84%
investing in risky
and safe assets,

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and allowing for the risk
sharing which you don't usually

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.970 align:middle line:90%
see in wealth planners.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But we know we needed
it for Thailand,

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:84%
because you've already seen
how much risk sharing there is.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So we want to smooth
out the income

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.890 align:middle line:84%
profile consistent with the
ins and outs of those gifts.

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And the residual is the
household's exposure

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:90%
to their own income shocks.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So we explained to
those Thai households

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:90%
how the planner works.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, to
motivate this, think

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.580 align:middle line:84%
about going to the doorstep
of a household living

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.390 align:middle line:84%
in West Virginia, having
collected some of their data.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Or better yet, what
data do we want

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to collect in West Virginia
consistent with running

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.510 align:middle line:84%
this wealth planner, so
we can give them advice?

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:84%
The setting would be different,
but the idea is the same.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So with the wealth
planner, we find out

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.770 align:middle line:84%
how much they're planning
to give to their kids,

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:00.670 align:middle line:90%
if anything.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
We calibrated their
income processes

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.160 align:middle line:90%
with trends and fluctuations.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:84%
We looked at their
committed consumption goals,

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and we're very careful
about their initial wealth.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, you come into the
period with a certain amount

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.240 align:middle line:84%
of wealth, and you could consume
it, or you could save it.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.370 align:middle line:84%
You can save it and
risky or safe assets.

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.410 align:middle line:84%
In principle, you
could also borrow,

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and then that is going to
determine wealth for next time.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So I probably didn't
emphasize it as much.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is where
the stocks and flows

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.620 align:middle line:84%
are coming together again
early on, through this budget

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.830 align:middle line:90%
constraint.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Initial wealth and
consumption is subtracted off,

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and the remainder goes into
risky and safe assets, which

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:90%
will determine wealth next time.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we looked
at actual flows

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:53.230 align:middle line:84%
in the data, the
second household,

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.310 align:middle line:84%
the recommendation of the
planner in terms of life cycle

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.370 align:middle line:84%
which is saving up
enough when you're

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:84%
relatively young to be able
to survive through older ages.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of these households
get in trouble.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So we try to help this guy,
giving advice and actually

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.960 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
realism of the goals.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And I made the point that this
planner exists for the US.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Although I don't know that
it's particularly well designed

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
for households in
West Virginia, it

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:84%
does take into account
details of the US tax code,

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and Social Security, and so
on, but acting as if there's

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.740 align:middle line:90%
no networks, no risk sharing.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.930 align:middle line:90%
We'll eventually find out.

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Then I made this transition
to Bitcoin as an account.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So Bitcoin accounts have
the ownership of the coin,

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and also a way to
buy something else

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and transfer the coin
to a third party,

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:55.300 align:middle line:84%
by sending the proposed
transection to be validated.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So the Bitcoin ledgers
are a combination

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.160 align:middle line:84%
of the balance sheet and
the statement of cash flow.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And with the introduction
of the idea of cash flow,

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the
Thai financial accounts

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.365 align:middle line:84%
to look at that
for the first time.

00:40:10.365 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:84%
We'd already looked at the
income and balance sheet

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:12.990 align:middle line:90%
statement.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Now we're looking at
the cash flow statement.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Cash flow from production,
consumption, financing,

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.850 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So then the issue is,
what do the ledgers do?

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Thailand, they're
largely using paper currency.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.370 align:middle line:90%
So they do not keep accounts.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.620 align:middle line:90%
And there are no common ledgers.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin is all on an account,
and there are common ledgers.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called a
distributed common ledger.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So we actually went
to create ledgers

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that would be common
in the Thai data,

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and discovered a lot
of data discrepancies

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.040 align:middle line:84%
because we hadn't
collected the data that way

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.040 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.100 align:middle line:84%
This is also a
reminder, if we're

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:84%
collecting data in
West Virginia and we're

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.040 align:middle line:84%
getting the identity of
the transacting partner

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.040 align:middle line:84%
when we interview that
partner, those transactions

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.270 align:middle line:90%
should also show up.

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So ideally one would
do that in real time

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:12.050 align:middle line:84%
almost, when memory
is fresh, or for that

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:14.540 align:middle line:84%
matter their understanding
of a transection

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.240 align:middle line:84%
with a commercial bank
which is opposed to what

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.350 align:middle line:90%
commercial bank is doing.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.050 align:middle line:84%
At least you think
that, of course,

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:90%
the commercial banks are honest.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Just remember Wells Fargo
that actually created accounts

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.970 align:middle line:84%
for households they
didn't know about,

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and then charged
them money for it.

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So we then talked about
the advantage of Bitcoin

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:40.760 align:middle line:84%
like distributed ledgers,
namely data reconciliation.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But in practice, of course,
they're using paper currency.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So with that
opportunity, we looked

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:50.490 align:middle line:84%
at another problem
of management,

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:55.370 align:middle line:84%
which is managing the currency,
managing the cash flow, which

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.340 align:middle line:84%
we modeled and fit to the
data, as having trends

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.680 align:middle line:90%
and stochastic fluctuations.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.740 align:middle line:84%
We have the evolution
of cash flow,

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.610 align:middle line:84%
adjusted taking into account
the ups and downs with shocks

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:84%
of revenues and
expenses, and adjusted

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:90%
by withdrawals and deposits.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.900 align:middle line:84%
The two costs were
going to the bank

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:84%
to make the physical
adjustment, and the opportunity

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:84%
cost, foregone
interest, of holding

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.250 align:middle line:90%
the currency in the house.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:25.685 align:middle line:84%
Which led to another
optimization problem.

00:42:25.685 --> 00:42:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Now minimizing the
expected costs,

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.420 align:middle line:84%
let me just say that our
vision for West Virginia

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:38.090 align:middle line:84%
is to combine the high frequency
cash flow with the longer term

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.230 align:middle line:90%
life cycle.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Because in practice they
are intimately related.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have a synthesis
of those frameworks in mind.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And in Thailand, they didn't
manage the currency very well.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:84%
In the rural areas, they're
holding far too much of it.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And in the urban areas,
they actually did better.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Of course, one
advantage of getting

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.580 align:middle line:84%
them to switch
from paper currency

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.520 align:middle line:84%
into electronic entries
that is then in principle,

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.740 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to manage portfolios
or to send reminders about cash

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:15.350 align:middle line:84%
management on apps on phones,
if all the transactions

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.430 align:middle line:90%
are electronic.

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And I give you some
examples of Yodlee

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and other apps that do this,
that collect electronic data.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that led
finally to, well,

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.670 align:middle line:84%
do you have to use
paper currency?

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.320 align:middle line:90%
The answer being no.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Sweden doesn't much
anymore, although they're

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.870 align:middle line:84%
worried about it in
the sense of worried

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that the private sector takes
over all of the payments,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and the Riksbank isn't needed
anymore, the central bank.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And the stuff in
between, which was Kenya,

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:54.830 align:middle line:84%
so Kenya eMoney, digital money,
is created by the cell phone

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.770 align:middle line:84%
company, allowing people
to cash in and cash

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:01.970 align:middle line:84%
out, and electronically
transfer the credits on the cell

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:05.390 align:middle line:84%
account, which turned out
to help with guess what?

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Risk sharing.

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So you see a tie-in here back
to those risk-sharing lectures.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.740 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's in
the context of Kenya,

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that your
kin back in the village

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:20.060 align:middle line:84%
have had a terrible
harvest can be

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.660 align:middle line:84%
mitigated by having the
migrant worker in Nairobi

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.680 align:middle line:90%
send more money.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And evidently, that
is exactly what

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:31.580 align:middle line:84%
happens, as opposed to having
to give the Kenyan shillings,

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.500 align:middle line:90%
paper currency, to a friend.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Put it in an envelope,
hope for the best,

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:41.270 align:middle line:84%
or in a very costly way go back
home and hand over the cash.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So risk sharing on the
ledgers actually helped.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.190 align:middle line:90%
But these are private accounts.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
what we typically

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.130 align:middle line:84%
refer to as distributed
ledgers, where

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.390 align:middle line:90%
there's third-party validation.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:84%
All of these transactions,
cell phone companies accounts,

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.290 align:middle line:90%
are trusted to be accurate.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Households can check
them, when they

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.150 align:middle line:84%
happen to see if
they get credited

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:06.710 align:middle line:90%
the way they're supposed to.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, Safaricom
could steal the money

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.290 align:middle line:90%
if they wanted to.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:90%
They don't, evidently.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They put it in the
bank, but still,

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and the banks are
subject to runs.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of risk remaining,

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:25.980 align:middle line:84%
even though this digital
currency is an innovation

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.150 align:middle line:90%
in the context of Kenya.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It certainly would not be
in the context of Sweden.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.380 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
interbank method.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So are there questions
about this lecture 10?

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.570 align:middle line:90%


00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's kind of a mouthful.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.860 align:middle line:84%
This lecture does both
the financial accounts,

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.910 align:middle line:84%
income statement, balance
sheet, and cash flow,

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and is also looking at two
problems namely cash management

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and lifecycle management,
and finally merging

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.820 align:middle line:84%
into a discussion of what
distributed ledgers, Bitcoin

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and distributed
ledgers, do or don't do,

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.680 align:middle line:90%
and potential substitutes.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.390 align:middle line:84%
How good or how bad is currency
and Safaricom digital credits,

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.820 align:middle line:90%
relative to validated systems?

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Although we haven't really
talked about validation.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.530 align:middle line:84%
That happens I think
in the next lecture.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:19.190 align:middle line:90%
So that was lecture 10.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Lecture 11 was about contracts
and mechanism design.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just give an overview.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.940 align:middle line:84%
There were two parts
to this lecture.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.060 align:middle line:84%
The first part is
figuring out what

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.550 align:middle line:84%
to do when there's
private information.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And the main conclusion
was there is a way

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.570 align:middle line:84%
to write down additional
constraints, called truth

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.550 align:middle line:84%
telling or incentive
constraints,

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that capture the problem
of private information.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And we will be able
to append those

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.600 align:middle line:84%
on top of the usual
programming problems

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.875 align:middle line:84%
that maximize the lambda
weighted sums of utilities.

00:46:56.875 --> 00:46:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a
tool, and the tool

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.110 align:middle line:84%
is getting better and
better, because we

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:01.890 align:middle line:90%
can do more and more with it.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
main points of this.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And the other was to
think about mechanism

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:11.300 align:middle line:84%
design, private contracts,
having to do with messages,

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and then back to
the ledgers which

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.940 align:middle line:84%
have to do with the
cryptography part of ledgers,

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and keeping messages secret,
and whether or not they

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.780 align:middle line:90%
have to be validated.

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So the motivation
for the first part

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.830 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that
some of these villages

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:31.700 align:middle line:84%
lie far away from the
central monastery.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Some are very near.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Some households work
as serfs, slaves.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Others far away pay rent.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to explain
this kind of variation

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.800 align:middle line:84%
in the organizations
that we see.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So we introduced a simple
two-agent model, where only one

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of the two, agent 1, had some
privately observed endowment.

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Agent 2 was the villa
or the monastery.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to know what
would be an optimal resource

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:06.140 align:middle line:84%
allocation mechanism,
granted that agent 1 has

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.470 align:middle line:90%
private information.

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So we did some derivation,
had agent 1 sending messages,

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:15.950 align:middle line:84%
looked at what would be
a maximizing message,

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:18.860 align:middle line:84%
derived a series
of inequalities,

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and then changed the
problems to sending messages

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.010 align:middle line:84%
about the underlying
endowment, and ended up

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:28.100 align:middle line:84%
with something we call the
truth telling constraint, which

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.040 align:middle line:84%
captures all of the
problems associated

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.170 align:middle line:84%
with private information
in this context.

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So then we're able to solve for
optimal resource allocations

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.290 align:middle line:84%
just by adding on these kinds
of incentive constraints,

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:45.080 align:middle line:84%
in addition to maximizing
the lambda weighted sums

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.250 align:middle line:90%
of utilities.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.960 align:middle line:90%
We did this in levels.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Then we went to lotteries
to make it more general.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.210 align:middle line:84%
We had a good discussion
at the beginning of one

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:56.390 align:middle line:84%
of the classes of the advantages
of these lotteries, which

00:48:56.390 --> 00:49:00.440 align:middle line:84%
we had talked about in the first
one third of the class as well.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and at some point,
there was a starred article

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:07.130 align:middle line:84%
on the reading list,
which was how to actually

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.970 align:middle line:90%
code these things up.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It's more related
to the next lecture.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, trying not
to be abstract about it.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So then we went from one
period to two periods.

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:20.150 align:middle line:84%
We solved the
two-period problem,

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and had incentive
constraints, truth telling

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:24.920 align:middle line:90%
constraints for both periods.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.890 align:middle line:84%
In this case, what
I was emphasizing

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:30.470 align:middle line:84%
both the dynamic program
and how to work back

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:33.500 align:middle line:84%
from the second period to the
first period sequentially,

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.950 align:middle line:84%
but also the fact that
moving forward from the first

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:40.370 align:middle line:84%
to the second, the message
is about underlying

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:43.970 align:middle line:84%
unobserved states would
be key to implementing

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:47.400 align:middle line:84%
the optimal information
constrained solution.

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And by emphasizing
messages, I was already

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.480 align:middle line:84%
anticipating contracts,
smart contracts,

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:58.190 align:middle line:84%
written on ledgers where
messages replace transactions.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And the optimal solution
to that two-period problem

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.550 align:middle line:84%
was neither full insurance
which wouldn't be feasible,

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:08.060 align:middle line:84%
nor limited borrowing and
lending which was not optimal.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, in class, we
had a very good discussion

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:14.390 align:middle line:84%
about this hybrid borrowing
and lending scheme.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:16.730 align:middle line:84%
We did costly
state verification.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:21.080 align:middle line:84%
I won't dwell on that, except
that over a range of shocks,

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.410 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to be
verifying anything at all.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's still effective,
because there's the threat

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.560 align:middle line:90%
of an audit for low claims.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And we went back and argued
that costly state verification

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.810 align:middle line:84%
can help explain what we
saw in the initial part

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:39.720 align:middle line:90%
of the lecture.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So here is where the transition
happened to distributed ledgers

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.810 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot
of material here.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I kind of argued that encryption
was one third key element

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:54.470 align:middle line:90%
of distributed ledgers.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.520 align:middle line:90%
We've seen it historically.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.930 align:middle line:84%
We see it in contemporary
applications.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:02.510 align:middle line:84%
It really breaks
down into encryption,

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.400 align:middle line:84%
of incoming and
outgoing messages,

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.390 align:middle line:84%
of hashing of data and others
so that it's uninterpretable

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:12.380 align:middle line:84%
unless one wants to prove that
it was the original, which

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:15.980 align:middle line:84%
is possible to do in crypto
graphic puzzles, which

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.650 align:middle line:84%
are hard, but not
impossible to solve.

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin is using
various of those things,

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:27.650 align:middle line:84%
including a way of organizing
the data through mining

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:28.790 align:middle line:90%
as the validation.

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I emphasized that
mining was not the only way

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to validate transactions on
ledgers, if you don't trust

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Safaricom or some third party.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And I also emphasized
the encryption part,

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:47.060 align:middle line:84%
which Bitcoin doesn't use,
homomorphic and that's

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.260 align:middle line:90%
not quite fair.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.090 align:middle line:84%
The encryption part
for the messages

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is related to
homomorphic encryption.

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But Bitcoin doesn't use
multiparty computation.

00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So then we came back to the
essence of the lecture, which

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.350 align:middle line:84%
was, what is the difference
between validation

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:07.700 align:middle line:84%
on distributed ledgers and
incentives and mechanism

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.620 align:middle line:84%
design, and the different
philosophies of economics

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.030 align:middle line:90%
versus computer science?

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Computer science assumes
that most nodes are

00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:22.720 align:middle line:84%
honest and reliable, and designs
algorithms on the assumption

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that the honest nodes will
follow the algorithms,

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and just have to have
enough total nodes

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.560 align:middle line:84%
relative to the faulty
nodes in the population

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.010 align:middle line:90%
for those protocols to work.

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:37.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you take the mechanism
design point of view,

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:40.390 align:middle line:84%
the protocols may not
be incentive compatible.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Economists assume everyone's
very selfish and maximizing.

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So even the miners
in Bitcoin have

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:51.190 align:middle line:84%
to have incentives to follow
the prescribed protocol.

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And that point is
true more generally.

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of led to the idea
that why not separate the two

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:02.500 align:middle line:84%
things, write down the
contract or mechanism design

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:08.080 align:middle line:84%
problem in code as
in a smart contract,

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.120 align:middle line:84%
let the parties agree
to it and make sure

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that it functions the way
they think that it does,

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and then send messages
to implement it?

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Those messages would be
encrypted through HE and MPC.

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's a contribution.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The mechanism design literature
assumes we have a planner.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:90%
I hate that language.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And the planner is trusted
to implement the mechanism.

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:36.340 align:middle line:84%
What encryption does
nowadays is to get rid

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.160 align:middle line:84%
of trusted third
parties and planners.

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Agents can keep
secrets from each other

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and implement the
optimal contract.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:47.210 align:middle line:90%
The ledgers still play a role.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean as in
borrowing and lending,

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you can sequester the collateral
and have it automatically

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:59.700 align:middle line:84%
transferred to the lender if
the borrower were to default.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So we're not claiming that we
only need the cryptography.

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:05.420 align:middle line:90%
We also need the ledgers.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.190 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
you don't need

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:10.670 align:middle line:84%
to have all the line items of
the code in the ledger being

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:14.120 align:middle line:84%
done, as with Ethereum,
on a distributed ledger,

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.470 align:middle line:84%
because that's
really, really costly.

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So again, there was a
lot in this lecture.

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Questions about lecture 11?

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Lecture 12 was the application
of contract theory.

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And we took it to
the Thai villages,

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.080 align:middle line:90%
and looked at occupation choice.

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of
things going on here.

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:37.760 align:middle line:84%
One, we now know
how to incorporate

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.960 align:middle line:84%
private information, and
incentives, and collateral

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:45.810 align:middle line:84%
by just appending extra
constraints onto the problem.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So let me start
skipping a little bit.

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Will the entrepreneur
take appropriate action?

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:57.800 align:middle line:84%
If it's not seen, then
you have to induce it.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Will the entrepreneur
pay back the loan?

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.990 align:middle line:84%
If not, you have to
have collateral, which

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:06.860 align:middle line:90%
is another kind of constraint.

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the household's
utility in consumption,

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and a disutility of
effort, and potentially

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.460 align:middle line:84%
risk neutral,
potentially risk averse.

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And households vary by
talent, wealth, and schooling.

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And we have they're running
a firm with stochastic output

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:27.320 align:middle line:84%
as a function of
effort and capital.

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.510 align:middle line:90%
And they can borrow.

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:32.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the slide I was
kind of racing to get to.

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So here is the
problem, which we posed

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:40.070 align:middle line:84%
as maximizing the
utility of the borrower

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:45.530 align:middle line:84%
or entrepreneur, subject to
the bank making zero profits.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's worth emphasizing
that in the previous lecture,

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:53.210 align:middle line:84%
as we've been maximizing lambda
weighted sums of utilities

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:55.880 align:middle line:84%
subject to resource
constraints, and incentive

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.320 align:middle line:90%
constraints, and so on.

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, here we made a
shift from maximizing

00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.870 align:middle line:84%
the utility of one party,
subject to a fixed utility

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:03.500 align:middle line:90%
of the other.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Or here, the utility
of the entrepreneur

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.920 align:middle line:84%
subject to a fixed and zero
profit level of the bank.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.050 align:middle line:84%
One could have solved
this problem the other way

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:15.410 align:middle line:84%
around, to maximize the
profits of the bank subject

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:20.040 align:middle line:84%
to a fixed reservation utility
on the part of the borrower.

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.860 align:middle line:90%
You should get the same answers.

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are
many, many solutions--

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:26.570 align:middle line:84%
if you allow profits
to be positive,

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:31.190 align:middle line:84%
if you allow some of the surplus
to go to the bank, et cetera.

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:34.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the borrower could
be pushed down to the point

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:37.910 align:middle line:84%
that they're almost
indifferent to participating

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:41.520 align:middle line:84%
if the banks are getting
the bulk of the surplus.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:45.110 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to emphasize is
it's all the same in the end.

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Maximizing lambda
weighted sum of utilities

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is the same as maximizing
the utility of one type,

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:54.890 align:middle line:84%
subject to fixed utility of the
other, and then varying those.

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So the rest of it was just
implementing the solution,

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:04.430 align:middle line:84%
limited liability, moral
hazard, with separate equations.

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we got to
this diagram where

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:10.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, if there were no
constraints at all, that

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:13.250 align:middle line:84%
would be like the full
information, full commitment

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:18.260 align:middle line:84%
solution, hit the bull's eye, it
could be entirely moral hazard

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and not limited liability.

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:23.630 align:middle line:84%
It could be entirely limited
liability and not moral hazard.

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Although in this case, if
you had both constraints,

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:29.960 align:middle line:84%
you have two equations and
two unknowns, the capital

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.470 align:middle line:90%
and the effort level.

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So when those two
constraints are satisfied,

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.230 align:middle line:84%
if they're both in
the program, you

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:39.140 align:middle line:84%
get a solution that has
nothing to do with utility

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:42.350 align:middle line:84%
maximization, because there's
only one point in the input

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:46.150 align:middle line:84%
space where both
constraints are satisfied.

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:48.865 align:middle line:84%
But in general, if you
have only one or the other,

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:54.190 align:middle line:84%
you have both max utility and
then subject to constraints.

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:57.460 align:middle line:84%
The rest of this lecture
was about implementation,

00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:00.730 align:middle line:84%
namely solving linear
programming problems

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and trying to pick
parameters in such a way that

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.620 align:middle line:84%
maximize the probability
that the model is true,

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:11.140 align:middle line:90%
given what we see in the data.

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Maximize the probability that
the data we see in reality

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:18.600 align:middle line:84%
could have come from
the model by choosing

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.860 align:middle line:90%
the parameters of the model.

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.740 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.600 align:middle line:90%
That was the application.

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we had the findings
that the constraints

00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:29.190 align:middle line:90%
varied by region.

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:30.855 align:middle line:84%
Are the questions
about this lecture?

00:58:30.855 --> 00:58:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:38.390 align:middle line:90%
So lecture 13 is also loaded.

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Although it's more recent.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm somewhat comforted, just
like the first review session,

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:47.300 align:middle line:84%
by the time we get to
13 and then 14, 15,

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:49.160 align:middle line:90%
you've already seen 15 tonight.

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Today, we just reviewed it.

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually getting
close to the end here.

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:56.400 align:middle line:84%
This lecture did two
important things.

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.510 align:middle line:84%
One, the theory
which was to define

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:02.120 align:middle line:84%
the notion of
Walrasian equilibrium

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.800 align:middle line:90%
within and without transfers.

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And the second was to apply it.

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So we get general
equilibrium solution

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:12.470 align:middle line:84%
in a small open economy
with production.

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.600 align:middle line:84%
All of this slide
had to do with,

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.430 align:middle line:90%
remember what an economy means.

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:20.810 align:middle line:84%
This is partly review of the
first one third of the class--

00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:23.210 align:middle line:84%
numbers of households,
numbers of firms,

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:28.370 align:middle line:84%
what consumers do, what firms
do, aggregate resources.

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:30.303 align:middle line:90%
We went over private ownership.

00:59:30.303 --> 00:59:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And again, we had a
very good discussion

00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:34.160 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the following class

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.730 align:middle line:84%
to review this slide in terms
of individual endowments

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:39.590 align:middle line:90%
and ownership shares.

00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And the key definition
of Walrasian

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:46.970 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium with
three items in it--

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:49.880 align:middle line:84%
maximizing profits
for firms, maximizing

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:54.620 align:middle line:84%
utility for households, and the
feasibility of the allocations

00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:57.710 align:middle line:84%
that result from those
two optimization problems.

00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:01.070 align:middle line:84%
The key being that prices
are the things that

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:03.350 align:middle line:90%
allow the reconciliation.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.060 align:middle line:90%
You can do partial equilibrium.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:05.870 align:middle line:90%
We did.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:09.230 align:middle line:84%
You can solve for profit
maximization taking prices

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.100 align:middle line:90%
as given.

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.260 align:middle line:84%
You can solve for
utility maximization,

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.940 align:middle line:90%
taking prices as given.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Here in general
equilibrium, we are only

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:19.460 align:middle line:84%
allowing certain prices
where those decentralized

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.070 align:middle line:84%
optimization problems are
consistent with each other

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that supply
is equal to demand.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and then this
Edgeworth box, which

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:33.320 align:middle line:84%
is like economists' favorite
environment, a sad statement,

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.350 align:middle line:84%
putting the two types of
households on the axis

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and talking about what a
competitive equilibrium would

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.500 align:middle line:90%
look like.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And the price equilibrium
with transfers and the welfare

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
theorems, which so far
I have only stated,

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.130 align:middle line:84%
although the last one
third of the class

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:52.790 align:middle line:84%
next week will be focusing
in part on these welfare

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:54.480 align:middle line:90%
theorems starting next week.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So then we did production
in the small open economy.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And we again went through this
algorithm pretty carefully.

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think I want
to say too much about it,

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.400 align:middle line:90%
too, too much.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But we simplify the
problem down into firms

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:12.080 align:middle line:84%
hiring inputs and trying to
find the factor prices that

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.460 align:middle line:84%
clear the input markets, taking
out external prices of goods

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.030 align:middle line:90%
as given.

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So we had the firms
maximization problem.

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
We wrote down that the
sum of the input demands

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
equal the endowments,
and reminded ourselves

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.920 align:middle line:90%
of Shepard's lemma.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So we had a different
statement of the input demands,

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:35.360 align:middle line:84%
which we could then solve,
especially in the 2 by 2 model.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Input demands are entirely a
function of input price ratios.

01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And with constant returns
to scale, it's even easier.

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
cost minimization

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
to achieve a unit
of output, and then

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:51.580 align:middle line:84%
to scale up and down when we
get to determining output.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.410 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
intensity of goods,

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.630 align:middle line:84%
the factor intensity
of the different goods

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.040 align:middle line:90%
with a definition.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Here was the cost curves
and their properties.

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Concave, we solve for
the equilibrium factor

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
prices, where both firms
face common prices.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Hence, there's only
one point where

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.250 align:middle line:90%
that's true on this diagram.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we went from
that to production.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
From production, we were
able to solve for the input

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.120 align:middle line:90%
quantities and the outputs.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we got the
external goods prices

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.310 align:middle line:84%
by considering the
free trade equilibrium

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:33.200 align:middle line:84%
with two countries determining a
price ratio moving from Autarky

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.170 align:middle line:90%
to international trade.

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:38.150 align:middle line:90%
So there were three theorems.

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:40.740 align:middle line:84%
We had this
Heckscher-Ohlin theorem,

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.040 align:middle line:84%
which someone mentioned
at the beginning of class

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
today, that the
returns to factors

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
depend on whether the
country is abundant in one

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:51.140 align:middle line:90%
factor versus another one.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
The Stopler-Samuelson,
having to do

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
with how factor
prices are moving when

01:02:55.790 --> 01:03:00.400 align:middle line:90%
we vary the price of outputs.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's all.

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:04.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.055 align:middle line:84%
Are there questions
about this lecture?

01:03:06.055 --> 01:03:10.420 align:middle line:90%


01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Here the
HO theorem that it

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
says that in the
Autarky, the price

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
of the capital intensive goods
in the capital abundant country

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
will be buy down, so here buy
down means the relative price

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:29.980 align:middle line:84%
wars in this
capital-abundant country

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
was lower than another
country, right?

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Not the absolute prices?

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:43.400 align:middle line:90%


01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: The good
that is being produced,

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
which is capital
intensive, if produced

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
in the capital abundant country,
should be relatively cheap,

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
because the other country
is abundant in labor

01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:02.790 align:middle line:90%
and scarce in capital.

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.560 align:middle line:90%
So--

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah my
question is that these

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
are cheap means that the
relative price was cheaper.

01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean in this
capital-abundant country,

01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:18.840 align:middle line:84%
the relative price of these
capital intensive goods

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
was lower than the same
relative price of the capital

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.170 align:middle line:84%
intensive goods in
another country,

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
like labor-abundant
country, right?

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:35.670 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:36.720 align:middle line:90%
When you look at this--

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
another great
question, thank you.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at this diagram,

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:42.960 align:middle line:84%
it's really only
the relative price

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.030 align:middle line:90%
of the goods that matters.

01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:47.130 align:middle line:90%
It's like p1 over p2.

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of things
that are relative here

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:54.120 align:middle line:84%
that look like they're
in Heckscher-Ohlin stated

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.070 align:middle line:90%
as absolute prices.

01:04:56.070 --> 01:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's really only
the relative price.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.590 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I get it.

01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:04.314 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

01:05:04.314 --> 01:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that
was lecture 13.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And the other two
lectures, 14, we

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
took that trade
model to Thailand

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and did some more with
the financial accounts

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
to get not just individual
income and balance sheet

01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:29.250 align:middle line:84%
statements, but to aggregate
up those statements to get

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:31.560 align:middle line:90%
to village asset accounts.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Village level savings accounts,
flows across the villages,

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.310 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:37.960 align:middle line:90%
But my time is up.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.977 align:middle line:90%
So I can't review it.

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the other
thing we're doing

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
is taking that 2 by 2 model to
actual data with the exception

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:48.990 align:middle line:84%
that the model here
actually did not

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:51.240 align:middle line:90%
have constant returns to scale.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
It had capital mobility,
whereas the 2 by 2 did not.

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Factor prices
would be equalized,

01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:middle line:90%
even without factor flows.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The thing that's
mucking up the Thai data

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.970 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a
borrowing constraint.

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So we have both real
and financial flows,

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.640 align:middle line:84%
subject to borrowing
constraints.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And lecture 15 was
what I reviewed

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.500 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of class.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Any questions about 14?

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.490 align:middle line:90%


01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:23.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, well I hope you find
these reviews useful.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I must say, you should
all feel really good,

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
because you're doing
well in the class,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and we are covering
a lot of material.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
The constant themes here
are theory, data, both,

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:39.200 align:middle line:90%
lots of tools, lots of concepts.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
By now, you're functioning
like actual real economists,

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and the conversations
on Piazza reflect that.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really happy with
how the class is going.

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you found
this review to be useful,

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and to be a reminder of
how much you have learned.

01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.280 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:08.000 align:middle line:90%

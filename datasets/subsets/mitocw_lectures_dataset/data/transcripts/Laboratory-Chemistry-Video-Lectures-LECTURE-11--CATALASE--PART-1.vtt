00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.968
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:03.936
[RUSTLING]

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:06.396
[CLICKING]

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.200
SARAH HEWETT: All right.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.670
We can probably get started.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310
So good afternoon.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.723
And today, we are going to start
talking about the final lab

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.640
that we are going to
talk about in the lecture

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.057
and the final lab
that you haven't

00:00:27.057 --> 00:00:29.870
heard about yet for the course,
which is the catalase lab.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.910
And some of you guys
started that yesterday.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.470
And some of you
will start it today.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.803
And then the rest of you will
have to wait a little bit.

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:40.490
But the catalase lab is our
biochemistry type lab that we

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.110
were doing in 5.310.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.040
And catalase is an enzyme if
you couldn't tell by the name.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.510
A lot of enzyme names--

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.600
you guys are familiar from your
biology classes-- end in ase.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.310
So catalase is an enzyme.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.970
And enzymes are proteins-- just
a review of your general bio--

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.100
that carry out specific
chemical reactions.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.470
And they're produced by
different living organisms.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.380
They work in the cells to do a
very wide range of chemistry.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.632
And there are many different
graphical representations,

00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:11.840
weird pictures that you can
find on the internet that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.445
try to depict what an enzyme
actually does in cartoon form.

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:16.320
And so here are a couple
of examples of that.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.990
So you have your enzyme
and then you have

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.960
what's called your substrate.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.380
And so that is the thing that
the enzyme is doing chemistry

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.880
on.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.000
The substrate comes in.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.630
It interacts with your enzyme
to form an enzyme substrate

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.725
complex.

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:28.850
Then the chemistry happens.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.000
And then the enzyme
releases the product.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.750
So sometimes the products will
be rearranging the substrate.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.500
Sometimes it will be
taking two substrates

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.310
and joining them together.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.870
And sometimes it will
be taking one substrate

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.740
and breaking it apart.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.448
So there's a bunch of
different reactions

00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:43.267
that can happen in
different enzymes.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:45.350
Similar thing-- if you
want to look at your enzyme

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.630
as a little Pacman kind of guy.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.432
You form the enzyme
substrate complex.

00:01:49.432 --> 00:01:50.390
You form your products.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.510
And then they break apart.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.380
So that's the general
idea of how enzymes

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.260
works in a very quick nutshell.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.440
So our specific
enzyme is catalase.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.670
And here are a couple of
pictures of catalase or artist

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.290
renditions of catalase.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.180
So this is a space
filling model of what

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.450
it would look like if all of
the atoms were kind of 3D balls.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.540
So you can see it has four
different subdomains here.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.900
And then these darker
parts in the middle

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.157
with the little green dot,
those are your heme center,

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:22.740
so these are iron
molecules and that's

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.580
where the chemistry happens.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.680
So these are the active
sites of the catalase.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.357
And you can also-- you may have
seen in other courses proteins

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.440
represented like this,
which has a little bit more

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.870
of the features of their
secondary and tertiary

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.780
structure.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.210
So you can see the alpha
helices and beta sheets.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.190
And we're going to talk
more about the structure

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.190
of the active site and
how the chemistry happens

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.800
and what all of those
squiggles mean next week

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.170
when we talk about catalase.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.830
SARAH HEWETT: Yes.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.730
Or wait.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.280
Each sub-domain has
one active site.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.503
So it has one heme in
each of the four parts.

00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:58.170
And we'll talk more
about that next week

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.870
when we go a little bit deeper
into the structure of catalase

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.123
and how it works.

00:03:02.123 --> 00:03:03.540
And then the other
important thing

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.080
you need to know about catalase
is it's a large molecule.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.130
Proteins generally are.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.900
There are polypeptides--
lots and lots of amino acids.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.110
And so its weight
is 240 kilodaltons.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.130
And a kilodalton is
1,000 mass units.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.230
So it's 240,000 grams per mole.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.980
And you'll need that
for some calculations

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.855
that you'll do in the
second half of the lab.

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.330
And we'll go over that
again in the next lecture.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.880
But to give you an
idea of the size

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.360
of that thing and the molar
mass, it is very large.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.690
Why do we need catalase?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.347
So there are many
redox reactions

00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:40.930
that are happening in your body
where you do electron transfer

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.900
reactions and you oxidize
or reduce different things

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.340
in your metabolism.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.710
And so electrons are
transferred around cells.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.170
You may have heard of the
molecule NADPH or NADH.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.130
Those transfer electrons
between different molecules

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.918
in your cells and
help with metabolism.

00:03:55.918 --> 00:03:58.210
And while these electrons
are being transferred around,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.710
you also know that
we breathe oxygen

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.585
and we need oxygen
to do-- to perform

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:02.710
many of our life processes.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.125
So you have a lot of oxygen
in your body as well.

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:07.000
And during a lot of
these metabolic processes

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.890
you can get electrons that
are transferred to oxygen.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.649
So if we have our oxygen
and it gains an electron,

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.480
we have what is
called superoxide.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.010
So now this has
a negative charge

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.230
and an unpaired electron.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.270
And so it is a
superoxide radical.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.925
And what do we know
about radicals?

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:30.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.300
SARAH HEWETT: They
would like to be stable.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.610
So they are not
stable because they

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.820
have this unpaired electrons.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.640
So they will either
give up this electron

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.557
or try to take an electron
from something else

00:04:39.557 --> 00:04:42.560
in order to have
their electron be--

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.150
or not be unpaired anymore.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.630
So these are very
reactive in the body.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.442
And this is actually a problem.

00:04:49.442 --> 00:04:50.900
And we don't want
this in our cells

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.983
because it is so reactive.

00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:54.740
So there is another enzyme
called superoxide dismutase

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.650
that breaks this apart
into elemental oxygen

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.110
and oddly enough
hydrogen peroxide.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.970
But it turns out that
hydrogen peroxide

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.640
in high enough concentrations
is also toxic to your cells.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.820
And hydrogen peroxide can
form hydroxy radicals,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.880
which are also very
damaging to your cells.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.610
There's a couple of reactions
that hydrogen peroxide

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.995
can do in the body.

00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:17.870
So the first is if you
have hydrogen peroxide

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.810
and then you have some of
this superoxide around--

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.140
so it's a radical anion there.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:36.480
You can make oxygen,
hydroxide ions, which are OK,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.690
and then hydroxy radicals.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.660
So then you form more radicals
and those can go and damage

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.360
your DNA, your proteins,
the different fatty acids

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.395
in your body, and cause
all kinds of problems.

00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:49.770
Another thing that can happen
is if there's just hydrogen

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:57.720
peroxide around and it picks up
an electron, it can form water

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.380
and another hydroxyl radical.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.270
So these are the
reactions that we do not

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.330
want to happen in our body
because it forms these--

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.620
it just keeps propagating.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.070
And then when radicals react
with other things that have all

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.380
paired electrons, it
generates more radicals

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.120
and you propagate
the radical formation

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.800
throughout your cell it
causes a lot of damage.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.600
So we need a way to
get rid of the hydrogen

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.080
peroxide in our body and
that is what catalase is for.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.480
And all organisms have catalase.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.690
You can extract it out of
humans, all types of mammals,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.280
even plants have it.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.160
Cells do not want
hydrogen peroxide in them.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.827
So there are different
forms of catalase

00:06:37.827 --> 00:06:41.160
that you can get from any
organism-- bacteria, all

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.660
the things.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.827
The catalase that we're
going to be using in the lab

00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:45.470
was extracted from cows.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.640
So just a fun fact.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.113
And when we're
talking about enzymes,

00:06:52.113 --> 00:06:54.280
the reason that enzymes are
so good and so efficient

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.770
at their jobs is because they
catalyze chemical reactions.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.437
And a lot of you are
chemical engineers,

00:06:58.437 --> 00:07:00.250
so you probably know
about catalysis.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.417
So what does it mean for
something to be a catalyst?

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.398
Anyone?

00:07:07.398 --> 00:07:09.190
Please give me a quick
catalyst definition.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] reaction.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.160
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.330
It speeds up a
chemical reaction.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.030
And it's not used up
during the process.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:20.128
So if we look at our
energy reaction diagram,

00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:22.170
if you have energy on this
side and then reaction

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.578
progress on this
axis, you can say

00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:27.120
that you have reactants that
are starting at a certain energy

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.300
level.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.113
And then you have
some energy that you

00:07:31.113 --> 00:07:33.030
have to put into the
reaction to get it to go.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.240
And then in a lot of cases, if
your reaction is exothermic,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.580
your products maybe at
a lower energy level.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.327
So it'll release energy overall.

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:41.910
But in order to get
the reaction to go

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.110
you have to put energy in.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:48.833
So this part of the curve is
our delta H of our reaction.

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:50.250
So it would be the
energy released

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:54.150
if it's exothermic, which in
this case this reaction is.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.723
But no matter what you
need to put in some energy

00:07:56.723 --> 00:07:58.140
to get the reaction
to go and this

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.870
is called the activation energy.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.770
Occasionally
abbreviated E sub a.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.600
So this is what
we care about when

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.370
we're talking about
reaction kinetics

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.670
and what a catalyst does.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.610
So a catalyst functions and
it makes the reaction faster

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.070
by lowering this energy barrier.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.100
So if the yellow line is the
reaction without a catalyst,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.083
then with a catalyst
it will be smaller.

00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:34.500
And the products
and the reactants

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.287
will have the same total
energy, but the energy

00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:39.120
you need to put in to
get the reaction to go

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.455
is going to be less.

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.830
And so the reaction
can go faster

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.360
and it can go in
milder conditions.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.140
And we can talk
about how enzymes

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.310
work to lower this
activation energy.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.030
So does anybody know
what methods enzymes

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.770
use to lower the activation
energy of a reaction?

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:57.270
Yes?

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.103
AUDIENCE: Proximity?

00:08:58.103 --> 00:08:59.940
Just getting the
reactants together?

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.732
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:09:00.732 --> 00:09:01.423
Proximity.

00:09:01.423 --> 00:09:03.090
So it gets the reactants
close together.

00:09:06.397 --> 00:09:07.980
If you have your
reactants in a beaker

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.820
and they're all
floating around, they

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.470
have to find each other
before they can react.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.610
And so if you have
an enzyme that

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.235
has a specifically
designed active site

00:09:13.235 --> 00:09:15.760
to hold these two
molecules close together,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.460
then they will react.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.973
What else?

00:09:19.973 --> 00:09:21.890
AUDIENCE: It can stabilize
a transition state?

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.682
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:09:22.682 --> 00:09:26.130
It can stabilize a
transition state.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.918
And how does it do that?

00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:32.648
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:32.648 --> 00:09:33.440
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.697
So it bonds to the
substrate and it

00:09:35.697 --> 00:09:38.030
can have either electrostatic
or even sometimes covalent

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.080
interactions.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.890
And it stabilizes
the transition state.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.682
And part of the way
that it does that is it

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:45.403
holds the molecules in the right
orientation for them to react.

00:09:45.403 --> 00:09:46.820
So even if you
have two molecules,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.903
if they're supposed to
interact like this to react

00:09:48.903 --> 00:09:50.990
and they're in a beaker
and they hit on this side

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.060
or upside down, the
reaction will not happen.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.790
So we can stabilize
transition states.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:06.550
Your transition state
and put molecules

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.800
in the correct orientation.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.310
Anything else?

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.430
There is one more
thing that they can do.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.320
OK.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.250
What's your idea?

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.630
AUDIENCE: If they raise the
temperature, it will increase--

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.245
collisions could increase.

00:10:31.245 --> 00:10:33.620
SARAH HEWETT: So increasing
the temperature of a reaction

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.662
will get it to go faster.

00:10:34.662 --> 00:10:36.348
Right?

00:10:36.348 --> 00:10:37.890
But that's just
because then you will

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.170
have more molecules that
have the necessary activation

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:40.540
energy.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.873
So you're not necessarily
lowering the activation energy

00:10:42.873 --> 00:10:45.182
that the reaction needs.

00:10:45.182 --> 00:10:46.640
But the last thing
that they can do

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.040
is they can provide
alternate reaction pathways.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.280
So sometimes you may
think that this will just

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.560
be a one-step reaction.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.110
If you had an enzyme,
occasionally it'll

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.770
look like this.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.735
It might provide an extra
intermediate in there

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:11.360
that helps to lower
the overall energy.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.735
And so that's
another way that it

00:11:12.735 --> 00:11:14.787
can lower this overall
activation energy

00:11:14.787 --> 00:11:16.370
is by providing an
alternate mechanism

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.820
other than maybe just two
molecules reacting together.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.410
There might be a
third intermediate

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.970
that helps actually
lower the overall energy.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.040
So those are possible ways
that the enzymes can work

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.940
to lower the activation energy.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.502
And so our goals for
the catalase lab are--

00:11:35.502 --> 00:11:37.210
well, there are a few
goals that we have.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.920
But our goals for
days one and two

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.550
are to determine the
activation energy of hydrogen--

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.240
the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide as catalyzed

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.980
by the catalase enzyme.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.200
So we're going to
try and figure out

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.240
what the activation energy
is after it's already

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.410
been catalyzed.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.780
And in order to do
this, we are going

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.970
to need to first determine
the order of the reaction

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.345
with respect to
hydrogen peroxide

00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:01.860
and be able to write a rate law.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.715
That'll help us
characterize the kinetics.

00:12:03.715 --> 00:12:05.090
So in day one of
this lab, you're

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.257
going to do that first part.

00:12:06.257 --> 00:12:09.460
And you're going to figure out
what the order of the reaction

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:09.960
is.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.050
And in order to have
that make any sense

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.020
we need to talk about kinetics
and how we discuss kinetics

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.758
in a chemical sense.

00:12:17.758 --> 00:12:20.050
So kinetics deals with the
speed of chemical reactions.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.260
And if we use everybody's
favorite generic reaction

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.170
a plus b goes to c plus d.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.670
You can write the rate of this
reaction-- you can express it

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.333
in a number of ways.

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:30.000
So the first way is
to think of the rate

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.300
of the reaction as the change
in the reactants over time--

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.010
so a and b.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.608
And it has a negative
sign because you

00:12:36.608 --> 00:12:37.650
are losing the reactants.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.200
Hopefully they're going away
as the reaction progresses.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.040
And it is equal to the
rate of the appearance

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.402
of c and the appearance of d.

00:12:46.402 --> 00:12:47.860
So these do not
have negative signs

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.578
because you are
making your product.

00:12:50.578 --> 00:12:52.870
So that is one way to express
the rate of the reaction.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.110
And when you do it this way,
you need to account for the fact

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.890
that there are
different molar ratios.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.980
So the reactants
and the products

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.838
will disappear in form
at different rates

00:13:02.838 --> 00:13:05.130
depending on how many of them
you need in the reaction.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.338
So to account for that, we
multiply by the reciprocal

00:13:07.338 --> 00:13:09.810
of this coefficient.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.310
We can also write
a generic rate law

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.157
like this where your rate
equals your rate constant, which

00:13:15.157 --> 00:13:16.740
you can calculate
and determine in lab

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.310
and is dependent
on the temperature

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.310
times the concentration
of your reactants raised

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.283
to a power and
your concentration

00:13:22.283 --> 00:13:24.450
of your other reactants
raised to a different power.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.320
And you can also write
an integrated rate law,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.740
which you may have seen before.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.620
So integrated rate laws deal
with one reactant at a time.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.490
And so if we look at a, we
can say-- we can write--

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.760
if there's only a we can write
the rate of a equals the rate

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.500
constant times a.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.125
Or we can say that the rate
is equal to the disappearance

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:49.030
of a overtime.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.010
And you can take the
derivative of this.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.090
So if we move everything
over, rearrange it--

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.490
So if we integrate
both sides of this--

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.750
if we integrate this side from
your initial concentration

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.720
to your concentration
at some temperature

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:24.140
and this side from t
equals 0 to some time t,

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:30.545
then if you do that math out you
will get the natural log of--

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:44.060
this is your integrated rate law
if your exponent here equals 1.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.770
So obviously, that will change
if you have different exponents

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:47.270
here.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.410
And then when you
do your integration

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.660
you will get different values.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.620
But this is a way to
relate the concentration

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.620
at your initial concentration
to a concentration

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.413
at a final temperature
or a final time.

00:14:58.413 --> 00:15:00.080
So that's one thing
that you've probably

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.170
seen before in some of your
other chemistry classes.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.643
And we can also talk about--

00:15:06.643 --> 00:15:08.310
well, we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.050
You may also have seen in some
of your other classes enzyme

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.630
kinetics or heard of
Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.060
And the Michaelis-Menten
model of enzyme kinetics

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.770
says that if you have
an enzyme and you

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.760
have a bunch of substrate,
the reaction can only

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.980
go as fast as there is
when there's only one

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.030
substrate in each enzyme.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.450
So if all of the active
sites are full of substrate,

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.150
then that is as fast
as the reaction can go.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.930
And it will proceed
at a steady state.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.380
So you can make
graphs of the reaction

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.490
rate versus how much
concentration of substrate

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.290
you have.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.660
And you can get this
Michaelis-Menten constant here,

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:50.530
which is a measure of
how much the enzyme--

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.060
what its affinity is for
the substrate essentially.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.590
So does the enzyme need a
whole bunch of substrate

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.310
before it'll start
going quickly?

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.980
Or can it go quickly
and efficiently

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.240
with just a tiny
concentration of substrate?

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.850
So we're not going
to worry so much

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:08.950
about those parameters
for our lab right now.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.890
But this is something
you may have seen.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.680
And one of the assumptions of
the Michaelis-Menten kinetics,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.640
which is actually kind
of important to us

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.640
is that you have your
enzyme and your substrate.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.265
They make the enzyme
substrate complex.

00:16:20.265 --> 00:16:22.330
And then they go to
enzyme and product.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.320
And they don't go in
the reverse reaction.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.420
So that's kind of
important to us

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.920
that if we are trying to measure
the rates of our reactions,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.850
that we don't have to contend
with the reactions being

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:31.810
catalyzed in reverse.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.160
All right.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.160
So now we can take a
little bit of a closer look

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.690
at the rate law for just a
normal chemical reaction.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.685
And pretty much the
most important thing

00:16:45.685 --> 00:16:48.060
you want to know about this
is that the units of the rate

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.040
are always moles per
liter per second.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.970
So whenever you are trying
to calculate a rate constant,

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.760
you want your units to line up.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:05.810
So if your rate--

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:11.480
if we want this in
molarity per second--

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.250
if your rate equals--

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:18.170
let's say these are both
equal to 1 just for now.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.500
Then what are our
units over here?

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.990
M and M. So what are the
units of k have to be?

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.150
So that's how you can figure
out what the units of your rate

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.460
constant are because
it always needs

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.360
to multiply with your
concentrations and your k

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.370
to equal moles per
liter per second.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.500
And that is going to be
the units of our rate

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.595
that we care about in
our kinetic equations.

00:17:51.595 --> 00:17:53.970
The rate constant is different
at different temperatures.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.012
So if you change the
temperature of the reaction,

00:17:56.012 --> 00:17:57.860
then your rate
constant will change

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.527
and you'll have
to remeasure that.

00:17:59.527 --> 00:18:01.610
And x and y are values
that need to be determined.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.890
They may be the same as little
a and little b but not always.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.890
So the kinetics
of a reaction are

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.870
determined if it's a
multi-step reaction

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.050
if their reaction mechanism
has more than one part in it.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.150
They may not all be reflected in
this overall chemical equation.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.730
You may not see
them, but the rate

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.070
is going to be dependent
on your slowest step.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.140
And that slowest
step is what is going

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.470
to determine your rate law.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.410
And it may not always match
your overall reaction equation.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.000
So be careful when you are
determining these things.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.650
You can't always just
assume that it is

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:37.100
from the little a and little b.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.677
So how are we going to determine
the order for our reaction?

00:18:39.677 --> 00:18:41.510
And this is what are
going to do on day one.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.180
We will use our
rate law expression

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.130
to determine the
order of the reaction.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.530
So you're going to--

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.630
according to our rate law here.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.630
It's the only reactant
that we have in this case

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.100
is hydrogen
peroxide, and we need

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.990
to determine what its order is.

00:18:59.417 --> 00:19:01.500
So if we change the
concentration of the peroxide,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.040
we should change the rate, yes?

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.890
So if we do a bunch of
reactions with a bunch

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.200
of different
concentrations of peroxide,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.135
we can measure the
rates, and then

00:19:12.135 --> 00:19:14.010
use the relationship
between those two things

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.647
to figure out our
concentration of--

00:19:17.647 --> 00:19:18.855
or our order of the reaction.

00:19:22.993 --> 00:19:24.910
So the way that you're
going to do this in lab

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.430
is you will have a
series of solutions,

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.483
and these are your solutions.

00:19:30.483 --> 00:19:32.400
You'll have a stock
hydrogen peroxide solution

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.608
that you're going to make up.

00:19:33.608 --> 00:19:35.800
It's going to be about
4% hydrogen peroxide.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.050
You'll use a phosphate buffer.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.350
Why do we need to use a
buffer for this reaction?

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.200
What's a buffer, I guess
is the first question?

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.663
AUDIENCE: It helps the
solution from changing PH2.

00:19:51.663 --> 00:19:52.580
SARAH HEWETT: Perfect.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.070
So a buffer helps the solution,
it prevents a solution

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.810
from changing PH.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.730
So you can make a buffer
out of certain PH,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.480
and then if acid or
base gets added to it,

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.780
it resists the change in PH.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.840
It keeps the constant.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.040
Why is that important
for our reaction?

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.778
AUDIENCE: Maybe [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:07.778 --> 00:20:08.570
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:14.280
So enzymes are most
functional at a set PH.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.050
So your PH of your
body is around 7,

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.327
so we want to keep
the PH of our reaction

00:20:19.327 --> 00:20:20.910
somewhere around our
physiological PH,

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.270
so our buffer is going to
be set to PH 6.8, which

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.700
is going to help make
sure that the enzyme is

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.787
in its active state.

00:20:27.787 --> 00:20:28.620
It is not denatured.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.235
If you change the
PH too much, you'll

00:20:31.235 --> 00:20:33.360
change the protonation
state of the different parts

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.885
of the protein, and
it can fall apart.

00:20:35.885 --> 00:20:37.260
So we want to make
sure that this

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.480
is happening at the correct PH.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.520
We'll add some
enzyme, and then we

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.110
will measure the
rate of the reaction.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:49.003
And we're going to do that
using this apparatus right here.

00:20:49.003 --> 00:20:50.170
So you'll have one of these.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.420
You'll have a water
bath, so that we can

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.870
keep the temperature constant.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.510
So you'll just fill this
with room temperature water,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.177
and then you can
monitor the temperature

00:20:56.177 --> 00:20:59.590
throughout your reaction to make
sure that it does not change.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.362
And then this is
your reaction vessel

00:21:01.362 --> 00:21:03.570
here, your pressure tube,
because you will be putting

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.820
all of your solutions in here.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.220
You will add your
peroxide and your buffer,

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.930
and then you will
put this cap on.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.800
And this Teflon cap here,
it's important to note,

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.213
has an O-ring on the bottom.

00:21:17.213 --> 00:21:18.880
And so you want to
make sure when you're

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.260
doing this reaction
that you're O-ring

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.000
is in there, because
that'll make a good seal,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.770
so you won't have
your products escaping

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.630
because our product is a gas.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.760
So you'll screw this on.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.095
And then there's a
hole in the top here.

00:21:30.095 --> 00:21:31.720
You can inject your
enzyme really fast.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.710
You're going be doing
this in partners.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.970
Somebody can inject
the enzyme really fast.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.250
And then you want to
connect your pressure tube.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.460
And this tube is connected
to a pressure sensor.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.210
And this pressure
sensor will be connected

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.210
to your computer, which
is why you need to bring

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.200
a laptop for the catalase lab.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.380
And we will give you
the Logger Pro software.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.507
And it will send the data
directly to your laptop.

00:21:49.507 --> 00:21:50.590
And it'll plot it for you.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.610
And you'll get a
curve that, hopefully,

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.960
looks something like this.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:59.170
And we will measure the pressure
of oxygen formed in kilopascals

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.360
versus time in seconds.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.640
And it'll graph
this thing for you.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.740
And the slope of
the graph is going

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.290
to be your rate of
kilopascals per second.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.790
And we want to take the rate
at this first part of the graph

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.710
where it is linear,
and why do we

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.010
want to take the rate at the
beginning of our reaction?

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.580
Yes.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.730
AUDIENCE: Reaction rate
is dependent on amount

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:24.918
of reactants?

00:22:24.918 --> 00:22:25.710
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.668
So the reaction rate is
dependent on the amount

00:22:27.668 --> 00:22:29.910
of reactants, and the--

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:33.270
so the rate of this reaction
obviously changes over time,

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.350
and we set up our
reactions so that we know

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.940
the concentration of peroxide.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.417
And the only time
in this reaction

00:22:40.417 --> 00:22:42.000
that we're theoretically
going to know

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.010
the concentration of
peroxide is at the beginning,

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.140
before some of it has
reacted and the rate changes.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.660
So we want to measure
the initial rate so

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.260
that we know our concentration,
and that we get a--

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.090
we have a consistent
place to take our data

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.830
from on each measurement.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.720
So once we have done all of
these different reactions--

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.030
you'll do all four of them--
all of the same procedure

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.090
in the same tube-- you'll
make five different graphs.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.990
You'll have this.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.960
Then how do we analyze this
data and get information

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.520
about the order out of it?

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.120
So here we are going to have
to do a little bit of math.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.890
So here are some of the
steps of the data analysis.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:23.660
The first thing that
you're going to have to do

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.690
is calculate the concentration
of the peroxide that you used.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:37.730
And we are going to give you 30%
hydrogen peroxide, which is--

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:43.610
its volume per volume-- so
there's 30 milliliters of H2O2,

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.140
and 70 millimeters of water.

00:23:47.763 --> 00:23:49.430
So if you remember
that your molarity is

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.660
your moles of your solute
over the total volume

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.580
of the solution, you can turn
this milliliters, assuming

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.460
a density of about 1, into
grams, grams to moles,

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.040
and you can calculate the
molarity of this solution.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.070
You're then going to take this
30% hydrogen peroxide that we

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:13.580
give you, and dilute it 13.3
milliliters to 100 milliliters.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.470
So then you can do
another dilution equation

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.762
to figure out your final
concentration of your hydrogen

00:24:17.762 --> 00:24:21.060
peroxide that you're going
to be using in the lab.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.395
So that's a first step.

00:24:22.395 --> 00:24:24.020
And then I'm going
to kind of rearrange

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.478
a couple of these
other steps, just

00:24:25.478 --> 00:24:28.840
because it'll make this a
little bit easier to go through.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.590
But the first thing
that we're going to do

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.370
is the easy part, which is get
your rate of oxygen formation

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.040
in kilopascals per second.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.790
And that we're just
going to read straight

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.957
from the slope of the graph.

00:24:38.957 --> 00:24:39.980
So that's pretty easy.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.420
So we'll have our rate
of oxygen formation

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.840
in kilopascals per second.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.710
Great.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:56.350
So now we want to take
a look at our rate law.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.240
And we have our rate
of oxygen formation,

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.510
but what's in our rate law?

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.020
Hydrogen peroxide.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.010
So we need to find a way to
go from oxygen and kilopascals

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:10.020
per second to moles per
liter per second of hydrogen

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.307
peroxide.

00:25:11.307 --> 00:25:13.140
So the first way that
we're going to do that

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.560
is to go from kilopascals
per second here to molarity

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:23.170
of oxygen. And we can do that
using our gas constant here.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.710
So if you divide by
the gas constant,

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:36.330
multiply by 1 over 8.314 moles,
liters times kilopascals,

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.203
we can cancel out
our kilopascals.

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.120
And we'll have moles per
liter, which is good,

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.460
but then we still
have this K, which

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.127
is our temperature
in Kelvin, so we also

00:25:43.127 --> 00:25:46.320
have to divide by our
temperature in Kelvin.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.300
And this will get us
our rate of oxygen

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:59.300
in moles per liter per
second, which is pretty good.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.320
We're close.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.117
But we still need to get from
oxygen to hydrogen peroxide.

00:26:04.117 --> 00:26:06.200
So how can we get from
oxygen to hydrogen peroxide

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.112
using this information?

00:26:09.112 --> 00:26:11.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.630
SARAH HEWETT: It would be--

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.345
so the ratio is 2:1, right.

00:26:14.345 --> 00:26:15.720
So there's two
hydrogen peroxides

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.610
in this reaction for
every one oxygen.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.460
But these coefficients
are in moles.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.555
And this is in moles per liter.

00:26:23.555 --> 00:26:25.930
So we need to figure out how
many moles of oxygen we have

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:29.453
before we can use our
stoichiometry ratio here.

00:26:29.453 --> 00:26:31.870
So how are we going to figure
out how many moles of oxygen

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:32.370
we have?

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.570
We need to know what our
volume of oxygen was.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.668
And for that we can go
to our pressure tube.

00:26:37.668 --> 00:26:40.210
So you'll have some of this is
going to be your solution down

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.130
here, so that'll be liquid.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.380
And then we need to calculate
the volume of the gas

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.942
above our reaction,
which is where

00:26:45.942 --> 00:26:47.150
oxygen is going to be formed.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:50.230
So we'll need to know
the volume of this,

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:51.970
and the volume of
the pressure tube.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.650
And the volume of the pressure
tube has already been measured,

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:54.460
and we'll give that to you.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.870
And you guys are
going to measure

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:59.208
in the lab what the volume
of your reaction vessel is.

00:26:59.208 --> 00:27:01.000
You're going to fill
this thing with water,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.590
weigh it, then weigh
it empty, and then you

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.715
can calculate by difference
in the density of water

00:27:04.715 --> 00:27:08.000
what your volume of
your whole tube is.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.520
And then you know your reaction
volume is 25 milliliters,

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.570
so you can subtract those and
get the volume of the gas.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.640
So if we know
these two together,

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.500
you'll get the volume of
the gas above your reaction.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:28.970
So if we have our rate of oxygen
formation in moles per liter

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:32.990
per second, we can
multiply that by our volume

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.850
that we calculate,
so liters of oxygen.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:46.040
And then we have our rate in
moles of oxygen per second.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.670
And now we can use
our stoichiometry,

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:54.610
because we have it in moles, so
we can take our rate in moles

00:27:54.610 --> 00:28:01.090
per second, and then we know
that it is 1 mole of oxygen

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:05.020
for 2 moles H2O2.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:12.817
Then we get our rate
H2O2 in moles per second.

00:28:12.817 --> 00:28:14.650
And what are the units
of rate that we want?

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.703
Moles per liter per second.

00:28:21.703 --> 00:28:23.120
So we have it in
miles per second.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.750
We're so close.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.630
Then we just need to divide
by the liters of our reaction,

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:31.040
which if you go back a couple
of slides, is 25 milliliters,

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.040
so all of our reaction
volumes are 25 milliliters.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.340
So if you convert that
to liters, divide by 0.25

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:43.600
liters, and then we
will have our rate

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.110
in moles per liter per
second, which is what we want.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.540
Now this still
doesn't get us to a,

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.470
but we can rearrange
this equation

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.220
by taking the natural
log of both sides.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.930
So if you have the
natural log of the rate

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:08.020
equals the natural
log of K plus,

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.200
then the A comes down,
a times the natural log

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:16.750
of your hydrogen peroxide
concentration, then--

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:20.320
we've just figured this
out from all of that math.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.600
We know this concentration.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.440
And this is going to
be our y-intercept.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.100
So if we have y
equals b plus mx,

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.260
if we make a graph
of the hydrogen--

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.570
or the natural log of the
peroxide concentration

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.850
and the natural log of
the rate, then our slope

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.520
is going to be our order.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.695
Hopefully, we haven't lost you.

00:29:40.695 --> 00:29:43.320
So the way that you're going to
treat all this data is you can,

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.820
instead of having to
do this calculation out

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.195
for every single trial, you
can make a giant spreadsheet.

00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:49.802
And in the lab manual,
it tells you what data

00:29:49.802 --> 00:29:50.760
we want you to collect.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.173
And this is all of it here.

00:29:53.173 --> 00:29:54.840
And then you can make
a spreadsheet that

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.000
does all of the calculations
for you, that gets you down

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.500
to the natural log of
rate, and the natural log

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.660
of hydrogen peroxide.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.830
So this is an example
of a pretty good way

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.060
to present your data.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.643
And I know it's kind of hard to
see on the printed out slides,

00:30:05.643 --> 00:30:09.757
but these will be on Stellar
if you want to look at them.

00:30:09.757 --> 00:30:11.840
And then your graph will
look something like this.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.770
And you'll have a straight line.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.228
And so from that
straight line, you

00:30:14.228 --> 00:30:17.710
can figure out what your
order of your reaction

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:18.930
is based on your slope.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.670
So that was a lot.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.457
So once we have that
done on day one,

00:30:27.457 --> 00:30:29.540
then, if you remember our
second goal for the lab,

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.998
it was to figure
out the activation

00:30:30.998 --> 00:30:32.660
energy of the reaction.

00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:36.500
And so the way that
we're going to do

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.085
that is to use the
Arrhenius equation,

00:30:38.085 --> 00:30:39.710
and that says that
the rate constant is

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:44.420
equal to A, which is this
collision frequency factor,

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:48.650
times e to the negative
activation energy over RT.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.998
And if we remember the things
that can change the rate,

00:30:50.998 --> 00:30:52.790
we can change the
concentration and that'll

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.050
affect the rate, and
also the temperature.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.190
So if we do our reaction
at different temperatures,

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.023
then we can determine
our activation energy.

00:31:00.023 --> 00:31:01.523
So what you're going
to do is you're

00:31:01.523 --> 00:31:03.398
going to pick one of
the trials from day one.

00:31:03.398 --> 00:31:05.731
Usually people pick the middle
one because this is easy.

00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:07.595
It's just 1 milliliter,
no decimals.

00:31:07.595 --> 00:31:10.370
Just easy to measure and
it's right in the middle.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.990
You'll pick one and you'll hold
the concentration of peroxide

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.990
constant, and then we
will vary the temperature.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:18.080
So you'll do seven runs
at varying temperatures.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.480
So you'll pick a temperature
in each of these ranges

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.190
and you will measure the rate.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.920
Again, you'll get the
same graph, the measure

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.010
the rate of oxygen per second.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:33.640
And then you can do
all of this same math

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.250
to get your information in
concentration of peroxide

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.125
to go from oxygen to
peroxide, because that's

00:31:38.125 --> 00:31:39.530
what we care about.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.090
The keys to success
for this reaction

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.490
are to wait for the
peroxide and the buffer

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:46.170
to reach the correct temperature
before you add the enzyme.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:50.222
So when you have your
reaction here in this tube,

00:31:50.222 --> 00:31:51.930
you'll put it in your
water bath and then

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.305
you want to give
it a few minutes

00:31:53.305 --> 00:31:57.182
to stir and come to equilibrium
at the right temperature,

00:31:57.182 --> 00:31:58.890
because it'll all be
at room temperature.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.515
And then if you're trying to do
your reaction at 0 degrees or 5

00:32:01.515 --> 00:32:06.255
degrees, your reaction part
won't actually be at 5 degrees

00:32:06.255 --> 00:32:07.380
even if your water bath is.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.960
So give it a few
minutes to equilibrate

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.610
before you take
your measurements

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.603
and before you
inject your enzyme.

00:32:14.603 --> 00:32:16.020
Another key to
success is to start

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.000
at the hottest temperature
and then add ice to cool it.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.710
It's easier to
control the cooling

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.510
than it is to control the
heating with these hot plates.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.890
The hot plates tend
to get really excited

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.150
and then they'll
heat your solution up

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.790
way above what it needs to, and
then it won't be able to cool.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.332
So if you start at your hottest
temperature and then add ice,

00:32:29.332 --> 00:32:31.320
you'll be able to slowly
lower the temperature

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.030
and do it in a more
controlled fashion.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.970
The other important
thing about this reaction

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.760
for day one and two, and I'm
sure your TAs will emphasize

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.135
this when they tell you in
lab and you guys have a chance

00:32:41.135 --> 00:32:44.180
to have this in front of you,
is to do everything really

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:44.680
quickly.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.470
So the reaction starts as
soon as you add the enzyme.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:47.845
So you'll have
your micropipette,

00:32:47.845 --> 00:32:49.303
you'll stick it
right in that hole,

00:32:49.303 --> 00:32:50.880
add the enzyme
really fast, and then

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.147
you want to attach
your pressure tube

00:32:54.147 --> 00:32:56.730
and then hit go on your computer
to start collecting the data.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.992
And that all has to happen
in like, a second so

00:32:58.992 --> 00:33:00.950
that you don't miss that
beginning of your data

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:04.200
collection.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.040
So those are some
important things.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.277
If we talk about the data
analysis for this reaction,

00:33:10.277 --> 00:33:11.860
it's kind of similar
to the other one.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.530
So you'll calculate the
concentration of peroxide,

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.760
you'll calculate the volume
of air above your reaction.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.760
You'll have the initial
rate of oxygen formation

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.240
in kilopascals per second.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.780
Then you can get the initial
rate of oxygen formation

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.380
in molarity per second
and moles per second.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.520
Then you can change your
rate of oxygen formation

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.272
to the rate of peroxide
decomposition, same math.

00:33:33.272 --> 00:33:35.730
And then using the rate law
that you determined on day one,

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:37.563
you're going to calculate
the rate constant.

00:33:37.563 --> 00:33:42.270
So if we have our rate,
our general rate law,

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.360
we'll measure this in the lab or
we'll calculate this, I guess.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.750
We will know this from day one.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.020
So you'll plug in
the value that you

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.702
get from your first set of
calculations right there.

00:34:02.702 --> 00:34:04.160
And then we measure
this in the lab

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.170
or we can
calculate/measure this.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.190
So we can calculate
our rate constant,

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.405
which is, if you just
rearrange this, it'll be k--

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.639
so that's not so bad.

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:31.630
And then in order to get our
activation energy out of this,

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.795
we are again going to take
the natural log of both sides.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.503
I think that I did
that out correctly.

00:35:00.396 --> 00:35:02.350
No plus sign here.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:06.290
All right, so this is your
linear form of this equation.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:12.495
So we have, again,
y equals b m and x.

00:35:12.495 --> 00:35:14.620
So if we do our reaction
at different temperatures,

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.160
then we will know the
temperature of our reaction.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.310
And then we will get k from
our rate constant from our rate

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.040
law, and you'll calculate
that for each of your trials,

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.050
as well, based on the rate.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.840
And then our slope is going
to be the activation energy

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.290
over the ideal gas constant.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:31.750
So we can get the
activation energy

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:35.320
from the slope of
a graph of 1 over t

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.093
times the natural log of k
versus the natural log of k.

00:35:38.093 --> 00:35:40.510
And then you can also get your
collision frequency factor,

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.440
this A term, from
your y-intercept,

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.693
so you'll also be able
to determine that.

00:35:45.693 --> 00:35:47.110
Then you'll use
your Linus program

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.010
to get the errors in
all of these things,

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:53.050
and that is essentially day
one and day two of the lab.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.340
Do you guys have any
questions about that?

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.060
There's a lot of math.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.040
So again, there's
another data chart

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.927
that you can make for
day two of the lab that

00:36:04.927 --> 00:36:06.760
has all of the information
that you're going

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.890
to need for these calculations.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:14.080
And then this is hopefully
what your graph will look like.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.050
It should be linear
with a negative slope,

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.550
and then the negative
will get taken

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.832
care of with that negative
sign in the equation.

00:36:21.832 --> 00:36:23.540
AUDIENCE: This will
be posted on Stellar?

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.698
SARAH HEWETT: Yes.

00:36:24.698 --> 00:36:26.740
Yeah, all of the slides
will be posted on Stellar

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.600
so you can see it
in a larger form,

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.335
because I know they didn't
print out super well.

00:36:32.335 --> 00:36:32.835
OK.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.540
So now we can take a
look at the reaction

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.840
that you're going to do in
a slightly different form.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.570
And you may have
seen this before,

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.800
but we're going to do it anyway.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:58.390
So hydrogen peroxide, you
may have some at your house.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.100
They sell it in a drugstore.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.350
It's like, 3% so it's not
as concentrated as the stuff

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.017
that we're going to
be using in the lab.

00:37:04.017 --> 00:37:05.480
But nonetheless,
hydrogen peroxide

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.990
is a thing that you can buy.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:12.058
And it naturally
decomposes over time,

00:37:12.058 --> 00:37:13.600
so this reaction is
always happening.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.350
If you have a bottle
of hydrogen peroxide,

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.540
usually the caps are vented
because if you seal it

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.540
for too long, you'll build
up pressure of oxygen

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.692
and that's a problem.

00:37:20.692 --> 00:37:22.400
The stuff that we have
in the lab is 30%,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.120
so that's definitely vented, and
we store it in the refrigerator

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.000
so that we slow
down the reaction

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.150
and keep our product for longer.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:34.420
So it is always happening
and you can speed it up

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.370
in a number of ways.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.840
So one of the ways is obviously
using enzymes, catalase.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.867
That'll speed up the reaction.

00:37:39.867 --> 00:37:42.200
But there are other catalysts
that you can use, as well.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.000
So have you guys seen the
elephant toothpaste reaction

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.290
before?

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.190
Yes.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.607
Do you guys know
what the catalyst

00:37:49.607 --> 00:37:50.620
is that we use for this?

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:55.390
There's a few you can use,
but does anyone remember?

00:37:55.390 --> 00:38:01.600
So we're going to react
hydrogen peroxide with potassium

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.570
iodide in this case.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.670
And you can use a
couple different ones,

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.378
like manganese dioxide,
I believe, works.

00:38:05.378 --> 00:38:06.910
You can use different
iodide salts,

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:11.570
but potassium iodide is
the one that I have today.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.850
And we're going to do a
little bit of an experiment.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:17.800
So we said that concentration
effects rate, right?

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.720
So we will try
our first reaction

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.870
with some hydrogen peroxide.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:31.460
And I'm going to pour out
about 10 milliliters of this

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:35.360
and then dilute it so that our
new concentration is about 7%.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.010
Yeah, that's right.

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.240
So pour that in there.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.330
And then we want to use a
potassium iodide solution.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.700
So we can pour some
of this in here.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.830
And then we have
the oxygen bubbles,

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.650
and who did the catalase
reaction yesterday in lab?

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.300
Anybody who's here?

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.760
So what did you guys see
when you added the enzyme

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.770
to your peroxide in the tube?

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.170
Bubbles, good.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.490
But it didn't foam up, right?

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.040
Because they just popped
and formed oxygen.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.570
So the way that we can get this
to foam is by adding some soap.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.390
This is just powdered soap.

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:31.140
And we can add a couple
of scoops of that.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.090
And now hopefully,
if all goes well,

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:39.060
when I add these together,
we will see the decomposition

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.489
of hydrogen peroxide.

00:39:50.016 --> 00:39:52.433
I can probably hold it up so
you can see what's happening.

00:39:55.822 --> 00:39:57.030
So what's happening in there?

00:40:00.096 --> 00:40:01.830
It's bubbling, good.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:02.330
Excellent.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:03.960
So what are the bubbles?

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.230
Oxygen. All right, so
it's taking its time.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.460
So while that is going,
we can set up another one.

00:40:15.072 --> 00:40:17.280
And this time, we won't
dilute the hydrogen peroxide,

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:25.960
so we'll just use 40 milliliters
of hydrogen peroxide.

00:40:30.415 --> 00:40:31.140
Need our soap.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.360
Yeah.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.827
Yeah, so it looks
like toothpaste maybe.

00:40:48.827 --> 00:40:50.660
Toothpaste that an
elephant would use, yeah.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:54.680
What?

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.090
Elephant toothpaste.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:57.050
Yeah.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.742
I also, in the course of
doing some research for this,

00:40:59.742 --> 00:41:02.075
found that some people call
it old foamy, like a guyser.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.130
So you may have heard
it by that name.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.600
All right, and then
we add the same amount

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.960
of potassium iodide.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.585
Hopefully I measured
this out properly.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.310
So if that was 7%
hydrogen peroxide,

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.393
what do we think is going
to happen if we use 30%?

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:26.140
Faster.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.050
Let's find out.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:43.410
So can you see the
steam coming off of it?

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:46.040
Yeah, so what does that
mean about the reaction?

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:46.957
It's exothermic.

00:41:46.957 --> 00:41:47.790
Yeah, it's very hot.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:51.840
If you were to come up here and
touch this, it is quite warm.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.480
But yeah, so that
went faster, right?

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.640
So we can do a
little bit of math

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.720
about how much faster the
potassium iodide makes

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.570
the reaction go than just what
would happen in your bottle

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.100
at home.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.730
And so our activation energy of
hydrogen peroxide decomposition

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:10.620
that is uncatalyzed,
just happens in nature,

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.380
is 75 kilojoules per mole.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.170
So if we use our
Arrhenius equation,

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:19.320
then we can plug in 75
kilojoules or 75,000 joules

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.980
to match our or
gas constant units.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.350
And then the activation
energy of the decomposition

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.510
as catalyzed by
potassium iodide is

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:30.060
about 56 kilojoules per
mole, so it lowers it,

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.840
makes the reaction go faster.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.020
If you do this math out--

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.150
I don't want to get my
numbers wrong here--

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:49.580
it is about 2,500 times
faster or 2,400 times faster

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.320
than what would
happen in nature.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:57.370
Now, if we talk about
catalase, and you guys

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.770
will calculate the
actual activation

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:02.830
energy of the
catalase-catalyzed reaction,

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.860
I will start and tell you that
it is less than 10 kilojoules

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.373
per mole.

00:43:06.373 --> 00:43:08.290
So that is a pretty
significant change, right?

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:12.830
Going from 75 kilojoules
per mole down to 10 or less.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:13.460
That's a lot.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.820
So if you do this math out,
where you go from 75,000 joules

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.000
to 10,000 joules, does
anyone have any guesses

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.980
as to how much faster
the catalase is

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.700
than just normal decomposition?

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.300
A lot.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:38.710
So that's a lot faster.

00:43:42.195 --> 00:43:43.570
So you can be
thinking about that

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:45.237
when you are thinking
about what happens

00:43:45.237 --> 00:43:49.060
in the cells of your body
because you are forming

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.810
these superoxide radicals
and hydrogen peroxide

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:54.190
all the time in your cells.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.950
And this reaction is happening
on this scale, or the reaction

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.130
that you just saw is happening
this many times faster

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:03.790
in your body, and you will see
it happen also in your flask.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:08.285
So any questions, thoughts?

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.280
No?

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.290
All right, well, thank you guys.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.320
You can head to lab.

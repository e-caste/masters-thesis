00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's get started.
We have a lot more chemistry to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
learn today.
And, as you are probably

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
becoming aware,
the octahedron plays a very

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
important role in the
coordination chemistry of the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
d-block elements.
So we are going to begin today

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
also with the octahedron.
And I just want to remind you

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
of the approach that we were
taking on Monday to understand

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
how d-orbitals split under the
influence of the presence of a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
set of ligands.
And this splitting I am

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
referring to is an energy
splitting.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We are talking once again about
how we can use energy level

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
diagrams to understand and
interpret the properties of

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
molecules.
And today, in particular,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we are going to be thinking
about how we can go from the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
angular properties of the d
orbitals all the way to some of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the magnetic and spectroscopic
or color properties of ions that

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
contain these d-block transition
elements.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And so, you will remember last
time on Monday,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we looked at placing ligands at
positions one through six on the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
octahedron in reference to our
coordinate system that we had

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
chosen, x, y,
and z here, as specified.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And what we were doing was,
at each of these positions that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
corresponds to a ligand atom,
evaluating each of the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
d-orbitals for the value of
theta and phi that is found at

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that ligand position.
And so, I am going to put up

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
part of the table that we
generated last time.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And that part will correspond
to ligand position,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
where we have ligands one,
two, three, four,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
five, and six.
Those six ligand positions.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And two of the d orbitals here,
d z squared and d x

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
squared minus y squared,
were found to give

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
non-zero values at these six
ligand positions that correspond

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to an octahedral complex.
The other three d-orbitals gave

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
zero at those positions because
all six of these ligands lie on

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
nodal planes of xz,
yz, and xy.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And what we are doing is just
writing down,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in tabular form,
the relative magnitude of what

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
you get if you evaluate the
orbital at those ligand

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
positions.
We had one in positions one and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
six, which are on the big lobes
of d z squared along

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the z-axis.
And we set that to one because

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that is the largest value that
we get when we evaluate any of

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
the orbitals.
And then, relative to that,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
these ligands two through five
that are in the x,y-plane and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which interact with the torus of
the d z squared

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
orbital in the x,y-plane,
have a value of one-quarter of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
what it is along the z-axis.
And then, d x squared minus y

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
squared
evaluated at positions one and

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
six gave us a zero.
And that is because positions

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
one and six fall on the z-axis,
which is actually an

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
intersection of two nodal planes
for the d x squared minus y

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
squared orbital.
And then, here we have at

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
positions two through five,
three-quarters.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And if you are having trouble
understanding what these numbers

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
mean, remember that we started
out with a sphere,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
so we are interested in seeing
essentially, what the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
probability is in finding that
electron in that particular d

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
orbital at that point on the
surface of the sphere.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And so what this is saying is
that, if you will,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the radial probability of
finding an electron in d z

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
squared along the
torus at some distance from the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
center is one-quarter what it is
along the z-axis at the same

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
distance from the center.
And then, at that same

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
distance, if we are in the
x,y-plane along x or along y,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
because that is where the lobes
of d x squared minus y squared

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
extend,
that probability drops to

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
three-quarters relative to the
two big lobes of d z squared

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
along z.
You can think of it as telling

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
you about the size of the lobes.
And, accordingly,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
the way that these lobes of the
d-orbitals can interact with the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
ligands at these positions on
the surface of the sphere coming

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
right out of evaluating the
angular parts of the wave

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
function.
And then, there are other

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
important coordination
geometries that we have to

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
consider.
Because coordination number

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
six, which corresponds to the
octahedron, is relatively

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
common.
But coordination number four is

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
also quite common.
And one of the important

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
coordination geometries for
coordination number four is a

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
tetrahedral coordination
geometry.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The tetrahedron is not limited
to being important in organic

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
chemistry.
It is also important for

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
coordination chemistry.
And you will recall that when

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
we look at a tetrahedron we talk
about ligands at alternating

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
corners of a cube.
And I will call these ligand

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
positions seven,
eight, nine,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and ten.
And, if we have a tetrahedral

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
metal complex with four ligands,
be they water ligands or

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
chloride ligands and be the
central metal ions,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
something like cobalt two
or nickel two,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
a tetrahedral array
like this is produced.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And we can go ahead and
evaluate the d orbital wave

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
functions at theta and phi
values that correspond to these

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
positions, seven,
eight, nine,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and ten, all at the same
distance from the center.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And then we can generate a
similar table,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
where we have our ligand
position and our set of d

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
orbitals.
And I will start here with

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
d(xz), d(yz) and d(xy),
and over here,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
d z squared and d x
squared minus y squared.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And we need our ligands

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
positioned at seven,
eight, nine,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and ten, which are these
alternating corners of the cube,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which is the tetrahedral
geometry.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And what we find,
when we go through and evaluate

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
for those theta and phi values
that correspond to these ligand

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
positions using our polar
coordinate system and then

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
scaling it the same way that we
do over here for the octahedron,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
is that all of these values
come out to be one-third.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Notice that,
in the case of the octahedron,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
we are interacting with some of
the lobes, like the lobes of d z

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
squared,
the large ones,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
directly along the axis that
makes it a pure sigma

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
interaction, a cylindrically
symmetric interaction.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
A big lobe of d z squared
and a ligand coming

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
in along the z-axis.
But if you think of the

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
positions of the lobes of the
xz, yz, and xy orbitals relative

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to these ligand positions,
seven, eight,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
nine, and ten,
the interaction is kind of

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
oblique.
It is not zero.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
We are not on a node,
but it is pretty small.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The overlap is not going to be
as good.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And it evaluates to one-third
for all of those positions.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What we find is that while xz,
yz, and xy were all zero over

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
here for the octahedral case,
over here, for the tetrahedral

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
case, they are all the same
again, but they are not at zero.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
They are at one-third.
And then, for x squared minus y

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
squared,
remember x squared minus y

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
squared has its lobes along x
and y.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
What that means is that ligands
seven, eight,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
nine, and ten actually lie on a
nodal surface of the d x squared

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
minus y squared orbital.
And that means that this is

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
zero, this is zero,
this is zero,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and this is zero.
And the amazing thing about the

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
math of the tetrahedral geometry
is that these ligands,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
seven, eight,
nine, and ten also lie on the

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
nodal surface of d z squared.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Remember that d z squared looks
like this and has our opposite

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
phase torus in the middle and
then has a conical nodal

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
surface.
We actually went ahead and --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
If you set the equation for d z
squared equal to zero

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and solved for it,
we found this angle here.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We found that angle.
And you will remember that that

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
was the arc cosine of root three
over three.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It turns out that that value is
exactly half of the tetrahedral

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
angle, which is the angel
between seven,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the center and eight.
And, because of this,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
all ligands,
seven, eight,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
nine, and ten lie on the
conical nodal surface of d z

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
squared,
such that we get zeros here,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
too.
One thing that relates very

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
nicely, the orbital picture for
the tetrahedral case for the

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
octahedral case,
is that z squared has the same

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
energy as x squared minus y
squared.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
When you sum over all the
ligand positions,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
we are going to get three here,
and we are going to get three

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
here.
And xz, yz, and xy all have

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
zero.
And over here xz,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
yz, and xy all have
four-thirds.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And z squared and x
squared minus y squared

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
both have zero.
And so I will redraw that over

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
here.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
What we are doing is drawing up
d orbital splitting diagrams for

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
two different possible
coordination geometries for a

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
coordination complex.
Let me just make that very

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
clear.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And I have my energy units
here, zero, one,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
two, three.
And this energy level diagram

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
looks like this for the
octahedral.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And we symbolize the octahedral
geometry with this Oh for

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
octahedral.
And we have here an energy

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
splitting.
We have a triply degenerate set

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000
of orbitals which we recognize
as xz, yz, and xy.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And the name that we give to
that triply degenerate set is

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
t(2g).
This t(2g) triply degenerate

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000
set, for this whole set,
is the t(2g) set.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
If I use that label t(2g),
you should remember the

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
specific d orbitals that
contribute to the t(2g) set and

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
make up the t2g set.
Up here we have the d z squared

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and the d x squared
minus y squared

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
at the same energy,
which are three relative energy

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
units here.
And those two together

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
constitute the e(g) set.
And I will often write that

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
with a star because we are going
to find out later,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
when we do the molecular
orbital theory of coordination

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
complexes, that these are
antibonding.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And the reason they are
antibonding is because,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
if you go over here and look at
it, if you have a ligand that

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
wants to act as a Lewis base
with respect to d z squared,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
then putting an
electron in d z squared

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
leads to repulsion of
that ligand, generating

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
antibonding characters.
You want your Lewis acid to

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
have empty orbitals to receive
lone pairs of electrons.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And, if instead they are
populated, that corresponds to

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
antibonding character,
much like we have talked about

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
for other types of molecular
orbital diagrams.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
This d-orbital splitting
diagram for Oh is really a

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
simplified molecular orbital
diagram for the molecule in

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
which we just look at those
orbitals that derive from the

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
set of five d orbitals on that
metal ion.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Because these are the orbitals,
--

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
-- and, together with the
electrons that occupy them,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
they control the properties of
color and magnetism that we will

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
be talking about for the rest of
today.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And let me remind you here that
we have a name for the magnitude

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
of this splitting,
which is called delta O for

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
octahedral.
And then, we also have the

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
tetrahedral case.
And how do we get the diagram

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
from this?
We just sum over the

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
contributions from each of the
ligand positions.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
In tetrahedral,
there are only four ligands.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
For xz, yz, and zy we have to
sum up four times one-third,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and that gives us,
for that set of three orbitals

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
using the same energy scale as
over there, three orbitals at a

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
value of four-thirds and two
orbitals down here at our zero

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
of energy.
And these will be d z squared,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
located on that
node, and x squared minus y

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
squared.
Whereas, up here we have xz,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
yz, and zy.
And these get the names e and

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
t(2) in the tetrahedral
geometry.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And the splitting between the
levels, the doubly degenerate

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and the triply degenerate pair
of energy levels,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
is here referred to as delta t.
And from the math of these two

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
tables and the magnitude of this
splitting being three relative

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
to this one being four-thirds,
you can easily derive the

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000
relation that delta t is equal
to four-ninths of delta O.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
One of the neat things about

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
this result qualitatively is
that if you have more ligands,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
six versus four,
you have a larger splitting of

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
the energy levels.
And that corresponds to putting

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
more Lewis bases,
more negative charges,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
around that sphere that we
talked about,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
in the coordination sphere.
And also, if you have

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
interactions between ligands and
metal d orbitals that are end-on

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
sigma symmetry,
directed at each other,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
you get bigger splitting
because that leads to better

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
overlap than the type of oblique
overlap that you get if you have

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
a ligand at a position such as
seven relative to an orbital

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
like d(xz).
You can now see that to fully

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
appreciate this,
you really have to have a very

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
good grasp of the nodal
properties of the d orbitals.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
This is why I am going to
re-emphasize that you should

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
spend some time on the computer
visualizing these things and

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
rotating them around and seeing
where these ligand positions for

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
these different coordination
geometries are with respect to

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
each of the five d orbitals.
That is quite important.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Also, you are going to see that
you could consider other

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
possible coordination geometries
that involve ligands at these

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
positions or at other positions.
For coordination number five,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
you could have a trigonal
bipyramid coordination geometry.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And you could go ahead and
evaluate the d orbitals at the

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
relevant positions.
You would already have three of

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
them here because in a trigonal
bipyramid, you would have

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
ligands at positions one and
six, and two.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And then two more back here at
120 degrees to two,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
but in the x,y-plane.
So you can do a trigonal

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
bipyramid the same way and
generate the d-orbital splitting

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
diagram for it.
You can also go ahead and do a

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
d-orbital splitting diagram for
a different geometry

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
corresponding to coordination
number four, which would be the

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
square planar coordination
geometry.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
If you just took ligand
positions two,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
three, four,
and five you could generate a

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
diagram.
And that diagram would be

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
relevant for systems that do
have square planar coordination

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
around a metal center,
and these are actually fairly

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
common.
Those are the four coordination

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
geometries, octahedral,
tetrahedral,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
trigonal bipyramid,
and square planar that are all

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
pretty commonly encountered and
that you can actually interpret

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
pretty nicely using the
d-orbital splitting diagrams.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Now, one of the properties that
we are going to want to

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
interpret will be the magnetism.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
And, in talking about the
magnetism of coordination

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
complexes, we are going to start
by mentioning two terms that you

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
have probably heard,
but I would like to define

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
explicitly today.
One is paramagnetic.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
That term is given to
substances that are attracted

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
into a magnetic field.
It is somehow a bulk phenomenon

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
that we are going to relate to
properties of d orbital

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
splitting diagrams.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
And systems can also be
described as diamagnetic.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And there are many other types
of magnetic behavior that we

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000
won't be discussing.
I'm a little too close to the

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
board, here.
Diamagnetic.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And that means that the
substance is repelled out of or

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.000
away from a magnetic field.
And one thing that you should

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
keep in mind is that the
magnitude of paramagnetism is

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000
usually orders of magnitude
greater than the magnitude of

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
diamagnetism.
So, this is much larger.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And what this means is if a
substance behaves as a

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
paramagnet, you can often
neglect its diamagnetism that

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
also may be present,
also must be present.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
The substances that are
paramagnetic are also

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
diamagnetic, but the
paramagnetism is much larger in

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
terms of its order of magnitude
and wins out.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
If you want to measure one of
these quantities for a system,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
that which is far more
difficult to measure is the

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
diamagnetism because it is a
much smaller number.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And then, I want to bring up
this quantity S.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
This is the spin quantum
number.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000
And you can readily calculate S
from looking at a populated d

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:43.000
orbital spitting diagram because
it will be the total number of

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000
electrons multiplied by
one-half, which is the spin per

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
electron.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
If you are confronted with a
particular coordination complex,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
the kind of thought process you
will need to go through is,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
what is the coordination
number, what is the coordination

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
geometry, what does the d
orbital splitting diagram look

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
like, how many electrons do I
have with which to populate the

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
d orbital splitting diagram?
After I have figured out how to

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
populate the d orbital splitting
diagram, how many of those

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
electrons are unpaired?
That gives me this.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I can then calculate S.
And, if I have S,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
I can make a prediction about
the value of something called

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
the spin-only magnetic moment.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Let me mention one more thing
back here, and that would be the

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
units.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.000
When we talk about magnetism,
we are going to be using units.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
This is called the Bohr
magneton.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
It is sometimes written as mu
sub b.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
It is also sometimes written as
capital B., capital M.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
That is the Bohr
magneton.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:39.000
And it is equal to
9.2741x10^-24 joules per tesla.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:47.000
This is the value of the Bohr
magneton.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:58.000
And the Bohr magneton is the
unit, also, of our magnetic

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
moment.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
And in particular,
today, I am going to be talking

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
about the spin-only value of the
magnetic moment.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
So we are going to be making
predictions using spin-only

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
considerations.
And for those considerations,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
we need to be able to calculate
S.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And we can do that pretty
quickly after we have it

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
correctly populated,
correctly chosen d orbital

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
splitting diagram for the
system.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And so the spin-only value for
the magnetic moment is given by

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
this formula,
which is mu is equal to 2.00

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
times the square root of S times
S plus one.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
And, in this formula,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
this part, this square root of
S times S plus one,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
from the quantum mechanics,
is the value of the angular

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
momentum, the electron spin
angular momentum.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
And this value 2.00,
I am calling it 2.00.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
It is actually a number that
differs only very slightly from

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
two.
So we can, for most purposes,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
use 2.00.
This is called the gyromagnetic

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
ratio of the electron.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
And, as its name implies,
it is the ratio of the angular

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
momentum to the magnetic moment
for the electron.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
This is our conversion factor
to go back and forth between

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
angular momentum and magnetic
moment.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
And that factor is the
gyromagnetic ratio for the

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
electron.
You will see this as gamma,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
sometimes.
And, for the free electron

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
value, it is a number very close
to two.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
And so, if you think about
different ions that could be at

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
the center of a coordination
complex, you wonder,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
well, what are my possible
values for the spin-only

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
magnetic moment,
as given by this formula?

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Well, we can make a table for
that.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
We have the number of electrons
that are unpaired,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
remember.
And then, we will be able to

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
calculate S.
And then we will want to get

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
mu, which is this spin-only
value calculated according to

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
that formula.
And ions from the part of the

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Periodic Table that we may
consider working with can have

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
up to seven unpaired electrons.
These numbers,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
like six and seven,
are more important for the

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
lanthanide ions in systems with
f-electrons than for systems

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
with d electrons.
But, nonetheless,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
we can easily make these
predictions the same way.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
And so S would be one-half for
one electron,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
one, then three-halves,
then two for four unpaired

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
electrons, then five-halves for
five unpaired electrons,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
then three, and then
seven-halves finally for seven

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
unpaired electrons.
And if you put this into this

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.000
formula, you would see that for
one unpaired electron,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000
it would be one-half times
one-half plus one square root

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
times two.
That would be square root of

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
three, so this would be a
spin-only magnetic moment of

00:00:01.730 --> 00:29:35.000
And then for S equals one,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000
we actually have a value of
about 2.83.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000
And then for three unpaired
electrons, we have a value of,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
let's say approximately 3.87.
And then for S equals two,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000
or four unpaired electrons,
we have a value of 4.90.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
For the spin-only magnetic
moment, if you go through with

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
these values of S,
these numbers of unpaired

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
electrons.
Let's just make sure we are

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
very clear on that.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
And then 5.92,
6.93, 7.94 approximately.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.000
You can check those numbers,
but they are approximately

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
right.
And in each case what you are

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
seeing is the spin-only
prediction for the magnetic

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
moment is always,
in units of Bohr magnetons,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
a little less than one plus the
number of unpaired electrons.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
It is not like you have four
unpaired electrons,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
so your spin-only magnetic
moment is around four.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
It is actually a little less
than five.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And that is because of the
quantum mechanics of the

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000
electron spin angular momentum.
And this kind of consideration,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
here, leads you into thinking
about what happens with

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
different d^n counts for a
particular type of metal

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
complex.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000
This means that we are going to
attack and address the high

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
spin/low spin problem.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
These systems are not so
terribly difficult,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
but let's face it;
--

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
-- once you have been presented
with a particular coordination

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
complex, and you think you know
the geometry,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
and you think you know the d
orbital splitting diagram that

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
corresponds to that geometry,
and you think you know how many

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
d electrons go into that
diagram, there is one more

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
thing.
And that is sometimes you have

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
to figure out if it is high spin
or if it is low spin.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
And what that means is for a
particular d^n count,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
there might be two possible
choices over here,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
depending on how the electrons
occupy the orbitals.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
And so let's look at an example
of this.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Here is energy.
Again, we are really focusing a

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
lot on energy level diagrams.
Sometimes we focus on molecular

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
orbital diagrams.
Right now, we are using these d

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000
orbital splitting diagrams.
And I will give you an example

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
that is octahedral.
And this is a species that we

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
looked at in a recent
demonstration in class,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
which is hexaaquo meaning six
waters around an iron two plus

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
in an octahedral array.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
This will be our metal complex
for which we will draw the d

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
orbital splitting diagram.
It is an octahedral complex,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
so we draw our diagram like
this.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And of course,
we have t(2g) and e(g)* levels

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
that we can populate with our d
electrons.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
And we are going to need to
figure out how many d electrons

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000
we have to put into this diagram
for the octahedral system.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
The oxidation state of the iron
here is +2.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And you can tell that because
the way you tell oxidation state

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
is to take into account both the
charge on the ligands.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Chlorides, for example,
are minus one.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Because water is a neutral
molecule, it is simply neutral.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
And then, you have to also take
into account the charge on the

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
whole ion.
So this is iron two plus.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
The iron in the plus two

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
oxidation state with six neutral
ligands.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
If I had six NH three
ligands in the same charge on

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
the ion, then it would still be
iron plus two.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
And you are going to get some
practice figuring out oxidation

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
state because if you cannot do
that correctly you cannot

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
identify the number of d
electrons to put into the

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
diagram correctly.
And this is iron plus two.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
You need to know that iron is

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
in Group 8 of the periodic
table.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
The equation for number of d
electrons here is eight minus

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
two equals six.
If it is in Group 8,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
that means that an iron atom
has eight valance electrons,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
the same way that carbon has
four valance electrons or oxygen

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
has six valance electrons.
And in Group 8 of the periodic

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
table, we are subtracting two
from the eight valance electrons

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
because there is a two plus
charge on the system.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
That leaves six valance
electrons on the iron.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
And that means this is what we
call a d six system.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
By convention,
we are considering all the

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
valance electrons that remain
after the metal has been

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
oxidized to plus two as d
electrons, meaning they are

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
going to go into our d orbital
splitting diagram.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Now, the reason we do this,
in fact, is because in ions

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
like this, the d orbitals are
the orbitals on the metal,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
on the iron,
that are the lowest in energy.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
After, in the case of iron,
iron has principle quantum

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
number three.
There is also a 4s and a 4p set

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
of orbitals available to iron,
but they are much higher in

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
energy.
We are simplifying the system

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
and just looking at what happens
with the five d orbitals,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
which are the lowest valance
energy orbitals available to the

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
iron.
Just like a carbon has a 2s and

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
a set of three 2p orbitals,
an iron has a set of five 3d

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
orbitals, a 4s,
and three 4p orbitals.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
But those s and p ones are
higher.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
We are just focusing on our d
orbitals, here,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
using our d orbital only
splitting diagrams with which we

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
have six electrons for
population of a diagram.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
And so what you see immediately
is you will identify with the

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
notion that there are two ways
to populate this diagram with

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
six electrons.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Because we can do this.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Here, we are following Hund's
rule of maximum multiplicity,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
trying not to pair up any
electrons until we run out of

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
spots for them,
and so we have to.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
There is one way to populate
the diagram.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Two electrons in e(g)*.
Four electrons in t(2g).

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
One of them,
spin inverted relative to the

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000
other five because you cannot
put two electrons in the same

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
orbital unless they have
different spins.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
And, finally,
we could populate the diagram

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
this way.
The case on the left is what we

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
call high spin.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
The case on the right is what
we call low spin.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And, as you think about it,
you will realize that the high

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
spin/low spin problem only
arises for certain d^n counts.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
It doesn't arise,
for example,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
for d one because we
would just put one electron down

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
here in t(2g) and that is not a
problem.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
And you will see that,
as you run through the d one

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
all the way up to the d
ten.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
d^n counts can go from d^0 to
d^10, and that is the limit of

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
the possibilities here.
Zero, one, two,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
three, four,
five, six, seven,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
eight, nine,
and ten.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Here I have chosen a d^6 case
to illustrate the high spin

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
versus low spin dichotomy.
And you might wonder when do

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
you --
Well, let me get back to that

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
in a moment.
And let me just say here that

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
we have four unpaired electrons
in d^6 high spin.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
We have one,
two, three, four.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
That makes this an s equals two
case.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
And, over here,
we have s equals zero.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
And so this one on the right,
this low spin case is s equals

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
zero.
We would say that this is not

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
paramagnetic.
It is going to be only

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
diamagnetic.
It has no unpaired electrons to

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
give it a magnetic moment
according to the spin-only

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
formula that we looked at over
here.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
On the other hand,
over here, we have an s equals

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
two state that predicts a
magnetic moment of 4.90 Bohr

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
magnetons.
And experimentally,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:35.000
mu was found for this system to
be 5.1 Bohr magnetons.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
So we say this one turned out
to be high spin.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And in a little while,
we will be talking more about

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.000
what are the physical factors
that determine whether a system

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000
is low spin or high spin.
Remember, we have this delta O

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
here.
And there is not one value for

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
delta O, and this is something I
am going to emphasize again in a

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
moment.
Delta O varies according to a

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
number of factors,
and these factors include the

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
specific nature of the ligands.
It includes the charge on the

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
metal center.
It includes the specific metal

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
that you are using.
And at some point,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
if delta O gets bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger and

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
exceeds what we call the pairing
energy --

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
This pairing energy is
something I will talk more about

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
later, but it is the energy
required to put two electrons in

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
the same d orbital.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
If you get to a condition where
delta O is greater than this

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
pairing energy,
in other words,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
there is a big splitting
between t(2g) and e(g)*,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
then the electrons will prefer
to pair up down here in the

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
t(2g).
Whereas, if you think of it

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
going to the limit of an
infinitely small delta O,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
they would have S equals two
because the gap between t(2g)

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
and e(g)* in the limit of
vanishing delta O,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
for example,
when ligands go to an infinite

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
distance away from the metal
center, they would then,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
in that limit,
have all five the same energy.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
And so your S would naturally
equal two.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000
If delta O is much greater than
the pairing energy giving a

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
large value of delta O,
then that favors low spin.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Factors that give rise to large
values of delta O favor low

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000
spin, and I will talk about a
few more factors like that in a

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
moment.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Here is a brief introduction to
the magnetic properties of

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
coordination complexes.
And I want to show that we can

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
use the same types of diagrams
to talk about the colors of

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
transition metal complexes.
We looked at the color change

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
in that demonstration I showed
you.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
And one of the really
fascinating aspects of

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
transition metal chemistry is
the colors that arise because of

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
absorption of a photon
coincident with promotion of an

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
electron from t(2g) to e(g)*.
And so we will talk briefly now

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000
about electronic / absorption
spectroscopy.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:48.000
And the most important thing I
want to impart to you here is a

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
selection rule wherein delta S
is equal to zero.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
This is the spin selection
rule.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
And this means that when a
photon comes in and interacts

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
with d electrons in a system of
the type we are discussing,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
that photon can be absorbed
coincident with promotion of an

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
electron from t(2g) to e(g)*,
as long as it doesn't violate

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
this spin selection rule.
And that means that the number

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
of unpaired electrons should be
the same in the system before

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
the photon is taken up,
as it is after.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And so here is an example of
that, a simple example.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Here is an octahedral system,
titanium with six waters and a

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
three plus charge.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Titanium is in Group 4 of the
periodic table.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Our water ligands are neutral,
with three plus charges to be

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
subtracted from four.
We have a d^1 system.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
This is one of the simplest
cases for talking about

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
electronic absorption
spectroscopy and is the first

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
thing that you encounter in your
textbook.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
By the way, let me just remind
you that right now you should be

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
reading Chapter 16 in your
textbook, that deals with

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
coordination chemistry,
electronic structure of d-block

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
elements, colors and magnetism,
and so forth.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
And the ground state,
here, is one in which t(2g) has

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
a single electron in it for this
d^1 ion and e(g)* is vacant.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
And, if that system,
in the case of titanium three

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
aquo in aqueous solution,
is a pale blue color,

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
a pretty pale blue --
If a photon comes in of the

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
appropriate energy delta O to
promote the electron into e(g)*,

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
then that transforms this
system into an excited state,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
as follows, with a
configuration (t two g) zero and

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
(e g star) one.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
These diagrams,
just like the molecular orbital

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
diagrams we developed for
diatomic molecules,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
can be associated with
configurations.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
And this transition can be
written as( t two g) one (e g

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
star) zero,
photon in, electron promoted

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
into e g star,
t two g zero and e g star one

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
now corresponding
to the excited

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
state.
And this excited state is

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000
produced in a vibrationally
excited manner.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
And it and the ground state
interact with the environment in

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
different ways,
such that the absorption

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
spectrum for a system of this
type gives rise to not a sharp,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
but a broad peak.
And, in fact,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
the spectrum would look
something like this.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Going from 200 to
nanometers in wavelength,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
you would see a profile like
this with one broad peak

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
somewhere in the red,
such that we would be behind

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
the pale blue color of these
solutions of aqueous titanium

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.000
three. So this
would be an absorption

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000
spectrum, and this is
wavelength, down here.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
And this is the peak for what
we call this d-d transition,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
from t(2g) to e(g)*.
There are a lot more subtleties

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
on this, which is where I will
begin on Monday.

00:48:57.325 --> 00:49:00.000
Have a great weekend.

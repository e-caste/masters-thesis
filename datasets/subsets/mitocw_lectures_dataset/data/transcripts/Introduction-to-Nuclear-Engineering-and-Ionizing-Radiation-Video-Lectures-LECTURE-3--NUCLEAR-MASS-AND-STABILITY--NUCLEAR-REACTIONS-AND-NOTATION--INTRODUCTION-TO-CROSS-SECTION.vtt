00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:24.080
MICHAEL SHORT: So I'd like
to do a quick two or three

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.872
minute review of the
stuff we did last time

00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:27.578
to get you back
into where we were.

00:00:27.578 --> 00:00:29.120
We were talking
about different types

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.920
of technologies that
use the stuff you'll

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.710
be learning in 22.01.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.590
Everything ranging from nuclear
reactors for producing power,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.130
and the Cherenkov radiation
that tells you-- well,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.990
that the beta particles
are moving faster

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.610
than the speed of
light in water.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.790
It's a neat thing, too.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.280
I've actually been
to this reactor

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.200
at Idaho, to the
spent fuel pool.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.740
Even the spent fuel, once
it comes out of the reactor,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.270
is still giving
off betas and still

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.890
giving off Cherenkov radiation.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.140
And you can tell how long
it's been out of the reactor

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.220
by how dim the glow gets,
which is pretty cool.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.720
So you can tell how old a fuel
assembly is by the blue glow.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.737
So remember, I told you
guys, if someone says,

00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:08.320
oh, you're nuclear,
do you glow green?

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.300
You can be like, no, it's blue.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.670
That's the right way of things.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.860
We talked about
fusion energy and got

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.780
into some of the nuclear
reactions involved

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.590
in fusion energy.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.320
And I'll be teaching you
more about these today.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.000
Why fission and
fusion work, it all

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.370
has to do with the
stability and binding

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.750
energy of the nuclei involved.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.820
And that'll be the
main topic for today,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.440
is excess mass, binding
energy, nuclear stability.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.720
We looked at medical
uses of radiation,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.420
from implanting
radioactive seeds called

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.800
brachytherapy seeds in certain
places to destroy tumors,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.500
to imaging, to X-ray therapy,
to proton therapy using

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.460
accelerators, or cyclotrons,
to accelerate protons and send

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.920
them into people.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.210
If you remember, last
time we ran the SRIM code

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.460
of the stopping range
of ions and matter,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.050
and actually showed
that protons all

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.660
stop at a certain
distance in tissue,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.050
depending on their energy and
what you're sending them into.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.056
Let's see-- we talked
about brachytherapy.

00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:10.639
We talked about
radiotracers, and this

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.014
is going to be one of the
other main topics for today, is

00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:15.890
these decay diagrams,
and figuring out not only

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.650
what products are made,
but what energy levels do

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.900
the nuclei have, and
how do you calculate

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.550
the energy of the
radioactive decay

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.150
products and the recoil
nuclei, which do take away

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.730
some of the energy.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.310
We talked about one
way to get rich.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.060
If you guys can figure
out one of the ways

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.640
to solve this moly-99 shortage.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.440
Right now, it's mostly
made in reactors.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.390
The future has got
to be accelerators

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.450
or some sort of
switchable device

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.680
where you don't need
to construct a reactor

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.170
to make these medical isotopes
for imaging, and tracers,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.273
and such.

00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:47.690
And finally, we
got all the way up

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.980
to space applications,
shielding, crazy, different

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.770
types of shielding, like
electromagnetic shielding,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.920
to protect from high
energy protons, all the way

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.400
to radiothermal generators,
which use alpha decay

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.920
to produce a constant
amount of energy

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.210
on the order of one to 200
watts for like 100 years.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.943
And finally, to a
different configuration

00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:11.360
of nuclear reactors,
where you can

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.960
design them to produce thrust,
not necessarily electricity.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.558
And that's where we
stopped on Friday.

00:03:18.558 --> 00:03:20.600
So let's move on to one
of the things I'd alluded

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.780
to earlier, which is
semiconductor processing.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.450
This is actually a diagram
from the MIT reactor,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.520
because we have
this beam port here.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.260
Has anyone got to
see the silicon beam

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.760
port at the MIT reactor?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.135
Oh, seven, eight--
OK, about half of you.

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:36.760
For those who haven't,
who here has not

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.520
had a nuclear reactor tour?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.060
Oh man.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.807
OK.

00:03:40.807 --> 00:03:42.640
Well, you'll get one
when you get to control

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.367
the thing in early October.

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:46.450
So you actually get to go
down to the control room

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.040
and see the rest
of what's going on.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.050
So make sure to ask them,
show us the beam port

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.120
for silicon ingots.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.420
And I think I already told you
the story about the poor UROP

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.340
who held the ingots
up to their chest,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.358
getting about 10 months of
dose, which is not dangerous,

00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:01.900
but it meant that
for 10 months, they

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.370
could have no
radiation exposure,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.490
and they had to
answer the phone.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.750
So that's how we ensure
safety around here.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.835
There's other ones that--

00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:11.210
applications that
you're probably

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.220
carrying around in your pocket.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.630
You can use the
fact that charged

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.570
particles have very
finite ranges in matter

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.760
to separate little bits of
that matter from other things.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.090
So this is actually how
single-crystal sapphires

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.900
can be separated in little
slivers for protective phone

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.180
covers, because sapphire
is one of the most--

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.430
the hardest, or the most
scratch-resistant materials

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.500
there is.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.350
Single-crystal sapphire
is exceptionally strong,

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.660
and optically transparent,
and expensive.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.780
I know that because on
one of our experiments,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.190
we use a single-crystal sapphire
window to see into reactor

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.790
conditions at like 150
atmospheres, and 350

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.550
degrees Celsius, and
pretty corrosive chemistry.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.560
So you want to use as
little as possible.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.840
So you can use a big,
expensive accelerator

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.850
to limit the amount of
sapphire that you use.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.070
And this is actually
done here in Boston.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.060
There's a facility not far from
here that uses an accelerator.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.120
And this is their
super detailed diagram

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.440
of what the radiation
looks like--

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.970
yeah, whatever.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.260
But what they do is they
take-- they accelerate protons.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.090
They send them through
bending magnets

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.070
to steer that beam path.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.590
And then they send
them into a large piece

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.690
of single-crystal sapphire,
which is exceptionally

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.130
expensive to make.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.530
And they can actually
lift off a thin sliver

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.480
with micron precision.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.100
The reason for that
is the same reason

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.050
that we showed with
that SRIM code.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.140
If you have this exact
energy of protons

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.120
going into well-known
matter, you

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.930
know what its range is going
to be with an uncertainty

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.740
or so of about a micron.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.070
So you can have things that
come out thin, uniformly

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.180
thick, and smooth, right away.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.340
There's some other
really wacky products--

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.020
like has anyone heard of
these betavoltaic batteries?

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.990
No?

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.040
They rely on beta decay or the
direct capture and electricity

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.110
generation from a
radiation source

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.730
like radioactive tritium.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.840
So in this little chip is about
2 curies worth of tritium.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.430
You guys will learn
in about a week,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.370
how to go from activity
in curies to mass,

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.120
or something like that.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.550
And so this chip
actually contains

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.620
a lot of radioactive
tritium that

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.770
directly creates electricity.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.520
So you can hook into
that chip and produce

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.800
nanowatts for years.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.170
So it's one of these
batteries that lasts-- well,

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.280
as long as a couple half-lives
of the isotope that's inside.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.720
Now there's a trade-off here.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.270
The shorter the
half-life, the more active

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.000
a given isotope will be for
the same number of atoms,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.830
but the shorter it will last.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.700
So you can have higher power
for lower time, or lower power,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.210
higher time.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.250
It's the classic
energy trade-off--

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.440
works the same way
with irradiation.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.240
And so now I wanted
to get into some

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.250
of the more technical
stuff, where

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.920
we'll be talking about
nuclear mass and stability.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.240
And this is where the nuclear
stuff really begins in 22.01.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.100
First, I want to make sure
that we all agree on notation.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.410
So I'll be writing isotopes
in this sort of fashion,

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.970
where we refer to A as
the atomic mass, or just

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.040
the total number of nucleons.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.680
This is not the exact
mass of a nucleus.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.830
It just refers to the sum
of the protons and neutrons

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.123
in the nucleus itself.

00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:21.040
And a lot of what we'll
be talking about today

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.300
is the difference between
this nice integer mass number,

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.100
and the actual mass
of the nucleus,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.950
and that difference is
given by the binding energy,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.170
or the excess mass, which
are directly related.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.420
Z is just referred to
as the atomic number,

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.550
or the number of protons.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.450
It's what makes the
element what it,

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.510
which makes the name
kind of redundant.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.760
But it's-- humans
learned by association.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.430
It's easier to remember
element names or symbols

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.320
than which element is which
just by the number of protons.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.820
So a lot of times we'll use the
name, or at least the symbol

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.280
just so we know what's going on.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.950
And anything up here is
some sort of a charge.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.520
I do want to warn you guys of
the dreaded multiple symbol

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.860
use or multiple use of symbols.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.760
I'll try to stick
for a lower case q--

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.270
will be charged.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.490
And uppercase Q
is going to refer

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.190
to the Q value or the
energy consumed or released

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.420
by a nuclear reaction.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.310
So they're both Q's
but we're going to keep

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.882
one upper and lower case.

00:08:17.882 --> 00:08:19.340
And like we mentioned
before, let's

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.920
say we were to write a
typical nuclear reaction,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.520
like the capture of
neutrons by boron

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.180
to produce lithium-7,
helium-4, better

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.200
known as an alpha particle,
and some amount of energy.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.440
There's two places where we
actually use this reaction.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.960
One of them is as control rods.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.960
A lot of reactors use
boron for carbide,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.910
or this compound B4C, which
is conveniently solid, fairly

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.450
dense, and contains a whole
lot of boron in one place.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.850
Specifically,
enriched in boron-10,

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.910
because boron-10 has a high
cross section, or probability,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.308
for neutron capture.

00:08:57.308 --> 00:08:58.850
And the other one
is in what's called

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.120
boron neutron capture therapy.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.003
Have I discussed this with
you guys already, BNCT?

00:09:04.003 --> 00:09:05.420
Good, because
that's what we'll be

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.250
talking about for a few slides.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.980
And to write this whole
reaction is the same thing

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.330
as writing this shorthand
nuclear reaction.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.412
So this is often how you
see them in the reading,

00:09:14.412 --> 00:09:16.370
and in papers, because
it's shorter to do that.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.187
But it's the exact same thing.

00:09:19.187 --> 00:09:21.270
So I have a couple of
questions for you guys then.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.870
I have this extra Q here.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.210
Where does that Q actually go?

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.420
So let's say boron
and neutron absorb,

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.660
it produces two nuclei with
different binding energies.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.670
What happens to
the excess energy

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.260
created from the conversion
of mass to energy?

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:38.840
Yeah, Alex?

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.910
AUDIENCE: That could be heat.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:40.640
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.973
And heat, and more specifically?

00:09:41.973 --> 00:09:43.450
AUDIENCE: Kinetic energy.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.027
MICHAEL SHORT: Kinetic energy
of the radiation released.

00:09:47.027 --> 00:09:48.610
And so that kinetic
energy is actually

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.350
used to our benefit in BNCT, or
Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.670
The way this works--

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.440
once I hit play--

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.100
is you can either-- you can use
any sort of source of neutrons,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.860
either a reactor
or an accelerator,

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.267
through a lower complex
chain of events, like this.

00:10:05.267 --> 00:10:07.600
In this case, an accelerator--
so you don't need a whole

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.680
reactor--

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.590
fires a beam of
high-energy protons

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.475
into a beryllium target.

00:10:13.475 --> 00:10:15.310
Does that sound fairly familiar?

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.980
Firing something at
beryllium, releasing neutrons,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.690
like what Chadwick was doing?

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.000
Except he was firing
alpha particles into it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.890
This releases neutrons.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.040
What they don't have labeled
here is slowing down stuff,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.470
or probably
hydrogenous material,

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.890
so that the neutrons slow
down to a lower energy.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.950
And their probability
of capture increases

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.530
or their cross
section increases.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.447
And if you don't know
what a cross section is,

00:10:39.447 --> 00:10:41.760
the definition is
two slides away.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.280
And the idea here is that these
neutrons then enter the brain

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.650
or wherever the
tumor happens to be.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.130
And we rely on the fact that
tumor cells consume resources

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.370
much faster than regular cells,
especially neurons, which

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.170
after you're about five,
don't tend to grow very much.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.340
So it's all downhill by the
time you enter kindergarten.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.390
And we use that to our advantage
so that the neutrons coming in

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.850
will hit the cancer cells,
which will preferentially

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.120
uptake the borated
compounds, leaving most

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.470
of the normal cells intact.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.200
And the difference in
dose can be a factor of 5

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.760
or a factor of 10.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.370
So that the cancer gets fried
while doing as little damage

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.250
as possible to the remaining
brain cells, of which we

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.320
have fewer and fewer every day.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.910
So I say statistically
speaking you

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.440
guys are probably
smarter than me

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.670
if we go by number of
neurons in your brain,

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.630
because I think I'm the
oldest person in the room.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.200
And so now we can start to
explain, how does BNCT work,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.900
and why did we make the
choices that we did?

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.350
For example, they use
30 MeV protons in order

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.198
to induce these neutrons.

00:11:43.198 --> 00:11:45.740
So we have a nuclear reaction
that looks something like this.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.860
We start off with
beryllium-9 plus a proton--

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.450
let's just call it
hydrogen to stick

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.520
with our normal notation--

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.540
and becomes-- well, can someone
help me balance this reaction?

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.790
We know we get a neutron.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.975
What else is left?

00:12:02.975 --> 00:12:06.650
So Monica, what would you say?

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.646
AUDIENCE: Let's see--

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Even just say
number of protons and neutrons,

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.040
and we'll figure out
the symbol later.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.648
AUDIENCE: Number of
protons should be--

00:12:20.648 --> 00:12:22.190
MICHAEL SHORT: Sorry,
oh, that's a 4.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.718
AUDIENCE: The number of
protons should be five.

00:12:25.718 --> 00:12:26.510
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.420
Five protons, which
means it's boron.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.578
And number of neutrons
in the nucleus?

00:12:32.578 --> 00:12:33.120
Someone else?

00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:36.417
Yeah?

00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:37.437
AUDIENCE: Nine.

00:12:37.437 --> 00:12:38.270
MICHAEL SHORT: Nine.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.450
So we have boron-9.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.330
Not a stable isotope of boron,
but it doesn't really matter,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.960
because boron-9 almost
immediately decays into

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.310
an alpha, and an
alpha, and a hydrogen.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.628
But this nuclear
reaction right here

00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:56.420
is what we'll be studying
for a little bit.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.830
And there'll also be
some amount of energy.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:04.490
And this Q can actually
be positive or negative.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.710
No one said there had
to be energy released

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.450
in a nuclear reaction,
because in this case,

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:18.540
we actually start off with 30
MeV protons and roughly zero

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.998
MeV beryllium.

00:13:19.998 --> 00:13:21.540
If you want to get
really exact, it's

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.050
on the order of
about 0.01 eV, which

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.810
is why we neglect the
kinetic energy of beryllium

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.870
at room temperature.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.960
There are other
reactions that when

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.150
you fire a proton
into them will produce

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.547
neutrons, such as the
absorption of lithium.

00:13:36.547 --> 00:13:38.380
But can anyone think
of why we'd want to use

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.880
beryllium instead of lithium?

00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:48.020
Kristin, what do you think?

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.340
What could be a bad thing
about using lithium?

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.984
You ever throw in water?

00:13:54.984 --> 00:13:55.880
AUDIENCE: No.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.630
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.088
Then I should show
you what happens

00:13:58.088 --> 00:14:00.110
when you throw it in water.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.850
There's a few bad
things about lithium.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.400
It does this when you
throw it in water.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.170
It's one of the alkali metals.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.540
It's got an awfully
low melting point.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.910
It reacts with oxygen to
produce an oxide almost

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:11.880
instantaneously.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.760
So if you ever take a
lithium battery apart,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.700
which you shouldn't, but if
you watch the video of somebody

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.340
else doing it, you'll see that
the lithium foil turns black

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.570
almost instantly.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.550
It also has a pretty
poor thermal conductivity

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.610
and doesn't hold that structural
integrity when it melts.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.518
So it's not that good
of a target to use.

00:14:28.518 --> 00:14:30.560
Beryllium's pretty cool
in that it's the lightest

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.275
structural material there is.

00:14:32.275 --> 00:14:33.650
Folks tend to make
satellites out

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.690
of it, because it
costs a lot of money

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.077
to launch things into space.

00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:39.410
And if you want something
that has a high melting point,

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.440
and is light, and is structural,
beryllium's your way to go.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.800
It also happens to be a
great neutron generator.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.230
And then why 30 MeV?

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.950
In this case, we're going
to use a table called JANIS,

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:56.230
which I've got open over here.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.407
And I just have to clone my
screen so you can see it.

00:14:59.407 --> 00:15:01.990
This is a resource that I think
you guys are going to be using

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.670
quite a lot in this course.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.038
We have a link to it on
the learning module site.

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:08.080
And I'm going to show you
how it works right now.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.690
So I tend to use the web
version because it works

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.460
on any browser, any computer.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.080
And now you can start to pick
which nuclear reaction you're

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.830
looking at.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.230
And you can get
tabulated cross sections.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.760
So I'm going to start by
zooming all the way out.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.715
We can pick our
incident particle.

00:15:25.715 --> 00:15:27.090
Since in this
case, we're looking

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.870
at the firing of
protons into beryllium,

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.680
I'll pick the incident
proton data right here.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.410
There's a lot of different
databases with sometimes

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.450
conflicting information.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.870
I tend to go with the most
recent one you can find.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.850
And click on cross sections.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.190
And this is, again another
table of nuclides, anything

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.990
in green there's data for.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:53.640
Anything in gray, there isn't.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.980
So let's go all the way
back to the light nuclei,

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.840
zoom in, go back down
to the light nuclei

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.910
again until we find beryllium-9.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:12.110
Double-click on that, and
let's look for the anything

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.700
cross section.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.870
And this is a pretty
wide energy scale.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.990
So you can actually change
your X minimum and maximum.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.970
So let's change it to
a minimum and maximum--

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.590
I don't know-- a
maximum of 50 MeV.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:30.260
We don't have to see all of
that other stuff going on.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.020
50 MeV and maybe
a minimum of 10.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.970
If you notice-- actually,
I'll go back to 1.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.490
And I want to point
something out.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.775
You can actually get a
good yield of beryllium.

00:16:43.775 --> 00:16:46.150
Let's see-- you can actually
get a good yield of neutrons

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.940
by firing protons at
beryllium in lower energies.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.090
But I notice there's
this interesting feature

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.410
right around there.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.577
The cross section's flatter.

00:16:54.577 --> 00:16:55.827
And so if you want to get an--

00:16:55.827 --> 00:16:57.310
ensure that you
get the right dose,

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.530
you might want to deal
with a flatter cross

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.308
section or a flatter
probability region,

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:03.100
so that you have
something more predictable

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.230
instead of in a really
high slope region.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.849
But some of these
nuclear reactions

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:11.480
actually take extra energy
in order to move forward.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.690
And we'll show you another
example pretty quickly.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.020
Let's go back to
our slides here.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.240
Then another question
is, how does the boron

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.220
only get into the cancer cells?

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.810
Like we mentioned
before, cancer cells

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.609
are actively
growing, which means

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.820
they need a very large
and active blood supply.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.670
And so it's one way for
things to, let's say,

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.980
not quite cross the
blood-brain barrier.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.190
If the cancer cells are growing
and your neurons aren't, then

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.605
your cancer cells are going
to use more energy, take

00:17:40.605 --> 00:17:43.290
in more sugar, which
might be doped with boron,

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.005
or some other compound
doped with boron,

00:17:45.005 --> 00:17:47.130
and that's all you can get
the boron into the cells

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.960
that you want.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.870
And then why was boron
selected for the therapy?

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.130
Let's think about that.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:58.490
What happens after the
neutron is created?

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.180
And let's write the next
stage of the reaction.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.870
In boron neutron
capture therapy,

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:10.260
we rely on doping the patient
with boron-10 to release

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:21.510
an alpha particle, and
lithium-7 and a gamma ray.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.922
So now what we
can start doing is

00:18:22.922 --> 00:18:25.380
look at the table of nuclides,
which I'm going to teach you

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.630
how to read now, to
figure out-- let's

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.560
say that this neutron had
an energy of about zero eV

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.120
and the boron nucleus had
an energy of about zero eV.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:42.780
And in the end, all this
stuff here has gained or lost

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.360
some sort of energy
cue, Q. And today we're

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.200
going to teach you how
to calculate this Q.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.330
So I want to skip ahead to how
to read the table of nuclides.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.320
So there's all-- this is
like the poster you'll

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.570
see in every nuclear building.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.303
It's kind of what makes us, us.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.220
What you'll notice is
that there's a whole lot

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.070
of nuclei at the lower left.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.940
They are the light ones.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.340
At the upper right, they
are the heavier ones.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.040
And they're colored
by half-life.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.620
In general, the blue
ones will be stable,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.320
and the further away you get
from blue, the less stable

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.185
they get.

00:19:14.185 --> 00:19:16.560
So right away, without even
delving deeper, what patterns

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560
do you guys notice here?

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.310
Yeah, Alex?

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.897
AUDIENCE: As they get bigger,
heavier, they're more unstable.

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:25.730
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.082
There's a whole section
where there's no more blue.

00:19:29.082 --> 00:19:30.290
There are no stable elements.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.590
So stability drops off
after a certain point.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.890
And what about in the
region of stable isotopes?

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.950
Does anybody notice any
repeating patterns here?

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.000
Take a look at every other row.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.040
There's a bunch of
blues and then one,

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.090
and then a bunch and then one,
and then more and then none.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.310
That must be technetium,
because that's

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.920
the only element around
there that doesn't have any.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.050
And then a bunch of blues.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.310
So every other row--

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.550
and in this case, it's
increasing number of protons--

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.490
has more or fewer
stable isotopes.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.280
It turns out that
the even numbered

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.070
isotopes have a lot more stable
ones, for reasons that we'll

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.900
get into pretty soon.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.598
If you zoom in a
little bit, you can

00:20:14.598 --> 00:20:16.140
see all the different
isotopes so you

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.460
can select which ones you want.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.600
And again, if you look
really closely, that's--

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.370
let's say, neon right here
has got a few stable ones.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.840
Sodium has one.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.890
Magnesium as three.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.240
Aluminum has one.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.872
And this pattern
repeats all the way up

00:20:28.872 --> 00:20:30.330
to the point where
you don't really

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.730
get any more stable isotopes.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.525
If you double-click
on one of them,

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:36.150
you get all the
information that you'll

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.740
need for the next three
or so weeks of the course.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.250
So in this case, I
picked on sulfur-32,

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.530
one of the stable
isotopes of sulfur.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.800
So if you notice it doesn't
have any decay mechanisms here,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.200
but it does say its
atomic abundance.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.270
So you can know how-- what
percentage is normally

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.470
found in nature.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.660
And then there's a
few other quantities

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.180
that is going to be the topic
of what's going on here.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.670
Let's start with
the atomic mass.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:04.290
If you notice, the atomic
mass is slightly less than 32,

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.950
32 being the mass number, or
the total number of protons

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.690
plus neutrons in the nucleus.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:15.140
The actual mass is a
little lower by that amount

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.655
right there, the binding energy.

00:21:17.655 --> 00:21:19.280
It might be a little
funny because I've

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.060
given you a mass in AMU, and a
binding energy in kiloelectron

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.110
volts.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.410
I want to remind you that
these are the same thing.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:32.000
The conversion factor you'll
be using over and over again

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.270
throughout this course,
especially on the next p sets,

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:46.600
is one atomic mass unit
is 931.49 MeV c squared.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.172
Yeah-- I'm sorry.

00:21:51.172 --> 00:21:53.470
Yeah, never mind,
put that there.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.763
So then, again,
one, don't round--

00:21:55.763 --> 00:21:57.430
because we've had
times when folks said,

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.380
ah, this is about 931.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.922
And when you're
off by half an MeV,

00:22:01.922 --> 00:22:03.880
you could be at a totally
different decay level

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.838
or get a positive Q when
it should be negative,

00:22:05.838 --> 00:22:07.050
or vice versa.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.220
And let's take a quick
look here to say,

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:15.292
if this atomic mass
is 31.9720707 AMU--

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:16.750
this is why I
brought a calculator.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.520
Normally I do mental,
math but since I

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.770
told you guys don't
round, I can't

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.950
do eight significant
digits in my head.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.025
So I'm going to
get that in there--

00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:27.043
0707.

00:22:27.043 --> 00:22:28.710
If any of you guys
want to follow along,

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.570
I encourage you to.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:34.660
And say minus 32, which
is the mass number.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:40.260
So in this case we're taking
the actual atomic mass

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.150
minus the actual--

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.560
the mass number.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.700
In this case, it's 32.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:52.070
In this case it's, 31.9720707.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.580
And we end up with minus 0.0--

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.070
I'm going to put all
the digits here--

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.840
293 AMU.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.750
If we convert this to MeV--

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:18.270
times 931.49, we get
minus 26.0159 MeV.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:23.170
See this number anywhere
on the KAERI table?

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.435
Right there-- that's
the excess mass.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.110
And in this case, we usually
give this the symbol delta

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.220
for the excess mass.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.800
And these are how
these quantities

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.030
are directly related.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.620
The excess mass--
well, actually,

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.450
what does the excess
mass really mean?

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.450
It's the difference
between the actual mass

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.870
and a fairly poor
approximation of the mass.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.060
So the excess mass
doesn't really

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.160
have that much of a
physical connotation.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.180
But it is nice, because
if you know very well

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.790
the tabulated atomic number--

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.240
I'm sorry, the-- yeah, the mass
number and the excess mass,

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.100
you can figure out--

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.020
let's see-- yeah,
you can figure out

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.640
what the real atomic mass is.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:14.130
And I want to switch now to
the actual table of nuclides

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.420
and show you one example.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.510
If you want to very quickly
jump between isotopes,

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.302
you can type them
in right up here.

00:24:21.302 --> 00:24:23.760
And does anyone know what the
gold standard for atomic mass

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.260
is?

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.010
And I'll give you a
hint, it's not gold.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:26.510
Yep?

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.510
AUDIENCE: Carbon-12.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.860
MICHAEL SHORT: Carbon-12.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.653
What do you think the
excess mass of carbon-12

00:24:31.653 --> 00:24:33.570
is going to be without
doing any calculations?

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.500
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.600
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.990
Zero.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.230
So if we go to
carbon-12, because that

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.250
is set as the standard, the
way atomic masses were done

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.540
was carbon-12 weighs
exactly 12 AMU.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.480
The excess mass here is zero.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.320
And that's why the atomic mass
is 12.0 to as many decimals

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.060
as we care to note.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.230
So is everyone clear
on what excess mass is?

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.730
Yep?

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.360
AUDIENCE: What's the point of
c squared for that conversion?

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.970
MICHAEL SHORT: So mass
does not actually equal--

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.035
oh right, and it's
actually on the--

00:25:09.035 --> 00:25:10.700
where did my chalk go?

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.830
It's actually down below.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.180
The point is that energy is
related to mass by c squared.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.930
So they're not the
same units, but they're

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.536
directly convertible.

00:25:21.536 --> 00:25:22.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.470
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:26.410
And so this way, you have
an E over a c squared.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.610
You get an m, and there we go.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.620
I had the units upside down.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:38.570
However, carbon-12 does not
have a zero binding energy.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.370
Yeah, Luke?

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.815
AUDIENCE: How come when
you did that calculation,

00:25:41.815 --> 00:25:44.140
you didn't use the c squared?

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:49.750
So like, it seems like then
that would be 26.0159--

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.840
MICHAEL SHORT:
MeV per c squared.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.340
Yeah.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.980
AUDIENCE: But they don't
say that up there--

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.435
or it didn't say
that on the table.

00:25:57.435 --> 00:25:58.810
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, that's true.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.660
MICHAEL SHORT: So
it is funny, right?

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.090
The binding energy is give it
in keV, and that's correct.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:08.500
An energy is an energy.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.730
An excess mass, it
really should say

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.290
keV per c squared, because if
we're talking in units of mass,

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.540
it's got to be in m.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:21.710
Or in this way, you could say
m is an energy per c squared.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:26.020
So this, to me, is a semantic
inconsistency in the table.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.120
But you guys will know
that a mass is always

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.270
going to be an AMU,
or kilograms, or MeV

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.730
per c squared.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:37.150
And energies will be in
MeV, keV, some sort of eV,

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.370
usually, in this course.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.520
The binding energy,
though, that's correct.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.280
That's in keV, because
that's an actual energy.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.530
Now then the question is,
what does the binding energy

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.580
actually represent?

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.680
Does anyone remember
from Friday or Thursday?

00:26:54.762 --> 00:26:56.470
I can refresh your
memory, because that's

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.800
what I'm here to do.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.850
The binding energy
is as if-- let's say

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:05.600
we're assembling carbon-12
from its constituent nucleons.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.970
There's going to be 12 of them.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:14.565
Let's say we had six
protons and six neutrons.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.080
We can calculate the
total mass energy

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.560
of this ensemble of nucleons
when they're infinitely

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.730
far apart from each other.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.110
And forgive the little--

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.370
it's not to scale.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.820
But they are infinitely
far apart from each other.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.350
And we can say that--

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.780
let's say there is
Z number of protons.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.080
So we'll say the
binding energy is

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.910
the number of protons
times the mass of a proton

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.150
plus the number of neutrons--

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.600
A minus Z-- times
the mass of a neutron

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.950
minus the energy of the
assembled carbon-12 nucleus.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.860
So there's actually a
measurable difference

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.590
in mass between six
protons and six neutrons,

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:16.980
and the actual mass of a nucleus
with atomic number A and--

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:22.026
I'm sorry, with atomic number
Z and mass number A c squared.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.360
So is everyone clear on how
we arrived at this formula?

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.310
It's effectively
the energy released

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:34.180
when you take the individual
nucleons, assemble the nucleus.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.430
You don't have as much
mass as when you started.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.620
Or in some cases, you might
have a little more mass

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.760
than when you started if things
are particularly unstable.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.730
And you can use the excess
mass and binding energies

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:50.320
in relative amounts to see, is
a nucleus going to be stable?

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.500
For example, let's
look at iron-55 I'm

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.150
going to jump here,
make it a little bigger

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.560
so the important stuff
is easier to see.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.657
And if you notice, the
binding energy of iron-55--

00:29:03.657 --> 00:29:04.740
there's quite a bit of it.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.940
It's very well-bound.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.780
In fact, this is one of
the most well-bound nuclei

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.330
in the whole chart of nuclides.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.830
Let's look at
something that we know

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.400
to be particularly unstable.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.670
Someone have any idea?

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.580
Let's just add like
20 neutrons to iron

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.810
let's see if it even exists.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.260
No-- doesn't happen.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.930
Let's try adding 10
neutrons to iron--

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.100
or go even crazier.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.570
What about 70?

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:39.090
Too small-- all right, let's
meet somewhere in the middle--

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.780
68.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.238
Still a pretty high
binding energy,

00:29:42.238 --> 00:29:43.822
but you can look at
it as a difference

00:29:43.822 --> 00:29:45.175
in binding energy per nucleon.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.500
So in this case, the
binding energy per nucleon--

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.660
if you take the binding
energy and divide

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.580
by the total number of
nucleons, will give you

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.660
a relative measure of how
tightly bound that nucleus is.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.430
Now these are not
absolute things.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.630
You can't just say,
certain binding energy

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.630
leads to certain stability,
but they do give you

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.752
pretty good trends to follow.

00:30:06.752 --> 00:30:08.710
And we're actually going
to be coming up with--

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.570
probably on Thursday--

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.050
a semi-empirical formula to
get the rough binding energy

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.110
of any particular assembly
of protons and neutrons.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:21.580
And it follows experimental
calculations pretty well--

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.382
surprisingly so.

00:30:24.382 --> 00:30:26.090
I want to jump back
to here, because I've

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.720
mentioned cross sections,
and I want to actually define

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.120
what a cross section is,
because this is a quantity

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.850
that you're going to
be using everywhere.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.130
Let's say that we fired
a beam of particles--

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.960
it doesn't matter what it is--

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.630
at a target of other particles.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.450
Let's say, the beam
particles are atom A,

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:46.970
and the target
particles are atom B.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.210
And once these A particles
pass through the target

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.790
B, a little bit
fewer of them come

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.780
out the other side reacted,
or unscathed, or unscattered.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.050
And some of them are absorbed,
or scattered, or bounced off,

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.870
or scattered backwards,
or what have you.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.790
We can write the sort
of proportionality

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:09.140
constant between the change
in intensity of our A beam

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.230
and the thickness of our slab.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.000
And we give that
proportionality constant

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.500
this symbol, little sigma.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.490
We'll get something
going up here.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.225
Little sigma, which we call
the microscopic cross section.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.970
It's in effect, a constant
of proportionality

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.910
that relates the
probability of absorbing

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:37.640
an atom from this beam I--

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.220
or from this beam of atoms
A through a slab of B.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.800
And then if you
take this formula,

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.350
you divide by that delta X--

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.210
so I'm going to
take what's on there

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:55.530
and say delta I over delta
X equals minus cross section

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.990
ABn--

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.180
which refers here to
the number density.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.150
So I'll keep our
table of symbols

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:05.265
altogether so it's a
little easier to follow.

00:32:05.265 --> 00:32:15.490
n is our number density, which
means the number of atoms

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.740
per unit volume.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.670
Usually, in nuclear
quantities, we use centimeters

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.520
because these are things that
are actually fairly measurable,

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.410
and cross sections
are actually in units

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:31.880
of centimeters squared.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.160
And let me finish
that expression.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.050
We had the number
density of our target

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:43.300
B. We had our initial
intensity, and that's it.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:47.360
Anyone know how to solve
this differential equation?

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.856
If we take the limit
of small deltas,

00:32:51.856 --> 00:32:55.888
it should start to look like
a differential equation.

00:32:55.888 --> 00:32:57.680
The final answer is up
there on the screen.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.810
Does anyone remember the
method to actually solve

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:00.935
this differential equation?

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.990
This is the easy one--

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:07.130
separate the variables.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.970
So in this case, we can
divide each side by I of of X,

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:13.720
multiply each side by X.
I'm going to bring this up

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.630
so I'm not bending down.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:25.300
So we have dI over I equals
minus sigma ab n of B times dX.

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:33.340
Integrate both sides
and we get log of I

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:45.160
equals minus sigma ab n of BX,
and some integration constant.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.780
You can apply an initial
boundary condition to say at X

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.050
equals zero, the
intensity of the being

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.690
x was some intensity I naught.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.700
Whatever intensity of the
beam that we initially

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.020
fired at the target.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.200
And by combining
these two, you end up

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.420
with the expression
you get right there,

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:08.440
which is that the intensity
of the beam coming out

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:14.230
is the initial intensity times
e to the minus sigma ab nbx.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.370
And we've kind of
derived the idea

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.670
of exponential attenuation.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:26.480
For those who haven't
seen that word before,

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.440
attenuation or the gradual
removal of the beam of incident

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.870
particles by whatever
the target happens to be.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.870
This quantity right
here, we actually

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:45.480
have another symbol for it,
which we give big sigma.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:50.248
And in this case, big sigma
we call the macroscopic cross

00:34:50.248 --> 00:34:50.847
section.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:59.940
I'll draw a box
around these so we

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:04.020
know these are our symbols that
we're keeping defined here.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.960
And so you may see that the
microscopic cross section just

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.575
depends on single reactions
between the incoming atoms

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:14.970
A and the target atoms B.
The macroscopic cross section

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.650
depends on how much B is there.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:22.170
So if you want to get per atom
probabilities of absorption

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.660
scattering, whatever
thing you're looking at,

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.210
you use the microscopic
cross section.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.980
And if you have a finite
amount of stuff there,

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.640
and you know the number
density of your substance B,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.790
you can use the
macroscopic cross section

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.910
to get actual total
probabilities of beam

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.260
attenuation--

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.320
or to calculate
exponential attenuation.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.750
We're going to see this
again in another form when

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.970
we talk about
designing shielding,

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.470
and how much
shielding do you need

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.930
to remove how much of the beam?

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.060
Well, this quantity
right here, there's

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.360
actually tabulated values for
a lot of this stuff at the--

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.680
on the NIST website.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.500
And I have links to that as
well on the Stellar website,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.650
so you can-- instead of having
to look these all up on JANIS

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.150
and multiply number
densities, there

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.430
are some easier graphical
functions you can just

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.110
find the value for.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.880
But we'll get back to
that in a few days.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.770
So anyway, on reading
the KAERI table,

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.770
there's a few
quantities right there.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.380
We've already defined
what the excess mass

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.330
and the binding energy is.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:25.890
And I want to note
right here, if you

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.710
want to actually calculate
binding energies by hand, which

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.765
I'm going to ask you to
do a bit on problem set 2,

00:36:31.765 --> 00:36:33.765
you'll need to know what
the mass of the proton,

00:36:33.765 --> 00:36:35.910
and the neutron,
and the electron

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.760
are to, again, usually
like six or seven digits

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.970
is the idea behind this course.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:45.240
Notice that they're not
exactly one atomic mass unit,

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.860
because one atomic
mass unit, again,

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.523
was set with that
carbon-12 standard.

00:36:48.523 --> 00:36:50.940
I'm not going to use the word
gold standard because that's

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.570
a misnomer in this field.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.940
And so like I said, what
does excess mass really mean,

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.530
physically?

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.990
Not much, because
it's the comparison

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.900
to an arbitrary standard or
a rather poor approximation

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.890
of the mass.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.250
The binding energy actually
does represent the conversion

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.290
of mass to energy
when you assemble

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:15.980
a nucleus like Voltron-style
from its constituent nucleons.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.070
So let's try a few examples
in class right here.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.210
I'd like you guys to follow
around and try and calculate

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:26.700
the binding energy of each of
these three nuclei of sulfur.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:31.400
Let me get a better blank
board so we can follow along.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.660
And there's a few different
ways of calculating

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.980
that binding energy.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.410
You can do it by
the excess mass.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:38.850
You can do it by--

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:40.630
let's go back to the
table of nuclides

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.240
so I can show you
how I would do it.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.870
Let's start with sulfur 32.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.426
And we'll write up the
quantities that we're--

00:37:48.426 --> 00:37:50.000
that we know.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.860
Let's say the excess
mass is the actual mass

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.800
minus the mass number.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:04.950
The binding energy is Z times
mass of hydrogen plus A minus Z

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:09.870
mass of a neutron minus the
actual mass of that nucleus

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:14.100
with AZ c squared.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.290
And then what we can do is
rearrange this excess mass,

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:23.120
isolating the mass term right
here, and make a substitution.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.740
So we can say the
mass is actually

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:32.820
the excess mass plus A.
Stick that in right there,

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.730
and now we can calculate and
confirm the binding energies

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:40.170
that we see right here from
tabulated excess mass values,

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:45.120
atomic number, mass number,
and the masses of a hydrogen

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:51.330
atom and a neutron,
which, for reference,

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.100
I'll write up here as well.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.330
So the mass of a
hydrogen is the mass

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.120
of a proton plus an electron.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:10.110
So 1.0072-- 007276 plus 0.000--

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.480
make that a little
easier to read--

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:20.360
how many zeros-- 00054858 AMU.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:27.180
Mass of a neutron, surprisingly
close to Chadwick's prediction.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:33.120
8664 AMU.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.420
So now I'll head back to
the table of nuclides.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.110
And let's see if you
guys can follow along.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.750
What we want to do is try
to confirm this binding

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.020
energy using the atomic
mass, the excess mass,

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.630
or if we don't even
know the atomic mass,

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:53.070
we can use the excess
mass plus A right there.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:58.650
So let's see-- Z, in this
case, for sulfur, is 16 times

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.740
the mass of hydrogen. This
is definitely a calculator

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.325
moment, because like I said,
I don't know about you guys,

00:40:04.325 --> 00:40:06.450
but I can't do eight
significant digits in my head.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:21.930
0054858-- 1.007855--
probably enough digits--

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.510
plus 16, because there's--

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:26.750
mass number here is 32.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.050
The atomic number is 16.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:32.370
That leaves us with 16 neutrons
times the mass of a neutron,

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:36.120
08664--

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:47.670
minus the excess mass, which
in this case is 26.015 MeV--

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:52.770
015 MeV per c squared.

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.560
So thanks for that-- thank
Jared for that question because,

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.517
indeed, the excess
mass, if you want

00:40:57.517 --> 00:40:59.100
to write it in terms
of a mass, should

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:04.150
be in MeV or keV per
c squared minus A,

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:09.090
which is 32 times c squared.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.490
So let's do all this out--

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.630
shouldn't take too long.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.730
007825 plus 16--

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:38.610
1.008664 minus 32 minus
26.015 divided by c squared.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:39.740
It's basically nothing.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.310
Gives us on the order of--

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:48.845
let's see-- times c squared.

00:42:10.975 --> 00:42:12.100
What did we get right here?

00:42:18.792 --> 00:42:21.182
AUDIENCE: Is the 26 negative?

00:42:21.182 --> 00:42:23.600
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah, let's see.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.400
I believe it is, because we
have to subtract the mass,

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.758
and we're substituting
in this delta--

00:42:28.758 --> 00:42:30.710
AUDIENCE: Isn't
the delta negative?

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.250
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.150
Good point.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.280
There is a negative there.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.780
So that's minus negative that.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.740
And A is 32.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.222
Thank you.

00:42:42.222 --> 00:42:42.930
Yeah, good point.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:43.847
Let me try this again.

00:43:12.865 --> 00:43:16.500
Ah, I know what I'm doing wrong.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.340
This part right here, we
want to convert to AMU.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.400
So we can take our minus--

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:32.670
thank you-- 26.015 MeV
per c squared and divide

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:38.544
by our conversion
factor, 931.49--

00:43:38.544 --> 00:43:42.350
let's see-- MeV per
c squared per AMU.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:46.590
What does that give us?

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:51.850
26.015 over that.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:44:00.630
0.027928 AMU negative.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.460
Let's put that in
and see how we do.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:24.330
So plus 0.027928 minus 32.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:28.440
And then we get 271.--

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.530
I'll just say 764 MeV.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.630
I think six digits is enough.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:38.770
The actual binding
energy, 271.780 MeV,

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:41.650
so we're off by 16
electron volts--

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.060
close enough.

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.710
Also note that I used a
five-digit accurate conversion

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:46.210
factor.

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:47.460
That might be part
of the source of it.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.870
Does someone have a question?

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:49.515
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:49.515 --> 00:44:52.300
In the equation on top,
you did the atomic number

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.758
times the mass of the proton,
but in the one on the bottom,

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:56.216
you used atomic
mass times the mass

00:44:56.216 --> 00:44:58.590
of the hydrogen
including the electron.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:44:59.522
Is there--

00:44:59.522 --> 00:45:00.480
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh yeah.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.800
I actually added the two.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.100
So the mass of an electron,
since it's got that extra zero,

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.960
makes so much of a--

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.040
so the mass of--

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:08.683
oh-- yeah.

00:45:08.683 --> 00:45:10.350
The mass of hydrogen
would be the proton

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.983
plus the electron right there.

00:45:11.983 --> 00:45:12.650
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:16.423
But why do hydrogen, though,
if [INAUDIBLE] just the proton?

00:45:16.423 --> 00:45:18.840
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, because
there's an electron there, too.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.850
Now this can
usually be neglected

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:22.890
because it's such a
small fraction compared

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:23.880
to everything else.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.338
So now we're talking
about-- what--

00:45:25.338 --> 00:45:29.410
the fifth or sixth
decimal place.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:32.070
But just for exactness,
I stuck on it.

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.470
Yeah, in your calculations,
you can try with and without,

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.845
and I think you'll find that
it doesn't matter that much,

00:45:36.845 --> 00:45:39.780
because in the end we get the
binding energy that we see

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:44.460
on the table to within 16
electron volts for a total

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.180
of-- yeah--

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.380
271 MeV.

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.790
That's pretty accurate.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:48.480
Yeah.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.980
AUDIENCE: If you
wanted to calculate

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.840
the like energy released
from a reaction,

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.070
would you do the binding energy
for [INAUDIBLE] reactants

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:56.868
that's trapped products
for the reactants?

00:45:56.868 --> 00:45:58.410
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
the next slide.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:45:59.600
We'll get right there.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.960
Yeah, so you're catching
on to where we're going.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.860
So once you can calculate
either the excess mass,

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.753
or the binding energy, or the
total mass of any nucleus,

00:46:08.753 --> 00:46:10.170
you can start to
put them together

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.340
into nuclear reactions.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.500
So since you asked, let's
take a quick look at them.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.772
Where is our nuclear
reaction board?

00:46:16.772 --> 00:46:18.480
Anyone mind if I hide
this board for now,

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.264
so we can go back
to our original?

00:46:20.264 --> 00:46:20.764
OK.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:27.520
Let's take a look at
this reaction right

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:33.110
here, the actual boron neutron
capture therapy reaction.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:37.360
And now we can get towards
calculating this Q, what

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.910
the difference is between the--

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:42.460
the total energies of the
products and the reactants,

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.150
and where does that go?

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.540
So now we can either
look up or calculate

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:49.840
the binding energy of
each of these nuclei,

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.720
subtract off the energy of the
gamma, which I've looked up

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:59.380
already, is about 0.478 MeV.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.770
And we can figure out what the
total Q of this reaction is.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:03.753
So in this case--

00:47:03.753 --> 00:47:05.170
I'll skip ahead
to the slide where

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:08.980
I've got it because that way
I won't write anything wrong

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.420
on the board--

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.220
got everything right up here.

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.680
We assume that both
boron and the neutron

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.720
have roughly zero
kinetic energy.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.700
And at the end,
they come out with

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.180
some other kinetic energies
as well as this gamma ray.

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.960
The sum of this energy
differences, we refer to as Q.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.930
And we can actually
confirm this total Q

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:31.195
with a few different methods.

00:47:31.195 --> 00:47:33.070
In this case, it's always
conserve something.

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:34.750
That's the whole
theme of this course,

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.880
is you can conserve
total masses,

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.650
you can conserve total
kinetic energies.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:43.120
We may not know those, but
tabulated in the KAERI table

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.770
are the binding energies
of each of these nuclei.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.320
So let's try that out right now.

00:47:50.515 --> 00:47:52.390
So let's look at the
binding energies of each

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.090
of these nuclei and see
what the difference is,

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:56.890
the total energy released.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:00.760
First of all, what's the binding
energy of a lone neutron?

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.160
Anyone have any idea?

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.220
I see a lot of these--

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:03.720
zero.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.498
Yep.

00:48:04.498 --> 00:48:06.790
You haven't assembled an
nucleus out of a lone neutron,

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:14.500
so we'll go with the neutron has
a binding energy of zero MeV.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.480
Boron, not quite
the case, but we

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.160
can go back to the table of
nuclides and punch that in--

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.360
boron-10.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.800
We can look up its
binding energy,

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.250
which is about 64.7507--

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:40.200
I keep saying about, which
is exactly 64.7507 MeV.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.410
And then our other
two nuclei, helium-4--

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:48.300
so you can punch
in helium-4 here.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:49:03.040
It's got a binding energy
of exactly 28.295673 MeV.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:10.055
And finally, lithium-7,
let's punch that in.

00:49:10.055 --> 00:49:11.430
I think you guys
are going to get

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:12.810
very familiar with this table.

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:14.580
There's a few
versions out there.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.380
There's a new slick
Java version that I

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.620
found a little hard to use.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.520
So I like the text-only version,
because it's just as simple

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.410
and fast as it gets--

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:34.180
39.244526-- 526.

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:38.770
So any sort of increase in
total amount of binding energy

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:42.310
between the reactants
and the products

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:45.190
is going to release
or absorb energy.

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:49.900
Now because boron does capture
a thermal neutron, or a neutron

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.170
with approximately zero
eV of kinetic energy,

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:55.210
does anyone have any
idea whether this would

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.450
release or consume energy?

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:01.450
In other words, do think this
is an exothermic or endothermic

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:04.120
reaction?

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:04.817
Yeah, Alex?

00:50:04.817 --> 00:50:06.400
AUDIENCE: I'm guessing
that heat would

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.590
be released through the
material-- the capture

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.350
material would be heated up.

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:11.140
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.610
Indeed.

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.800
If the total Q value
is greater than zero,

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.390
we refer to this as exothermic--

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:20.960
kind of like in chemistry.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.550
And if Q is less than zero, we
refer to this as endothermic.

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:30.298
So let's do our binding
energy subtraction now.

00:50:30.298 --> 00:50:32.590
We want to figure out how
much excess binding energy is

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:33.110
released.

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.100
So I'm going to
take the reactants--

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.850
I'm sorry-- I'm going
to take the product.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:47.110
So helium 295673--
add lithium 244526--

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:53.560
subtract boron 0.7507-- subtract
the neutron, which is zero,

00:50:53.560 --> 00:51:01.820
and we're left with 2.79 MeV.

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:05.265
And because it's positive,
this is an exothermic reaction,

00:51:05.265 --> 00:51:07.640
which is what we'd expect,
because this reaction actually

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.050
happens.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:10.970
If this was an
endothermic reaction,

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:12.660
what could you do
to make it occur?

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:18.280
Yeah?

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.248
AUDIENCE: Heat up the reactants.

00:51:21.248 --> 00:51:22.790
MICHAEL SHORT: Like
with temperature,

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.384
or what do you mean?

00:51:24.384 --> 00:51:26.753
AUDIENCE: Make them have
higher kinetic energy or--

00:51:26.753 --> 00:51:27.920
MICHAEL SHORT: There you go.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.378
So actually-- yeah-- you kind
of said the same thing twice.

00:51:30.378 --> 00:51:32.690
Heating things up does give
them higher kinetic energy.

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:34.107
If you rely on
temperature, you'll

00:51:34.107 --> 00:51:37.425
be imparting eV worth
of kinetic energy.

00:51:37.425 --> 00:51:39.050
But if you accelerate
them, or get them

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:40.467
from a different
nuclear reaction,

00:51:40.467 --> 00:51:42.810
and you get them up
to the MeV level,

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:45.590
where whatever this Q value
could be might be negative,

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.760
then you can get the
reaction to occur.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:53.390
For example, what is
the Q of that reaction?

00:51:56.708 --> 00:51:59.080
AUDIENCE: Negative 2.79.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.560
MICHAEL SHORT: Negative that.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.190
So in this case,
if you want lithium

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:07.060
to absorb an alpha particle,
and make boron and a neutron,

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.190
you would have to
accelerate the alphas

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:12.850
to that same amount of energy
in order to get this to occur.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:16.600
So nuclear reactions do go
both ways, just not as easily.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.100
Kind of like chemical
reactions, you

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.290
can drive them in
different directions

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:22.690
by changing the temperature
or changing the concentration

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:23.800
of the reactants.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.730
Here the concentration
doesn't matter.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.440
But the kinetic energy related
directly to the temperature

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.710
definitely is.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:34.740
And so in this
case, it's 2.79 MeV.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:39.540
If I tell you the gamma ray
takes off 0.478 MeV of that,

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:45.150
we're left with 2.31
MeV between the lithium

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.120
nucleus and the helium nucleus.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.460
Now my next question-- my
last question for you today--

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.100
oh man--

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.542
is what's the split?

00:52:53.542 --> 00:52:55.750
I think I don't want to keep
you longer, because it's

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:56.973
one minute of 10:00.

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:58.390
So this is the
question that we're

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:00.110
going to pick up
with on Thursday,

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:03.190
which is how much of the
energy is taken off by helium?

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:06.530
And how much is
taken off by lithium?

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.640
Sorry, I should have kept
better track of the time.

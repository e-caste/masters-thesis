00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Just wanted to begin today by
pointing out a couple of articles

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
from today's Boston Globe.
There's an article that's on the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
financial pages about investors
reconsidering gene therapy,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and startups funded as technology
evolves.  A lot of you have heard

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the words gene therapy.
A lot of you, at the end of that

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
bacterial genetics lecture,
said you weren't quite sure what

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
complementation was.
But, gene therapy is basically

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
complementation but to work.
The idea is if you got a broken

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
gene, and you can put in a good copy,
then you'll take the cell back to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
being normal, which is exactly what
we're doing in those phage crosses

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
where we had two phage,
one with the mutant copy of the gene,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and one with the wild type copy of
the gene.  And they're saying here

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that there's a renewed interest.
Now, the basic strategy in these

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
things is to take usually a
retrovirus, the same kind of idea

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that we heard about with the HIV-1
virus that will make a DNA copy,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and then the copy gets inserted
somewhere in the chromosome.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So, the good thing is it puts and a
new copy in a chromosome.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The bad thing is you got a piece of
DNA being stuck somewhere in the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
chromosome.  And there are places
where it can go where it doesn't

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
matter, and there are other places
where it really does matter.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So, it's been a very tricky business
with gene therapy.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Part of the thrust here is they're
thinking that maybe they need to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
pick targets were the person's going
to die anyway so that if there is a

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
risk of getting cancer or something,
it's outweighed by the possible

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
thing.  That's sort of the thrust.
You can see the article; it's in

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
today's paper.
It's very timely for what we are

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
talking about now.
And then on Friday I'm going to

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
start talking about recombinant DNA
strategies and stuff.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But there's another article in
today's paper.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This is one of those things that I
told you about where an article is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
published in the,
in this case, online in the journal

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
nature.  They have an embargo on a
press thing until Thursday or so,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and then the article is on, the hot
papers that have just come out show

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
up in the newspapers,
usually either on Friday or Monday.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And this is yet another system that
they describe as making a molecular

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
repair kit that corrects mutations
in the cells' DNA.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So far, this has only been done in
cells.  But it's working well enough,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and the article is saying this
approach could become a serious

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
competitor to conventional gene
therapy.  In here,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you have sort of a layman's account
of this kind of complementation by

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
gene therapy.  We're talking about
gene therapy in that field which

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
attempts to force feed healthy genes
into cells hobbled by defective ones

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
has been plagued by failure,
and recently was found to cause

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
leukemia in some patients.
That's probably because of the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
insertion events associated with
these viruses.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This new system rewrites the small
stretch of misspelled genetic code.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That's typically the reason the
gene has gone bad.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So it's a different kind of
strategy.  This is the first report

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I've heard of that.
Some of the stuff we're talking

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
about is sort of inescapable because
you're going to see

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it in the paper.
Here, they're telling you the sort

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
of thing I was just saying.
The viruses inject their payloads

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
at random within the cells tangled
mass of DNA sometimes disrupting

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
normal genes.  Even when genes land
in good locations,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the molecular machinery that
regulates their activity is also

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
often thrown off,
leaving the healthy genes operating

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
at a level to low to be helpful or
functioning in the wrong parts of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the body.  It must begin to sound
familiar.  You stick a random piece

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
of DNA somewhere,
you can disrupt the regulation in

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the gene as well as just landing in
the open reading frame.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So there's a problem with gene
therapy.  Now,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
they'd like to make you think that
this is going to be the promised to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
everything, but as always it's more
complicated.  And so,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I just picked up the last paragraph
of this article.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Other scientists said the approach
looked promising,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
but predicted it would end up
struggling with this problem of its

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
own, James M. Wilson,
a gene therapy researcher at the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
University of Pennsylvania.
Now, there's somebody who's in a

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
position to criticize,
but also has a vested interest

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
himself and the alternative therapy,
noted that the first step of the new

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
process causes for [zinc
fingers?].

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It's a kind of protein that's
involved in this,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to make a fresh break in DNA to
accommodate the insertion of the

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
corrected sequence.
It's the same kind of break it with

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
radiation that can lead to cancer.
And we're going to talk today about,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
you'll see where double-stranded
breaks and whatnot can be a real

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
problem in terms of the integrity of
the DNA and genome stability,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
which is maintaining gene stability
so important in avoiding cancer.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
You guys are a tough crowd.
Comments ranged from, this was the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
best lecture that I'd given to ones
that were absolutely the other end

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
of the spectrum.
You're a very hard group.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I truly am going to take, I don't
have time really to sit back and

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
redo all my lectures,
but I've a huge amount of input,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and I'm going to go back over all
this input and getting,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and take it very seriously in terms
of how I go about things next year.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I can see a number of changes and
going to make.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Whoever sent me the e-mail that
talked about the Dock Street

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Bohemian Pilsner brewed in Utica,
NY, this classic golden Pilsner,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
pungent, perfumy taste and so on,
it was a moment of lightness, but if

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I got to many things like that it's
not going to hell in a contract to

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
figure out how to do.
For the person who asked about how

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
to avoid accidental pollination,
when they're going to do that, they

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
actually take the stamens off the
flowers so you don't get accidental

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
self fertilization.
You actually go out and make ones

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that are just male or just female
flowers.  You can do that rather

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
easily.  OK, so what we got into
last time, or what I told you last

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
time, and I promise you that there's
another Mendel lecture coming.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
For those of you who thought this
was a little slow,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
you may find the next one is all too
fast.  But anyway,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that will be how it goes.
Mendel had carried out this

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
fundamental series of experiments.
And I did linger over it because I

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
think it's so simple you can
actually see the scientific process

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
in action, and it also isn't
complicated by any techniques that

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
we can't see.  And it was a
tremendously important insight that

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
genetic information came in units.
But as I told you,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
it wasn't accepted because for most
of the world at the time,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
it was a statistical argument.
There weren't any entities that

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
were two of inside a cell,
and all that sort of thing.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So, it didn't take over scientific
thinking.  It wasn't until about

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
1900 when several other geneticists
did finally find the systems that

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
duplicated Mendel's results,
and therefore showed that these were

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
general inferences,
something that Mendel himself,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
as I told you, by choosing weeds and
bees as follow-up systems

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
hadn't been able to do.
These other geneticists showed them

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
in other systems.
But the other thing that made the

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
difference at the time,
was by this point cytologists,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
who were looking at cells under
microscopes, had found entities

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
whose behavior seemed to match those
of these particles of information

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that Mendel had postulated to
explain these patterns of

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
inheritance that he was seeing.
These particles,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
because they were called chromosomes,
which literally means colored things,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the reason they were colored was not
because they were inherently colored,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
but because cytologists were
staining the cells with a variety of

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
things.  And that was what allowed
them to visualize these.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And so, by staring into microscopes,
right around this time, around the

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.000
turn of the century,
1900s or so, cytologists had come up

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.000
with three key observations.
One was that chromosomes came in

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000
matched pairs.
So, let's say in this cell,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000
there were too long and too short.
So that's a chromosome.  And a

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000
correspondence,
we now know, to double-stranded DNA

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000
molecule that's been
all condensed up.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And there are two copies of each
chromosome in this thing.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So: too long, too short, one came
from mom, one came from dad.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And for bookkeeping purposes,
I'm going to color them so that from

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
one parent is unshaded,
and the other one is shaded.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Most of you know in human cells we
have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
This is a now fancier method of
visualizing chromosomes called

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
[peating?] chromosomes where you
take little stretches of DNA that

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
are unique to particular sequences,
attached dyes, and then use them to

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
[stain?] the cells,
and so they will color only

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
particular chromosomes.
And we have 22 pairs of identical

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
chromosomes, and then the sex
chromosomes here,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
X and Y, this would be a male,
or two Y's if we were female.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
We'll return to those in the next
lecture.  Kim Naismith,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
who spent his life working on how
these chromosomes segregate gave a

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
talk a year ago.
He's in London at a hospital in

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
London.   And then he brought in the
next slide.  There was an artist who

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
spent several months visiting with
him, trying to find ways to

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
represent in art some of what she
saw going on.  And I thought you

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
might enjoy seeing this,
the slide.  This is the human

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
complement of chromosomes,
represented in stripy socks that

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
various staff members from the
hospital brought in for

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
her to do this.
So, a little touch of scientist

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
humor which some of you may think is
pretty nerdy, but anyway there it

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
was for what it's worth.
He showed that in our departmental

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
[colloquium?].
OK, the second thing,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
then, that the cytologists noted by
staring at this was during ordinary

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
cell division,
which gives two identical daughters

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
the numbers of chromosomes
per cell is preserved.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And this ordinary cell division is

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000
given a special name of mitosis.
So if we take this cell, the first

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000
thing that happens,
then, is the chromosomes are

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:37.000
duplicated.
We've talked a lot about DNA

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:47.000
synthesis at the molecular level.
This is looking at it.  Excuse me,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and so, there are now two DNA
molecules, that each one of these

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:07.000
new DNA molecules is given
a special name.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
This is called a chromatid.
So there was one DNA molecule here.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
It's now duplicated, but you'll
notice these are still joined

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
together.  The point at which they
are joined together is known as the

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
centrosome.  And then,
after this, after the DNA's been

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
copied, these things are lined up at
the center of the cell and then they

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
are pulled apart to give two
daughter cells that are just like

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
what you started with.
This part, so this is 2N,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
if N is the number of kinds of
chromosomes.  And then there's two

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
each.  This is 2N.
At this point, the DNA contents of

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
the cell is 4N.
This is 2N.  This is 2N.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
We're back to where we started.
This part was invisible to the

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
cytologists, at least in the sense
the chromosomes at this point are

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
extended.  And so,
they weren't able to visualize them

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
by looking through the microscope.
But as it came time for cell

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
division, then the chromosomes
condensed up very tightly.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
This is probably to avoid tangles.
And you need to pull them apart

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
into the two daughter cells.
And then the part that could see

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
them, this was known as mitosis,
this process by which the

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
chromosomes are pulled apart.
So, mitosis is a mechanism for

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
nuclear division that results in two
daughters with identical

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:14.000
genetic information.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:24.000
When you contrast this to meiosis,
which I'll show you in just a minute,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:34.000
this has been studied for years in a
kind of observation way.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I showed you at some point.
This is an animal cell where the

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
chromosomes line up,
and then they pull apart.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I think I showed you, and you can
see the cells divide once they've

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
done that.  I'm going to show you
this next thing,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
which everything happens more slow
motion.  This is a picture of the

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
blood lily, so it's a plant.
Again, the choice of model system

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
is often, if it has a feature that
is good for a particular thing.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
This happens, very easy to visualize
in these lily cells.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Now here, the cells have duplicated
their chromosomes,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and the daughter chromosomes are
held together.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
They're glued together,
so you can tell in this thing that

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
they've been glued.
Now, in order to separate the first

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
thing they have to do is line up at
the equator of the cell.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And then it pulls apart and you can
see that each daughter cell gets one

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
of the duplicated chromosomes.
OK, so that's mitosis.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
It generates two copies of what you
started with.  The other observation

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000
that the cytologists made was that
cell divisions that produce sex

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000
cells work by a different system.
So, the third thing,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And, I'm going to give you the

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
scientific word now for sex cells.
So, they're usually called gametes.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
General term, so that would be
sperm and egg,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
or pollen would be a kind of gamete.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000
In this process,
the number of chromosomes is halved.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And this special type of cell
division is known as meiosis.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:57.000
It's very important, because if we
didn't have meiosis we wouldn't

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000
have any progeny.
We need to be able to cut the number

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
of chromosomes we have per cell in
half, so as Mendel inferred,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
then when each parent made a
contribution you'd be back up to the

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
right number of cells.
Now, so this process begins again

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
by duplication of the DNA.
So this would be 2N.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Now we go to, as before,
with one interesting difference here.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:53.000
So we are at 4N in the cell.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
But you notice that drawing these
duplicated chromosomes with

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.000
chromatids overlapping.
This point of, I didn't do this too

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
well.  The point of connection: what
are the two chromosomes overlap is

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000
known as the chiasma.
It's a point of actual physical

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:30.000
interaction between
the chromosomes.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And what it allows the cell to do is
to have the two homologous

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
chromosomes, in this case the two
long ones, find each other,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
and actually physically interact.
That's a critical event for the

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
next step that I'm going to show you.
It's also a point,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
which you'll see in the next lecture.
There is additional genetic

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
diversity introduced
into the system.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
So, at this point,
what's happened is that the DNA has

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
doubled, at this point,
looks sort of like mitosis except

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
for the fact that the duplicated
chromatids have overlapped.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
There's a least one of these for
every pair of duplicated chromosomes.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
So what happens in the next phase,
which is known as meiosis I is that

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
the pairs of duplicated chromosomes
are separated.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
So, we get two cells.
We might get, say, the unshaded of

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
this one and the shaded of the
little guys.  And the other one then

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
is shaded with a long one,
and shaded with this one.  This is

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
2N, and this is 2N.
But if you'll take a look at what's

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
happening over here,
you will see that we don't have the

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
same thing going on.
In that case, we were producing

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
identical copies of the starting
cell.  In this case,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
we've got something different now
because we've separated both copies

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
of, let's say,
the chromosome from dad from both

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
copies of the chromosome that
originated with mom,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
and the other way over here.
These, then, undergo a second round

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
that's known as meiosis 2,
which resembles now mitosis in the

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000
sense that the duplicated chromatids
are now pulled apart into daughter

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
cells so that this one will generate
what long, unshaded one,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
one short, and there will be two of
those.  In the cell,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:06.000
it will generate a shaded long and
unshaded like that.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
So now, there are four of these.
And you'll notice that there is now

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
an N.  So, we have the number of
chromosomes during meiosis via a

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
process by two rounds of division.
The other thing you can think of is

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
you can begin to see,
at least, when the evolution of sex

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000
was such a powerful force in driving
evolution by introducing so much

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
variation, because each of us has a
copy of each of our 22 chromosomes

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
where we have homologous pairs,
one from mom, one from dad.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
That every time we make a sex cell,
a sperm or an egg, what happens is

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
for chromosome 1,
you can either get a copy from mom

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
or the copy from dad.
And then the next one: copy from

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
mom, copy from dad, and so on.
You can see the variation is

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
possible just from that part of the
process alone.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
And there's going to be more
variation that come about from

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
events that happen where this
chiasma is as I'll show you.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
So, meiosis then, as I said,
is a mechanism for nuclear division

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
that produces four daughter cells
with half the genetic info

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
of the original.
So, how did I write that?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And in this case,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:31.000
the daughters are not identical.
Does somebody have a question?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Yeah?
Oh, this part of the process,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
the cytologists broke this down when
they were observing.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
So, it was a part they couldn't see.
When they started to be able to see

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
it, they first saw this one division,
and then the second division.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
They called the first round or
division of meiosis 1, and

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:06.000
the second meiosis 2.
So it was just a name given to the

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:16.000
process.  Yeah?
Oh, sorry, excuse me,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:26.000
I see the problem.  OK,
it goes this way.  This period of

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:36.000
time is called meiosis 1.
That part of the process is called

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
meiosis 1, meiosis 2, sorry.
Yeah, I mean what I wrote down as

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
arbitrary.  You could've had to for
mom, and two from dad.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And in fact, I guess if we have 22
pairs we could eventually have a

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
sperm or egg that had all of the
copies from mom, and all

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
of the copies from dad.
You could calculate the statistical

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
chances of that happening,
but what you'll discover as we'll

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
find next time,
is that even if you did that the

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
chromosomes would no longer be
identical to what you got from mom

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
or dad, because there's a little bit
of genetic recombination going on

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
during that process.
I'll also show in a minute that you

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
can get errors in this process,
and that these are important.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
So, what happens then is that
fertilization,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
what the cytologists can see
happened was that the number of

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
chromosomes have been halved.
So, you had N plus N giving you 2N

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
where this might be,
for example, the egg,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
and this might be the sperm,
since gametes have half the number

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
of genetic content when they fuse,
then you go back to the original

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
number.
And this gave rise to what was known

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000
as the chromosomal theory of
inheritance.  Even though

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000
cytologists didn't know what these
colored things were,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000
they seemed to have the properties
that you would expect the carriers

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
of the genetic information to have.
Be duplicated before a cell was

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
going to divide and then they seemed
to be very precisely segregated so

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
that each daughter cell got one copy.
And it made sense,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
then, in terms of the formation of
sex cells you'd have,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
and then it would all come back up.
So, the cytologists proposed this

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
chromosomal theory of inheritance.
Chromosomes were the carriers that

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
carried the genetic information.
And you can see now that Mendel's

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
work was rediscovered,
which is more or less what happens

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
around 1900, how beautifully it
mapped on top of this because the

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
genetic information came in
particles.  You'd think,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
oh, well those particles are sitting
on those chromosomes.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
They get duplicated.  They get
separated.  They get divided in half.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Their number gets divided in half
when you make sex cells.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
So, I want to at least point out,
let me go onto this next thing here.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Here was one other picture I'd
shown you.  This was a cancer cell

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
dividing again.
We see the same process at work.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
And that just reminds you, when I
was talking about that kind of

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
process, trying to remind you that
one cell gives rise to two cells,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
and one DNA molecule gives rise to
two DNA molecules.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
But these phenomena are related
[even no one tends?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
to talk about in different parts of
the courses, and if you've got more

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
than one DNA molecule per cell,
then each one's a chromosome.  And

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
then you have to take care of
segregating those as well.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
But a point that I'd made is that
up until this part at the right

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
could be a yeast or an E.
coli, but if it's going to be

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
someone, something more complicated
that's got different kinds of cells

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
like us, then we have these
ultimately, an adult human

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
with 1014 cell.
So, this process has happened over,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
and over, and over again.  And it
has to be really very accurate.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.000
And, there was remarkable advances
have been made in understanding this

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000
process over the last few years.
And a lot of this was due to the

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:06.000
work of Lee Hartwell,
who carried out experiments,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
I guess, that offered some key
insights into the basis of the whole

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
cell cycle, of which this is just
part.  So they said,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
here we can't really see all of this
stuff in the microscope.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
What cytologists were able to
observe was that after the

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
chromosomes had duplicated,
then they condensed up.  They became

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
visible, and they could see that
part of the system.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
So, a great body of knowledge has
been learned over the past few years.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Lee Hartwell,
who was a postdoc at MIT with Boris

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Magasanik a number of years ago,
was one of the key people who led to

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
this round of insights.
And what we now know, the cell

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
cycle can be basically divided
into four parts.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
So a newly born cell,
if you will, undergoes what's known

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
as phase of the cell cycle that's
known as the G1 phase.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
And you could think of this as,
amongst other things, sort of

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
preparation for duplicating the
cell's DNA.  And then,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
there's a phase known as the S-phase,
which is what DNA synthesis

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
takes place.
That now gives the cell and

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
information content of 4N.
There was then another phase known

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
as G2, which you could think of as
preparation for pulling the

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000
chromosomes apart,
and for the cell dividing.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
And that's known as mitosis.
And so, this is quite remarkable.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
It's quite fundamental.  It's a
very elegant and very complex system

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
of controls.  And what Lee learned
is that there is an elaborate system

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
of what we now know as checkpoints
in the cell cycle.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
And the idea is pretty much the
same sort of thing that you might do

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000
if you were an engineer and you were
setting up a quality control process

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
that involved a series of stages.
And what a checkpoint does is it

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
basically commands successful
completion of a prior phase before

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
the system is permitted to move to
the next stage.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
And you can sort of see the problem
here, that if you are trying to,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
say you're copying your chromosome,
your DNA, and you only got part way

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
through.   And then he proceeded to
the part where you pulled the

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
chromosomes apart.
There would be all kinds of chaos

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
inside of the cells because you
would be breaking chromosomes.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000
You wouldn't be getting identical
information.  And there are three

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.000
major checkpoints.
There is a checkpoint at the G1 S

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:25.000
boundary.  There is actually more
than one.  But there's an intra-S

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000
phase checkpoint,
and then there's another one at the

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
G2 M boundary as well.
And the way that Lee found this out,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
I wanted to just take you back
because remember when I was talking,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
well, first we talked about how
would you get an mutant affecting an

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
essential cell,
a gene whose function is essential

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
for the cell.  [He said?
you'd have to be conditional in

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
some kind of  way,
because the organism would be dead,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
and couldn't use genetics to study
it.  So, when I introduced you to

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
those phage, and we wanted to study
critical functions needed for phage

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
growth, we needed a conditional
mutant.  Remember,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
we did look for temperature
sensitive mutants.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
So that's what Lee Hartwell started
to do with yeast in 1970

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
approximately.
He just looked for mutations that

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
were temperature sensitive
lethals in yeast.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Now, yeast can be diploid,
but they also can be haploid,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
which is just one copy of genetic
information.  So just like the

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
bacteria [haploid yeast?
, if you get a mutation affecting a

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
gene, then you see its phenotype
right away because there isn't a

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
complication of the second
chromosome.  And Lee got the Nobel

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Prize for his work,
just, I forget, three years ago or a

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
short time ago anyway.
And so, this was the process he was

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
studying.
I showed you this movie.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
In this case, this is budding yeast,
and you can see why it's called

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
budding yeast is that rather than
the still growing and segregating

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
down the middle,
the daughter cells grow as little

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
buds coming off the side.
The DNA is still going to be

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
duplicated as we got,
and then segregated into the

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
daughter.  So that part of the
process is there,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
but there's yeast growing sped up a
bit so you can see it.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
So, what we found was that when he
looked at his TS mutants,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
he found that they tended to arrest
at characteristic stages,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
and he was able, then, to figure out
that there must be some sort of

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
checkpoint system that is something
went wrong during one of the faces,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
then the cells with all pile up at a
particular characteristic stage in

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
the cell cycle.
And this was controlled by these

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
checkpoints.
These checkpoints are of enormous

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
importance because if something goes
wrong with them,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
as happens often in cancer cells,
then you get a huge increase in

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
instability of the genome very
similar to the way,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
using, for example, mismatch repair
causes instability of the genome and

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
therefore things that can cause a
cell to forget to divide when it

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
stopped dividing when it hits its
neighbors, which part of the cell it

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
belongs to and so on.
Those kinds of changes will come

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
with much greater frequency.
Another thing that was completely

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
remarkable was because it was yeast
it was relatively easy to find genes

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
that were broken.
Going back to complementation,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
leaving aside the technicalities,
if we had a mutant that's a TS

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
lethal and it's dead,
if we put a good copy we'll know it

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
because the cell won't die at a high
temperature anymore.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
So, you can sort of see from the
first principle it was relatively

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
straightforward to find the genes in
yeast that are necessary for cell

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
cycle control.
The remarkable thing is that

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
they've been concerns all the way up
to humans that the proteins that are

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
involved in the cell cycle control
are virtually identical in humans.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
So, the system, again, is probably
locked into place because it works

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
so well.  And once it was working,
then evolution didn't have a lot of

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
space.  I won't say it's completely
identical in human cells,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
for example, have a few more
wrinkles that they throw away.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
And fundamentally,
you can see evolutionarily that the

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
system [involved once?
.  One thing I just want to comment

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
on, and here's just an example of
the sort of thing that can happen if

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
you get a problem with pulling
chromosomes apart when they're not

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
ready, or something happens that
make a break in a chromosome.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
You will get a double strand break,
and cells don't like that, and they

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
try and fix it up.
I think in this case,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
you can see the chromosome 9 has
picked up a piece of a couple of

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
other chromosomes.
This piece here came from

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
chromosome 8 over here,
and this piece here came from

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
chromosome 22.
And so, this cell now has things

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
kind of messed up.
And this particular chromosome's

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
got parts of two other chromosomes.
And so, you can start to think

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
about the consequences of that.
You'll see when you start

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
segregating chromosomes,
there are issues.  And also,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
the junctions themselves can
sometimes do things like creating

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
fusion proteins that have aberrant
properties, for example,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
a signaling molecule that's now
locked permanently into the on

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
position or something like that.
Those sorts of things can happen by

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
these as well.
So, here's a very abbreviated form,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
the principal that happens, or what
happens so that the chromosomes

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
become visible in the microscope.
There is about a couple of meters of

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
DNA in every human cell.
So, you can see almost from first

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
principles, it almost has to be
packaged in some way to fit in that

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
little, tiny area.
And down at the basic level,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
the DNA is looped around a little
cluster of proteins called histones.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
And then, as the cells approach the
mitotic stage,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
they package these and higher,
and higher, and higher levels of

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
packaging so that the chromosomes
get more and more compact,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
and therefore less like spaghetti,
and less likely to get tangled when

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
they are pulled apart.
Now, this teaching as part of the

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
course.  It's in the book.
It's a little like glycolysis,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
though, and there's so much detail.
It's hard to notice at all.  And

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
what I've tried to do here is just
sort of take a step back,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
focus you on the really big parts of
the process.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
But you can see this is a sort of
typical textbook thing showing you

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
the various sub stages of this
process that cytologists have given

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
names to each part of this.
For example, you can see the

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
chromosomes lining up at the
equatorial phase just before they're

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
going to be pulled apart.
One little detail which I glossed

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
over at this point as you can see
that the chromosomes are,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
of course, surrounded by the nuclear
membrane.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
And, at least in many cells,
what happens is just before the

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
chromosomes are going to be pulled
apart, this nuclear membrane in a

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
matter of 20 or 30 seconds goes from
being a membrane into sort of

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
breaking into a whole little series
of membrane sacs.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
And then, after the chromosomes
have pulled apart,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
now you reassemble the nuclear
membrane around each set of

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
chromosomes.  And I think there's
still an awful lot to be learned

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
about how that particular trick is
done.  And that's a

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
textbook diagram.
These are the kinds of things the

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
cytologists were looking at as they
were describing it.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
And one thing you can certainly see,
I think, is that there are a lot of,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
if you want to think of them as
cables, this whole process is done

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
by molecular machinery.
And in fact, one of the key things

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
for ensuring that the chromosomes
are all lined up is each are

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
attached to each poll of the cell.
So, an individual chromosome feels

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
tension on both sides,
and there's pretty good evidence at

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
this point that says that what has
to happen before mitosis is allowed

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
to proceed is that each duplicated
chromosome must feel the tension on

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
both sides.  And if one of them is
only attached on one side,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
it's not allowed to go ahead.
Here are a couple more pictures.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
The chromosomes are in blue, and
all this cabling is in green.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
You can see a molecular machine's
basically at work.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
And I wanted to show you this
picture because this is important.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
There's two parts to this.  Julie,
could you hit?  So, this is a normal

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
mitosis.  These are in lung cells
from a newt, which are very flat.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
So it's easy to visualize them.
I believe this is by Nomarski, a

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
kind of optics called Nomarksi
optics.  What they're doing,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
the duplicated chromosomes are
getting lined up at the equatorial

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
position in the cell,
and you get a spindle attached to

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
one side, and then a spindle
attached to the other.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
And once that's happened,
then you can see the chromosomes.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Watch this one over here, for
example.  It just got attached,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
and it's being pulled into the
middle.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And once the cells feel that all the
attention, there's tension on all of

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
them, and then it enables the next
stage of the process.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
And you will see each of the
daughter chromatids segregate before.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
And, I just want to impress upon
you it's complicated enough just

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
replicating the DNA at the [fidelity?
.  We talked about an awful lot of

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
other stuff has to go on.
And it would be a reasonable

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
question: is there ever a mistake?
And there is.  This one actually

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
shows another cell where there's
going to be a mistake.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
You can't see it yet, but you can
see the chromosomes are all

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
condensed up.  And they are
beginning to get these spindles

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
attached.  And as they get attached
to the site then they get localized

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
in the central part right down the
equatorial plane of the cell.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
But, I think you'll start to see
the problem emerging at the moment.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
I think it's going to be this guy
right here.  I think a little arrow

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
will probably appear before too long.
But what's happened is this one

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
didn't get properly connected on
both sides.  But,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
the cell's going to go ahead anyway.
Watch.  The one up here is going to

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
get pulled in.
There it goes.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
It's getting pulled in.
And then, once it's in there,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
then the cell is going to go ahead
and divide anyway.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
So you can see what the problem is.
This one's got to over here,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
and this one over here is missing it.
This process is known as

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
non-disjunction.
This is the sort of thing that

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
happens in cancer cells that have
broken, where the checkpoint gene is

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
broken.  And then,
if you have that, then the cells go

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
on.  The same problem happens in
meiosis, and it's up here.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000
It's the same principle that if you
end up with, if you don't segregate

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.000
the cells, the chromosomes correctly,
then you can end up with a sex cell

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
that has two copies of one of them.
And the other one has none.  And if

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000
you have two copies,
or 2N plus 1N, then you end up with

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
a trisomy.  And if you have zero
plus N, you end up with what's known

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
as a monosomy.
So, these would be from defects in

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000
meiosis.  I'll just close by saying
the one that you probably have heard

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
of is Down's syndrome which is
trisomy 21.  That comes about from

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000
this sort of process.
It's a very debilitating genetic

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:59.000
deficiency.  Most of you are
probably familiar with it.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
This process happens.
Things go wrong at meiosis,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
about one in every [fifth?]
detectable human pregnancy doesn't

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
go to completion for the most part
because of an underlying problem

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
like this, that the body is set up
[to need?] the pairs of each

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
chromosome.  If you have one too
many or one too few it's usually

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
lethal.  So, if one in every five
human pregnancies has that happened,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
you end up with a miscarriage.  My
wife and I have been through it.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
It's a devastating experience.
I think you can just look around and

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
figure the odds.
A significant number of the people

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
in this room are going to have to
cope with this.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
And I'm just bringing this up for
your attention right now is it

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
something that in our society we
tend not to talk about very much

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
unless maybe you're a Hollywood
movie star and it makes it into the

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
tabloids or something.
But it's a very common human

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
experience, and very difficult to
cope with.  But there it is,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
for most of those pregnancies that
terminate very early,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
usually the underlying cause is a
problem and traces back to the kind

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
of stuff we see here where something
went wrong during the segregation

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
process of making the
sex chromosomes.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
And as I say, if it happens in just
our ordinary cells,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
that's one of the thinks that leads
the progression to cancer.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
OK, so I'll see you on Wednesday.

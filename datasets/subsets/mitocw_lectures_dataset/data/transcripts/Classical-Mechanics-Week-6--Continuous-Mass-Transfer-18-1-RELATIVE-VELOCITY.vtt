00:00:00.762 --> 00:00:02.720
We will practice going
between reference frames

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.410
to look at relative
velocities in one dimension.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.660
Let's say that an observer
is standing on the sidewalk

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.760
and that observer
sees a car drive

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.830
past to the right
at a speed of v car.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.660
The observer also
sees a bike that's

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.290
riding to the left at
a slower speed, v bike.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.270
Now, I'm interested
in what the car looks

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.550
like from the
perspective of the bike.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.030
The bike sees
itself as stationary

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.170
and sees the world around
it moving to the right.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.930
To the bike, the
observer on the sidewalk

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.960
appears to be moving to the
right with the speed of v bike.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.310
The car was moving to the
right relative to the reference

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.750
frame of the observer
standing on the sidewalk.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.780
So to the bike, the
car looks like it's

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.600
going even faster to the
right with a total speed

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.500
of v car plus v bike.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.540
Let's say, later on the
biker throws an apple

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.180
in the direction of her movement
and sees this apple travel

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.700
to the left with the
speed of v apple.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.430
Now I want to know
what an observer sees

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.320
in the stationary
frame on the sidewalk.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.850
The apple appears to
be traveling a speed v

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.350
apple faster than the
biker all to the left.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.000
So the observer on the sidewalk
will see the apple move

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.885
to the left with a total
speed of v apple plus v bike.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.360
Now let's say the person
throws the apple forward

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.140
at a speed v apple.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.060
What does the car see?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.360
To the car the apple is going
to the left at the speed of v

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.950
car minus v apple.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.789
How about the bike?

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.820
To the bike, the apple is going
at a speed of v apple plus v

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.140
bike to the right.

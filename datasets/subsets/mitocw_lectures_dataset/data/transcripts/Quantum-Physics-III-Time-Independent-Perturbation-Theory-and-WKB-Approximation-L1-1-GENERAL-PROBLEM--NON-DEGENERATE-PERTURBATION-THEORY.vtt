00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:01.010
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:01.880
Good morning.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.540
And welcome to 8.06.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.360
Let's begin.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.500
Our subject in 8.06 has to do
with applications of quantum

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.020
mechanics and using
quantum mechanics

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.210
to understand complex
systems, in fact systems

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.650
more complex than the ones
you've understood before.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.680
For example, in
previous courses,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.630
you've understood very well
the simple harmonic oscillator.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.180
You've solved for
the Hamiltonian.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.490
You've found all
the eigenstates.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.200
You've found all the energies.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.730
You know about the spectrum.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.840
You can do time evolution
in the harmonic oscillator.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.270
You've discussed
even peculiar states

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.755
like coherence states,
squeeze states.

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:58.230
You know a lot about this
very simple Hamiltonian.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.530
You've also studied the
hydrogen atom Hamiltonian.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.830
And you've found the
spectrum of the hydrogen atom

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.900
with all the
degeneracies that it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.290
has and understood
some of those wave

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.510
functions and the properties.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.990
And those are exact systems.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.520
But it turns out
that in practice,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.500
while those exact systems form
the foundation of what you

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.640
learn, many systems,
and most of the systems

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.230
you face in real life and
in research, are systems

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.360
that are more complicated.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.470
But at least a large fraction
of them have a saving grace.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.720
They can be thought as
that simple Hamiltonian

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.600
that you understand very
well plus an extra term

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.600
or an extra effect, some sort
of your total Hamiltonian

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.430
being essentially the
simple Hamiltonian

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.400
but differs from it
by some amount that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.410
makes it a little different.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.100
So your simple
Hamiltonian therefore

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.790
can be the harmonic oscillator.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.090
And in that case, for
example, in general,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.060
you may have a potential
for a particle.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.250
And you know, near the
minimum of the potential,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.420
the potential is roughly
quadratic in general.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.680
But then, as a Taylor
expansion around the minimum,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.710
you find a quadratic
term, no linear term,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.230
because it's a minimum,
a quadratic term.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.360
And then you will find maybe
a cubic or a quartic term.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.590
And the oscillations
are a little unharmonic.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.190
But it's dominated by the
simple harmonic oscillator

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.890
but some unharmonicity.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.170
This is studied by people that
look at diatomic molecules.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.350
The vibrations have this effect.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.800
It's experimentally detectable.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.930
You can have the hydrogen atom.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.170
And if you want to
study the hydrogen atom,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.470
how does an experimentalist
look at the hydrogen atom?

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.420
He puts the hydrogen atom
and inserts a magnetic field

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.510
and sees what happens to the
energy levels and then inserts

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.620
an electric field and sees what
happens to the energy levels.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.120
And those can be thought
as slight variations

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.960
of the original Hamiltonian.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.790
Van der Waals forces are,
you have two neutral atoms,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.170
and they induce on each
other dipole moments

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.100
and generate the force,
a very tiny effect

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.790
on otherwise simple
hydrogen atom

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.550
structure but a very important
force, the Van der Waals force.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.370
So what we're going
to be doing is

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:16.079
trying to understand these
situations in which we have

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:25.650
a Hamiltonian that is equal to
a well known Hamiltonian, this H

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.780
0.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.720
0 meaning no perturbation,
no variation.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.895
This is our well known system.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.160
But then there's going
to be an extra piece

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.870
to that Hamiltonian.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.670
And we're going to call
it delta H. Delta H is yet

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.970
another Hamiltonian.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.270
It may be complicated,
may be simple.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.150
But it's different from H 0.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.810
Now, this will be the
Hamiltonian of the system

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.750
that you're really
trying to describe.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.440
And therefore, you
should demand, of course,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.080
that H 0, delta H, and
H are all Hermitian.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.160
All Hamiltonians are
supposed to be Hermitian.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.660
And this is the situation we
want to understand in general.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.770
This is the concrete
mathematical description

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.680
of the problem.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.040
But we do a little more here.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.490
We need a tool to help
us deal with this.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:51.070
And there's a wonderful nice
tool provided by a parameter.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.660
A parameter here makes
all the difference.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.610
What is this parameter?

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.749
It's a parameter we
like to put here.

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:59.790
And we'll call it lambda.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.650
You might have said, no.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.900
I don't have such a thing.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.370
This is what I want to do.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.940
But still, it's better
to put a lambda there,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.450
where lambda is unit-free,
no units, and belongs

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.445
to the interval 0 to 1.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.420
In that way, you
will have defined

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.950
a family of Hamiltonians
that depend on lambda.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.810
And lambda is this quantity
that you can vary from 0 to 1.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.040
So you decide you're going to
solve a more general problem.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.520
Perhaps you knew what is the
extra term in the Hamiltonian.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.730
And you say, why do
I bother with lambda.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.610
The reason you
bother with lambda

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.290
is that it's going to help us
solve the equations clearly.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.930
And second, physically,
it's kind of interesting,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.500
because you could think of
lambda as an extra parameter

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.300
of the physics in which you
maybe set it equal to 0,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.810
and you recover the
original Hamiltonian.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.590
Or you vary it, and
when it reaches 1,

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.810
it is the Hamiltonian
you're trying to solve.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.110
On the other hand,
this parameter

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.010
allows you to do
something very nice too.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.540
One of the things
we're going to try

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.030
to clarify by the
end of this lecture

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.440
is, shouldn't this
thing be rather small

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.760
compared to this one.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.840
If we want to, say, deform
the system slightly,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.800
we won the correction
be small compared

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.050
to the original Hamiltonian.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.200
So what does it mean
for a Hamiltonian

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.680
to be small compared
to another Hamiltonian?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.960
These are operators.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.180
So what does it mean?

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.610
Small.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.430
You could say,
well, I don't know

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.440
precisely what it means small.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:09.190
Maybe means that the matrix
elements of this delta H

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.150
are small compared to the
matrix elements of that.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.460
And that is true.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.900
Surprisingly, will
not be enough.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.550
On the other hand,
whatever is small--

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.170
we could all agree that
if this is not small,

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.669
we could put lambda equals 0.01.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.840
Maybe that's small.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.539
But if that's not small,
lambda equal 10 to the minus 9.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.929
If that's not small,
10 to the minus 30.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.110
At some point, this
will be small enough.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.890
And therefore, we could
try to make sense.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.880
This allows you to really think
of this as a perturbation.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.980
For whatever delta H is, for
a sufficiently small lambda,

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.400
this is small.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.810
So this is what we're
going to try to solve.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.865
And let's try to imagine
first what can happen.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.800
So I'm going to try to
imagine what's going on.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.280
A plot, that's the best
way to imagine things.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.620
So I'll do a plot.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.770
Here I put lambda.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.550
And here, in the
vertical axis, I

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.420
will indicate the
spectrum of H 0.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.965
So this is going
to be an energy.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.620
So it may happen
that, in our systems,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.370
there's a ground state.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:08.230
And this ground state is
going to be a single state.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.390
I will not put a name to it.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.210
I will just say there
is one state here.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.350
That means the ground
state is non-degenerate.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.050
Degenerate states are
states of the same energy.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:27.640
And I say there's just one
state, so not degeneracy.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.980
Suppose you go here.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.260
And now you find two states.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.410
So I put two dots here
to indicate that there

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.070
are two states there.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.220
Finally, let's go
higher up and assume

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:48.110
that this Hamiltonian
maybe has one state here,

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.610
but here it has four states.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.690
And these are the energies.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.920
Those are some numbers.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.230
And the spectrum must
continue to exist.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:09.660
So this is a spectrum of your
H 0, the Hamiltonian you know.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.200
Certainly, the hydrogen
atom Hamiltonian

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.790
has degenerate states.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.380
So that's roughly
what's happening there.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.830
The simple harmonic
oscillator in one dimension

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.780
doesn't have degenerate states.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.470
But the isotopic
harmonic oscillator

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.730
in two or three dimensions
does have lots of degeneracies.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.420
You've seen those, probably.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.220
So that's typical.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.010
So what are we
aiming to understand?

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.190
We're aiming to
understand what happens

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.000
to the energy of
those states or what

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.540
happens to the
energy eigenstates

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.450
as the perturbation
is turned on.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:58.010
So imagining lambda going
from 0 to 1, the process

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.770
of turning on the perturbation.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.820
And eigenstates are
going to change,

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.570
because whatever was
an eigenstate of H 0

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.950
is not going to be an eigenstate
of the new Hamiltonian.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.280
And the energies
are going to change.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.130
So everything is
going to change.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.970
But presumably, it will
happen continuously

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:27.020
as you change lambda
continuously from 0 to 1.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:32.730
So this first state, for
example, may do this.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.100
I don't know what it will do.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.830
But it will vary as
a function of lambda.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.410
The energy will do something.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.575
Maybe we can cut it here and say
that lambda is equal to 1 here.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.465
Now we have two states.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.900
So I can analyze this
state with what's

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.370
called non-degenerate
perturbation theory, which

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.490
means you have a
non-degenerate state.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.110
And there are
techniques that we're

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.290
going to do today to understand
how this state varies.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.510
But how about this one?

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.000
Here you have two states.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.260
What happens to them?

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.340
Well, two states should
remain two states.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.140
And their energies,
what will they do?

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.780
Maybe they'll track each other.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.500
But maybe the perturbation
splits the degeneracy.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.330
That's a very
important phenomenon.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.320
Let's assume it does that.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:37.140
So it may look like this,
like that, for example.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.300
The perturbation makes
one state have more energy

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.050
than the other.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.650
Here is another state.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.050
Now, a phenomenon
that might happen--

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.890
many things can happen.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.260
This is a very rich subject
because of all the things

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.160
that can happen.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:09.360
It may happen that this thing,
for example, goes like this

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.410
and like that.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.730
But there are four states.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:16.250
It may be that one
state goes here.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.110
And three states go here.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.330
But then after a little
while, they'll depart.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.760
How many did I want?

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.960
No, I got too many.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.500
Well, five.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.250
All right, so it may
happen, something like that,

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.670
that they split, and
then to a higher order,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.270
they kept splitting.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.680
In fact, they're splitting here
already, but you don't see it.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.220
It's too close, just the
same way as x squared and x

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.790
to the fourth and x to
the eighth, at the origin,

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.990
they all look the same.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.960
And then they eventually split.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.450
So this is what we're
going to try to understand.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:06.500
For this, we need non-degenerate
perturbation theory,

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.700
for this, degenerate
perturbation theory, for this,

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.140
we need sophisticated
degenerate perturbation theory.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.070
This is a very
intricate phenomenon.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.460
But still, it happens and
happens in many applications.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.520
So we're going to
start with a simpler

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.240
one, which is non-degenerate
perturbation theory.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:40.010
And then we say, well, what does
it mean that we understand H 0?

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:47.970
It means that we have found
all the eigenstates with k 1,

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.610
maybe up to infinity.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:50.540
I don't know.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.130
k is not momentum.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.180
These are the energy
eigenstates of H 0

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.370
that we're supposed to know.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.370
And they're all orthonormal.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.540
That can always be done.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.110
When you have a
Hermitian Hamiltonian,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.350
you can find an orthonormal
basis of states.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:20.090
And being orthonormal,
this orthogonality holds.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:25.040
The states are
eigenstates of the H 0.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:34.040
So for this, we'll
call this E k 0.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.340
The energy of this
state, k, for the label

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.630
of the state, 0,
because we're not doing

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.390
anything in perturbation yet.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.860
We're dealing with the
unperturbed 0th order system.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.150
That defines the energies.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:01.900
And this energy
satisfies a E 0 0

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:13.150
is less than or equal than E 1
0 less than or equal to E 2 0.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.244
So all the energies are ordered.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.660
I need the equals because
of the degeneracy.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.310
They might be degenerate.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.600
So you have this situation.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:40.000
So let's consider this state
that is non-degenerate.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.940
And let's assume this
is the state n 0.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.960
It's the nth state.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:58.870
If n 0 is
non-degenerate, it means

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:07.700
that E n 0 it's really
smaller than the next one.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.250
And it's really bigger, the
energy, than the previous one.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.220
No equal signs there.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:27.170
It really means those
things are separate.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.710
And that's the meaning
of non-degeneracy.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.680
And now, what are
we trying to solve?

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.590
Starting from this
n 0, we're trying

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.620
to find out how
the energy changes

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.780
and how the state changes.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.950
Both things are important.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:58.020
So we're going to try to solve.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:04.080
Therefore, for H
of lambda n lambda.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.980
The state n 0 is going to
change when lambda turns on.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.570
And it's going to
become n of lambda.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.880
And this is going to
have an energy E n

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:22.920
lambda instead of E n 0.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:28.530
This has an energy
E n 0 with respect

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.480
to the original Hamiltonian.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:36.090
Now it's going to have an energy
E n of lambda n of lambda.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:41.040
So that's the equation
we want to solve.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:48.160
This is what this state n 0
becomes as you turn on lambda.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.630
And this is what
the energy E n 0

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.770
becomes as you turn on lambda.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:20:00.840
So we note that, when
n lambda equal to 0,

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.010
is what we call
the state n zero.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:16.790
And the energy E n at lambda
equal 0 is what we call E n 0.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.410
So with this initial
conditions at lambda equals 0,

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.600
we're trying to
solve this system

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.660
to see what the state becomes.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.280
And now, here comes
a key assumption,

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.470
that the way we're
going to solve this

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:39.870
allows us to write a
perturbative serious expansion

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.890
for this object.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:49.890
So in particular, we'll write
n of lambda is equal to n 0.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:54.390
That's what n of lambda should
be when lambda is equal to 0.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.680
So then there will be a first
order correction, lambda,

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:06.990
times the state n 1 plus lambda
squared times the state n 2.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.890
And it will go on and on.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:18.450
Moreover, E n lambda,
when lambda is equal to 0,

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.870
you're back to the energy E n 0.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:35.450
But then there will be a
lambda correction times E n 1--

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:39.200
that's a name for the
first order correction--

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.940
plus a lambda squared
correction E n 2.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.710
So this is our
hypothesis that there

00:21:53.710 --> 00:22:01.170
is a solution in a perturbative
serious expansion of this kind.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.060
And what are our unknowns?

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.190
Our unknowns are this object.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.790
This one we know is
the original state.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.050
This object is unknown.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.300
This is unknown.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.510
This is unknown.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.310
All these things are unknown.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.560
And they go on like that.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:25.935
Most important, all these
objects don't depend on lambda.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:33.120
The lambda-dependence is
here, lambda, lambda squared,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:33.990
lambda on.

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.320
And these are things that
don't depend on lambda.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.530
These are objects that
have to be calculated.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.070
They're all lambda-independent.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:52.190
So we are supposed to solve this
equation under this conditions.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.900
And that's what we're
going to do next.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.370
This is a short story of
maybe the quickest turnaround

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.240
I've ever experienced, ever.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.870
Here you're seeing a
very fine image made

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.910
by the researcher at Stanford.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.480
I'm not going to muck up
her name and I apologize.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.160
Please do see her credit.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.500
This is a solar
voltaic device that we

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.860
decided to try to quickly
get attention for, which

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.299
was very exciting research.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.700
So they sent me a
few of these cells.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.650
And I literally had
just a few hours

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.360
to try to attempt
an MIT homepage.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.610
So I made an image
of just one device.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.970
I actually used a stereo
microscope to make the image.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.570
But I could absolutely
have done the same

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.720
with a camera and a 105 lens.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.410
I just thought it
would be interesting

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.590
for you to see
this little story,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.010
even though I did
not use a camera.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.500
And then I placed
it in Photoshop

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.680
and just duplicated
a few of the layers,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.160
just to sort of get a feel
for what I might want to do.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.400
And I wound up developing an
image with layers of the cells

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.110
and moved them around.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.890
I was in a mood for lavender.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.280
So, sure enough, the MIT
office did use it online.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.910
But eventually, I was
looking for the homepage

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.080
and wanted to suggest
something solar-like.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.950
So I used a gradient
in the background.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.550
I really didn't like that.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.390
And then I remembered
from my thousands

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.240
of slides of images
of the landscape,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.770
that I did, in fact, have a
sunset from California, that I

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.460
took many years ago on film.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.250
And so I used that
for the background,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.780
overlaid the various
layers that I previously

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.310
made of the solar cell,
cropped it a little bit.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.680
And eventually,
they did, in fact,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.510
use it for the MIT homepage.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.290
This took all of,
I'm not kidding,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.980
three hours from start
to finish, very unusual.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.120
See if you could do it.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.410
I challenge you.

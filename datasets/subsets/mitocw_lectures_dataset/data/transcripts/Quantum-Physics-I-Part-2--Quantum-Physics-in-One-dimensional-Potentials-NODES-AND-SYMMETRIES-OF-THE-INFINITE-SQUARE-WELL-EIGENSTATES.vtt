00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
PROFESSOR: Here is x.

00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:07.679
And here is a.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.000
Various copies of the x-axis.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.780
For the ground state, what
is the lowest energy state?

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.050
It's not zero energy,
because n begins with 1.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.990
So it's this.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.450
The lowest energy
state is a sine.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.990
So the wave function
looks like this.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.650
This corresponds to sine.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.150
1.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.040
Or n equals 1.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.070
The next one corresponds to n
equals 2, and begins as a sine.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.220
And it just goes up like this.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.680
You add half a wave each time.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.820
Remember, we quantize
k a with n pi.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.550
So each time that you increase
n, you're adding pi to k a.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.680
So the phase, you see,
you have sine of kx.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.300
So you have sine that
goes from 0 up to k a.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.830
And k a is equal to n pi.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.690
So you go from 0 to pi, from 0
to 2 pi, then from 0 to 3 pi.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.310
So it would be one up,
one down, like that.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.990
And I could do one more.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.820
This one would be with four
cycles, two, three, four.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.130
So this is psi 1, psi
2, psi 3, and psi 4.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.340
Wave functions do
more and more things.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.950
So what can we learn
from this wave function?

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.490
There are several things
that we need to understand.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.280
So one important thing is
that the wave function,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.760
these are all normalizable
wave functions.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.710
The ground state-- this
is the ground state--

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.790
has no nodes.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.960
A node, in a wave function,
is called the point where

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.690
the wave function vanishes.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.450
But it's not the endpoints
or the points at infinity,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.650
if you could have a range
that goes up to infinity.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.050
It's an interior
point that vanishes.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.480
And the ground
state has no nodes.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:04.600
So a node, node, so zero
of the wave function,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.770
not at the end of the domain.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.610
And of the domain.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.130
Because if we
included that, I would

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.870
have to say that the ground
states has two nodes already,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.720
you'll see, around 0.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.140
But the 0 at the
end of the domain

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.000
should not be counted as a node.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.700
Nodes are the zeros inside.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.690
And look.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.000
This has no nodes, and
it's a general fact

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.320
about states of potentials.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.302
The next excited
state has one node.

00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:43.550
It's here.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:52.020
The next has two nodes, and
then the next is three nodes.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.410
So the number of
nodes of the wave

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.350
function increases in potential.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.390
You have more and
more wave functions

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.320
with higher and higher excited
states, and the number of nodes

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.960
increases one by one
on each solution.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.240
That's actually
a theorem that is

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.019
valid for general potentials
that have bound states.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.090
Bound states are states
that are normalizable.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.780
So the decay at infinity.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.180
You see, a state that
is not normalizable,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.940
like a plane, where it
is not a bound state.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.740
It exists all over.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.340
And it's a general
theorem that this phase,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.360
this one-dimensional
potentials, whenever

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.660
you have bound states,
the number of nodes

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.870
increases with the
energy of the eigenstate.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.900
We will see a lot
of evidence for this

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.920
as we move along the course,
and a little bit of a proof.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.750
Not a very rigorous proof.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.480
The other thing
I want to comment

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.160
on this thing that is
extremely important

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.910
is the issue of symmetry.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.930
This potential for simplicity,
to write everything nicely,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.490
was written from 0 to a.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.350
So all the wave functions
are sine of n pi x over a.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.120
But in some ways, it perhaps
would have been better

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.380
to put the 0 here.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.440
And you say, why?

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.920
What difference does it make?

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.590
Well, you have a 0 at the middle
of the interval, the potential

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.190
and the domain of
the wave function

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.200
are symmetric with respect
to x going to minus x.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.970
So actually, when you look at
the wave functions thinking

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.460
you can rethink this as an
infinite box from a over 2

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.790
to minus a over 2, and the
solutions, you just copy them,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.010
and you see now, this line
that I drew in the middle,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.040
the ground state is symmetric.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.280
The next state is anti-symmetric
with respect to the midpoint.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.420
The next state is now symmetric.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.630
And the following
one, anti-symmetric.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.600
So this is also a true fact.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:38.490
If you have bound states
of a symmetric potential--

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.070
I will prove this one,
probably on Wednesday.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.060
A symmetric potential
is a potential for which

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.980
V of minus x is V of x.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.240
Bound states of a
symmetric potential

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.495
are either odd or even.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.180
This is not a completely
simple thing to prove.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:24.640
We will prove it, but you
need, in fact, another result.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.110
It will be in the homework.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.900
Not this week's homework,
but next week's homework.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.940
In fact, homework that is due
this week is due on Friday.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.280
So the bound states of
a symmetric potential,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.090
a potential that satisfies
this, are either odd or even.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.590
And that's exactly
what you see here.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.810
That's not a coincidence.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.960
It's a true fact.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.730
The number of nodes increase.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.540
And the other fact that is very
important, of bound states,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.850
of one-dimensional potentials--

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.360
supremely important fact.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.080
No degeneracies.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.040
If you have a bound
state of a potential that

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.460
is either localized like
this or goes to infinity,

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.200
there are no degenerate
energy eigenstates.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.100
Each energy eigenstate here,
there was no degeneracy.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.470
Now, that is violated by
our particle in a circle.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.799
The particle in
the circle did have

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.440
degenerate energy eigenstates.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.570
But as you will see, when you
have a particle in a circle,

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.140
you cannot prove that theorem.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.810
This theorem is valid for
particles in infinitely--

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.830
not in a circle.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:56.230
For x's that go from minus
infinity to infinity or x's

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.430
with vanishing conditions
at some hard walls.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.830
In those cases, it's true.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.470
So, look, you're
seeing at this moment

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.960
the beginning of very
important general results,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.090
of very fundamental
general results that

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.130
allow you to understand the
structure of the wave function

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:17.740
in general.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:24.970
We're illustrating it here, but
they are very much, truly now,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.120
general potential.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.530
So what are they?

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.220
For one-dimensional potential
unbound states, no degeneracy,

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.060
number of nodes
increasing one by one.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.350
If the potential is
symmetric, the wave functions

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.560
are either even or odd.

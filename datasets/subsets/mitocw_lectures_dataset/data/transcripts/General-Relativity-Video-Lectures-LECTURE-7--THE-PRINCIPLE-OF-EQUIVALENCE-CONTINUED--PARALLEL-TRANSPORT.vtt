SCOTT HUGHES: All
right, good afternoon.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.540
So today's lecture is a
particularly important one.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.890
We are going to introduce the
main physical principle that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.680
underlies general relativity.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.320
We'll be spending a bunch of
time connecting that principle

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.050
to the mathematics as the
rest of the term unwinds.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.210
But today is where we're
going to really lay out

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.400
where the physics
is in what is known

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.230
as the principle of equivalence.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.360
So before I get into
that, just a quick recap.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.700
So in terms of technical
stuff we did last time,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.700
the most important
thing we did was

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.830
to introduce these
mathematical objects called

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.750
Christoffel symbols.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.590
Christoffel symbols are
those capital gammas.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.660
We began by thinking
of them as just what

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.940
you get when you look at
the derivative of your basis

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.920
objects.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.578
Pardon me a second.

00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:02.370
There was a lot of
chalk on the chalkboard,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.330
and I think I inhaled half of
it while I was cleaning it.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.160
So take derivatives
of your basis vectors.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.520
And there, you get something
that's linearly related

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.690
to your basis objects.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.190
And the gamma is the set
of mathematical quantities

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.900
that sets that
linear relationship

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.860
between the derivatives
and the objects themselves.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.320
One can build under the demand--

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.150
so recall how we did this.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.340
We have a physical
argument that tells us

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.880
that a quantity we call the
covariant derivative, which

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.300
is a way of using these
Christoffel symbols in order

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.560
to get tensorial derivatives.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.630
So if I look at just the
partial derivative of a tensor,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.900
if I'm working in a general
curvilinear coordinate system,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.730
the set of partial
derivatives do not

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.200
constitute components
of a tensor.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.700
OK?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.020
I posted some notes online,
demonstrating explicitly

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.400
why that is.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.960
But in a nutshell,
the main reason

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.730
is that, when you
try to work this out

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.733
or when you go and
you work this out,

00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:04.650
you will find that there
are additional terms.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.710
It was like the derivative of
the transformation matrix that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.110
come in and spoil
the tensoriality

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.568
of this relationship.

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:13.110
And what the
Christoffel symbol does,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.200
as you guys are going
to prove on P set three,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.580
it introduces terms
that are exactly

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.470
the same but with
the opposite sign

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.160
and cancel those things out.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.700
So that the covariant
derivative is

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.740
what I get when I
correct each index

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.110
with an appropriate factor
of the Christoffel symbol.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.540
It is something that is
a component of a tensor.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.750
In other words, it obeys
the transformation laws

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.480
that tensors must have.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.790
We have a physical
argument that essentially

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.330
is something that is
tensorial, in other words, both

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.960
sides of the equations are
good tensor quantities in one

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.210
representation,
have to be tensorial

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.010
in any other representation.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.440
And from that, we deduced
that the covariant derivative

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.080
of the metric must always be 0.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.160
And by taking appropriate
covariant derivatives

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.030
of the metric, sort of doing a
bit of gymnastics with indices

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.320
and sort of wiggling
things around a little bit,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.350
we found that the
Christoffel symbol can itself

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.130
be built out of partial
derivatives of the metric.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.710
And the result looks like this.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.070
So that's a little bit
more of an in-depth recap

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.917
than I typically do.

00:03:15.917 --> 00:03:18.000
But I really want to hammer
that home because this

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.690
is an important point.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.967
We then began switching gears.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.300
And we're going to do something.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.030
So I introduced, at the end of
the previous lecture, a fairly

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.970
silly argument,
which, nonetheless,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.550
has an important
physical concept to it.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.630
So where we were going
with was the fact that,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:57.660
when we have gravity, we cannot
cover all of spacetime with

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.950
inertial frames,
or I should say--

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.520
I should watch my wording here--

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.620
with an inertial frame.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.120
OK?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.200
We're, in fact,
going to see that you

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.820
can have a sequence of them.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.050
And we're going to find
ways of linking them up.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.260
But for now, if you think
of special relativity

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.180
as the theory of
physics in which we

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.360
can have Lorentz coordinates
that cover the entire universe,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.140
that's out the window.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.650
OK, and so I'm going to
skip my silly derivation.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.650
Part one of it is
essentially just a motivation

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.765
that a gravitational
redshift exists.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.910
So I gave a silly
little demonstration

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.550
where you imagined dropping
a rock off of a tower.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.800
You had some kind of a magical
device that converts it

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.390
into a photon that
shoots it back up

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.460
and then converts
it back into a rock.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.360
And you showed that,
as it climbed out

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.390
of the gravitational
potential, it

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.295
had to lose some of its energy.

00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:56.170
Or else, you would get
more energy at the top

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.087
than you put in when you
initially dropped it.

00:04:58.087 --> 00:05:00.580
It's a way of preventing you
from making perpetual motion

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.298
machines.

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:04.090
That is, without a
doubt, a flaky argument.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.840
It can be made a little
bit more rigorous.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.380
But I didn't want to.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.860
And I will justify the reason
I can do this is that this is,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.430
in fact, a highly tested
experimental fact.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.020
Every single one
of you has probably

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.450
used this if you've
ever used GPS

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.070
to find your way
to some location

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.390
where you're supposed
to meet a friend.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.800
And what this basically
tells me is that,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.040
if I imagine a
tower of height h,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.290
if I shoot light with
frequency at the bottom, omega

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.720
b, when it reaches
the top, it'll

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.020
have a different
frequency, omega t,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.270
where these are
related by omega t

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:01.300
equals, and I'm going to put my
c squareds back in there, just

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.410
to keep it all complete.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.910
OK?

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.610
So this is, I emphasize,
a very precisely

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.280
calibrated experimental
result. There

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.050
are many ways of doing it,
some silly, some serious.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.300
The silly one was sort of fun.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.600
But it does actually capture
the experimental fact.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.100
OK?

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.450
The key experimental fact is
that it's necessary for light

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.690
to lose energy as it climbs
out of the gravitational field,

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.170
in essence, because it's
possible, thanks to quantum

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.230
field theory, to convert photons
into particles and particles

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.040
into photons.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.070
This is a way of
conserving energy.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.920
OK, so this was just part one
of this argument that we cannot

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.140
cover all of spacetime
with an inertial frame.

00:06:45.542 --> 00:06:47.000
So here's part two
of the argument.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.945
Suppose there was, in fact, a
very large region of space--

00:06:53.945 --> 00:06:55.820
now let's say it's near
the Earth's surface--

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.310
that could be covered by
a single Lorentz frame.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.780
OK?

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.950
So I want you to
imagine that you're

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.460
sending your beam of light up.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.335
And we're going to take
advantage of the fact

00:07:28.335 --> 00:07:29.870
that light is wave like.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.430
So what I want
you to do is think

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.110
of the spacetime trajectory of
successive crests of this wave

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.470
as it climbs out of the
gravitational potential.

00:07:58.163 --> 00:08:00.330
So I"m going to make my
spacetime diagram the way we

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.670
like to do it with
time running up.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.400
And so this direction
represents height.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.770
So down here is the
bottom of the tower.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.592
So let's just make
the drawing clearer.

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:14.550
Let's let this tick be
the bottom of the tower.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.710
This tick over here
will be the top.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.860
Now if we were just
in special relativity,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.318
there was no gravity, we know
light would just move on a 45

00:08:30.318 --> 00:08:33.179
degree angle on this thing.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.270
We don't know yet what gravity
is going to do to this light.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:36.770
OK?

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.900
But you can imagine that
whatever it's going to do,

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.260
it's going to bend it away in
some way from the trajectory

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.510
that special relativity
would predict.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:49.930
So let's just imagine that
crest one of this light,

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.220
it follows some
trajectory in spacetime

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.510
that maybe looks like this.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.420
So here is the world
line of crest one.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.720
So what about the world
line of credit two?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.730
So let's think about what
the world line of credit two

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.690
must be under this assumption
that we can, in fact, cover

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.123
all of spacetime with
a single Lorentz frame.

00:09:28.123 --> 00:09:28.810
OK?

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:49.390
If that is the case,
so if that is the case,

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.550
no position and no
moment is special.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.050
OK?

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.150
Everything is actually
translation invariant

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.350
in both time and space.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.300
So the second crest
is going to be

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.720
emitted one wave period later.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.690
But there's absolutely nothing
special about spacetime one

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.700
wave period later.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.270
And as it moves
along, there can't

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.700
be anything special about this.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.060
If it is to be a global
Lorentz frame, whatever

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.630
the trajectory is that the crest
two follows through spacetime,

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.900
it's got to be congruent with
the trajectory of crest one.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.210
I've got to be able to
just simply slide them

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.487
on top of each other.

00:10:52.487 --> 00:10:53.710
OK?

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.665
That is what this
assumption demands.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:19.580
So this is going to look
something like this.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.290
OK?

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.790
Artwork a little bit off.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.500
The key thing which
I want to emphasize,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.780
though, is that if
this guy is congruent,

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.850
the spacing between crest one
and crest two at the bottom,

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.220
let's call it delta tb, there'll
be some spacing between the two

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:37.820
at the top.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.780
We'll call it delta tt.

00:11:42.093 --> 00:11:43.010
They must be the same.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.670
But that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.750
That is just a
period of the wave.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.460
And that's just up
to a factor of 2 pi.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.574
That's 1 over the frequency.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:28.550
So this implies delta tb is not
equal to delta t at the top.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.220
So a frequency at
the top is smaller.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.000
So the period will actually
be a little bit larger.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.030
So when you think about
this argument carefully,

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.790
the weak point is
this assumption

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.270
that I can actually cover the
region with a large Lorentz

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:43.770
frame.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.340
Remember what this is telling
me is that, essentially, there

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.840
is no special direction, right?

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.030
I can do translation,
variance in time and space,

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.710
and they're all the same.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.330
But that's actually completely
contradicted by common sense.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.980
If there were no special
direction, why did it go down?

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.550
There's obviously something
special about down, right?

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:16.740
So we conclude we cannot have
a global Lorentz frame when

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.520
we've got gravity.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.120
And in case you want to read
a little bit more about it,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.780
I'll just give a highlight that
this argument was originally

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:45.045
developed by a gentleman
named Alfred Shield.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:04.280
So that's unfortunate,
OK, from sort

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.520
of a philosophical
perspective because the fact

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:13.070
that we don't have a global
Lorentz frame makes you think,

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:13.670
oh, crap.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.680
What are we going to do
with that framework we

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.320
spent all this time developing?

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.630
OK?

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.160
The existence of a Lorentz frame
and many of the mathematics

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.430
we've been developing for
the past few lectures,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.640
they all center around things
you can do in Lorentz frames.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.540
So it's kind of like, OK, so
do we just throw all that out?

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:39.450
Well, here is where Einstein's
key physical insight

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.290
came in and gave us
the physical tools

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.260
that then needed to be coupled
to some mathematics in order

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.730
to turn it into something
that can be worked with

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.610
but, nonetheless,
really save the day.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.660
So the key insight has
there's a few steps in it.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.588
So first thing, I was very
careful to use the word global

00:15:07.588 --> 00:15:09.630
when I ruled out the
existence of Lorentz frames.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.890
But I'm allowed to have
local Lorentz frames.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:24.390
Let's see.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.650
What does that actually mean?

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.220
So I'll remind that a Lorentz
frame is a tool that we use

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.270
to describe inertial observers.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.008
In fact, we often call
them inertial frames

00:15:46.008 --> 00:15:48.050
because they're sort of
the constant coordinates.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.480
They represent the coordinates
of an inertial observer

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.965
who happens to be at rest in
that Lorentz coordinate system.

00:15:53.965 --> 00:15:54.840
So let's switch over.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.750
Let's start calling them
inertial frames for just

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.290
a moment.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:17.150
So an inertial frame means that
there is nothing accelerating,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:24.010
so no accelerations on
observers or objects at rest

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:24.670
in that frame.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.350
In other words, no
forces are acting.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.770
Einstein's insight
was to recognize

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:56.330
that the next best thing
is a freely falling frame.

00:17:15.674 --> 00:17:16.670
OK?

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:23.395
If you are in a freely falling
frame, to you, it sure as hell

00:17:23.395 --> 00:17:25.020
seems like there's
a force acting on it

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.880
and there's some
accelerations acting upon it.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.750
But let's imagine you're in
this freely falling frame.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.320
And you have a bunch
of small objects

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.748
that you release near you.

00:17:35.748 --> 00:17:37.831
Let's see if I can find
some bits of broken chalk.

00:17:42.545 --> 00:17:44.420
So when you're in this
really falling frame--

00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:49.880
this was a lot easier
when I was younger.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.460
All right, when you're in
this really falling frame, OK,

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.500
and these objects
are all falling,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:02.360
there is no acceleration of
these objects relative to you.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.810
The reason for this is that
the gravitational force

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.630
is proportional to the mass.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:18.830
And so the fact that
we have f equals ma.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:26.670
And fg proportional
to mass means

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:33.665
that all objects in that
freely falling frame--

00:18:33.665 --> 00:18:35.790
this is a term that I'm
going to start using a lot.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:44.538
So I'm just going to
abbreviate it FFF.

00:18:44.538 --> 00:18:46.580
If I get really lazy, I
might call it an F cubed.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.480
Anyway, l objects that are
in that freely falling frame,

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.850
they're experiencing
the same acceleration.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:59.950
And so they experience
0 relative acceleration

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.757
at least in the absence
of other forces, OK?

00:19:02.757 --> 00:19:04.090
Perhaps one of them is charging.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.800
There's an electric force.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.770
Well, then it sort of suggests
that the interesting force

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:14.290
is the extra force provided
to that relative to what

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.170
we call the gravitational force
that is driving this freefall.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:51.233
So I urge you to start getting
comfortable with this idea

00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:53.900
because we're going to find this
to be-- so one thing, which I'm

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.570
going to do in a
couple of minutes,

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:02.300
is actually a little
calculation that shows me

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:11.010
I can, in fact,
always find a Lorentz

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.426
frame in the vicinity of
any point in spacetime.

00:20:14.426 --> 00:20:15.100
OK?

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.970
And so we're going to actually
regard that Lorentz frame

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.120
as being the preferred
coordinate system of a freely

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.490
falling observer, one
who is not accelerated

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.460
relative to freefall
at that point.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.930
We are not in
freefall right now.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.090
The damn floor is pushing
us out of the way.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.540
But in this way of
doing things, we

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.730
would actually regard us as
being the complicated people,

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:37.380
OK?

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.900
Someone who is merrily
plummeting to their death,

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.650
they're actually the
simple observers,

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.340
who are doing what they should
be doing, in some sense.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.670
So the key thing, a
way of saying this,

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.700
so coming back to this
and just one more point

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.840
about that, because
there are no relative

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:06.830
accelerations, within
this frame, objects

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.040
maintain their
relative velocities.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.567
That's basically the
definition of something

00:21:22.567 --> 00:21:23.400
that is an inertial.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.400
If I have a frame
where everything is--

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.697
two objects are moving with
respect to each other at 1

00:21:28.697 --> 00:21:30.780
meter per second, they're
always moving at 1 meter

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.090
per second, that's inertial.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.700
And so this sort of demands that
we do all of our experiments

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.385
in plummeting elevators
or in space, right?

00:21:38.385 --> 00:21:39.760
OK, obviously,
you can't do that.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.218
So there's some
complications we're

00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:43.733
going to have to learn
the math to describe.

00:21:43.733 --> 00:21:45.900
But this is the way we're
going to from now on think

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.810
about things is that the
freely falling frame is

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.230
the most natural generalization
of an inertial frame

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.980
that we describe using
Lorentz coordinates.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.550
Now before I discuss a
few details about this,

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.410
an important thing
that is worth noting

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:05.880
is that a very important
aspect of any realistic source

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.794
of gravity is that
it is not uniform.

00:22:09.794 --> 00:22:10.650
OK?

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.490
Gravity here is a
little bit stronger

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.710
than gravity on the ceiling, OK?

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:21.560
And it's a lot stronger than
gravity in geostationary orbit.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.390
We call this variation
in gravity tides.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:38.910
So tides break down the notion
of uniform freely falling

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:39.410
frames.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.780
What this is telling
us is that this idea,

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.300
if I'm going to create
this inertial frame that

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.860
is essentially a
freely falling frame,

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.400
it will have to
be a finite size.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.010
Hence, it's local
and not global.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.740
OK, physically,
this is telling me

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:12.840
that, if I have a really
tall freely falling elevator,

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:22.140
and I'm here, I have one friend
here and one friend down there,

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.137
even if we start absolutely at
rest, let's say we're at rest.

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:27.470
We measure reference back to
the walls of this elevator.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.550
It's a very stiff elevator.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.650
We will see the three
of us diverge away

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.360
from each other with time, OK?

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.820
Because this person, let's
say earth is down here,

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.920
this person is feeling the--

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.460
and using Newtonian intuition,
gravity is a little stronger.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.200
Gravity is medium.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.520
Gravity is weak.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.130
And so as viewed in that
freely falling frame,

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.983
let's say we center it
on me here in the middle,

00:23:49.983 --> 00:23:52.650
I will see the person in the top
go up, the person at the bottom

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:53.150
go down.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:01.330
Another way of
saying this, so let

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.800
me just say that, so
a very tall elevator,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:13.420
we'll see a
separation of freefall

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.830
since gravity is not uniform.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.770
But there's another
way of saying this.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.160
And what this is
telling me is imagine

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.710
I made a spacetime diagram that
shows trajectories of the three

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:45.550
of us, so the three of
us that are plummeting

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.690
in this elevator, OK?

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.690
What we find, if we
make our trajectories

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.773
as we fall-- in fact, let's
just go ahead and make

00:25:01.773 --> 00:25:03.950
a little sketch of this.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.550
OK, so let's say
here is the middle.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.488
Here is the top.

00:25:11.488 --> 00:25:12.280
Here is the bottom.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.750
I'm going to draw this in
coordinates that are fixed

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.060
on the person in the middle.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.660
So the person the middle, in
their freely falling frame,

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.870
they think they're
standing still.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.330
They see the person at the
top moving up and away,

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.308
the person at the bottom
moving up and away.

00:25:33.308 --> 00:25:36.900
It's a very similar story to
the little parable I sketched

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.430
of that light pole moving up.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.098
These are not
congruent trajectories.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.440
Another way to say this is
that, in any moment, if I think

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.280
of these as world lines,
I can, at any moment

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.400
along the world line, I can
draw its tangent vector.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.715
The tangents do not
remain parallel.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:21.397
Now I'm going to take
you back to probably,

00:26:21.397 --> 00:26:23.230
I don't know when you
guys all learned this,

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.355
but when you first started
learning about geometry.

00:26:25.355 --> 00:26:26.800
For me, it was in middle school.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.070
And when you first started
learning about geometry,

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.150
you were usually doing
geometry on the plane.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.690
And they gave you various axioms
about the way things behaved.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.780
One of them is now known as
Euclid's parallelism axiom.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:52.780
And it states that if I have
two lines that start parallel,

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.100
they remain parallel.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.700
If you dig into the
history of mathematics,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:19.400
this axiom bugged the crap out
of people for many, many years,

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.300
OK?

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.110
Because when you look at
pictures on a piece of paper

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.900
or on a chalkboard or something
like that, it seems right, OK?

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.770
But it really can't be
justified quite as rigorously

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.380
as many other axioms
that Euclid wrote down.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.950
And it turns out, there's
an underlying assumption.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.200
The assumption is that
you are drawing your lines

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.850
on a flat manifold.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.710
There's a ready counterexample.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.830
Go to the Earth's equator.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.440
You start, say,
somewhere in Brazil.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.420
Your friend starts
somewhere in Africa.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.440
Both of you stand on the
equator and go due north.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.500
You are moving on
parallel trajectories.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.760
You will intersect
at the North Pole.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.260
OK?

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:19.890
Well, guess what?

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.210
You ain't moving
on a flat manifold.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:22.918
You're moving on the
surface of a sphere.

00:28:22.918 --> 00:28:26.670
OK, curvature causes initially
parallel trajectories

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.940
to become non-parallel.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.660
What this is telling us is that
the manifold I'm going to want

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:39.300
to use to describe events when
I have gravity cannot be flat.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.940
I'm going to have to
introduce curvature into it.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.670
Take us a little while to unpack
precisely mathematically what

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.210
that means.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:50.790
But this is sort of a sign that
things got more complicated.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.670
And tides are the way in
which that complication

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.930
is being introduced.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:03.000
So switch pages here.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.340
So what we have basically danced
around and put together here

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.520
is one formulation
of what is known

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.765
as the principle of equivalence.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:00.620
The principle of equivalence,
or one formulation of it,

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:23.420
tells me that over
sufficiently small regions,

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:42.490
the motion of freely falling
particles due to gravity cannot

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:50.099
be distinguished from
uniform acceleration.

00:30:55.843 --> 00:30:57.260
The physical
manifestation of this

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.635
is that if you're
an observer who

00:30:58.635 --> 00:31:01.050
is in that freely falling
frame moving due to gravity,

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.720
you are also experiencing
that uniform acceleration.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.650
So you see no net acceleration.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.090
This particular
formulation of it

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.616
is known as the weak
equivalence principle.

00:31:16.928 --> 00:31:18.970
I'm going to give you a
couple variations on this

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.880
in just a second.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:27.040
One thing that's
important about it is,

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.750
essentially, it's a
statement that, if you

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:38.100
think about Newton's laws,
the idea that f equals ma

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.670
and the force of gravity
is proportional to m,

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.460
it's a fairly precise
statement that you

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.190
think of that m as the
gravitational charge.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.410
It's saying that the
gravitational charge,

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.900
the gravitational mass
and the inertial mass

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.610
are the same thing.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.923
That's actually a
testable statement.

00:31:54.923 --> 00:31:56.840
What you can do is look
at materials that have

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.000
very different compositions.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.417
In particular,
what you want to do

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.130
is look at things
that maybe have

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:03.920
different ratios of
neutrons to protons

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.730
or have highly bound nuclei
with lots of gluons in them

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.260
or various kinds
of fields that you

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.810
can imagine perhaps couple
to gravity differently

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.040
than the quarks do.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.760
And so there are what are called
free fall experiments to test

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:24.640
this, which really
basically just boils down

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.290
to dropping lots of different
elements of the periodic table

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.040
and making sure they all
fall at the same rate.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.910
And the answer is that they
fall at exactly the same rate

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.670
within experimental precision.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:42.850
And the last time I looked
it up, well, what they do

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:50.020
is they demonstrate the WEP,
the Weak Equivalence Principle,

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.980
is valid to about, I believe,
it's about a part in 10

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:54.700
to the minus 13.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.075
Might be a little
bit better now.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.600
So bear with me just
one second here.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.850
OK, so good.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.360
We've got this notion here.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.340
And you might now
think, OK, great.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.780
I have a way of
generalizing what

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.890
the notion of an
inertial frame is.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.570
Is this enough for
me to move forward?

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:34.350
Can we now do all of
physics by just applying

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:42.900
the laws of special relativity
in freely falling frames

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.660
or, putting it this way, our
new notion of an inertial frame?

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.270
For two reasons that
are closely related,

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.710
this doesn't quite work.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:04.377
And it comes down to the fact
that because of tides, we

00:34:04.377 --> 00:34:04.960
can't do that.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.250
What this basically means is
that the transformation that

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:35.192
puts you into a freely falling
frame here is not the same

00:34:35.192 --> 00:34:36.650
as the transformation
that puts you

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.500
into a freely falling frame
10,000 miles over the Earth's

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.909
surface, OK?

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.739
There are different
transformations

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:45.320
at different locations
in spacetime.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.840
This comes down the idea that
it's not a global Lorentz

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.380
frame, OK?

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.230
We had a sequence of
local Lorentz frames

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.850
that we have to link up.

00:35:16.808 --> 00:35:19.100
So I'm going to do a calculation
in just a moment where

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:24.020
we explicitly show that we can
always go into a frame that

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:29.120
is locally Lorentz, but that
there's a term that I'm going

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.680
to very strongly
argue is essentially

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.590
the curvature associated with
the spacetime metric that

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.230
sets the size of what
that region actually is.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.940
So what we are
going to do, what is

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:49.570
going to guide our physics
as we move forward is,

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:53.080
essentially, we're going to take
advantage of a reformulation--

00:35:56.665 --> 00:36:05.047
there we go-- of the
equivalence principle, which

00:36:05.047 --> 00:36:06.255
I'm going to word as follows.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:25.160
In sufficiently small
regions of spacetime,

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:37.470
we can find a representation or
a coordinate system such that--

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.220
I don't want to cram
this into the margin.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.220
So I'll switch boards--

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:13.930
the laws of physics reduce to
those of special relativity.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:19.390
This is known as the Einstein
equivalence principle.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:22.923
At least, that's the name that
Carroll uses in his textbook.

00:37:22.923 --> 00:37:24.340
A couple books use
different ones.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.215
But this is a very nice
one because it really

00:37:26.215 --> 00:37:30.700
is the principle by which
Einstein guided us to rewriting

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.230
the laws of physics.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.830
So we've got a weak equivalence
principle, an Einstein

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.030
equivalence principle.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.010
Just as an aside, there
is something called

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.886
a strong equivalence principle.

00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:51.000
We're not going to talk
about this very much,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.625
but I'm going to give it to you
because it's just kind of cool.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:07.420
It tells me that gravity
falls in a gravitational field

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.490
in a way that is
indistinguishable from mass.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.730
That's a little weird.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.940
I'm not going to explain
it very much right now.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.770
A way to think about
it will become clearer

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.870
in some future problem sets.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:33.910
Basically what it's
telling us is that when

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:35.410
you make very strong--

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.440
when you make any kind
of a bound object,

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.930
some of the mass of that
object, in the sense

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.750
of the mass that is
measured by orbits,

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.690
can be thought of as
gravitational energy, OK?

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.000
Energy and mass are
equivalent to one another.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.580
So that gravitational energy
should respond to gravity.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.777
And in fact, it falls just
like any other mass, OK?

00:38:54.777 --> 00:38:55.610
This is another one.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:56.620
This is actually very--

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:03.220
well, prior to
September 2015, this

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.890
was very difficult to test.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.230
There were some very
precise measurements

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:11.140
of the moon's orbit that
were done to test this.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.390
And there were observations
of binary pulsar systems

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:16.440
that were done to test this.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.690
Now every time LIGO measures
a pair of binary black holes,

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.170
which are nothing but
gravitational energy,

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.490
and our theoretical models
match the wave forms,

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.290
sort of like, boom,
equivalence principle.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.810
Drop mic.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:28.710
Leave room.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:38.620
All right, so let's get precise.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:50.620
What I want to do is
show that we can always

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.160
find a local Lorentz frame.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.660
And what I mean
by that is that I

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.990
want to be able to
show that I can always

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:17.370
do a change of my coordinates,
a change of my representation

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:23.220
such that, at some point, I can
convert the metric of spacetime

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.220
into the metric we used
in special relativity,

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.530
at least over some
finite region.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.382
So let me define a
couple of quantities

00:41:00.382 --> 00:41:02.590
and then let me formulate
the way this calculation is

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:03.190
going to work.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:14.560
Let us let coordinates
with unbarred Greek indices

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.470
be the coordinate
system that we start in.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:29.260
And let's say that, in
this representation,

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.720
the metric is G alpha beta.

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:38.840
Let's demand that
there exists a set of

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.880
coordinates that
I will represent

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.960
with bars on the indices.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.990
When we transform to
these coordinates,

00:41:46.990 --> 00:42:10.060
I want spacetime to be Lorentz
at least in the vicinity

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.590
of some point or some event.

00:42:19.318 --> 00:42:20.886
We'll call that event p.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.200
So we will assume that
there is some mapping

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.140
between these
coordinates, so there's

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.040
no nasty singularities there.

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:01.650
And it's nothing that
we can't deal with.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.300
So we can do it in
either direction,

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:14.820
but let's say x alpha
is x alpha of p written

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.590
as some function of these guys.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.215
And so there's a transformation
matrix between the two of them.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:31.890
It takes the usual form, OK?

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:42.050
So mathematically, the way
I'm going to show this is I

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:56.400
want to show that we can
find a coordinate system such

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:02.390
that, if I compute
the spacetime metric

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:07.190
and the barred
representation, this is always

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:12.065
going to be given by doing
this coordinate transformation.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:20.060
Then I get the metric
of flat spacetime

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.445
over as large a
region as possible.

00:44:33.664 --> 00:44:37.685
OK, we know we're not going to
be able to do it everywhere.

00:44:37.685 --> 00:44:39.060
What I want to
show is that I can

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:42.540
make that happen at the point
p and that the functional

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.780
behavior of this thing
is sufficiently flat

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:49.237
that it remains at
this over some region.

00:44:49.237 --> 00:44:51.570
So let me just sketch what
the logic of this calculation

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:52.195
is going to be.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:21.320
So what we're going
to do is expand.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:27.430
So remember g is a function.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.650
All of these l's are functions.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:31.150
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:33.820
to think of this
whole thing as itself

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.430
being some kind of a function.

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:37.150
I'm going to expand
in the Taylor series.

00:45:56.673 --> 00:45:58.340
There's something
really cool that we're

00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.080
going to have to do with this.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.280
I mean, if I do this
in general, you're

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.160
going to get something
pretty vomitous It's

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.200
a giant, giant mess.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:03.700
OK?

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.360
You might worry, what the hell
are we going to do with this?

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.568
OK, but there's something
really cool that we can do.

00:46:08.568 --> 00:46:11.650
So we are given the metric g.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:14.440
But we are free to pick our
coordinate transformation to be

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.000
whatever we want it to be.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.620
So what we are going
to do is compare

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:31.030
the degrees of
freedom offered by

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.950
the coordinate transformation.

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:34.840
Which again, I emphasize,
we are free to make

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.132
that whatever we need it to be.

00:46:44.382 --> 00:46:46.840
So the coordinate transformation
and its derivative, right?

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.940
We're free to play
around with this thing.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:49.915
It's under our control.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:03.530
To the constraints
that are imposed

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.378
by the metric and its
derivatives, which

00:47:05.378 --> 00:47:05.920
we are given.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:27.150
So what we're
essentially going to do--

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.730
so in a moment or two,
I'm going to write out

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:34.140
very schematically what this
coordinate transformation is

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.170
going to look like when I
do the Taylor expansion.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.420
And what I want to
do is, essentially,

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.690
just count up how many
degrees of freedom

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:45.030
the coordinate system
offers me, count up

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:46.860
the number of
constraints that need

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.620
to be matched in order to
effect this transformation,

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.220
see whether I've got enough.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.162
Assess what we
learn from that, OK?

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:05.070
We just set up with
a few more things

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:06.270
to help define the logic.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.670
So I'm going to write G
alpha beta as G alpha beta

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:22.360
at the point p plus x gamma.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.110
And you know what?

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.950
Let's do the expansion
in the bar coordinate.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:34.200
Minus x gamma bar at point
p times the derivative

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:34.850
at point p.

00:48:39.502 --> 00:48:40.960
And then I'm going
to get something

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:49.180
that involves a
complicated form of x

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:59.150
squared and second derivatives.

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:00.160
OK, this can keep going.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.500
But this is going to be
enough for our purposes.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:09.650
I am likewise going to expand
my coordinate transformation

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:10.150
matrix.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.204
Make sure I got all
my bars in place.

00:49:31.204 --> 00:49:31.704
OK.

00:49:47.615 --> 00:49:48.115
OK.

00:49:54.262 --> 00:49:55.720
So let me go over
to another board,

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.740
just write down a few
more important things.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:58.990
And then we'll start counting.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.150
So first key thing,
which I want to note

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:17.400
before I dig into
the calculation,

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:25.640
is the metric at this
point, its derivative,

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:29.590
its second derivative.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.790
These have been handed to us.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:32.290
OK?

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.240
So we have no freedom
to play with these.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.835
These are going to
give us constraints

00:50:35.835 --> 00:50:36.835
that we need to satisfy.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:51:01.610
The coordinate transformation
in its various derivatives,

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:03.310
we are free to specify these.

00:51:08.166 --> 00:51:11.700
These are our
degrees of freedom.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:23.630
OK, so let me just
restate the calculation

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:24.630
that we are going to do.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:27.960
Basically, we wanted to do this.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.173
Schematically, here's
what this calculation

00:51:30.173 --> 00:51:31.090
is going to look like.

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:35.115
And if you look
at this right now,

00:51:35.115 --> 00:51:36.990
you might think this is
going to be horrible.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:40.020
But we don't need to specify
every step of this thing

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.250
in absolutely gory detail.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:57.490
What we want to do
is make this, which

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:15.810
I can write as this guy at
point p, this guy at point p,

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:27.150
this guy at point p plus a
term that is going to be linear

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:30.600
in the distance from the
spacetime displacement away

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.380
from point p.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.420
If you want to go and multiply
this out, knock yourself out.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.880
But it suffices to
know that you are

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.350
going to get some
new things that

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:46.180
involve first derivatives
of all these quantities.

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:56.080
So this will involve
these two things.

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:14.677
And this will involve
second derivatives

00:53:14.677 --> 00:53:15.510
of all these things.

00:53:20.272 --> 00:53:21.730
Now what we're
going to do is we're

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:24.490
going to try to make what
we would get multiplying all

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:28.295
this out look as much
like minus 1, 1, 1,

00:53:28.295 --> 00:53:30.560
1 of the diagonal as possible.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.143
And like I said, it really just
involves accounting argument.

00:53:34.143 --> 00:53:36.310
It's actually one of my
favorite little calculations

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:39.793
we do in this class because
it's my favorite word for this

00:53:39.793 --> 00:53:40.960
is it really looks vomitous.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.040
But it's quite elegant.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:49.895
And I have an
eight-year-old kid.

00:53:49.895 --> 00:53:51.520
And I'm constantly
trying to teach her,

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.860
math is just all about counting.

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.110
And this is a perfect example.

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.770
This is really just
about counting.

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.680
So let's look at this
thing at 0th order.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:07.760
So what I'm trying to do is
guarantee that I've got some l,

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.380
which I can choose,
which will make

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:15.260
the components of the g at
that point be minus 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:22.550
So my constraints, the
conditions I must satisfy

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:28.760
involve things that hit
these 4 by 4 symmetric tensor

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.240
components.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.150
So this guy is something
that is symmetric.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.830
Nature has just handed
me a symmetric tensor

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:41.230
with a symmetric 4 by 4 object.

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:44.440
Those are 10 constraints that
my transformation must satisfy.

00:54:55.590 --> 00:55:03.270
What I'm going to use to do this
is this matrix at the point p.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:09.870
And I'll remind you,
this matrix is just

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:14.280
following set of partial
derivatives at that point p.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.290
This is also 4 by 4.

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:20.460
It is not symmetric.

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:29.670
So this actually gives
me 16 degrees of freedom

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:31.691
to satisfy these constraints.

00:55:39.868 --> 00:55:40.840
Ta da!

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.980
We can easily make this thing
look Lorentzian at the point p.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.290
In fact, we can do so
and have six degrees

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:49.180
of freedom left over.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.840
Any idea what those six
degrees of freedom are?

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.406
Remember you're going
into a Lorentz frame.

00:55:55.406 --> 00:55:57.180
Yeah?

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.830
Three rotations, three boosts.

00:55:58.830 --> 00:55:59.460
Exactly right.

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.820
Boom.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:18.940
So not only does it
work mathematically,

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.030
but there's a little
bit of leftover stuff

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.890
which hopefully
hits our intuition

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:25.512
as to how things should
behave in special relativity.

00:56:28.956 --> 00:56:31.400
OK, that's not really
good enough though, right?

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.140
So I just showed that I
can do it at this point.

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:38.132
And if I move a centimeter
away from that point, suppose,

00:56:38.132 --> 00:56:39.590
there's some really
steep gradient,

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:41.040
and then it goes
completely to hell.

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:41.540
OK?

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:42.538
Then we're in trouble.

00:56:42.538 --> 00:56:43.580
So we have to keep going.

00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:45.740
We have to look at
the additional terms

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:46.984
in this expansion.

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:55.630
So when we do things at
0th order, we have now--

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:57.400
so g has been handed to us.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:01.900
We have now specified
behavior of l at that point.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.710
So l has been
completely soaked up.

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:09.340
I don't have any more freedom
to mess around with it.

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:17.990
When I go to the next
order, OK, so the quantity

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:23.330
that is setting my constraints
is the first derivative

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:25.350
of this.

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:30.806
So these are four derivatives
of my 10 metric functions.

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:44.920
4 by 4 symmetric
by 4 components.

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.165
So I have got 40
constraints I must satisfy.

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:01.290
OK, well, the tool
that I have available,

00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:04.800
I am free to specify the
derivatives at this point.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.233
Again, remember this is
itself a partial derivative.

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:33.540
So I've got 4 components alpha,
4 derivatives with gamma bar, 4

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:35.640
derivatives with mu bar.

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.450
Partial derivatives, it should
not matter what the order is.

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:42.510
So this needs to be
symmetric on mu and gamma.

00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:55.720
So I, in fact, have 40 degrees
of freedom at 1st order.

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.820
Perfect match.

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:05.320
OK?

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.970
So I can make my
coordinate system.

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:11.140
Not only can I make it equal
to the Lorentz form at--

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.110
I can make the spacetime
metric Lorentz at the point p,

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:16.180
I can also make it
flat at that point p.

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:21.950
All right, now
we're feeling cocky.

00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:24.860
So let's move on.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.130
How far can I go?

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:31.060
I lost the page I need.

00:59:50.657 --> 00:59:52.740
OK, so now you have a
flavor for what we're doing.

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:53.240
OK?

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.250
I want to count up the
number of degrees of--

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:57.080
sorry-- the number
of constraints

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.550
that are in the metric
object, the new metric

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:02.073
object I work with at
this order and compare it

01:00:02.073 --> 01:00:04.490
to the degrees of freedom in
the coordinate transformation

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:05.073
at this order.

01:00:09.383 --> 01:00:11.300
So when I go to 2nd
order, my new metric thing

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.430
that I'm going to be
messing around with

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:16.050
is the second derivative.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:22.840
So I take two derivatives of
g alpha beta at the point p.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.770
So this again needs to be
symmetric in the derivative.

01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:38.820
So I have a symmetric 4
by 4 on these two guys.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:49.030
And the metric is itself 4
by 4, one alpha and beta.

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.125
So there is 100
conditions, 100 constraints

01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:52.000
that we must satisfy.

01:00:55.750 --> 01:01:07.190
So let's look at the
second derivative of this.

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:09.190
OK, so I'm going to move
this down a little bit.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.550
This is now going to look
like the third derivative

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:25.800
when I do this transformation.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.467
So it's going to be
the third derivative

01:01:27.467 --> 01:01:43.420
of x alpha with respect to mu
bar, delta bar, and gamma bar.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:48.850
So I've got 4 degrees
of freedom for my alpha.

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:56.680
And this must be
perfectly symmetric

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.190
under the any interchange
of the indices mu bar,

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.022
delta bar, and gamma bar.

01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:03.710
OK?

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:07.400
This is a little exercise
in combinatorics.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.170
So the number of equivalent
ways of arranging this

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:17.570
turns out to be n
times m plus 1 times n

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:22.860
plus 2 over 3 factorial.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.770
And I'm in 4 dimensions
for n equals 4.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.020
Work that out, and
you will find that you

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:34.870
have 80 degrees of freedom.

01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:45.050
So what we can do
is we can always

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:47.780
find a coordinate transformation
that makes it flat.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.570
It makes it
Lorentzian at point p.

01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:52.290
It is flat in that region.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:56.470
In other words, there is
no first derivative there.

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:57.020
Sorry.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.020
Flat's not really
the right word.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:03.170
There is no slope
right at that point.

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:06.430
But we cannot transfer
away the second derivative.

01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:13.100
And so what this tells me is the
coordinate freedom that we have

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:17.260
means that we can always put our
metric into the following form.

01:03:56.198 --> 01:03:57.990
I'm just going to write
this schematically.

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:02.580
Second derivative to
the metric and sort

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.701
of the quadratic separation
in spacetime coordinate.

01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:35.110
So a couple things about
this are pretty interesting.

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:36.870
So this is basically
telling me that we

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:40.590
can make it Lorentz only up to
terms that look, essentially,

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:42.570
like the second
derivative of the metric.

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:44.640
Well, the second
derivative of any function

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.690
tells you about the
curvature of that function.

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:49.232
So this word curvature is going
to be coming up over and over

01:04:49.232 --> 01:04:50.560
and over again.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.010
We are, in fact, because
this is general relativity,

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:53.940
we can't do everything simply.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.340
We're going to actually find
that there is a rigorous way

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.550
to define a notion of curvature
that we're going to play with,

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:02.370
which indeed looks
like two derivatives

01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:04.350
of the spacetime metric.

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:07.440
And we are going to find it
has, I mean, it's actually

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.690
going to end up looking
like a 4 index tensor.

01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:11.190
OK?

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:14.850
So it's going to be an object
that's got 4 indices on it.

01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:19.540
Each of those indices goes over
the 4 spacetime coordinates.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.100
And so naively, it looks like
it's got 4 to the 4th power

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.840
independent components.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.862
256.

01:05:26.862 --> 01:05:29.070
It has certain symmetries
we're going to see, though.

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:31.028
And when you take into
account those symmetries

01:05:31.028 --> 01:05:32.730
and you count up
how many of those

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:35.130
components are
actually independent,

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:37.870
any guesses what the number
is going to turn out to be?

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:39.310
20.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.825
Yes, it exactly compensates
for the number that cannot be

01:05:42.825 --> 01:05:44.700
zeroed out by this
coordinate transformation.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.690
It's called the Riemann
curvature tensor,

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:48.490
and we will get to that fairly--

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:50.810
actually, really, just
in a couple lectures.

01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:54.520
The other thing which
this is useful for

01:05:54.520 --> 01:06:01.180
is in all of my discussion
of the equivalence principle

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:04.690
up to now, there's
been a weasel word

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:06.940
that I have inserted
into much of the physics.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:10.250
I always said over
sufficiently small regions.

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.750
OK?

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:13.630
I say that trajectories begin
to deviate from one another

01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:16.290
when they get sufficiently
far away from one another.

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:16.790
OK?

01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:18.385
And you should be
going, what the hell

01:06:18.385 --> 01:06:20.343
does sufficiently small,
sufficiently far away,

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.070
what do all these things mean?

01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:22.600
OK?

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.880
And the issue is you
need to have a scale.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:30.057
Well, this scale is going to
be set by the second derivative

01:06:30.057 --> 01:06:30.640
of the metric.

01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:47.080
So the size of the region
over which spacetime

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.600
is inertial in this
coordinate system,

01:06:49.600 --> 01:07:03.890
in this representation
is approximately so

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:08.060
imagine it's 1 over--
we can think of d2g

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:11.375
as being 1 over
a length squared.

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:12.800
So 1 over the
square root of that

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.037
gives me a rough
idea of how long

01:07:15.037 --> 01:07:17.120
the curvature scale
associated with your spacetime

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:17.730
actually is.

01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:20.900
And it tells you how big your
inertial region actually is.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.530
So we're going to make this
notion of curvature regress

01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:30.410
very, very soon.

01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:32.600
As a prelude to
this, we now need

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.990
to start thinking about how
we do mathematics and physics

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:37.100
on a curved manifold.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:46.125
So I'm going to start to
set up some of the issues

01:07:46.125 --> 01:07:47.000
that we need to face.

01:08:18.807 --> 01:08:20.640
So we're going to need
to define what I mean

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.439
by a manifold that is curved.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:24.660
So a curved manifold
is going to simply

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:30.479
be one in which initially
parallel trajectories do not

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:32.069
remain parallel.

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:04.819
So an example is the surface
of a sphere, as I illustrated.

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:07.189
You start somewhere on
the equator in Brazil.

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:10.170
Your friend starts somewhere
on the equator in Africa.

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:12.290
The two of you
start walking north.

01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:14.120
You are exactly
parallel when you take

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.652
that first step of the equator.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.569
But your trajectories
cross at the North Pole.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.370
Interestingly, an
example that looks

01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:32.890
curved but is not, the
surface of a cylinder.

01:09:40.858 --> 01:09:41.359
OK?

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.580
If I take two
lines, again, I need

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.262
to imagine that this region
continues all the way up here.

01:09:46.262 --> 01:09:48.470
I make two lines that are
parallel to each other here

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:50.840
and I have them extend
around this thing,

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.899
they would remain parallel
the entire way out, OK?

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:56.150
Another way of stating
that is that you can always

01:09:56.150 --> 01:10:00.500
take a cylinder and,
with an appropriate cut,

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.710
but without tearing it, you
can flatten it out and make it

01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:07.372
into a simple sheet, a
perfectly flat sheet.

01:10:07.372 --> 01:10:09.830
You cannot do that with a sphere
without tearing it in some

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:10.330
places.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:20.510
So what is going to begin
to complicate things

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:24.890
is that we want to work with
vectors and tensors that

01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.825
live in this curved manifold.

01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:43.210
We haven't really thought too
carefully yet about the space.

01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:45.230
And let's just focus
on vectors for now.

01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:47.630
We haven't thought too carefully
about the space in which

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:49.640
the vectors actually live.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.140
So implicit to
everything we have

01:10:51.140 --> 01:11:02.530
talked about up until now is
that we often regard vectors

01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:07.750
as objects that themselves
reside in a tangent space.

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.500
OK, if I'm working in a
manifold that is flat,

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.667
say it's the surface of
this board, OK, and just two

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:19.050
dimensions, every
point on this board

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:20.580
has the same tangent, all right?

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:25.075
So if I draw a vector here and
I draw another vector over here,

01:11:25.075 --> 01:11:26.700
it's really easy for
me to compare them

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.890
because they actually live
in the same space that

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:31.410
is tangent to this board.

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:34.410
If I'm on the
surface of a sphere,

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:37.110
points that are tangent to
the sphere at the North Pole

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:38.730
are very different
from points that

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:41.800
are tangent to the
sphere on the equator.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.783
So it becomes difficult for
me to actually compare fields

01:11:44.783 --> 01:11:46.950
when they are defined on a
curved surface like this.

01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:26.180
So this makes it a little
bit-- and so I'm just

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.630
going to set up this problem,
and I will sketch the issue.

01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:32.855
And then we will resolve it
in our lecture on Tuesday.

01:12:32.855 --> 01:12:34.730
This makes it a little
bit complicated for me

01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:37.370
to take derivatives
of things like vectors

01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:40.700
when I'm working in
a curved manifold.

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.740
So let's consider the
following situation.

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:49.760
So I'm going to define some
curve, which I would just

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.970
call gamma.

01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:55.320
It lives in a curved
space of some sort.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.990
I'm going to draw it
here on the board.

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:06.200
But imagine that this is
on the surface of a sphere.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.490
OK?

01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:10.686
So here's the curve gamma.

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:19.690
And let's say this point p
here has coordinates x alpha.

01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:24.060
And this point q
here has coordinates

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:27.787
x alpha plus dx alpha.

01:13:27.787 --> 01:13:29.370
Suppose there's some
vector field that

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:31.630
fills all this manifold.

01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:32.830
OK?

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:37.910
And so let's say
the vector a looks

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:41.858
like this here at the point p.

01:13:41.858 --> 01:13:48.140
And it looks like this
here at the point q.

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.480
How do I take the derivative
of the vector field

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.100
as I go from point p to point q?

01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:19.320
Well, your first guess
should basically just

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.170
be do what you always
do when you first

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:23.656
learn how to take a derivative.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.360
OK?

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.380
So that would be a
notion of a derivative.

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.740
There's nothing mathematically
wrong with that.

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:17.240
OK?

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.907
But we're going to
find that it gives us

01:15:18.907 --> 01:15:22.690
problems for the same reason
that we ran into problems when

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:24.900
we began working
with vector spaces

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.270
and curvilinear coordinates.

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:27.520
OK?

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.660
If I want this to be a
tensorial object in the same way

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.918
that we have been defining
tensors all along here,

01:15:33.918 --> 01:15:35.210
I'm going to run into problems.

01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:36.880
So let me just actually
demonstrate what

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.268
happens if I try to do this.

01:15:40.268 --> 01:15:42.310
So the key bit, the way
we want to think about it

01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:45.790
is that the points p and q
don't have the same tangent

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:56.640
space, which is a
fancy way of saying

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.310
that, as I move from
point p to point q,

01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:01.260
the basis vectors are moving.

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.379
They're starting to point
in different directions.

01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:19.733
So if this were to be--

01:16:19.733 --> 01:16:21.400
like I said,
mathematically, if you just

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.050
want to get that
derivative, that

01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:26.810
is a quantity which has a
mathematical meaning, OK?

01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:29.140
But it's not the component
of a tensor, which

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.990
we have called out as having a
particularly important meaning

01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:34.840
in this geometric construction
of physics that we are doing.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.905
And so if this were
to be tensorial,

01:16:37.905 --> 01:16:40.280
then I should be able to switch
to new coordinates, which

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:57.000
I'll designate with primes, such
that the following was true.

01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:08.050
The reason why this
doesn't actually work

01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:10.000
is I'm going to
demand that alpha--

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.330
excuse me-- that a is, in fact,
actually already tensorial.

01:17:13.330 --> 01:17:13.830
OK?

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:15.330
It's the compound
of a vector, which

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.830
is a particular kind of tensor.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:30.540
So I'm going to demand
that the following be true.

01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:40.760
And I'm going to demand
that my derivatives,

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:41.970
they are just derivatives.

01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:44.340
They do the usual rule
Jacobian rule when

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:47.310
I switch coordinate systems.

01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:49.302
And so skipping a
line of algebra,

01:17:49.302 --> 01:17:50.760
which you can get
in my notes, this

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.220
is actually very similar to
the notes I've already posted.

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.720
When you work this
out, you're going

01:17:54.720 --> 01:18:15.280
to find you get one
term that's correct,

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.790
but you get another
term that involves

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:21.190
a derivative of your coordinate
transformation matrix.

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:29.432
And this is an actual term,
spoils the tensorialness

01:18:29.432 --> 01:18:30.140
of this quantity.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:40.510
The way we are going
to cure this is we

01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:46.350
are going to demand that if
we want our derivatives to be

01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:51.420
derivatives that comport with a
notion of taking tensor objects

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:55.110
and getting other tensor objects
out of them, before we take

01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:58.530
the derivative, we have to
have some way of transporting

01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:01.020
the objects to the same
location in the manifold,

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.850
where I can then compare them.

01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:39.400
So here's one example
of a notion of transport

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.180
that we could use.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.920
So here's a at point q.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.490
There's a at point p.

01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:55.637
Notion one that we'll talk about
is known as parallel transport.

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:06.550
What that's essentially going
to mean is I'm going to say,

01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:09.465
well, let's take one of
these guys, either q or p.

01:20:09.465 --> 01:20:11.490
The way it's drawn in
my notes, I've used q.

01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:12.810
But it could be either.

01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:15.090
And let's imagine
I slide it parallel

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:42.120
to itself until this gives me a
alpha from q transported to p.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.140
And then I define a derivative
with that transported notion

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.370
of the vector.

01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:49.970
Now notice I've called
this notion one.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:51.890
You can take from
that this idea of how

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:54.210
I transport the vector
from one place to the other

01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:55.430
to do this comparison.

01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:57.800
I cannot uniquely define it.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.087
There are, in fact, multiple
ways you can do this.

01:21:00.087 --> 01:21:01.670
We're going to talk
about two that are

01:21:01.670 --> 01:21:04.720
useful at the level of 8.962.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.470
In principle, I imagine
you could probably

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:08.760
come up with a whole butt
load of these things.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.150
These are two that
the physics picks out

01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:12.740
as being particularly
useful for us

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:14.930
for the analysis that
we are going to do.

01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:15.530
OK?

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:16.910
So we'll pick it up
there on Tuesday.

01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:18.368
We're going to
start by coming back

01:21:18.368 --> 01:21:20.510
to this notion of I want
to differentiate a vector

01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:22.540
field in a curved manifold.

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.950
And let me just state
before we conclude,

01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:29.030
now that I've transported
a from q to p,

01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:31.220
they share the
same tangent space.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.650
Since they share the
same tangent space,

01:21:33.650 --> 01:21:35.030
I can compare them more easily.

01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:37.520
That allows me to make a
sensible derivative that

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.280
respects all the notions
of what a tensor should be.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.940
We'll pick it up from
there on Tuesday.

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:25.600
MICHAEL SHORT: Hey guys, hope
you enjoyed the brief break

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.210
from the heavy technical stuff.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.085
Because we're going to
get right back into it

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:31.222
and develop the neutron
transport equation today,

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:32.680
the one that you
see on everybody's

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.470
t-shirts here in the department.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.550
So I think multiple
years folks have

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.940
used this equation on the
back of t-shirts just be like,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.540
we're awesome.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.940
And we do difficult math.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.563
Well, this is what you're
going to start to do it.

00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:47.230
In fact, it's big
enough and hard enough

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.770
that we're going to spend
all day today developing it,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.080
like actually writing out
the terms of the equation

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.390
and understanding what
it actually means.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.490
Before, on Thursday
and Friday, we're

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.580
going to reduce it down to
a much simpler equation,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.680
something that you can
actually solve and do

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.080
some simple reactor
calculations with.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.100
We started off the whole idea of
the neutron transport equation

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.710
as a way to track some
population of neutrons.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.770
Let's see, I'm going to have
our variable list up here.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.763
What I'll probably do is
on Thursday and Friday

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:21.430
I'll just have it
back up on the screens

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.097
so that we don't have
to write it twice.

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:25.985
But there's going to be a lot
of variables in this equation.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.610
I'm going to do my
best, again, to make

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.240
the difference between V and nu
very obvious, and anything else

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.230
like that.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.940
But the goal is to track
some population of neutrons,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.330
at some position,
at some energy,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.110
traveling in some direction
omega, as a function of time.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.060
And the 3D representation of
what we're looking at here

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.250
is let's say we had some
small volume element, which

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.370
we'll call that our dV.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.100
That's got normal vectors
sticking out of it.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.550
We'll call those n-hats
in all directions.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.530
And inside there, let's say
if this is our energy scale,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.850
we're tracking the
population of neutrons

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.540
that occupies some
small energy group dE,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.700
and is also traveling
in some small direction

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.092
that we designate as d-omega.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.660
So that's the goal of
this whole equation

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.970
is to track the number of
neutrons at any given position.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.730
So let's call this
distance, or the vector r.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.390
In this little volume, traveling
in some direction omega,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.550
with some infinitesimally
small energy group d.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.100
That's going to be the
goal of the whole thing.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.900
And what we'll do
is write this to say

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.220
the change in the population of
neutrons at a given distance,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.910
energy, angle, and
time, over time

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.440
is just going to be a sum
of gain and loss terms.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.190
And what I think we'll
take all day today to do

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.440
is to figure out what are
the actual physical things

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.800
that neutrons can do in
and out of this volume,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.990
and how do we turn those
into math, something

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.980
that we can abstract and solve?

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.020
There's a couple
other terms that we're

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.710
going to put up here.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.210
We'll say that the flux of
neutrons, which is usually

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.960
the variable that
we actually track,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.120
is just the velocity times
the neutron population.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.540
And also let's define some
angularly independent terms.

00:03:50.608 --> 00:03:52.150
Because in the end
we've been talking

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.480
about what's the
probability of some neutron

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.000
or particle interacting
with some electron going out

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.230
at some angle.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.840
But as we're interested in
how many neutrons are there

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.690
in the reactor, we usually
don't care in which direction

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.440
they're traveling.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.350
So the first simplification
that we will do

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.812
is get rid of any sort
of angular dependence,

00:04:10.812 --> 00:04:12.520
getting rid of two of
the seven variables

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.995
that we're dealing with here.

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:15.370
So all these
variables right here

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.170
will be dependent on angle.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.670
And all these
variables right here

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.930
will be angularly independent.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.590
So there'll be some
corresponding capital

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.260
N, or number of neutrons as
a function of r, E, and t.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.320
We'll call this Flux.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.340
We'll call this Number.

00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:47.730
There's going to be a
number of cross sections

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.897
that we need to worry about.

00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:53.820
So we'll refer to little
sigma as a function of energy,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:03.390
as our micro-cross-section,
and big sigma of E

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.220
as a macroscopic cross-section.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.355
Then you want to remember the
relation between these two.

00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:17.840
AUDIENCE: Solid angle?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.660
MICHAEL SHORT: The
solid angle, not quite.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.598
That's, let's see.

00:05:22.598 --> 00:05:24.140
There's a difference
between-- and so

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.030
what these physically
mean is little sigma

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.977
means the probability of
interaction with one particle.

00:05:28.977 --> 00:05:30.560
And this is just the
total probability

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.893
of interaction with all the
particles that may be there.

00:05:32.893 --> 00:05:33.748
So yeah, Chris?

00:05:33.748 --> 00:05:34.790
AUDIENCE: Number density?

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.550
MICHAEL SHORT: There's
number density.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.770
Already we have another
variable conflict.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.930
How do we want to resolve this?

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.440
Let's see.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.962
We'll have to change
the symbol somehow.

00:05:48.962 --> 00:05:52.195
Let's make it cursive.

00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:53.320
Don't know what else to do.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.195
I don't want to give it
a number other than n

00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:57.030
since we're talking
about neutrons,

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.155
or that right here it's
going to be number density.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.350
And in the end, we're worried
about some sort of reaction

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.150
rate, which is always
going to equal some flux,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.470
or let's just stick with some
angularly dependent flux,

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:23.330
that r, E omega t,
times some cross-section

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.800
as a function of energy.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.460
And it's these
reaction rates that

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.690
are the rates of gains
and losses of neutrons

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.300
out of this volume, out
of this little angle,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.970
out of this energy group,
and out of that space,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.600
or into that volume
energy group and space.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.780
So let's see, other terms
that we'll want to define

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.000
include nu, like last time.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.280
We'll call this
neutron multiplication.

00:06:56.523 --> 00:06:57.940
In other words,
this is the number

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.690
of neutrons made on average
during each fission event.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.790
And we give it energy
dependence because as we

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.170
saw on the Janis libraries
on Friday, I think it was.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.320
What's today, Tuesday?

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.690
I don't even know anymore.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.960
I think as we saw on Friday,
that depends on energy

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.615
for the higher energy levels.

00:07:15.615 --> 00:07:19.550
And there's also
going to be some Kai

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:30.010
spectrum, or some
neutron birth spectrum,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.130
which tells you the average
energy at which neutrons

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.180
are born from fission.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.980
So regardless of what energy
goes in to cause the fission,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.470
there's some
probability distribution

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.280
of a neutron being born
at a certain energy.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:53.910
And it looks something like
this, where that's about 1 MeV.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.160
That's about 10 MeV.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.158
And that average right
there is around 2 MeV.

00:08:00.158 --> 00:08:01.950
And so it's important
to note that neutrons

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.360
are born at different energies.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.850
Because we want to track
every single possible dE

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.340
throughout this
control volume, which

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.400
we'll also call a reactor.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.930
Let's see, what other
terms will we need to know?

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.520
The different types
of cross sections,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.320
or the different
interactions that neutrons

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.520
can have with matter.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.645
What are some of the ones
that we had talked about?

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.590
What can neutrons do
when they run into stuff?

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.350
AUDIENCE: Scatter.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.683
MICHAEL SHORT: They can scatter.

00:08:27.683 --> 00:08:31.111
So there's going to be some
scattering cross-section.

00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:35.409
And when they scatter,
the important part

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.159
here is they're going
to change in energy.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.610
What else can they do?

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.110
Yeah?

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.820
AUDIENCE: Absorbed.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.820
MICHAEL SHORT: They
can be absorbed.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.640
So we'll have some
sigma absorption.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.210
What are some of the various
things that can happen

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.395
when a neutron is absorbed?

00:09:02.196 --> 00:09:03.200
AUDIENCE: Fission.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.810
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, so
one of them is fission.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.656
What are some of the other ones?

00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:15.406
AUDIENCE: Capture.

00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:16.590
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep, capture.

00:09:23.232 --> 00:09:25.190
What were some of the
ones that we talked about

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.740
during the Chadwick paper?

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.180
AUDIENCE: Neutron [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.260
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
so there can be some--

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:38.710
we'll call it n,in, which means
one neutron goes in, i neutrons

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:47.420
come out, so 1 to
i neutrons, sure.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.100
Anything else?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.935
Encompassed in absorption?

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.385
Well when we refer to scatter
here, what type of scattering

00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:03.260
are we talking about?

00:10:07.688 --> 00:10:09.660
AUDIENCE: Compton's scatter?

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.385
MICHAEL SHORT:
Compton's for photons.

00:10:11.385 --> 00:10:13.260
It's OK.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.420
Was it elastic or
inelastic scattering?

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.170
AUDIENCE: Elastic.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.640
MICHAEL SHORT:
Elastic scattering.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.430
So another thing you could call
an absorption event, depending

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:30.150
on what bin you put things
in, is inelastic scattering,

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.590
which is that kind of--

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.110
we call it scattering
because one neutron goes in,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.610
one neutron comes out.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.510
But in reality, you have
a compound nucleus forming

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.920
and a neutron emitted from
a different energy level.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.760
So it doesn't follow the
simple ballistic laws of,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.850
and kinematic laws of
inelastic scattering.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.050
What else can neutrons do?

00:10:52.092 --> 00:10:54.050
Now we're getting into
the real esoteric stuff.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.883
But I want to see if
you guys have any idea.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.640
Did you know that
neutrons can decay?

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.080
A low neutron is actually
not a stable particle.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.130
If you look up on the
Kyrie table of nuclides,

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.460
it's got a half
life of 12 minutes.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.170
So if you happen
to be able to have

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.570
neutrons in a bottle or
something, which we actually

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.640
can do.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.320
There's centers for
ultra-cold neutrons and atoms.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.933
There's one at North Carolina
State where they actually cool

00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:27.350
down neutrons to cryogenic
temperatures to the point where

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.150
they can actually confine them.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.540
They only live on
average 12 minutes.

00:11:37.212 --> 00:11:38.920
And then there would
also be what we call

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.810
a neutron-neutron interactions.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.330
There is a finite,
non-zero but very small

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.870
probability that neutrons
can hit other neutrons.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.970
But the mean-free path for
these is on the order of 10

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.495
to the 8th centimeters.

00:11:59.495 --> 00:12:01.370
So this is not something
we have to consider.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.350
But it's interesting to
know that yes, neutrons

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.090
can run into other neutrons.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.280
And these sorts of things
have been measured.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.680
We won't have to
worry about this.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.810
We won't have to worry
about neutron decay.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.060
But it's interesting to note
that a low neutron is not

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.460
a stable particle.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.000
It will spontaneously
undergo beta decay,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.520
into a proton and an electron.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.510
Pretty neat, huh?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:30.220
Anyway, if we sum up all
these possible interactions,

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.340
we have one other
cross-section, which

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.330
we're going to call the total
cross-section, the probability

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.600
of absolutely any
interaction occurring at all.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.260
Because any sort of
interaction of that neutron

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.520
is going to cause removal from
this group of energy position,

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.450
angle, location, whatever.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.570
Whether it's absorption, or
fission, or elastic scattering,

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.300
or inelastic scattering,
any sort of event--

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.870
except for forward scattering,
which means nothing happens--

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.530
is going to result in this
neutron either leaving

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.160
the volume.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.100
So it might scatter out
of our little volume.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.180
Or it might change direction,
scatter out of our d-omega.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.080
Or it will lose
some energy, or gain

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.920
some energy, in some cases,
leaving our little dE, which

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.057
is what we're trying to track.

00:13:23.057 --> 00:13:24.640
Because we're actually
tracking what's

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.580
the population of neutrons
in this little dE,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.210
in this direction, in this
position, at this time.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.760
And supposedly if we
know this term fully,

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.200
we can solve for
all the neutrons

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.408
everywhere, anywhere in the
reactor with full information.

00:13:38.408 --> 00:13:40.200
So what we'll spend
the rest of today doing

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.300
is figuring out what are all the
possible gain and loss terms.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.940
So let's start just putting them
out physically, or in words.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.740
And then we'll put them to math.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.160
So what are some of the
ways in which neutrons

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.630
can enter our little group
of volume, angle, and energy?

00:14:01.414 --> 00:14:04.940
How are neutrons created?

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.580
Yeah, Luke?

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.830
AUDIENCE: From fission,
or a neutron emission.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.010
MICHAEL SHORT: From fission,
yeah, so that's one big source.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.650
So we'll call this a gains.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.550
This is a losses.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.900
And you said a neutron source.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.942
Can you be more specific?

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:22.260
AUDIENCE: A neutron
emission, like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:29.190
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, so we'll
say n,in reactions, right?

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.170
OK, cool.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.505
How else can we gain neutrons?

00:14:37.164 --> 00:14:38.600
AUDIENCE: Fusion?

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.800
MICHAEL SHORT: Fusion?

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.390
OK.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.010
That is true.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.690
Although fusion
reactors don't really

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.380
operate on the principle of
neutron criticality, or neutron

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.312
balance.

00:14:49.312 --> 00:14:50.770
So this discussion
for now is going

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.310
to be limited to
fission reactors.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.690
But yeah, good point.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.540
Fusion does make neutrons.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.080
What else?

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.710
Yeah?

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:07.225
AUDIENCE: They could enter from
one of the adjacent volume?

00:15:07.225 --> 00:15:09.600
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, they
could come from somewhere else,

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.620
right?

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.415
Let's just call that
an external source.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.300
In the books and
in your reading,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.750
you'll just see them
treat this external source

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:28.900
as some variable s
of r, E, omega, t.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.700
So you'll just see this
treated as s, a source,

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.990
with no further explanation.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.490
It's like, oh, math
says that there

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.845
could be external sources.

00:15:39.845 --> 00:15:41.970
But I want to tell you
where they really come from.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.190
Most reactors
nowadays don't just

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.860
start up when you throw a
bunch of uranium into a pool

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.510
and pull out the control rods.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.580
You actually have to stick in--

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.530
if this is your little
reactor right here--

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.630
you actually have to stick in
a little piece of californium--

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.630
I think the isotope is 252--

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.080
as what we call a
kickstarter source.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:09.120
So californium is made mostly
in the HFIR, or the High Flux

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.980
Isotope Reactor, at the Oakridge
National Lab in Tennessee,

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.980
where they have a really,
really high power reactor.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.780
It's 85 megawatts.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.050
It's about that big
around and this tall.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.490
It's really, really small.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.580
For reference, that's about
the size of the MIT reactor,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.530
except our reactor's
6 megawatts.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.510
Theirs is 85 megawatts.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.690
And it's designed to be
an incredibly high flux,

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.630
to go by neutron capture, and
neutron capture reactions,

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:41.430
to build up californium
252, which is spontaneously

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.110
giving off neutrons like crazy.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.800
And this right here, that's
your external source.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.790
And this helps get
reactors going.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.560
Because you can
either very slowly

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.690
wait for the fission
reaction to build up

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.950
in a controlled manner.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.620
Or you can give it a kick in
the pants and get it going.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.960
This HFIR reactor
is pretty cool.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.750
Like I said, it's 85 megawatts.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.940
And it's about as
dense as it can get.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.880
The fuel is actually made by
explosively bonding sheets

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.190
of uranium in a certain sort of
semi-cylindrical configuration.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.369
And it produces so much
decay heat in so little space

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.230
that if it were to lose
cooling, the reactor

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.206
would melt in 8 seconds.

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.530
You usually have
days or so before

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.200
that happens in a
conventional reactor

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.840
because the power density
just isn't that high.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.970
So you can actually
see down to the tank

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.090
that contains HFIR if you go
for a tour at Oakridge National

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:34.870
Lab.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.630
And it's way down below this
gigantic like, not quite

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.883
Olympic, but getting
there sized pool of water,

00:17:40.883 --> 00:17:42.550
just to make sure
that there is adequate

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.910
cooling for this thing.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.250
It's intense.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.380
But that's just a notice
that these external sources,

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.520
these are real things that
we use in power reactors

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.960
to get them going.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.750
What are some other ways
that one could make neutrons,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.170
or that neutrons could
enter into our energy group?

00:18:04.515 --> 00:18:06.640
And the silence is expected
because this is usually

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.490
the hardest part of
developing this equation.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.720
And I want to introduce it.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.466
Yeah, Luke?

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:13.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
scattering, too.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.465
MICHAEL SHORT:
That's exactly it.

00:18:14.465 --> 00:18:15.580
They can scatter in.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.910
So when we develop this
neutron transport equation,

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.370
we're not just
tracking the neutrons

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:25.450
in this little energy group dE,
direction, d-omega, and volume

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:26.290
dV.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.320
You actually have to know what's
the population of neutrons

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.030
in every single group.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.210
Because you might have a neutron
at a higher energy level that

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:40.245
undergoes scattering from
some different energy,

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:43.650
E-prime into our energy group.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:49.030
So continuing with our
gigantic list of variables,

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.730
we're going to call E
is, we'll say r energy.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.408
And this vector omega
is our direction,

00:18:57.408 --> 00:18:58.575
the one that we're tracking.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.500
And E-prime is going to
be some other energy.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.260
And omega-vector-prime is
going to be some coming

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.670
from some other direction.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.010
And like Luke said,
this is what we

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:30.740
would refer to as in-scattering,
which means some neutron comes,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.960
that was going in a
different direction, that

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.000
did have a different
energy, and has now

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.832
entered into the single
group that we're tracking.

00:19:37.832 --> 00:19:40.040
Eventually we're going to
integrate over all energies

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.270
to track all energy groups.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.960
So that's where we're going.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.530
And there's one more term that
I want to introduce right now.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.330
It's what's called
the scattering kernel.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.440
Don't ask me why
it's called kernel.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.400
But this is just the terminology
I want you guys to get used to.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.370
And there's going to be some
sort of probability function

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.210
where a neutron starts off at
a different energy, E-prime,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.170
and in a different
direction, omega-prime.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:17.920
And it enters into our group
energy E and direction omega.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.430
Right now we'll leave it as
a highly general function.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.990
What we're going to find
later is there's just

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.440
some sort of simple line to it.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.140
If you guys remember, if
some neutron starts off,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:37.170
let's see, probability of
entering into some energy

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.190
group.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.110
If you notice, if you
remember from last time,

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.650
the neutron, when it undergoes
any sort of scattering

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.460
reaction, can end
up with any energy

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:53.280
between its original energy
for the case of theta equals 0,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.710
and this parameter, alpha
energy, for the case theta

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:01.220
equals pi, where
alpha is A minus 1,

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.870
over A plus 1 squared,
where A is the atomic mass.

00:21:09.927 --> 00:21:12.010
You guys remember this
from back in the Q equation

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.320
days, when we were
finding out what's

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.320
the probability that a neutron
coming in with energy E

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.580
ends up at any energy E-prime?

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.480
Actually I'll just write this
as the scattering kernel.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.120
What it ends up looking
like, in most cases,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.260
is just a flat line.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.550
There's an equal probability of
the neutron ending up anywhere

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.070
between energy E and
anywhere between energy

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.960
alpha-E. It's actually a
pretty simple function.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.517
It's just a constant value
here and 0 everywhere else.

00:21:44.517 --> 00:21:46.100
What that means is
that if, let's say,

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.890
a neutron hits a uranium
atom, there is no way in hell

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.050
that it can transfer
all of its energy

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:56.720
to a uranium atom because
of conservation of energy

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.250
and momentum, like we've
been harping on for kind

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.150
of this whole class.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.940
What's the only time that
this alpha-E could actually

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.110
extend all the way to 0?

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.790
What case would that be?

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:14.838
AUDIENCE: You're
hitting another neutron.

00:22:14.838 --> 00:22:17.047
MICHAEL SHORT: You're hitting
another neutron, which,

00:22:17.047 --> 00:22:18.660
as we said, is a
very rare event.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.770
That is true.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:21.312
Or what else could
you be hitting?

00:22:21.312 --> 00:22:22.790
AUDIENCE: A proton?

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.930
MICHAEL SHORT: A proton,
hydrogen. That's right.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.110
So it can only be,
let's say you can only

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.690
have the probability of
the neutron ending up

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:39.130
with any energy for the case
of hydrogen. Incidentally,

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.260
this is why we fill
light water reactors

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.420
with hydrogen.
The goal is to get

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.080
the neutrons as slow as
possible as quick as possible.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.060
Interesting sentence
to say there, right?

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.420
We want the neutrons to be
as low energy as possible

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.340
as rapidly as possible.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.770
And the best way to do
that is to fill the reactor

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.070
with hydrogen because then any
collision could, in theory, get

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.260
the neutron down to zero energy.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.680
Without water, or something
with the same mass as a neutron,

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.600
like another neutron,
there is no way

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.688
that that neutron can
slow down by very much.

00:23:11.688 --> 00:23:13.230
So even though we're
going to keep it

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.260
as this generalized function,
note that in reality it's

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.270
this pretty simple function.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.190
It changes a little
bit, as there

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:24.030
can be a forward scattering
bias for some neutron reactions.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.000
But we are not going to
deal with that this year.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.890
You will deal with that
next year in 22.05.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.840
So I've been saying a
lot, oh, well, we're

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.423
not going to go into this topic
because you're going to see it

00:23:35.423 --> 00:23:37.220
in 22.02, which is quantum.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.050
Now I switched
gears to say, we're

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.630
not going to go into the
way this function changes

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.940
because you'll see it
next year in 22.05,

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.500
which is neutron physics.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.490
But for now I want you
to be prepared for 22.05.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.315
So we'll put on in-scattering
as one of our gains.

00:23:56.702 --> 00:23:58.660
There's a last one I want
to make you aware of.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.143
We very briefly touched upon it.

00:24:00.143 --> 00:24:02.560
But I wouldn't be surprised
if no one remembers because it

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.935
was for like 10 seconds.

00:24:04.935 --> 00:24:06.310
It's what's called
photo fission.

00:24:10.617 --> 00:24:13.200
What this means is you have some
reaction that would, in comes

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.190
a gamma, and out goes fission.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:22.310
This actually does start to
happen around 3 or 4 MeV,

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.030
for isotopes like uranium 235.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.800
And in our reactor, whatever
shape we decide it is,

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.950
there are tons of gamma rays
flying about in all directions

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.020
at very high energy.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.770
Does anyone remember
where they come from?

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.930
Anyone remember the
fission timeline

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.760
that we drew on Friday?

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.240
So what we said
there was right away,

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.440
let's say fission happens.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.520
And almost instantly, you
get your fission product one

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.750
and fission product two.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.100
And they move around
for a little while.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.925
And then some of them
will emit some neutrons.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:13.110
And then some of them will
start to emit gamma rays, betas,

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:19.160
and whatever else they're
going to do until they finally

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.370
lose all their kinetic energy
and stop in the surrounding

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.330
fuel, creating the heat that
actually powers the turbine

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.210
and make steam to
make electricity.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.400
And so it's from these
gammas, as well as

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.150
any of the gammas from the
decay products of the fission

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.990
products that lead to a huge
flux of gamma rays firing out

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.640
from all sides in the reactor.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.807
That's one of the main
things that you actually have

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:44.750
to shield in a nuclear reactor.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.570
Since we talked about all
sorts of different shielding,

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.450
and all sorts of ways that
you have to shield things,

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.630
you know from seeing the MIT
reactor-- which you all did--

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.270
that there's like six
feet of lead and concrete

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.100
shielding around the reactor.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.470
It's not there to shield
the alphas and the betas,

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.090
because those don't really
make it out of the water.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.750
It's not there to shield
the soft X-rays that betas

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.120
make from bremsstrahlung.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.630
It's also not there
to shield the neutrons

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.380
because the neutrons
don't really get out.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.300
They bounce around, or
get absorbed in the water,

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.840
or the fuel, the reflector.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.820
It's there to shield the
high-energy gamma rays.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.200
Because the only
thing that stops

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.750
high energy gamma
rays is lots of mass

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.480
in between the source and you.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.350
So we know there's tons
of gammas all about.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:36.020
So let's say there's also going
to be some gamma ray flux.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.510
There'll be some
gamma ray energy.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.740
And there'll be some
cross-section for photo fission

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:48.240
as a function of the incoming
gamma ray energy spectrum.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.660
Now I'm adding terms to the ones
that you'll see in the reading

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.350
because drawing them out in math
is actually fairly instructive.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.810
They all follow
the same pattern.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.560
So instead of just
showing you one of each

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.715
and saying memorize, we'll
develop a whole lot of these.

00:27:01.715 --> 00:27:03.090
And you'll find
out that they all

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.660
actually look almost the same.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.257
Can anyone else think of any
possible gains of neutrons?

00:27:11.257 --> 00:27:12.590
Where else could they come from?

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.340
Yeah?

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.407
AUDIENCE: Neutron birth
spectrum, is that?

00:27:18.407 --> 00:27:20.240
MICHAEL SHORT: So the
neutron birth spectrum

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.280
is included in fission.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.950
So our nu is in there.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.480
Our chi of E is in there.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.300
And that's a nu of E.
That's all accounted

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.440
for in the fission term.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.813
And we'll see how we put
that together to math.

00:27:32.813 --> 00:27:34.730
And if no one else has
any ideas, that's good.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.530
Because neither do I.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.630
Now what about the lost terms?

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.700
There aren't too many
of these, as long

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.260
as you lump them correctly.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.170
So what sort of
ways could neutrons

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.608
be lost from our energy group?

00:27:48.608 --> 00:27:49.480
Yep?

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.910
AUDIENCE: Scatter out.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.112
MICHAEL SHORT: Scatter out, yep.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.700
They can undergo any kind
of scattering reaction.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.220
And they will probably
change direction and energy.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.920
What else?

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.080
Well, we've got to list up on
the board right there, right?

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:13.930
Capture, fission,
because in order

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:19.340
to undergo a vision you
actually have to lose a neutron,

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.810
and so on, and so on, and so on.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:25.360
What I want to do to
simplify things is this.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:33.130
It's a lot simpler just to
track the total cross-section,

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.930
the probability
of any interaction

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.570
at all whatsoever,
because any interaction

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.260
will cause the neutron to
either change energy and angle,

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.860
or disappear, even if it
makes some other ones.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:49.830
So we can simplify this to just
the total cross-section term.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.850
And there's only one
other way that neutrons

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:56.428
can leave our energy
angle and volume group.

00:28:56.428 --> 00:28:57.220
What would that be?

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:04.690
So any reaction takes
care of energy and angle.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.902
What about volume?

00:29:06.902 --> 00:29:08.610
How do neutrons leave
the control volume?

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.740
It's simpler than it may sound.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.820
They just go.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.050
They just move.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.990
The neutrons are
always moving, right?

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.990
We'll call that leakage.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:30.380
Because every neutron's got a
speed, like we showed up here,

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.720
where the flux of
neutrons, the number

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.200
of neutrons moving through
some surface per second,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.380
is just their velocity times
the number that are there.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.880
For there to be a
neutron flux there

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.790
has to be a velocity, which
means the neutrons are moving.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.670
So the neutrons, even without
undergoing any reaction,

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.353
could just move out
of our control volume.

00:29:49.353 --> 00:29:50.270
And then they're gone.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.050
And that's all there is
for gain and loss terms.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:00.210
So let's see if we can
do this all on one board.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:04.710
I want to start putting this
table right here into math

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.090
that we'll be able to abstract,
simplify, and then solve,

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.590
but not today, not solve today.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.300
So if we want to
track the change

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:21.270
in the number of neutrons
as a function of time,

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.240
let's start writing
down the gain terms.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.490
So how do we describe
the number of neutrons

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.012
produced from fission?

00:30:30.012 --> 00:30:31.720
What sort of terms do
we have to include?

00:30:35.027 --> 00:30:37.360
And Jared started kicking us
off, so what would you say?

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.940
AUDIENCE: Neutron birth?

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.030
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep, so the
neutron birth spectrum,

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.510
there's going to be some
probability that a neutron is

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.840
born in our energy
group E. Because we're

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.580
tracking how many neutrons are
in our little dE energy group.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:59.320
What else matters
in terms of fission?

00:31:02.645 --> 00:31:04.550
AUDIENCE: Number of fissions?

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.270
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
number of fissions.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.020
So if we want to write
number of fissions,

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.930
we have to write that
as a reaction rate.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.910
So let's take those
two terms right there.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:18.230
So we'll have sigma fission.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:22.610
In this case, we're going
to write E-prime times flux

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:29.590
of r E-prime, omega-prime, t.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:31.810
Why did I write E
and omega prime here?

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.930
Just from a physical reason.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:37.110
Yeah?

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.950
AUDIENCE: So you're going to
be coming from another energy

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:39.870
group.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.340
MICHAEL SHORT: Precisely.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:41.910
That's right.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.750
So the neutrons are going to be
produced from some other energy

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:46.500
group.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.380
For example, the fission
birth spectrum right here

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.603
starts out--

00:31:50.603 --> 00:31:51.270
where did it go?

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:54.150
I knew I drew it
somewhere-- at one MeV.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:57.420
But most of the neutrons
that cause fission to happen

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.210
are way down below 1 eV.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.400
So it's different
energy neutrons

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.520
that cause neutrons to be
born in our energy group.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.680
That's why we're using
E-prime and not E.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.160
It's some other energy group.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.810
And so we also have to account
for all possible other energy

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:17.502
groups.

00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:19.210
So if we want to write
this, right, we'll

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:28.010
say this could be as low as
0 eV, to our maximum energy.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:35.980
And there's going to be some
d-omega-prime, dE-prime, dV.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:41.920
We'll also have to account
for all possible angles

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:47.770
and integrate over
our entire volume.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.700
It's going to look ugly
quick, but it's all

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.860
going to be understandable.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.360
So what this says
is that we have

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.360
to account for the
reaction rate of fission

00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.650
from all other energy
neutrons inside our volume

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.660
from other energies
and other angles,

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.480
and account for every
other possible energy.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.630
Because they can all
make fission happen.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.000
What else is missing in terms
of describing the number

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.051
of neutrons made from fission?

00:33:14.051 --> 00:33:15.426
AUDIENCE: Neutron
multiplication.

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:17.009
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
there's the number

00:33:17.009 --> 00:33:18.940
of neutrons made per fission.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.690
So we have to put in our
neutron multiplication factor.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.040
And in this case, normalize--

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.910
I think someone had mentioned
solid angle-- we normalize over

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.570
all possible angles with
an over 4 pi in there.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:35.460
And this right here
is the fission term.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.490
So this tells us the
number of neutrons

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.460
gained in terms of
a reaction rate,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:44.750
times the number of neutrons
for each of those reactions,

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.430
times the probability
that there just

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.140
happened to be born
in the energy group

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.900
that we're tracking.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:54.380
So is there any term here
that's unclear to folks?

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.010
Yeah?

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.110
AUDIENCE: So what's the lower
bound on the first integral?

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.652
MICHAEL SHORT: On
the first integral?

00:33:58.652 --> 00:33:59.570
That 0 electron volts.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.308
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:34:00.308 --> 00:34:01.850
MICHAEL SHORT:
Because supposedly you

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.490
could have a neutron
at 0 eV, which

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.380
has a very high cross-section.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.750
So it should probably
induce fission.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.929
In reality, there might be some
actual minimum temperature.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:14.630
But there is a
non-zero probability

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.708
that you could have
a neutron at rest.

00:34:16.708 --> 00:34:17.750
It's just not very large.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.770
AUDIENCE: And the top bound?

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.728
MICHAEL SHORT: The top
bound as E max, whatever

00:34:20.728 --> 00:34:22.760
your maximum neutron energy is.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:28.670
This is usually around 10 MeV,
for most fission reactors.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:33.600
That E max is going to be this
point right here, the highest

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.750
energy at which neutrons
can be born by any process.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.150
And so this term
right here is going

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:45.762
to serve as a template for all
the other gain and loss terms.

00:34:45.762 --> 00:34:47.679
So I think this is the
hardest one that we had

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.630
to develop from the beginning.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:54.230
Now let's develop the
term for, let's just

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.030
go with external
sources, pretty easy.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.065
There's going to be some
source making neutrons.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.900
It's something that
you would just impose.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.660
Like say, all right, I have a
californium source giving off

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.902
this many neutrons.

00:35:11.902 --> 00:35:14.110
Well then you know how many
neutrons it's giving off.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:15.070
And that one's done.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.640
That's easy.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.490
So we've done fission.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.460
We've done external.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:28.190
Now that we've done fission
let's tackle photo fission.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.790
So what would be photo fission
cross-section look like?

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.293
It's going to look
awfully similar.

00:35:42.293 --> 00:35:43.710
So what sort of
things do you need

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.168
to know if it's a
fission reaction?

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.710
Well, what do we have up here?

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:52.960
Just start reading things off.

00:35:56.392 --> 00:35:57.100
I heard a murmur.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:57.810
What was that?

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] flux.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.760
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
so you're going

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.900
to have to have some flux.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:07.310
In this case, we want to know
what's the flux of gamma rays

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.700
because photo fission
starts off with a gamma,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.390
then ends up with a fission.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.600
And it's also going
to be in our volume.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.110
It's going to matter what the
energy of those gammas is.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:22.250
They'll all be traveling in
some direction at some time.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:25.330
What else do we need?

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.452
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the 4 pi [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:28.910
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, if we're going

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:34.010
to be going over all
angles, you need the 4 pi.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.550
What else?

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:41.174
Do we have a reaction rate yet?

00:36:41.174 --> 00:36:42.020
AUDIENCE: No.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.452
MICHAEL SHORT: No,
well what's missing?

00:36:44.452 --> 00:36:46.323
AUDIENCE: The cross-section.

00:36:46.323 --> 00:36:47.490
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.280
We need a cross-section.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.120
And in this case,
instead of just fission,

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.750
or neutron fission, we'll
put in the gamma fission

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.560
cross-section.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.100
And so now we have a reaction
rate for a single reaction.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.670
We've got to integrate
over all of our gamma ray

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:10.710
energies, over all
angles, over our volume.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:26.780
What else is missing besides
our d-omega, dE gamma, d-Volume.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.420
It should look awfully similar
because the terms are basically

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.743
exactly the same, with just
different cross sections

00:37:31.743 --> 00:37:32.660
and energies in there.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.600
So what's missing between the
photo fission and the neutron

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.006
fission one?

00:37:37.006 --> 00:37:38.697
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:38.697 --> 00:37:41.030
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure, there
might be some different birth

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.736
spectrum for gammas.

00:37:43.736 --> 00:37:45.800
And there might be some
different multiplication

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.570
factor for gammas between
neutron fission and photo

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:50.250
fission.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.320
But these terms should
look exactly the same

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.350
because in every case you're
looking at some reaction

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.770
rate between either the neutrons
and fission or the gamma

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.150
and fission.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.670
And you need to know at
what energy they're born,

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.640
how many are made,
all the angles,

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.600
and integrate overall the
variables that we care about.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.920
And this is part of why I'm
adding these extra terms

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.800
because they end up looking
all exactly the same.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.280
It's the integral of a
reaction rate times some stuff.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.230
That's all that every single one
of these terms is going to be.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.050
So we've got photo fission.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:26.910
Now let's tackle in-scattering.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.830
So how do we
represent scattering?

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.160
In the same way that we
represented fission, what do we

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.130
start with inside the integral?

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.130
AUDIENCE: Reaction rate?

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:40.900
MICHAEL SHORT:
Reaction rate, yes.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.845
So we're going to have some
scattering cross-section.

00:38:44.845 --> 00:38:46.220
And if it's in
the scattering, it

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.710
means it's coming from a
different energy, hence

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.177
the prime.

00:38:50.177 --> 00:38:51.010
We'll have our flux.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.830
And here's where we're going to
bring in our scattering kernel.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.710
Because there's some
probability that the neutron

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.200
scatters in from
a different group.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:21.505
And then we'll have our
d-omega, dE-prime, dV.

00:39:21.505 --> 00:39:22.380
Is this complete yet?

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:32.700
We've now accounted for
one other energy, E-prime.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.300
Now how do we account for
all possible other energies

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.213
scattering into
our energy group?

00:39:37.213 --> 00:39:38.140
AUDIENCE: Integrals.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.680
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
again, same integrals.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:45.470
We integrate over all
possible energies,

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:51.190
over all possible angles,
and over our volume.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.350
Hopefully these terms
are looking very similar.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.820
In every case it's a volume,
angle, energy integral

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.365
of a reaction rate.

00:39:59.365 --> 00:40:01.990
And all that's saying is there's
some rate that these reactions

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.770
are occurring, which is either
a gain rate or a loss rate.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.080
We integrate over whatever
volume, energy, and angle

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.800
we're tracking.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.840
And that's all there is to it.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.463
So we've got in-scattering.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.722
Now let's tackle
the n,in reactions.

00:40:20.722 --> 00:40:22.680
There's only going to be
one little difference.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.763
But I want you guys to
tell me what sort of things

00:40:24.763 --> 00:40:27.030
are going to be the same
as all the other terms

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.780
that we have here.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.760
So what do we start off
with inside the integral?

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760
AUDIENCE: Reaction rate.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.052
MICHAEL SHORT: A reaction rate.

00:40:37.052 --> 00:40:38.610
And how do we write that?

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:39.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.505
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
a cross-section,

00:40:45.505 --> 00:40:47.130
there's going to be
some cross-section,

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:53.000
for, let's call it n,in reaction
as a function of energy,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.710
times a flux.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:02.970
There'll be our normal
integrated over all angles,

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:06.940
all energies, and our volume.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.200
So we have a reaction rate.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.290
What do we have to then
integrate that reaction right

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:12.910
over to get all the neutrons in?

00:41:16.375 --> 00:41:19.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
same things.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:22.400
MICHAEL SHORT: Same things
as everything else, exactly.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.050
Integrate over all
possible energies,

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.880
integrate over all
possible angles,

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.630
integrate over our volume,
looks quite similar.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:36.260
The only thing we haven't dealt
with is this i term right here.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:45.790
Because there can be, there are
actually n,2n reactions, n,3n,

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:49.560
n,4n, and so on.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.070
So there are probabilities
that, let's say

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:55.130
you, in goes 1 neutron,
out comes 3 neutrons.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:56.810
But no fission
actually happened.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.760
You just blast a
few of them out.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:04.775
So I think all we'd really have
to do is sum over i equals 1.

00:42:04.775 --> 00:42:07.715
Oh, I'm sorry, i equals
2, because a neutron

00:42:07.715 --> 00:42:09.590
going in and then the
same neutron going out,

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.000
that's just scattering.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.050
And what would be the maximum?

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.440
Probably 4.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.870
Because the probability
of an increasing i

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:24.400
or more neutrons coming out
gets lower and lower as you go.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.640
In fact, these reactions
don't even turn on until--

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.260
the n,2n reaction turns
on and around like 1 MeV.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.070
This one turns on and
around like 5 MeV.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:37.930
This one turns on
at like 12 MeV.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:42.410
I was just looking up these
cross-sections before class.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.010
So if you have a reaction
that doesn't happen

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.410
beyond your highest
neutron energy,

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.655
you probably don't
need to worry about it.

00:42:49.655 --> 00:42:52.030
But the reason I had us write
all these extra equations--

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:55.510
and I think that the t-shirt
for this department needs some

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.830
updating to include
these extra terms--

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.100
is because they're
all the same term.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.980
It is in every case,
it's an integral

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:13.860
over all of our stuff
of a reaction rate,

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:18.090
d-stuff, times a multiplier.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.900
Every single term
in this equation

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.360
follows the exact same pattern.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.870
So what I hope, and I would
expect out of you guys,

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.790
is that if I were to
give you this table

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.250
of possible reactions,
you would be

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:39.510
able to recreate this neutron
transport equation using

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:42.030
this template to know that
every single reaction is just

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:45.450
multiplier, times integral
of stuff of a reaction rate,

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:49.890
d-stuff, where the reaction rate
is just a cross-section times

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:51.450
a flux.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:54.500
That's all there is to it.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.450
Not bad when you see
that everything follows

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:58.740
the same pattern, right?

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.080
That's the basis behind most
of the hideous equations

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.940
that you see in all
of physics everywhere,

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.700
is if there are additive
or subtractive terms,

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.363
they'd better be
in the same units.

00:44:07.363 --> 00:44:09.030
And so they're going
to follow some sort

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:11.430
of a similar template.

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:14.380
Not too scary when you
think of it that way.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.335
So let's now come up
with the loss terms.

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.650
I should have planned
these boards better.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.350
Keep these ones here
so we keep a template.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:28.890
And we'll have a
minus, well, how

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:35.770
do we write the anything
reaction using this template?

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.250
How many neutrons
undergo a reaction

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.000
when one neutron
undergoes a reaction?

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:48.982
Yeah, 1.

00:44:48.982 --> 00:44:49.940
So our multiplier is 1.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.630
We don't have to worry about it.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.440
We have our integral of stuff.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:58.190
So we'll have to integrate over
all possible volumes, angles,

00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:59.540
and energy.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.485
And what's on the inside?

00:45:02.485 --> 00:45:05.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
total cross-section.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.220
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
total cross-section

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:22.460
as a function of energy times
the flux, d-stuff to save time.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.100
So don't worry, even though
the boards are laid out funny,

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.933
on the pictures of the
blackboard that we'll

00:45:26.933 --> 00:45:29.308
put on the Stellar site, I'll
Photoshop these and arrange

00:45:29.308 --> 00:45:30.850
them so that they're
all in sequence.

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.180
And you can see everything.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.390
And then there's the
last term to account for.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:37.540
That's the leakage term.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.200
This one is a little different.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.970
It's the only one that's
a little different.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.750
And in this case, we're going
to say that our little volume

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:53.140
element also has
a surface to it.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.480
And if the neutrons
leave the surface,

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.470
then they leave the volume.

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:05.770
So in this case, we'll have a
surface integral of our neutron

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:10.860
flux, say our neutron flux dS.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.160
Because there's no reaction
happening when neutrons just

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.840
move, right.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.520
They just go.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:23.652
And so, well, we'd also have to
multiply by our normal vector.

00:46:23.652 --> 00:46:25.110
Because every flux
is going to have

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.210
a certain number of neutrons
moving in a certain direction.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:31.860
Let's say we were tracking
the flow of neutrons

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.310
through this surface right here.

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:42.830
And if we had a flux going
in exactly this direction,

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:47.600
through this surface, and
this is the normal vector,

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.800
in this case, flux,
which is a vector

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.950
dotted with the normal
vector, is just the flux.

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.200
Which is to say that if the
flux and the normal vector

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.080
are aligned in the same way,
then every neutron going

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.740
through the surface is tracked
as going through the surface.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.760
To take the opposite example,
what about the situation where

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:15.120
you have a surface here and you
have a mono-directional flux

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.340
of neutrons in this direction.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.320
And that is your surface normal.

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:28.510
What does the flux dotted
with the surface normal vector

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.280
equal?

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:35.840
0, it's just a dot product
between the direction

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.410
that your neutrons are moving
and the normal vector saying,

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:41.390
does it go out of
the surface at all?

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:45.990
So for these two limiting cases,
in this case, the fluxes just

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:47.540
let's say, what
is it, the number

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:49.820
of neutrons leaving the
surface is the flux.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.830
In this case, no neutrons
leave the surface

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:54.680
because they're not actually
going through the surface.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.820
It's a good time to mention,
again, that these units of flux

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:03.590
are in neutrons per centimeter
squared per second, which

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.690
is to say the number
of particles traveling

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:09.655
through this area in centimeter
squared every second.

00:48:09.655 --> 00:48:11.030
I know we've gone
over it before,

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:13.622
but I want you to keep
these units in mind.

00:48:13.622 --> 00:48:15.830
Because now they actually
have a little more physical

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:18.010
significance.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:22.590
And that's why we have this
flux times normal vector dS.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.210
That describes the
number of neutrons

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.050
that get through the surface.

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:30.730
The last thing we'll do, because
everything else is a volume

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.850
integral, we want this to be a
volume integral because we're

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:35.710
going to simplify this
in terms of getting

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.157
rid of all the volume stuff.

00:48:37.157 --> 00:48:39.490
We're going to use what's
called the divergence theorem.

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:44.810
I hear some snickering.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:46.340
Because I remember
this is probably

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:50.080
something where you were told
in 1801 or 1802, this exists.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.230
Use it in a few problems.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:52.190
Moving on.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:53.965
That sound about right?

00:48:53.965 --> 00:48:55.340
This is when you
actually use it.

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:02.110
So the divergence theorem
says that the integral

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:07.310
of some variable F dS, through
some volume element of surface,

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:11.970
is the same as the
volume integral of--

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:12.800
how does this go--

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.160
del dot F dV.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.060
And this is going to be
quite important because one,

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.370
it gives us a volume integral.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:33.630
So this is, it will be a volume
integral of our del dot flux

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.940
dV, so now everything's
in the same units.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.330
And if we were to say forget
about our little volume

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:40.830
element.

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:43.230
Let's just assume
an infinite reactor.

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:47.070
Every single volume integral in
term just instantly disappears.

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:49.650
Because we wrote
these equations to be

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:55.080
identical for any dV
anywhere inside this reactor.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.340
If the reactor is then infinite,
then all of those volume terms

00:49:59.340 --> 00:49:59.952
disappear.

00:49:59.952 --> 00:50:01.410
And that's the
first simplification

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:05.030
that we'll make
in the next class.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:09.380
But right here on
these five boards,

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.610
we've developed the
neutron transport equation,

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:15.140
which is the absolute, most
general, highest escalated

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.390
form of how do
you track neutrons

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:21.560
through any volume, any
direction, any energy,

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.060
at any time.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.850
And we'll spend Thursday
and Friday simplifying this

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:28.190
to something that we can solve.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:32.040
The other reason that we
use this divergence theorem

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.040
is because we're going
to make an approximation.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.440
This crazy looking
thing right here,

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.570
we will make an approximation
called the diffusion

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.940
approximation where we
assume that neutrons

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.580
are like a gas that just
diffuse away from each other.

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.910
And that's going to make solving
this really, really easy.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.650
It's going to go from
some second order

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.740
differential or differential
integral equation

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.090
to just the equation that
you can solve with algebra.

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.190
Yep?

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:59.470
AUDIENCE: Do you need the dE
d-omega for the last term?

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:05.470
MICHAEL SHORT: Probably, yeah,
over all E, over all omega.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:12.280
And that flux is going
to be of r, E omega, t.

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:16.755
Absolutely.

00:51:16.755 --> 00:51:18.880
Just to make sure, everything
is in the same units,

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.610
every term has a fairly
similar template.

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:26.260
The only difference is leakage,
there's no reaction here.

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:32.940
Every single other term
constitutes a reaction.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.650
And they all follow
this template.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.750
So I will stop here
because it is five of.

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:41.350
See if anyone has
any quick questions

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:42.980
on what you've got here.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.180
I'll make sure to get all
of this on the board images

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.950
so you guys can
take a look at it.

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:49.450
And I'll projected
up on the screen

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:51.700
so that we can make some
simplifications based on what

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.440
we see here on Thursday.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.070
Yeah?

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.582
AUDIENCE: What is the
neutron birth spectrum?

00:51:57.582 --> 00:51:59.290
MICHAEL SHORT: The
neutron birth spectrum

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.900
says that if you have any
old fission event, what's

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.000
the probability of
those neutrons being

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.080
born at different energies?

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.250
What this says is that they're
born between 1 and 10 MeV,

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:11.342
with a peak at around 2 MeV.

00:52:11.342 --> 00:52:13.300
But if you want to track
the number of neutrons

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.675
in every energy group, you
need to know where they begin.

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.620
Good question.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.823
So if any of the terms here are
unclear what they physically

00:52:22.823 --> 00:52:24.990
mean, because that's what
I'm most interested in you

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:28.020
guys knowing, please do
ask either on Piazza,

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.620
on email, on Thursday.

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:30.120
Yeah?

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:30.810
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between the big N

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:32.610
and the little n again?

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:35.490
MICHAEL SHORT: The big N
and the little n, which one?

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:38.054
The cursive one, or this one?

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:40.350
AUDIENCE: The little n
up top there and then

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:41.340
the non-cursive one.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:44.220
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, the little
n and the non-cursive one.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.700
The little n is the number
of neutrons in a volume,

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:51.290
at a certain energy, going in
a direction, at a certain time.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:54.270
Big N right here is just
number density, number

00:52:54.270 --> 00:53:01.030
of atoms per centimeter cubed.

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:04.210
Cursive n is the number
of neutrons at an energy,

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:05.020
in a volume.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.270
We don't care where
they're going.

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:10.870
And the reason I write
these terms up here is we

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:13.750
are going to switch from
lowercase to capital,

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:16.480
or angularly-dependent
to angularly-independent

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.290
by making a simple
approximation to say,

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.082
we don't care what
direction they're going.

00:53:20.082 --> 00:53:22.560
We just care if they're there.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.027
But in real complex
neutron physics problems,

00:53:25.027 --> 00:53:27.360
like the one solved at the
computational reactor physics

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.670
group, you need to
know all the angles.

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.170
And you need to
know the probability

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:33.960
or the cross-section that a
neutron coming in at this angle

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.230
leaves at that angle and
imparts a certain energy.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:37.480
Because they're all different.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.450
For the purposes of
this class, I just

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.252
want you to know
that they exist.

00:53:41.252 --> 00:53:43.460
And the first thing we will
do is simplify them away.

00:53:45.717 --> 00:53:47.300
But this way, you'll
be fully prepared

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.730
for 22.05 and a lifetime
of reactor physics,

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:50.540
if you so choose.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.580
Who here is done a year op
in the computational reactor

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.690
physics group?

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:58.186
Just one, OK.

00:53:58.186 --> 00:53:59.033
I recommend more.

00:53:59.033 --> 00:54:01.200
They tend to be the biggest
group in the department.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.930
They've got like
20 grad students

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.880
and probably more
year ops than that.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.310
So try it out.

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:10.430
It's what makes us
us, us nukes, right,

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:16.400
is neutrons and tracking them
to ridiculous proportions.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.350
OK, definitely want to let
you guys go it's one of.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:21.461
So I'll see you all on Thursday.

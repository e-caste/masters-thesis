00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.410
PROFESSOR: Everything
make sense?

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.928
Are you guys good with Newton?

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:27.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.880
PROFESSOR: Yes, really?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.380
I'm done.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.570
I'm going home.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.412
Are you guys good
with Karatsuba?

00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:35.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.234
PROFESSOR: Kara-what?

00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:41.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.090
OK, so who is happy
with Karatsuba?

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.100
Good.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.220
Who is happy with Newton?

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.690
Wait.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.150
I need to ask the other ones,
because not enough people--

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.860
who is not happy with Newton
and wants to look over it?

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.471
Who wants to look
over Karatsuba?

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:06.970
Oh, so you guy are
paying attention.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.570
Good.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.770
OK.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.270
All right.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.520
So Newton and Karatsuba.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.130
Let's start.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.240
So Karatsuba real
fast, and then we'll

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.120
spend more time having
fun with Newton.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.260
So suppose we don't
know Karatsuba.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.920
We want to multiply two numbers.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.946
What's the method that we
learned in elementary school?

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:35.750
AUDIENCE: You take the first
digit of the first number,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.446
and then you multiply
it by the second number.

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:40.890
And then you take
the second digit

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.285
and multiply it by the second
number, but then you add a 0.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.260
And so on and so forth.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.790
PROFESSOR: So I'll
take this digit

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.330
and multiply it with this number
and write the result down here,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.400
right?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.360
So whatever this thing happens
to be, 1, 2, 3, 4 times 8,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.150
write the result.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.440
Then I take 1, 2, 3, 4 times
7 and add the result here

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.430
and the last digits are 0.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.790
1, 2, 3, 4 times 6, two 0s.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.380
1, 2, 3, 4 times 5, three 0s.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.280
Then I add these up
and I know that I'm

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.206
going to get the right result.

00:02:25.206 --> 00:02:26.580
What's the running
time for this?

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:31.607
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:31.607 --> 00:02:32.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.899
So why is it n squared?

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.024
AUDIENCE: Because you go
through every single thing

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:43.716
for every digit below.

00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:44.340
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.560
So I'll have these
partial products here,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.390
and I have as many
partial products

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.780
as digits in the second number.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.250
So if I have n digits here,
I have n partial products.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.220
Each partial product is this
first number here multiplied

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.520
by a digit.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.070
So if this guy has
n digits, then there

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.170
are n digits everywhere here.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.250
And this thing will be
2 n insides actually,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.630
but we're doing asymptotic,
so we don't really

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.450
care about constant factors.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.730
So in the end, you have
to add up n numbers.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.890
All of them are order n in size.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.530
So n times order n squared.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.540
This is plain old
multiplication.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.790
Does anyone know why
Karatsuba's better?

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:30.075
Yes?

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.288
AUDIENCE: You do
three multiplications

00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:33.719
or something like that?

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:34.680
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.472
So, let's go for
a simple answer.

00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:38.388
AUDIENCE: It's better.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.893
PROFESSOR: So the simpler
answer is it's faster.

00:03:48.893 --> 00:03:49.780
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.854
PROFESSOR: n, n log 2--

00:03:52.854 --> 00:03:55.870
AUDIENCE: I said
better, it's faster.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.120
PROFESSOR: I mean, some
algorithms have the same speed

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.200
but are simpler.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.770
We like this one
because it's faster.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.550
It's definitely not simpler.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.210
So, it has this
running time here.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.090
Log 2 of 3 is a weird number.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.050
It's somewhere
between 1.5 and 2.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.250
So not revolutionary, but
it's better than this guy.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.420
OK, why do we get to this?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.959
How do we get to this?

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.880
Does anyone remember
the recurrence for it?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.895
Yes?

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.289
AUDIENCE: It's 3 times 2--

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:25.830
PROFESSOR: You're
not remembering it.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.794
You're cheating.

00:04:26.794 --> 00:04:27.710
AUDIENCE: No, I'm not.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.686
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.460
PROFESSOR: So, let's see
why it looks like this.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:48.590
Karatsuba takes 2 numbers that
have n digits, splits both

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:57.310
of them up into two-- n over 2n,
n over 2, n over 2, n over 2--

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.300
and then is able to compute the
product of these two numbers

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.830
by only using three
multiplications, and then

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.160
some additions.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.360
Multiplications are expensive,
additions are cheap.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.830
So it does three multiplications
that are of the form

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.710
some number of n over
2 digits multiplied

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.310
by some number of
n over or 2 digits.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.370
And exactly what the
multiplications and what

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.200
the additions are is, it's
interesting to look over it.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.160
You can look over it, convince
yourself that this is correct.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.780
Chances are you'll remember for
the exam and forget afterwards.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.190
Please remember this.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.090
This is the essence
of Karatsuba.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.532
And remember Karatsuba,
because if you google this,

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:50.240
you get the rest.

00:05:52.604 --> 00:05:54.270
So the multiplications
are in the notes.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.040
I don't think it makes sense
to spend some time on them

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.670
and convince you
that, yeah, there

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.180
are three multiplications
that will get you that.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.740
Instead, suppose I labeled
these as a, b, c, d.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.130
If I evaluate the multiplication
as using brute force,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:21.940
it's a times n over 2b plus
c-- sorry, a plus-- no,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.000
this isn't good.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.300
10 to the power n over 2a plus
b times 10-- assuming the base

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.400
is ten, if it's not, you
replace it-- n over 2 c plus d.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:46.030
And you get 10 to the n
times, I think, ac plus 10

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:54.030
to the n over 2 times
ad plus bc plus bd.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.486
The problem with this is
this is a multiplication,

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:04.190
multiplication,
multiplication, multiplication.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.000
So this uses four
multiplications

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.120
of size n over 2 to
evaluate the answer one

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.040
multiplication of size n.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.800
And if I have four
multiplications,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.500
then the recursion becomes
4t of n over 2 plus o of n.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.570
So this is t bad of n.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.690
So if you do this using
the recursion tree,

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.790
you're going to see that--
yup, I hear whispers.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.970
n squared.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.590
So this isn't useful.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.470
This will give you
insight on how to do it,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.060
but if you try to
implement it this way,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.360
you don't get any speed up.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.971
The insight in Karatsuba
is that the guy figured out

00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.720
how to do this with
three multiplications.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.260
OK, makes sense?

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.050
Is everyone happy
with Karatsuba now?

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.605
So that multiplying by 10 to
the n over 2 is just shifting a?

00:08:02.605 --> 00:08:03.230
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.804
OK.

00:08:03.804 --> 00:08:04.470
Very good point.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.750
So this isn't an
actual multiplication.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:14.590
If you have your number, say
stored in a python list--

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.430
so if these are
your digits, then

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.940
in order to multiply
by 10 to the n,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.960
you append 10 to
the n 0s at the end.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.630
0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:34.409
So, this is append of 0 n times.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.200
So this is order n, so it
counts as an addition, not as

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.020
a multiplication.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.440
So, these are free.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.870
These are expensive.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.358
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:51.820
OK.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.030
Who's happy with Karatsuba now?

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.744
Let me feel like I did
something useful today.

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:57.910
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:58.535
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:08:58.535 --> 00:09:00.820
AUDIENCE: I didn't fully
understand what [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.100
PROFESSOR: So, I
have this number

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.310
and I'm splitting
it up into 2 halves.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.950
The way split up is I say this
is a number of size n over 2,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.420
and I have to shift
it to the left.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.870
So n 10 to the power
of n over 2 shifts

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.960
it left by n over two digits.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.946
And then I add it to b.

00:09:24.946 --> 00:09:26.320
So this in a sense
is just saying

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.554
that this is the left half,
this is the right half.

00:09:28.554 --> 00:09:30.520
AUDIENCE: This is
actually that same number.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:30.775
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:32.100
It's exactly the same number.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.439
OK, so who is happy
with Karatsuba now?

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:43.730
AUDIENCE: Wait, but that's
four multiplications though.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.500
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.260
AUDIENCE: That's not three.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:45.640
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.560
AUDIENCE: But we said
there were three.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.570
PROFESSOR: So, I was
saying that this,

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.410
if you;re doing it the brute
force way, you get four,

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.240
and that is slow.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.120
So what Karatsuba
did is he figured out

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.580
the way to do this with
just three multiplications.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.580
So it's not these three.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.520
You have to think
a little bit more.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.877
But you google it, or you
look at the lecture notes,

00:10:03.877 --> 00:10:05.710
or you think a little
bit, then you find out

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.700
the three multiplications
that do the trick.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.720
So the difference between
this 4 here and this 3

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.470
here is important.

00:10:19.337 --> 00:10:20.920
All right, anything
else on Karatsuba?

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.500
Cool.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.740
Let's talk about Newton.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.150
That's the hard stuff.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.500
And let me see how
we're doing on time.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.287
OK, doing well.

00:10:35.287 --> 00:10:37.120
So does anyone remember
the point of Newton?

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.590
OK, so I heard an
application that

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.590
lets you compute square roots.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.820
What else does it let you do?

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.685
PROFESSOR: OK, we have
Karatsuba for multiplication.

00:10:57.685 --> 00:10:59.310
You might be able to
do it with Newton.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.740
Probably not going to be faster.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.810
But division, definitely.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.380
So square roots and division.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.990
So this is why we care about it.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.460
Now what does it do from
a mathy perspective?

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.380
So what's the mathy
definition of Newton.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.356
AUDIENCE: Estimates--

00:11:15.356 --> 00:11:16.230
PROFESSOR: Estimates?

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.120
AUDIENCE: The value--

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.002
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:11:18.002 --> 00:11:18.960
So, we have a function.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.770
Suppose it looks like this.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.840
So, what Newton
helps us do is it

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.230
helps us find a root
of the function.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:37.990
And the root is a value x 0
so that f of x 0 equals 0.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.060
So this is what it does.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.518
So when you want
to use Newton, you

00:11:40.518 --> 00:11:42.640
have to set up your
function in such a way

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.900
that your answer is a root.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.840
OK.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.965
How does Newton work?

00:11:59.220 --> 00:11:59.720
Yes?

00:12:02.185 --> 00:12:03.560
AUDIENCE: You
start at some point

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.268
where you actually
know the answer to it,

00:12:05.268 --> 00:12:08.462
and then you kind of
draw a approximation.

00:12:08.462 --> 00:12:10.837
So you're just drawing a line
from the point to the root,

00:12:10.837 --> 00:12:13.567
and then just incrementing
down that line.

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:14.150
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.970
So we start at
some point, right?

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.580
How do we call that point?

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.500
Initial guess.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.360
Fancy name.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.980
So we have an initial guess
for what the root might be.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.510
It's not going to be the right
answer, because otherwise

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.718
why am I bothering with this?

00:12:26.718 --> 00:12:28.119
But it can be too far off.

00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:29.660
We'll say that if
you're too far off,

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.409
you're not going to
converge or you're not

00:12:31.409 --> 00:12:32.870
going to converge fast enough.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.800
So say we start somewhere
here and, we think, you know,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.810
this is pretty close.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.160
It's not quite there,
but it's pretty close.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.050
What I do from here
on is, you said

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.736
I approximate this function--

00:12:45.736 --> 00:12:46.670
AUDIENCE: The line.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.460
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.214
So what's of the best line?

00:12:49.214 --> 00:12:50.880
The best way to
approximate the function

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.230
with the line is to use
is the tangent, right?

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.130
So here, it sort
of looks like this.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.690
And if the function
were linear, this

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.490
would be a perfect
approximation and we'd

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.791
get answer in one step.

00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:03.290
OK.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.400
So this is the tangent.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.441
And then what we do
with this tangent?

00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:09.482
AUDIENCE: Well, after we
get the equation for it,

00:13:09.482 --> 00:13:13.766
then we find the root, right?

00:13:13.766 --> 00:13:14.767
Or no?

00:13:14.767 --> 00:13:16.850
PROFESSOR: Well, I can't
find the root right away.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:17.730
AUDIENCE: The root of that line.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.610
Of our tangent line.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.193
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:13:19.193 --> 00:13:20.922
So we find the root
of the tangent, which

00:13:20.922 --> 00:13:22.505
is the point where
it hits the x-axis.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.805
And what happens
with this point?

00:13:28.805 --> 00:13:30.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.710
PROFESSOR: OK, so this
is our next guess.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.460
And then we trade.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.990
So then we draw another
tangent, and the idea

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.300
is that eventually,
you're going to get there.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.879
And if we go through
the maths, we

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:44.920
will see that you actually
get there pretty fast.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.880
So that's why we
like this method.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.980
So let's see how we convert this
drawing thing into an equation

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.900
that you can write into python.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.730
Let's label these quantities.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:01.694
So, x2, x1-- actually
let's not use 1 and 2,

00:14:01.694 --> 00:14:03.360
because these are the
first two guesses.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.830
Let's say our current guess is
x and the next guess is x prime.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:19.170
So this line and is x1 minus
x, so this guy over here.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.470
And what's this guy over here?

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.070
f of x.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.900
Don't be shy.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.330
It's the right answer.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.840
So I have f of x here,
x 1 minus x here.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.750
I also have this angle
here, and this angle here

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.330
is the same angle
as the angle here

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.790
because both of these
lines are horizontal,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.900
so they're parallel.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.572
So what do I know
about this angle?

00:14:46.572 --> 00:14:47.530
AUDIENCE: It's tangent.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.530
PROFESSOR: It's tangent.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.080
OK.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.890
The tangent, that's
called the angle alpha.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:56.170
What's the tangent of the angle?

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.086
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.280
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.940
AUDIENCE: F of x
over x [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:12.340
PROFESSOR: I think
you're trying to give me

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.040
the formula for x prime.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.970
Just the tangent.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:16.940
Just the tangent.

00:15:20.735 --> 00:15:22.070
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.630
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.770
Can someone reassure me?

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.770
This is right, right?

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.940
[AUDIENCE AGREES]

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.987
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
the slope of the line.

00:15:29.987 --> 00:15:30.570
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.980
So, yeah, you're
going to give me

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.570
the slope of the line
which lets me compute this.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.730
OK, I was looking for this.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:37.230
OK.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.430
So now, let's get
what you're saying.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.730
So this is the tangent, right?

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.710
So, the tangent at a
point of a function

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.440
is the function's derivative.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.960
So now we're going to write
all these things down and hope

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.740
that we get an equation
that make sense.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.730
So we have the
tangent of this guy,

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.881
also happens to
be this over this.

00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:02.380
Right?

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.830
This is a right angle
triangle, so the tangent

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.290
is f of x over--
this is what you

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.890
were trying to tell me, right?

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.790
x1 minus x.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.980
So now I know that
this is f prime of x.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:23.330
OK.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.420
So, we look at the picture,
we put in everything we know,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.420
and then we write
an equation here.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:38.560
And we solve for--
sorry, this is x prime.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.720
So, if we solve
for x prime, we're

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.720
going to get x prime
as a function of x.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.850
And this tells us,
given a guess here,

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.856
how do we compute
the next guess?

00:16:48.856 --> 00:16:50.230
So once we have
an initial guess,

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.104
this lets us make the
guess better and better

00:16:52.104 --> 00:16:55.680
and better, closer and
closer and closer to x0.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.860
So, let's solve this
equation reasonably quickly.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:10.945
x prime minus x equals f
prime of x over f of x, so

00:17:10.945 --> 00:17:13.800
x prime is--

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.165
AUDIENCE: Does it matter if it's
x minus x prime or [INAUDIBLE],

00:17:18.165 --> 00:17:20.269
because technically
it's x minus x prime.

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:22.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
matters, because you're

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.079
going to get the wrong sign.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.346
Which is exactly what
I'm about to do here.

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:27.514
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:29.430
PROFESSOR: So, I'm not
going very well, right?

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.660
This is wrong.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:41.088
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's because you
flipped your x at your prime--

00:17:41.088 --> 00:17:44.084
AUDIENCE: x minus x prime
instead of x prime--

00:17:44.084 --> 00:17:46.500
AUDIENCE: No, I think it's
because f prime of x is on top.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.715
It should be on the bottom.

00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:51.040
In the second--
no, third equation.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.465
Shouldn't those be flipped?

00:17:52.465 --> 00:17:55.814
Because if you move
the subtraction,

00:17:55.814 --> 00:17:57.758
x prime to the left--

00:18:03.104 --> 00:18:04.080
PROFESSOR: f what?

00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:08.200
AUDIENCE: f of x over
f minus x instead

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.380
of f prime x over f of x.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.677
Yeah, there you go.

00:18:15.677 --> 00:18:17.010
PROFESSOR: OK, so I can do math.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.150
OK, so that's one issue.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.110
There's one more issue.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.380
So, there are too
many issues here.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.400
Issue number one, this.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.229
Issue number two,
I got this wrong.

00:18:26.229 --> 00:18:27.854
AUDIENCE: Oh, we get
a negative number.

00:18:27.854 --> 00:18:29.646
AUDIENCE: 2x minus x prime.

00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:30.270
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.385
So the reason for
that is we're going--

00:18:32.385 --> 00:18:34.510
AUDIENCE: Only if you start
from the right, though.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:35.176
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:35.176 --> 00:18:36.724
AUDIENCE: If you
start from the left,

00:18:36.724 --> 00:18:44.368
if your guess is to the
left of the actual root,

00:18:44.368 --> 00:18:47.077
it may or may not be different.

00:18:47.077 --> 00:18:47.660
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.780
So our guess should
be to the right.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.180
So this is x minus x prime.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.539
So the reason it's x minus x
prime, the way you remember

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:02.580
this and you don't do the
same mistake that I did

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.910
is, you want to walk
against the derivative.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.050
If you walk in the
direction of the derivative,

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.970
it's going to move
you forward, right?

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:19.120
So, if you go in the
direction of the derivative,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.580
instead of going
backwards like this,

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.000
you're going to go
forward like this.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.690
So you're going to go
away from the solution.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.320
So, this will take us
in the right direction,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.480
and this means that it's--

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:52.550
OK.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.690
So two ways to remember this.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.565
One that you're going
against the derivative.

00:19:55.565 --> 00:19:57.740
Another one is that
you have your guess

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.500
and you're subtracting
something from it.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.060
AUDIENCE: You flipped
your primes again.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:01.350
PROFESSOR: Again?

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.850
Jesus.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:03.334 --> 00:20:05.084
AUDIENCE: I mean, I
agree, the prime looks

00:20:05.084 --> 00:20:08.097
better on top part of
the fraction, but still.

00:20:08.097 --> 00:20:08.680
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.190
Well clearly, my hand
thinks the same thing.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.732
So this is you'd
iterate using Newton.

00:20:18.732 --> 00:20:20.690
So the way to remember
that the signs are right

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.299
is your x is somewhere
here, and you

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:24.590
know you have to subtract
something from it so it looks

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.930
like this figure.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.790
And this actually works in
all the cases, turns out.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.750
Our guesses are usually
smaller than the actual number,

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.510
and this still works.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.390
OK, so let's go over Newton.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.840
What do we have, or
what do we need in order

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.280
to make Newton happen.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.790
So we need to be able
to evaluate this, right?

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.190
So we need to be
able to evaluate

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:58.180
f over f prime of x for
any x that Newton gives us.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.210
And for Newton,
this is a black box.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.500
So whichever way
you use to implement

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.280
this is fine, as long as
it works reasonably fast.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.550
OK, what else do we
need to use Newton.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.470
We need to remember this formula
Let's start with something

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:15.350
easy.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.600
Suppose we want to use
it to compute a over b.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.600
How do I do that?

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.330
What do I need?

00:21:24.634 --> 00:21:26.679
AUDIENCE: You need a
line, a tangent line

00:21:26.679 --> 00:21:27.950
like you did before.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.730
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
already taken care of here.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.210
So we have this, and
we know that we'll

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.000
have to compute this
and plug it in here.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.900
So, what do I need to
compute a/b using Newton?

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.060
So, I need the function, right?

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:03.790
This thing.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.790
I can't say it's something, I
have to figure out what it is.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.940
I guess I was confusing because
I said assume we have this.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.789
Well, sorry.

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:11.580
We don't have this.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.996
We need to figure
out the function

00:22:12.996 --> 00:22:15.149
so we can evaluate this.

00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:16.940
OK, so we need to come
up with the function

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.850
so we can evaluate
that, and what property

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.674
does the function need to meet?

00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:22.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:25.779 --> 00:22:27.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that
would be nice, right?

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:34.980
So we want the function
so that f of a/b equals 0,

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.760
because that's the number
that Newton will give us.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:46.080
And we also need to be able
to compute f over f prime of x

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.840
without doing any
division, right?

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.094
If we did the divisions,
it doesn't work.

00:22:53.094 --> 00:22:54.760
OK, so the first thing
we're going to do

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.000
is we're going to simplify this
problem to 1 over b instead

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.630
of a over b, because if
you know what's 1 over b,

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.400
you're going to
multiply this by a,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.160
and you're going
to get a over b.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.480
Suppose we work
with integers and we

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.200
don't want to touch
floating point numbers.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.695
What would we actually compute?

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.730
AUDIENCE: You shift
it out, right?

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.920
To get that 0.23, shift
now to [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.310
PROFESSOR: All right, all right.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.150
So 1 over b.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.160
Unless b is 1, in which
case it's really boring.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.540
1 over b looks like this.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.410
0 point something.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.710
This is not an integer number.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.830
I don't like it.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.560
So what I do is,
I decide that I'm

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.880
going to need
digits of precision,

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.820
and I'm going to shift
the decimal point

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.130
right by d digits.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:57.190
So instead of 0
point something, it's

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:00.650
d digits here point
something else.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.110
How do I do this?

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.580
AUDIENCE: Multiply
by 10 to the d?

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.038
PROFESSOR: Multiply
by 10 to the d.

00:24:07.038 --> 00:24:12.830
So instead of computing 1
over b, 10 to the d over b.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:18.210
And we call this 10 to the
d R in our station notes.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:24.620
So we're going to compute
R. Over b multiplied

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:31.190
by a, and then
everything divided by R.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.150
So we talked about
how you multiply

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.080
by R. How do you divide by R?

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.230
So, if I have a
number with n digits

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:44.875
and I want to divide by 10
to the d, how do I do that?

00:24:44.875 --> 00:24:46.127
AUDIENCE: Shift.

00:24:46.127 --> 00:24:47.085
PROFESSOR: Shift right.

00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:48.830
If the number is a python list?

00:24:53.449 --> 00:24:54.240
AUDIENCE: Slice it.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.018
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:24:55.018 --> 00:24:56.730
So kill the last d digits.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.850
So, if I add d
digits to the right,

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.710
I multiply by 10 to the d.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.290
If I slice the last digits,
I divide by 10 to the d.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:08.690
So this is division,
this is multiplication.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.770
And the reason I care
about that is this

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:16.894
is going to be an easy division,
and whenever I have this,

00:25:16.894 --> 00:25:18.060
it's an easy multiplication.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.660
OK, now what function
am I going to use?

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.570
Does anyone know?

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:32.460
Can I use x minus R
over b equals zero?

00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:44.750
AUDIENCE: Sure?

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:49.972
PROFESSOR: Well, so, this is
f of x. f prime of x is what?

00:25:49.972 --> 00:25:51.445
AUDIENCE: Just
negative R over b.

00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:54.120
Or no, 1.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:54.770
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:59.142
So, f prime of x over--

00:25:59.142 --> 00:26:00.808
AUDIENCE: I think you
switched it again.

00:26:00.808 --> 00:26:01.986
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:01.986 --> 00:26:02.860
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.530
Because I was running ahead,
and I was like, OK, this works.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.880
Why does it work?

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.764
OK, so this is going to be
x minus R over b, right?

00:26:12.764 --> 00:26:13.680
Can you evaluate this?

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.135
If I can't evaluate this,
I already know the answer.

00:26:23.395 --> 00:26:26.650
AUDIENCE: Your prime's
not on the bottom one.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.130
PROFESSOR: So, it's x
minus this divided by 1.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.084
So, it's this.

00:26:30.084 --> 00:26:32.500
So then, if you're trying to
evaluate this far the guesses

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.200
that Newton gives
you, you can't.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.720
Because if you could, you'd
have the answer already.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.340
So we can't use this function.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.010
This is a nice and easy
function that doesn't work.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.731
So while I erase the
board, one minute, someone

00:26:45.731 --> 00:26:46.980
figure out the right function.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.158
Sorry?

00:27:08.158 --> 00:27:09.074
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:09.074 --> 00:27:11.080
PROFESSOR: Man,
that's hard math.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:11.990
No, that's too hard.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.656
That's too hard.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.950
OK, let's try this.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.820
Let's try instead
of x minus R over b,

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:28.240
let's try this 1/x minus b/R.
And the intuition behind this

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:36.391
is if I have to compute
b/R, I can do that.

00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:36.890
Right?

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.450
It's an easy division.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:42.260
If I somehow get rid of
1/x and all I have to do

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.330
is compute b/R, it's
an easy division.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.430
Because dividing by
2 to the R by R means

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.222
you're going to shift by
some digits to the right.

00:27:54.222 --> 00:27:56.430
So let's see if the math
works out for this function.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.830
What's f prime of x?

00:28:08.304 --> 00:28:11.292
AUDIENCE: Negative
1 over x prime?

00:28:11.292 --> 00:28:14.280
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.510
Like, does no one know it?

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.050
At least one student
has to know it.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:25.820
OK, so f of x divided
by f prime of x is what?

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:36.900
AUDIENCE: Negative x
plus x squared b/R.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.127
PROFESSOR: Plus x squared b R.

00:28:39.127 --> 00:28:39.752
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:43.289 --> 00:28:44.330
PROFESSOR: Is this right?

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.837
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:52.837 --> 00:28:53.420
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:59.890
So if I have my initial guess--
so if I want to get x prime,

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:08.592
x prime is x minus f of x
over f prime of x, right?

00:29:08.592 --> 00:29:09.400
So, what is it?

00:29:14.746 --> 00:29:23.635
AUDIENCE: 2x minus x
squared over R. OK.

00:29:23.635 --> 00:29:24.612
Did this work?

00:29:24.612 --> 00:29:26.320
Did it get rid of all
the hard divisions?

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.950
[LAUGHS]

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.650
Please nod so I know
we're good to go.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:41.710
Tell me if we're not.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.420
So how many divisions
did we have here?

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.212
One division, this guy, right?

00:29:45.212 --> 00:29:46.420
AUDIENCE: But that's a shift.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.503
PROFESSOR: That's a shift.

00:29:47.503 --> 00:29:51.120
Because R is 10 to the d.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.602
AUDIENCE: What about the
multiplication [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:53.602 --> 00:29:55.560
PROFESSOR: So, we know
how to do multiplication

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.200
because we learned
Karatsuba just now.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.740
So we wanted to get
rid of division,

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.490
because if you're
trying to solve division

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.950
by doing division,
it's probably not

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.800
I'm going to work unless you're
doing divide and conquer.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:14.372
OK, so this is how it works.

00:30:14.372 --> 00:30:16.580
I'm not going to run into
the error formulas for this

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.030
because I want to do
another case first.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.110
You can keep going on this
and it's in the notes.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.940
The only thing that
is useful to remember

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.600
is that we use this trick.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.730
So, I want to look at this
function, square root 3 of a,

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.060
and I want to use
Newton to compute it.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.654
So this is the third order root.

00:30:37.654 --> 00:30:39.820
It's not the regular square
root that we had before.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.530
So we're trying to
not be boring and not

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:44.300
just repeat what's in the notes.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.630
How do I do this?

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.424
Let's walk through the steps.

00:30:48.424 --> 00:30:49.965
So what's the first
thing that we do?

00:30:54.171 --> 00:30:54.670
Very good.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.419
Look to the right.

00:30:55.419 --> 00:30:57.320
Find the first step,
and let's put it here.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.280
What's the first step.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.057
AUDIENCE: Function f
of 0 at cube root of a.

00:31:08.057 --> 00:31:08.640
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:16.640
So we need a function
f so that f of-- good.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.070
So before we start writing
the actual function,

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.740
what if I want to
compute cube root

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.700
of a up to d digits
of precision?

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.737
So if I want to
compute cube root of 2,

00:31:29.737 --> 00:31:31.820
this is going to give me
numbers that are below 1.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.236
I have to do with
fractions again.

00:31:33.236 --> 00:31:34.350
I don't like that.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.470
If I want the digits of
precision, what do I do?

00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:43.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.340
PROFESSOR: Jumping ahead.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:46.840
But yeah.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.173
So you have the right answer,
but you're speaking slowly

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:51.670
because you're afraid you're
going to do a mistake, right?

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:57.010
So, the way to compute this
to d digits of precision 10

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:01.650
to the d, right?

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.970
This shifts the
dot to the right.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:07.030
So I have to get this
10 to the d inside here,

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.590
and I get and to the 3d times a.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.700
Perfect answer, by the way.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.694
Don't forget this 3 here.

00:32:15.694 --> 00:32:17.610
If you do, you're going
to get something else.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.320
So now I take this guy,
and this is the new number

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.070
whose cube root I
have to compute.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.620
Cube, cube, cube.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.100
OK.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.500
So I can do this
in integer land,

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.500
and then I'll get
an integer result,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.590
and I shift it
right by d digits,

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.350
and I have a number with
d digits of precision.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.520
Does this make sense?

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.330
OK, what's f?

00:32:54.526 --> 00:32:55.494
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:55.494 --> 00:32:56.702
PROFESSOR: Let's go for that.

00:32:56.702 --> 00:32:58.200
Let's see if that works.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.220
x cubed minus a.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.310
Well, let's pretend.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:06.560
We're going to make
this b the new a.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.160
So let's not to
worry about this.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.780
This happens somewhere else.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.810
We went through
it so that we know

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.996
that we know how
to deal with it.

00:33:14.996 --> 00:33:16.620
And now we're going
to forget about it.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.379
So, it's x cubed minus a.

00:33:19.379 --> 00:33:21.420
Because we argued that
this is an integer, right?

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.980
So we don't have to do anything
fancy like dividing by R

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.960
that we had to do over there.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.740
So, what's f prime of x?

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.110
OK.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.005
So, iteration?

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.814
How do we iterate?

00:33:41.814 --> 00:33:43.690
AUDIENCE: x prime?

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.930
PROFESSOR: Let's start
with x prime equals

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.241
x minus f of x
over f prime of x.

00:33:51.241 --> 00:33:51.740
Right?

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.850
Nice and easy so
we have it here.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:59.380
And this becomes minus copy
these two things, right?

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:04.160
x cubed minus a over 3x squared.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:04.920
OK.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.020
Next thing, I bring this
guy under the denominator,

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:16.540
so it's 3x cubed minus x
cubed plus a over 3x squared.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:23.250
So it's 2x cubed plus
a over 3x squared.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:30.082
So this is 2/3 plus--

00:34:30.082 --> 00:34:31.528
AUDIENCE: 2 over 3x.

00:34:31.528 --> 00:34:33.456
You keep saying
cubed and writing 2.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's better.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.170
Thank you.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:48.900
Plus 1/3 times a over x.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.510
So this one's division.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.364
AUDIENCE: x squared.

00:34:53.364 --> 00:34:54.239
PROFESSOR: x squared.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:55.370
Ouch.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.500
So this guy wants division.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.044
By the time I do this, I better
have division ready, right?

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.830
OK, so that my iteration.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:14.097
x prime is 2/3 x plus
1/3 and a over x squared.

00:35:14.097 --> 00:35:14.930
What else do I need?

00:35:22.097 --> 00:35:23.680
An initial guess
would be nice, right?

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.830
I can't do this if I
don't have the first x.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.894
So let's try to think of a
starting x that's reasonable.

00:35:30.894 --> 00:35:32.810
The better it is, the
faster it's going to be.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.059
So let's try to come up with
something reasonable that

00:35:35.059 --> 00:35:40.310
doesn't require too much
thinking or too much.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:42.889
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:42.889 --> 00:35:43.930
PROFESSOR: Too much work.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:45.430
I have to compute a square root.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:46.564
So what's a?

00:35:46.564 --> 00:35:47.480
Let's start with that.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.880
What's an a, right?

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:55.600
So, it's an n digit number.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:01.410
And say the digits are d1,
d2, d3, all the way up to dn.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.930
So what's a good approximation?

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.970
Well, the first
approximation for this?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.886
AUDIENCE: You get a
third as many digits.

00:36:13.886 --> 00:36:15.320
PROFESSOR: A third
as many digits.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:15.820
OK.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:22.830
So something times
10 to the n/3.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.452
Let's say that
something is 1, right?

00:36:30.452 --> 00:36:31.910
So this is the
first approximation.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:33.326
It's the right
order of magnitude.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.204
Do people see why this
is a good approximation?

00:36:39.204 --> 00:36:40.620
So this number,
whatever it is, it

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:50.260
has to be between 1,
0, 0 0, 0, and 1, 0, 0.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:50.760
OK.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.050
So generally when
we do this, what

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:53.620
we have to have in
an approximation

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.840
is the right order of magnitude
And maybe the first digit.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.872
If we can figure
out the first digit,

00:36:58.872 --> 00:37:00.830
then we're in a good
shape, or something really

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.516
close to the first digit.

00:37:02.516 --> 00:37:03.890
How would we get
the first digit?

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:11.020
AUDIENCE: Cube root
of the first digit?

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.572
Sure.

00:37:13.572 --> 00:37:14.530
How do we compute this?

00:37:18.322 --> 00:37:19.744
AUDIENCE: Get a formula?

00:37:19.744 --> 00:37:20.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:26.805 --> 00:37:28.930
PROFESSOR: OK, so I'm not
going to argue with that.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:29.870
AUDIENCE: I like that.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.020
PROFESSOR: So I want to reject
the recursive argument first.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.520
So this is going
to be small, right?

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.130
This is going to be 10 if
you're working with digits,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.310
or if you're a computer,
maybe it's 256,

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:45.600
or maybe it's 2 to
the 16 or 2 to the 32.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.650
Not much bigger
than that, right?

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:48.760
Pretty small.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:53.390
So these algorithms really
good for big numbers.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:55.900
Algorithms that are
complicated but have

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.930
nice asymptotic complexity
are good for big numbers.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:02.910
They're awful for small numbers,
as in they 10 to 100 times

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.290
more times to run.

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:07.730
So let's not to
do that for this,

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.650
because it's like
bringing a tank

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.690
and shooting it so you
can hammer a nail in.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:15.720
Not the right tool.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.210
So, precomputed list.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:18.970
I like that.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:21.261
It's an option, especially
if you're [INAUDIBLE] right?

00:38:21.261 --> 00:38:23.430
You can use pen and
paper to get it.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:24.900
What if I don't want to do that.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.630
What if my base is
more like this.?

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:27.546
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:31.259 --> 00:38:33.050
PROFESSOR: So this is
a very good solution.

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.726
I'm not arguing with it.

00:38:34.726 --> 00:38:38.820
If your power is this or this,
by all means, use a table.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.660
So let's see what do we do here?

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.048
I just want to think
a little bit more.

00:38:44.048 --> 00:38:44.964
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.850
PROFESSOR: OK, so there's
some approximation

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:57.300
that comes from math
that says that d1 over 3

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.150
is not going to be
such a bad guess.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.030
Now let's be CS people
and do something better.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.726
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the exponent.

00:39:03.726 --> 00:39:07.239
2 to the 14, divide--
is that 14, right here

00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:07.780
AUDIENCE: 16.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.321
AUDIENCE: 16.

00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:09.512
Divide 16 by 3.

00:39:09.512 --> 00:39:11.220
Or I guess that's not
quite right either.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.841
PROFESSOR: So you're saying
2 to the power of, say, 5?

00:39:14.841 --> 00:39:17.118
15 over 3?

00:39:17.118 --> 00:39:19.400
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
seem quite right.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.550
PROFESSOR: So, let's
try to do better.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:22.140
This is math.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.120
Let's just try to
do it in a CS way.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:32.120
So we're trying to guess a
digit between 0 and 2 to the 16.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.730
I heard an "oh."

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.660
Yes?

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.170
You had your hand up?

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.400
No?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.155
OK.

00:39:44.155 --> 00:39:47.745
AUDIENCE: You take the
current time 2 to the 16.

00:39:47.745 --> 00:39:50.170
I mean--

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.729
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:52.729 --> 00:39:54.270
PROFESSOR: So your
algorithm is going

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.707
to be fast with some
probability, right?

00:39:56.707 --> 00:39:57.540
No, that's terrible.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.900
Let's not do that.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.232
Please don't make me
grade code like that.

00:40:04.232 --> 00:40:06.845
AUDIENCE: Did you already
cut out the recursive option?

00:40:06.845 --> 00:40:07.428
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:07.428 --> 00:40:08.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.957
Well, so I don't want to
recurse on square roots.

00:40:10.957 --> 00:40:12.790
AUDIENCE: But you could
recurse on that one.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:13.530
PROFESSOR: I mean,
if you give me

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:15.250
some algorithm that happens--

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.427
AUDIENCE: You're
already [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:18.427 --> 00:40:19.010
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.400
So, what's the intuition?

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.730
If you have a computer
and you have register,

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:29.957
bytes, bits, whatever.

00:40:29.957 --> 00:40:31.540
You don't know how
to do square roots.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:38.440
That's not an instruction, but
these are all instructions.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:38.940
Right?

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:43.119
So if I have a guess,
say I start with half

00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:45.660
and then I get my guess, what
do I need for the binary search

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.470
to work?

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.500
Given a guess that's
somewhere here,

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.640
I have to be able to say whether
this is too small, too big,

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.820
or just the right number.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.500
So given a guess, I can multiply
it by itself three times,

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.000
right?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.400
Compute gets cubed.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.210
And I can see how does
it compare to the number

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:04.780
that I want.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.555
So I have the first digit, and
I have an order of magnitude.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.330
Not bad, right?

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.150
Pretty good initial guess.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.390
This is as much of an answer
is you need to give out

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:31.610
in physics problems, and you
get full score, so that's good.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.950
OK, how are we doing so far?

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:37.670
Following along?

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:40.892
AUDIENCE: If we compute
our guess cubed,

00:41:40.892 --> 00:41:43.724
we want only to compare
it to our original number

00:41:43.724 --> 00:41:44.987
to see how close it is?

00:41:44.987 --> 00:41:45.612
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:41:45.612 --> 00:41:49.337
AUDIENCE: And, do we just
keep on doing that until--

00:41:49.337 --> 00:41:51.920
PROFESSOR: Well, so you're going
have to guess a digit, right?

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.000
Between 0 and 2 to the 16.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.120
So you choose the largest thing
that's smaller than your guess,

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:58.760
or something.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.760
AUDIENCE: Or until we
get the first digit.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:00.794
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:00.794 --> 00:42:01.505
Just the first.

00:42:01.505 --> 00:42:03.380
And then you have a
first digit, and then you

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.705
have an order of magnitude.

00:42:04.705 --> 00:42:06.080
And then you feed
that to Newton,

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.275
which converges way faster.

00:42:09.805 --> 00:42:11.930
So you could the binary
search for the whole thing,

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.640
but that would be slower
than Newton, turns out.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.740
Yes?

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.900
AUDIENCE: So where'd
you get the f of x here?

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.320
I'm missing that stuff.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.000
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, right there.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.550
PROFESSOR: Someone
told me to use this.

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:33.710
One of you guys
told me to use this.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:34.780
Well, so I tried it out.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.040
I put it here.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.110
And then I computed
the derivative,

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.747
and I looked to see if
this looks reasonable.

00:42:40.747 --> 00:42:42.580
And this looks like
something I can compute.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.550
AUDIENCE: And why
was that reasonable?

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.150
PROFESSOR: Because I know
how to do the division

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.941
and multiplication.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.890
So, say if I would have had
the square root of 3 in here,

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.700
that wouldn't be
reasonable, right?

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.440
Just like before.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.065
When you're trying
to compute division,

00:42:58.065 --> 00:42:59.317
we can't have division.

00:42:59.317 --> 00:43:00.900
If you're trying to
compute sine of x,

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.720
you don't want to
have sine of x.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.570
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.120
and computing a over x
squared is reasonable?

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.659
PROFESSOR: Because
we did it before.

00:43:09.659 --> 00:43:10.200
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.820
So then you might use
something else, maybe?

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.730
You can use something else as
long as you know how to do it,

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:16.230
and as long as it's
reasonably fast.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.976
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:17.976 --> 00:43:18.600
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.516
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:25.900
PROFESSOR: Oh, no that's fine.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.210
AUDIENCE: Oh, that fine?

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:27.752
OK.

00:43:27.752 --> 00:43:29.210
PROFESSOR: So, the
binary search is

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:30.840
fine to get the
first approximation.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.290
But after that--
so I'm not going

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:35.140
to do a binary search
for the whole result,

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.240
because Newton is
faster than that.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.520
I'm just using this so
that I have a decent guess

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.110
to pass to Newton.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:46.960
And we'll see why we need that
decent guess in two minutes

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.495
total.

00:43:48.495 --> 00:43:50.620
So I'm going to try to
spend two minutes to explain

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.830
how the error thing
works, and you'll

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.060
have to look at the
notes and make sense out

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.130
of the rest of it.

00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:59.345
So, let's see.

00:43:59.345 --> 00:43:59.845
Errors.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.260
So with Newton, you start
to with an initial guess,

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.570
and then you get to a
better guess, and a better

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:16.220
guess, and a better guess,
and so on and so forth

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.535
until you're satisfied.

00:44:17.535 --> 00:44:19.785
By the way, if we're doing
this one, are we satisfied?

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:25.956
AUDIENCE: What do you mean,
like, finding the guess?

00:44:25.956 --> 00:44:26.680
Are we satisfied?

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.430
PROFESSOR: Oh, no.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:28.790
So, we have the initial guess.

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:33.280
And we keep applying the formula
that I just deleted to iterate.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.400
When do we stop?

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.670
AUDIENCE: When we have
enough digits of precision?

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.660
PROFESSOR: So how do we know
when we have enough digits,

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:39.950
if we're working with integers?

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:41.910
AUDIENCE: We iterate
again and nothing changes.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:44.010
PROFESSOR: We iterate
again and nothing changes.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:47.892
So I'm computing-- do
I have this anywhere?

00:44:47.892 --> 00:44:49.030
Oh, no.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:50.180
I erased it.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:54.140
So I'm computing 10 t0
some-- oh, I had it up here.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.730
So, I'm computing
10 to the power

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:59.630
of d times a square
root of 3, because I

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:00.800
want to work with integers.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.730
Just integers.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:04.810
I used Newton to iterate.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:08.250
My precision gets gets
better and better and better.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:09.150
And I use integers.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.860
So I only have d
digits of precision.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.510
Everything after that gets
discarded automatically.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:17.516
When I get 2 x's that don't
change-- so if I get x5,

00:45:17.516 --> 00:45:18.890
and then I run
the thing and then

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.530
I get x6 that is
equal to x5, there's

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.520
no point to keep
running Newton, right?

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.109
I;m stuck.

00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:26.900
And I'm also done
because I have the answer

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.650
with d digits of precision.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.262
So this is where I stop.

00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:34.730
OK.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:38.390
Now, my precision is how far
I am from the right answer.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:40.750
And we write that
by saying that x1

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:47.770
is x, the true answer, times
1 plus epsilon, epsilon 1.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:55.120
And then x2 is x times 1 plus
epsilon 2, 1 plus epsilon 3,

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.480
so on and so forth.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.040
Right?

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.670
So, if we had a lot of time
and not too much stuff to do,

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:06.830
I could copy this thing here
that we have in the notes.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.210
That's eight lines of math.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:15.920
And then we'd get something
along the lines of x of i

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:24.460
plus 1 is x times 1
plus something times E

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:31.840
squared-- I'm sorry, Ei squared.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:40.100
So this is also
1 plus Ei plus 1.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:47.220
So what we get is that E of i
plus 1 is roughly E i squared.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:57.810
And this is what's really
called quadratic convergence.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:59.690
Now why is this good?

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.920
Can anyone think intuitively
why this is nice?

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.660
In which cases?

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.580
Yes?

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.150
AUDIENCE: You're converging
really quickly to your answer.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:08.100
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.405
But when do I converge?

00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:12.257
, So what I want this to happen?

00:47:12.257 --> 00:47:13.340
What do I want this to be?

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.256
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:17.197 --> 00:47:19.030
PROFESSOR: Well, you
guys told me everything

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:21.600
I need for the next two minutes.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.880
So, I want this to
become 1, right?

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:31.170
This has to go to 1 because I
want this whole thing to be x.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:35.740
So in order for this to be 1,
I want to epsilons to go to 0.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.140
So I want them to be
as small as possible.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:42.470
Now, you said that if my
epsilon is smaller than 1,

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:48.400
then epsilon squared is
smaller than epsilon.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.940
And intuitively,
how this works is,

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.160
suppose you start with
an epsilon of 0.1.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.290
When you square
it, you get 0.01.

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:02.260
You square it again,
you get 0.0001.

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.080
Square it again.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:08.700
0.00000001.

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:09.200
OK.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.330
This is step 0, step
1, step 2, step 3.

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.980
How many digits do I have here?

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.698
Don't be shy.

00:48:20.698 --> 00:48:22.180
AUDIENCE: 2 to the i?

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:22.810
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:23.675
2 to the i.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.460
So this is going
to be equal to this

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:40.220
when 1 plus x times 1 plus
epsilon i over 1 plus epsilon--

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:48.020
sorry, i plus 1 epsilon i
when the floor of this thing

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:53.800
is-- sorry, there is a
delta somewhere here.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.210
So, something has
to converge to 0.

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:03.210
Sorry, this is what it is.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:06.110
1 plus e of i.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:14.310
So this is the difference
between two terms, x.

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:16.737
So this is x6 minus x5, right?

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.332
Convincing?

00:49:23.332 --> 00:49:24.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:25.979
Let's write it again.

00:49:25.979 --> 00:49:26.854
Let's write it again.

00:49:26.854 --> 00:49:27.687
This is out of hand.

00:49:27.687 --> 00:49:30.380
So, x, x minus x5,
or actually, xi

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:37.900
plus 1 minus xi is equal
to x times 1 plus epsilon i

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:43.390
plus 1 minus x times 1
plus epsilon i, right?

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:48.639
So this is x times-- Sorry?

00:49:48.639 --> 00:49:50.046
AUDIENCE: Those are xi, x of i.

00:49:50.046 --> 00:49:53.700
AUDIENCE: No, those
are the real x's.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.920
PROFESSOR: These are-- so
these are the approximations,

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.154
but then, this is the real x.

00:49:59.154 --> 00:50:00.570
AUDIENCE: I
understand, thank you.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:01.153
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:50:01.153 --> 00:50:04.610
So, this is, the difference
between them is this guy here.

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:12.430
So if I take the floor
because I work with integers,

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:16.700
when this floor becomes
0, we're done, right?

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.970
So in order for the
floor to become 0,

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:23.400
this guy has to be
canceled by this guy.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.300
So this guy has some number
of digits, whatever that is.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:31.260
It's my number with d
digits of precision.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:35.980
Well, that's OK
because-- where my 0s?

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:36.790
Did I erase my 0s?

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:37.590
Oh, no.

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:39.940
I have 0s here, right?

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.740
The epsilons have a
lot of 0s in them,

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:46.110
so the 0s are going to
cancel the digits in x.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:53.180
So as soon as I have enough 0s
here to cancel this, I'm stuck.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:59.040
The number of 0s
increases exponentially.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.310
So in each step the number
of 0s I have doubles.

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:06.880
So after log d steps, I'm done.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.700
If I have d digits
in here, because I'm

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.190
computing this with d
digits of precision,

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:15.650
after roughly log d steps,
I'll have enough 0s here

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:17.750
to reduce this and make
the whole thing be 0.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:23.420
So this is how I
know that it's fast.

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.730
So in the end, what you
want is the initial guess

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:30.440
has to satisfy
this, and then you

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:36.660
want to be able to
prove that this is true.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.130
So you want this factor
here that tells you you're

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:40.900
converging fast.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.280
So when you look at
the recitation notes

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.374
and you look at this
long string of equations,

00:51:46.374 --> 00:51:47.790
make sure this is
somewhere there,

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:50.631
because this means you're
on the right track.

00:51:50.631 --> 00:51:51.480
Yes?

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.941
AUDIENCE: If it
takes log d steps,

00:51:52.941 --> 00:51:56.960
doesn't the binary search
also take log-- ah, OK.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.930
Log 10 steps.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:58.430
Got it.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:59.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.560
Which is d.

00:52:02.317 --> 00:52:04.150
AUDIENCE: He's talking
about binary search--

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:05.250
PROFESSOR: Oh, for one digit.

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:05.540
Yeah.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.040
Oh, sorry.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.710
I thought you meant
for the whole thing.

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:11.020
So if you wanted to do binary
search for the whole thing,

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.200
that's log of the whole number.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.420
So that's order d where d
is the number of digits.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.622
AUDIENCE: Wait, he's talking
about a binary [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:20.622 --> 00:52:22.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:26.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] wants
to go for [INAUDIBLE], 10

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.060
to the 20th.

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.490
He wants to do a binary
search over like a cube root--

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:31.630
PROFESSOR: So, for this?

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:33.310
Binary search for
this or for one digit?

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:36.005
Or binary search to
compute the cube root?

00:52:36.005 --> 00:52:37.030
AUDIENCE: I think, yeah.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.630
PROFESSOR: So, if you do
that, your entire thing is

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:40.980
d digits, right?

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.861
So 10 to the d.

00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:45.610
Binary search takes
log of 10 to the d.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:48.070
AUDIENCE: Right, yeah.

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:49.570
PROFESSOR: So the
numbers that we're

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:51.690
dealing with are d digits.

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:53.930
So this d is the number
of digits, not the number

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:54.919
that you have.

00:52:54.919 --> 00:52:56.710
So if you look at the
number that you have,

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:58.125
this is log log n.

00:52:58.125 --> 00:53:00.228
AUDIENCE: Right,
that makes sense.

00:53:00.228 --> 00:53:00.728
Sorry.

00:53:00.728 --> 00:53:02.632
PROFESSOR: So, it's faster.

00:53:02.632 --> 00:53:03.590
AUDIENCE: I like it.

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:04.507
It is faster.

00:53:04.507 --> 00:53:05.090
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:05.390
Cool.

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:06.306
Thanks for the lesson.

00:53:06.306 --> 00:53:07.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

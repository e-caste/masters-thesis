00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So the big issue that I was trying
to take on yesterday,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and this is of really fundamental
importance to biology,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is that you saw from that molecular
composition of cells 80% water.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Of the rest of it about 50% of
what's there by mass is protein.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Proteins do most of the really
interesting stuff in the cell.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They're the ones that are able to
catalyze specific chemical reactions

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with all this amazing chemistry
that's needed for life to take place

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
at physiological conditions.
They are structural components of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the cells.  They are all kinds of
amazing machines.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I showed you the little flagellar
motor that turns it,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but that's just one of many,
many nano machines that are

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
necessary for life.
They have exquisite specificity

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
when you get sick and you get an
immune response.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You develop antibodies and other
cells that are able to recognize

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
exactly some piece of that virus or
bacterium that has infected you and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
mount an immune response.
But all of the things that are doing

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that are proteins.
And the sort of, most of you I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
think know that,
as we've sort of said that amino

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
acids are just a chain,
one amino acid joined to another

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
amino acid to another amino
acid and so on.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And so the backbone,
that peptide bond that I showed the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
other day is absolutely regular
piece of backbone.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And what gives the amino acids
their character is the side chain

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that hangs off.
And you'll have different side

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
chains hanging off depending on what
the amino acid is.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And you will not have to memorize
all of those structures.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But the important thing is that
these various amino acids fit into

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
chemical categories that give them
properties.  They either have a plus

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
charge and a negative charge,
they're hydrophobic, they don't like

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to go with water,
they are polar, they cannot interact

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
with water and so on.
And it's clear from a couple of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
your comments,
some of you are why are we going

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
through all of this?
Well, the reason we're going through

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
all of this is all amino acids look
like this.  It doesn't matter.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
They're going to be an enzyme,
a part of a motor, a structural part

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
of yourselves.
They all consist of the same

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
backbone made up of those 20 amino
acids.  And what gives these,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
makes the proteins so important is
the ultimate 3-dimensional structure.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm not sure what this sound is.
OK.  Let's try standing back here.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
What gives all of these proteins
their individual character is how

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
this chain of amino acids,
you could just think of them like

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
this, folds up into some
3-dimensional structure that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
ultimately is able to do the
biological function that we're

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
trying to understand.
And one of the real holy grails

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
still in biology is how to look at
the sequence of amino acids that

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
constitute a protein and figure out
what the 3-dimensional

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
structure is.
It's one of the holy grails that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
hasn't been solved.
One of you may have a key insight

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that will solve this.
If we could do that it would really

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
be a huge advance,
because what you can get out of the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
genome sequences is you can read the
sequence of every gene and you can

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
predict the sequence of amino acids
in the protein.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
But all it tells you is the linear
sequence of the amino acids.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It doesn't tell you what the
3-dimensional structure is.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And how an amino acid gets from the
sort of floppy chain linear

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
structure to the 3-dimensional thing
is complicated.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And you have to understand several
kinds of forces.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And so I introduced a few terms.
When we think about protein

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
structure, the primary structure,
that's just the linear sequence --

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
-- of amino acids.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So valine followed by a tryptophan,
followed by a proline, followed a

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
threonine, whatever it would be.
That doesn't tell you very much.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Then the first key part of
understanding how proteins get to a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
3-dimensional structure was the
discovery of what's termed

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000
secondary structure.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And these are the thing I introduced
to you to the other day.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
There are two important ones.
An alpha helix and a beta sheet.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And this is a propensity of a
certain string of amino acids in

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
this linear sequence to adopt one of
two very common protein structures.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And the important thing about these
elements, the alpha helices and the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
beta sheets is they are not
dependent on the side chain.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So they are not.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
They are instead dependent
on hydrogen bonds --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:55.000
-- between N-H and the carbon double

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
bond oxygen in the backbone.
And that was how Linus Pauling

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
figured out originally the alpha
helix.  He decided to ignore all the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
side chains.  And he worked out that
you could arrange the backbone of a

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
protein, the peptide bonds into
these repeating structures that

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
would account for the reflections
he'd seen.  When we get to talking

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
about how Watson and Crick worked
out the structure,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that's how they started out, too.
They decided to ignore,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
if you will, the side chains,
which are the As and Gs and Cs and

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Ts, which turned out to be not a
productive way to go after the

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
structure of DNA.
But, in any case,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that was part of what Linus Pauling
did in working these out.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And so those little movies I showed
you, this is an alpha helix.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Now, what's been done in this
picture is all the side chains have

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
been taken off.
And so you can look at this in your

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
textbook, you'll see pictures,
but these hydrogen bonds are --

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
The amino acid is just in this helix.
It's coiling around.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And at regular intervals there's
the opportunity for forming a

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
hydrogen bond.
And we can, with some success but

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
certainly not certainty,
predict that a particular sequence

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
of amino acids is going to form an
alpha helix.  And part of what

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that's based on is there are some
amino acids that don't fit easily

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
into an alpha helix,
so they'll disrupt one if it ever

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
tried to form.
So that's one of the elements of

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
protein structure.
So what you might get from this is

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the idea that somewhere along here
this little piece of the linear

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
sequence is apt to be an alpha helix.
And you can represent that as this

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
little sort of coil that you see in
these 3-dimensional structures.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
The other one, which is the beta
sheet, now that involves

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
interactions between two pieces of,
two stretches of amino acids.  Maybe

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
there was a loop in between.
And then you can get interactions

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
between them.  And that,
oops.  Let me just go, there's the

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
beta sheet interaction.
Now, those are represented as

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
arrows.  You know,
it takes two of them to go.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So you've got to have, to represent
a beta sheet in a 3-dimensional

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
structure you have to have two of
those broad arrows.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And there was a question why were
there arrows on them?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Well, one of the things,
I think you can see if you look at

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
those backbones,
is that both nucleic acid and

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
protein backbones,
there's a polarity.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
If you start in this direction,
the amino terminus, it's got a

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
particular direction.
It's not symmetric.  If you come

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
back the other way you find carboxyl,
amino, the alpha carbon.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And you'll find it in the opposite
order if you come back the other way.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So there's an inherent polarity.
The arrows aren't represented on

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
here, but they are when you look at
it in 3-dimensions.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And you can either form beta sheets
where the two strands have the same

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
polarity or, if in a case like that
where they loop back,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
then of course if this one was
pointing in this direction as it

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
goes through the loop then the
opposite strand will be pointing in

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the other polarity,
one going this way and one going

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that way.  So this part
is sort of helpful.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
You can make guesses that maybe this
part has a tendency over here to

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
form a beta sheet,
but you still haven't gotten very

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
far towards understanding how you
get to the 3-dimensional structure.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And just by putting on and
superimposing some amino acids onto

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
that alpha helix then you can see
what happens, that if you form an

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
alpha helix what happens is all the
side chains stick out.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And now I think you can see,
those of you who are engineers

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
anyway, if you wanted to build
something you have a cylinder and

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
you can stick amino acids out that
have particular chemical

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
characteristics.
And depending on the

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
characteristics of those amino acids,
whether they have charges on them or

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
if they hate water or something,
that will influence what happens to

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that component of the protein
structure when it gets into a

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
3-dimensional thing.
And, as I think I showed you the

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
other day, when we caught it looking
down the end on this particular

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
example, here are a couple of
aromatic amino acids right here,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
they're on the same side of the
helix and they would hate water.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Whereas, some of the other amino
acids up here are ones that have

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
charges so those would love water.
So what this would look like is a

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
cylinder part of which hated water
and part of which loved water.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And you might guess it folded up in
3-dimensional space.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
The part that hated water might
fold towards the inside

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
of the protein.
And the part of the cylinder that

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
loved water would face to the
outside.  So that's sort of the

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
underlying principle.
So the rest of the other forces

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that we had to understand in order
to get to what's called the tertiary

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
structure, this is the full 3D
structure, which we can now

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
determine by a variety of methods.
X-ray crystallography of proteins

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
is probably the most common.
The NMR, for example,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
can be used to derive a
3-dimensional structure as well.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And the other forces then that go
into this are ionic forces.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Someone seemed confused by this,
but if you have a plus charge on

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
this part of an amino acid and a
minus charge here,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
if in 3-dimensional space the plus
charge got somewhere near the minus

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
charge then that would
form an ionic bond.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And I think most of you know enough
electricity and magnetism that

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
wouldn't surprise you that those two
would be attracted.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The one that I think that has been
harder to understand is van der

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Waals interactions that we talked
about the other day,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
which is tricky in the sense that
for this course you don't

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
particularly really need to
understand the underlying

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
chemistry.
But the principal of it is that if

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
you have a nonpolar bond,
one that hasn't got any particular

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
attraction to it,
gets very, very close to another one,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
then the transient fluctuations in
one induce something in the other

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
one that makes them stick together.
And the whole point about this is

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
if you get two molecular surfaces
that are very,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
very close together,
about, you know, many two times the

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
length of a covalent bond or
something, then you can generate

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
very powerful forces.
Because even though each individual

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
interaction is weak,
about a quarter or a third of a

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
hydrogen bond,
summing them up can make them very,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
very strong.  And so that's another
kind of force that's important when

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
a linear molecule is trying to
figure out how in space it's going

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
to fold up.  The point of the gecko
thing was it's only relatively

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
recently been discovered that the
reason those lizards can stick to

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
walls is they have sort of
incredible split ends.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I noticed a couple of you came to
Bob Full's talk the other day and

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
you got to hear the full treatment.
But because the hairs on their feet

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
are so split they're very fine and
the molecules are able to make very

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
close interactions,
van der Waals interactions with the

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
surface.  And that's what's holding
the gecko to the wall.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And there are just so many of them
that it can support a whole gecko.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And that's what could be the basis
of, he said to me,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
a $30 to $50 billion adhesive
industry, a self-cleaning dry

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
adhesive.  And it's not something
magic only the gecko hair will do.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
You can design synthetic molecules
that have the same property and are

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
able to make these millions of van
der Waals interactions.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So that's two of the other things.
And the final thing, which isn't

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
really a force but goes into this,
is this hydrophobic effect.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And that is that if we have things,
amino acids such as valine or

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
something that doesn't like to mix
with water, then when the protein

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
folds up, the things that don't like
to interact with water will kind of

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
go together just the way if you put
a lot of oil in the water it will

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
sort of pull together.
Because any time you have something

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
that gets stuck in water,
it disrupts hydrogen bonds and

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
that's energetically unfavorable.
So the things that hate water will

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
tend to lump together.
And you're all used to seeing

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
little drops of oil and stuff
floating around.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And let me switch over to this
other thing now.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So this was just showing you one of

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
these protein chains that's folded
up into a 3-dimensional structure.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
This happens to be something with
an enzymatic activity.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
But the important thing for right
now is what's been colored in here

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
are the amino acids that if you look
back on the list of amino acids and

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
what categories are,
you'd see some of them are said to

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
have hydrophobic side chains.
You can see quite strikingly how

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
the amino acids in the interior part
of this protein have clustered

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
together.  They don't like to
interact with water.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
They interact very well with each
other.  Just like you can mix butter

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and oil, they mix together
very well.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And so that is another factor that
contributes to the 3-dimensional

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
structure of these proteins.
So understanding what proteins are

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
all about means ultimately
understanding their 3-dimensional

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
structure.  And,
as I say, a big unsolved problem

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
right at the moment is how do you
get from a linear chain of amino

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
acids to one of these 3-dimensional
structures?  And you can imagine

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
with 20 different side chains
there's an unbelievable number of

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
combinations that you can make.
Yet almost every protein in nature

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
has one unique or one or two or
something confirmations that takes

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
out, out of all the kinds of things
that you could do.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And it's this combination of forces
that does that.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
You know, let me just go back for
one second.  So the final thing that

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
ones talks about when you're talking
about proteins are quaternary

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
structure.
And what that means is when you have

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
more than one polypeptide chain,
so if we have two different proteins

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
that interact,
this is protein number one and this

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
is protein number two,
then there has to be some sort of

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
interaction between each of these
three dimensional structures in

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
order for the proteins
to stick together.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Something like that flagellar motor
that let's the bacteria swim,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
has many, many parts, all of which
have to fit together just the same

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
way all the different parts of an
engine have to fit together.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Now this next little movie is just
a dimer.  It's actually a

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
heterodimer so it's made of two
proteins.  They're different but

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
they've come together and they're
interaction.  So what you will first

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
see is the 3-dimensional structure
of each protein showing the alpha

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
helices, the beta sheets,
and nothing else is shown.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
The side chains aren't shown.
The molecular surfaces aren't shown.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
You can just see the backbone.
You'll see alpha helix a turn, some

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
beta sheets, just the kind of stuff
you were seeing the other day.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
But you'll see that the two
proteins are together.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And this is actually a movie made
by Tom Schwartz who's a

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
crystallogram who just started on
our facility this fall in the

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
biology department.
It's one of the proteins he studied.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And then after that he rotates it
around so you can see it.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
After that he then puts on the side
chains and then traces the surface.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
So this is what they call the van
der Waals surface.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So this is what the protein would
actually look like.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And what I think you'll see from
this is how incredibly well the

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
proteins fit together.
The theme I'll probably keep saying

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
all the way through the course is
biology works from fitting shapes.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And things have to work incredibly
well, and that's also why these van

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
der Waals forces become
so important.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Because evolution has ended up
making things that just go together

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
just like a hand in a perfectly fit
glove.  That's the way most of these

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
interactions are.
So watch this little movie.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
So the light blue is one of the
proteins.  There's an alpha helix.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
There are a lot of alpha helices in
this one.  And the purple one is the

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
other protein.
And you can see that in between

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
them there's an interface.
And so those must be interacting.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
But when he superimposes now all the
amino acids in the surface,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
now what he's going to do, he's
going to pull those apart so you can

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:42.000
see where they were interacting.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Do you get the idea now of how
beautifully these things have folded

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
up in 3-dimensional space in
positions so that they can fit

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
together and work together as a
machine?  Just the same way if you

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
were building a machine and you
needed to have two parts that you

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
had to join together you've got a
tool thing so that the surfaces go

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
exactly together.
That's what nature does.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
That's also why I'm making such a
deal out of this 3-dimensioanl

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
structure of proteins and how it got
there.  I could just say it gets

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
there by magic,
but it doesn't.  It's determined by

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
this set of forces.
And one of the things we cannot do

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
at this point is predict.
Here's a linear sequence of amino

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
acids.  Here's the 3D structure.
That would be a huge advance in

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
biology if one of you guys could
figure out how to do that

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
during your career.
OK.  So I just want to reiterate

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
some of the things that proteins do
because we'll be talking about them

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
as we go along.
One thing they do,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
they act as enzymes which are
catalysts for biological reactions

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
that take place under physiological
conditions.  And we'll give you a

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
lot of examples of those enzymes
starting very soon.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
They play structural roles.
Our hair, our fingernails are made

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
of protein.  The hairs on the
gecko's feet are made of keratin

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
which is the same stuff our hair is
made of, except they basically got a

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
whole lot of split ends.
They're finer hairs to begin with

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
and a lot of split ends.
And that's what makes these very,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
very fine things that can make van
der Waals interactions

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
with surfaces.
They play roles in specificity.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
For example, I mentioned the
antibodies.  And we'll talk about

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
the immune response in some detail
at the end of the course.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And one of the really magic things
that we've come to understand in

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
biology recently is how it is that
your body has this immune system

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000
that's able to recognize literally
any molecule, any molecule.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
It doesn't matter whether it is
existed or you and your PhD thesis

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
in chemistry synthesize something
the world has never seen before,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
your immune system can create an
antibody or something that will very,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
very specifically recognize that
particular shape in just the same

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
sort of way that you saw the shape
on that movie.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And you might think you'd need to
code a zillion millions of DNA in

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
order to do that.
But there's a trick using

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
combinatorial functions and mutation
that lets your body do that.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Another example, which I was
showing you, that can do all sorts

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
of little motors and machines,
I showed you the bacteria swimming

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
around.  These are just E.
coli.  And you cannot see the

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
flagellar motors,
but you can see them buzzing around

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
just under a cover slip.
Some of them are stuck to the cover

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
slip.  There we go.
In this one, which was taken by

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Howard Burge who is a professor at
Harvard, I just took this off his

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
website, you can see the bacteria
swimming by having these flagella

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
which are basically like sort of
propellers more or less that they

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
turn.  Here's one where he used the
strobe so you can get a little bit

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
better view of it.
And I showed you this picture in

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
the first lecture.
So that's the machine,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
but every single part of that
machine is made of a protein that's

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
got a very certain 3-dimensional
space.  And we're going to start

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
talking about energetics,
how does this cell get energy?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
And one of the things you might
wonder is if you were to design such

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
a nano machine how would you power
it?  They exist.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
I mean it's here.
But that's why in part I'm going to

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
start talking about energy and how
cells make energy,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
because this is one of the things
they have to do.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And that was, as I said,
was an average electron micrograph

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
of a lot of those motors.
So you can see that although,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
you know, that's the textbook thing,
the actual thing is pretty much the

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
same shape.  This is not at a
resolution where you can make out

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
the individual proteins that put it
together, but some of those are

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
starting to be known in
3-dimensional detail.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And I thought you might enjoy
seeing this just to convince you

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
it's a motor.  In this thing,
what Howard Burge did was he stuck

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
the propeller,
if you will, the flagellar to a

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
cover slip using an antibody.
And then he let them do their thing.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
And normally they would be turning
the propeller and swimming,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
but if the propeller is attached the
same thing would happen if you held

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
onto the propeller of a boat and
turned on the motor the boat would

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
start twirling around.
And what you're seeing here is

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
bacterial that are twirling around
because their flagellar

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
are stuck on.
And those of you who are observant

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
will notice even that they change
direction.  And that's part of the

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
system that bacteria use so they can
swim towards a food source or away

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
from another one.
OK.  Here's just something to let

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
you think about it.
If anybody can figure this out send

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
me an email.  Here's something else.
The phenomenon I'm going to show

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
you is due to a protein made by a
soil bacterium called Pseudomonas

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
syringae.  You don't
need to know that.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
It associated with plants.
And what you're going to see is a

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
little movie made by a couple of
post-docs in my lab where they took

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
pure water.  And if it's pure water
you can cool it below freezing.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
You can get it down to, I don't
know, minus eight degrees centigrade

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
and it still will be a liquid,
even though you know water freezes

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
at zero degrees centigrade.
And what it has to do in order to

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
turn into ice,
somewhere you have to nucleate the

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
formation of an ice crystal.
And once it goes,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
going.  So, anyway,
what you're going to see is some

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
super- cooled water they've made.
You can see there is zero degrees

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
there.  And this is Metchitaga,
one of the post-docs in my lab.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
That's the super-cooled water.
She's taking a little bit of

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
culture of this Pseudomonas syringae,
and she's just going to put it in,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
give a little tiny squirt, a few
micro-liters into that water.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Now it's going all cloudy.
And now you might wonder what's

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
happening there.
But, as you'll discovery,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
what happened is that what was
liquid water is now ice.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
That is due to one protein that this

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
bacterium makes and displays on its
surface.  And here's a controlled

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
experiment.  This is putting in a
little bit of rhizobium meliloti,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
another soil organism, and the same
amount of bacteria.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000
It didn't happen.
OK.  So that's due to a protein

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:17.000
that was on the surface of that
bacterium.  Anybody have any idea

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000
what that could do?
Send me an email.  OK.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000
There's one last class of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] macromolecule.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Those are lipids.
These are a little different in the

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
sense that this is not know a long
chain made by joining together

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
subunits as you see with the
proteins and nucleic acids,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
but putting together the parts
necessary to make a lipid involve

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
the same principle,
that you end up splitting out water

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
molecules.  That's a theme you've
heard over and over again.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And if we take three long chain,
three fatty acids, some number of

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
carbons --

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Some number of carbons.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Just some arbitrary number here.
And then we take a three carbon

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:41.000
compound that has three hydroxyl
groups.  Now, this is not a

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.000
carbohydrate because you'll notice
there's not a double bond oxygen as

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
you saw in the carbohydrates.
It's actually an alcohol that's

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.000
known as glycerol.
And if we split out water like this

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:12.000
what you get is a fat,
something you're familiar with from

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:20.000
beef fat.  Or if you get something
like olive oil,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:28.000
you've heard the term unsaturated
fats.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Maybe you'll recall from the second
lecture that if we had a single

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
covalent bond,
or if we had a double or a triple

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
bond that was called an unsaturated
bond.  So if you have an unsaturated

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
bond in here somewhere then you end
up with an unsaturated fat.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And most of you know probably
something like beef fat is solid.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
If you put it in a refrigerator
something like peanut oil

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
will stay liquid.
And that's because if you have just

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
saturated side chains from this then
they pack together very tightly and

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
they will form a solid.
If you put a double bond in then

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
there's a kink in the backbone and
it's hard for these things to pack

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000
together.  And that's why they're
called unsaturated fats.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Now, there's a very particular kind
of lipid that's of unbelievable

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
importance in biology known
as a phospholipid.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
And the reason that's so important
is that that is the boundary that

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
determines the outside of a cell.
So every cell, every organism

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
either is a single cell or is made
up of multiple cells.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And, as I said in the first lecture,
that one of the secrets to life is

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
having a boundary that goes around
your insides it separates your

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
insides from all the rest
of the universe.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And the way these membranes,
as they're called, are made of is

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:17.000
what's known as a phospholipid
bilayer.  And it's the same

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:25.000
principle as before.
It uses a glycerol, except that one

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:34.000
of the fatty acids is replaced by a
phosphate group that will have some

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:44.000
kind decoration added onto it.
And the other will have fatty acids

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:59.000
at the other two positions.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Now, you'll notice by splitting out
water here, the kind of bond that we

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
have created, the chemical name of
this is an ester bond.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
And if we wanted to break it we
could add water back across it.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000
So what's important about this
molecule is this part of the

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
molecule, if you will,
is water-loving because the very

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
polar bonds here,
the oxygen here would have a

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
negative charge under physiological
conditions.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
And this part is,
if you will, water-hating.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
So phospholipids are often
represented in the following way

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
where this is the water-loving and
then this would be the water-hating

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
part here.
And so if you take phospholipids and

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:12.000
you just try and disperse them in
water, they spontaneously

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:20.000
self-assemble into structures that
bring the water-loving parts

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
together and the water-hating parts
together.  And by so doing this they

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000
form what's known as a
phospholipid bilayer.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
And that's what this membrane is
made of.  Membrane of bacterial cell,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
membrane of our cells virtually the
same thing.  It has the property

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
that is not permeable to very much.
Water can get across a very limited

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
number of other chemical compounds,
but most things cannot.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
And so, by having this membrane,
what the cell is able to do then is

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
control who comes in and who comes
out.  And the way it does that is it

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
has to put particular importers or
exporters imbedded in the membrane

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
that can carry out those functions.
Because, as you would guess, any

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
system would have to bring stuff in,
get rid of waste, you'd have to be

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
able to go back and forth.
The things that do all those

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
transports across the membrane are,
what kind of molecule do you think

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
it likely to be?
If nature was going to design

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
something that was a pump to get
something in or something that would

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
get something out,
any idea what kind of molecule?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Take a guess given what I've said
so far.  Protein.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Yeah.  Absolutely.
And let me just sort of show you a

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
couple little pictures here.
So here's a representation of this

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
phospholipid bilayer.
This is pretty standard stuff.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
This is what you'd put on a
blackboard.  Here's in gray now the

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
phospholipid.  And here's one of
these proteins,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
a picture of one of these proteins
that functions to get things across

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
the membrane.  And hopefully what
you can see now is that it's made up

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
of a whole lot of alpha helices,
and they pack together to give sort

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
of a cylinder made up of different
alpha helices that weave in out like

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
this.  And then by this sort of
trick the protein is able to create

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
a channel that runs up and down the
middle of this protein that's

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
imbedded in the membrane.
And then, depending on the

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
characteristics that channel,
it can either be used to bring stuff

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
in or get rid of it.
There is a more fanciful depiction

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
of it.  This is not reality,
but there you are with the

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
water-loving parts.
Here are the fatty acids going in.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
And this is supposed to be one of
these membrane proteins.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Now, this next movie is trying to
pretend here that it's looking at

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
one of these membrane proteins
colored here in red as it

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
spans the membrane.
So here's looking from the membrane

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
surface on.  And now it's going to
dive into this thing as it crossed

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
the membrane.  And basically what
this movie is letting you do is feel

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
like if you were the molecule that's
being transported across the

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
membrane you'd see how you'd go
right down through a channel in the

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
middle of the protein.
So that's one of the underlying

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
principals then,
is that you have a phospholipid

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
boundary that's critical for life.
But then to have everything else

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
that needs to happen the cell makes
a series of proteins that function

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
either to bring stuff in or to bring
it out.  Or in the case of something

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
like the flagellar motor we talked
about it has to imbed a part of the

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
machinery right in the membrane.
And one last picture I just want to

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
show you.
Usually, even on that movie,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
you tend to see the cell represented
something like this with a membrane

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
and every once in a while there's a
protein.  This is a cartoon but it

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
is much closer to a to-scale drawing.
This is an E.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
coli cell.  Now,
they have an extra membrane that we

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
won't worry about right for the
moment.  But right there,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
this little piece that we can see
little bits of, is the

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
cell's membrane.
And what this picture is showing is

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
that this membrane is just
absolutely studded with membrane

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
proteins that are going to carry out
various functions.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
And here actually we're seeing that
motor which is imbedded both in the

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
inner and outer membrane.
And there's the motor going off.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
But a couple of things maybe you
can take home from this is there are

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
a lot of proteins stuck in those
membranes that control what goes in

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
and out.  You also get a sense in
here of how crowded

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
the cytoplasm is.
The proteins are really at amazingly

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
high concentrations when they're
inside the cytoplasm.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
OK.  So that's sort of a quick
survey.  It's nothing more that a

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
really superficial introduction to
the four classes of biomolecules.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
But to go any farther we're going
to have to think a little bit now

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000
about of the characteristics
of living cells.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
I don't know if any of you know if
any of you know what this is,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
but this is bakers yeast.  If you
were making bread you know you put

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
some yeast in it and it divides and
it gives off carbon dioxide as a

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
waste product and makes the bread
rise.  And what's happened in that

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
little movie you just saw were two
cells dividing to give four,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
and four dividing to get eight,
and I don't know what we're up to

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
here, but you can see a cell grow.
That's sped up.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
It takes probably something closer
to an hour for a cell division to

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
take place.  But this is the kind of
thing that microorganisms do when

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000
they grow, is you can start with a
single cell and it will make two

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
cells that are identical to itself
and those will make four.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
And what happens when we start out
as a single cell,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
we start out initially like this.
And we make cells that are identical

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
at the beginning.
And those are the famous embryonic

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
stem cells, because at this point
they can become any cell in your

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
body.  And if you're a yeast it
doesn't matter.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Everything you make is the same.
If it's a human, once you start

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
dividing at some point cells are
going to have to start making

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
decisions and the progeny will have
to start to be different of each

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
other so that you can have something
that's an eye and another cell

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
that's in the liver and so on.
And we'll talk a little bit about

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
that as we go on.
But the major point,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
right at this point, is that all of
life involves one cell dividing and

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
giving a couple of other cells,
and then those going on.  So these

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
cells, as we've said,
characteristics of organisms which

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
are to be true at their cellular
level as well is that they carry out

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
metabolism, they undergo
regulated growth.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
And you have a nice example of yeast
undergoing regulated growth and they

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
reproduce, which in the case of a
single-celled organism is the same

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
as cell division.
For us reproducing is a lot more

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
complicated because we have to make
a whole other multicellular organism

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
where the cells have differentiated
functions, but the point about that

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
is there has to be an unbelievable
amount of synthesis.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
The DNA in our body,
we start out with two meters in a

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
fertilized cell,
and we have ten to the fourteenth

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
cells by the time we're an adult.
So we've had to make a tremendous

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
amount of DNA let alone protein and
everything else.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
And something almost all of you
know from your engineering

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
background from this place is that
you need energy in order

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000
to synthesize material.
And what we'll start to talk about

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
in the next phase of this course
then is how do cells make energy and

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000
how do they carry out metabolism.
So I'm going to, just before we do

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
that, introduce to you very quickly,
to close out here, two classes of

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
organisms that we find in nature.
We find organisms that are known as

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000
autotrophs.  These are certain
bacteria, and they're able to make

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
everything they need starting with
CO2, ammonia, phosphate,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:20.000
water, a few things, but that's all
they need.  So,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000
for example, an organism that lives,
a bacterium that lives out in the

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.000
open ocean is able to make
everything from those very,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:43.000
very simple basic building blocks.
Heterotrophs need to eat --

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:52.000
-- some things made by

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:06.000
other organisms.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
An example of a heterotroph that
you're familiar with,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
that I'm familiar with is us.
You probably remember your mother

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
reminding you,
as you're about to have yet another

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
hotdog, that it was important to eat
your vitamins.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
The reason you need to eat vitamins,
those are things we absolutely need

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
for our life but we cannot make them
ourselves.  Vitamin C is

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
one you probably know.
It has an interesting history how

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
people figured this out.
It was sailors at sea got really,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
really sick.  Their teeth would
start to loosen,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
they would start to bleed and they
would die.  Some of the famous sea

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
voyages you heard about in high
school, I think the Cape of Good

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Hope, on that trip where that was
discovered 100 out of the 160

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
sailors died at sea because of
scurvy.  Now, scurvy turns out to be

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
due to not having vitamin C.
And there was finally a guy,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Lind, I'm just blanking on his first
name at the moment,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
in about the 1700s who was a naval
surgeon in the British Navy who

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
actually figured out that if you
gave sailors lemon juice that they

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
didn't get scurvy.
It was a controlled experiment.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
It took about 50 years.  I think it
was 1795 when they started to

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
finally give the sailors lemon juice
and stopped having this terrible

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
sickness amongst their sailors.
And then in about 1950 they

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
substituted lime juice.
And some of you may still know the

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
British sailors are called ìlimeysî.
And that was because of this

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
solution they found to avoiding
scurvy.  And what was really

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
happening was they were finding a
way to provide vitamin C which is in

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
fresh fruits and vegetables which
wasn't part of the classic sailor

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
diet which was sort of biscuits and
dried meat during long voyages at

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000
sea.  And there are several other
vitamins, but the reason they're

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
called vitamins is they're things
that you body cannot make but other

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
organisms can.
The other thing that we cannot make,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:14.000
we can make some of our 20 amino
acids, but there are eight amino

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:23.000
acids that we cannot make,
lysine, methionine, lucien,

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:33.000
isoleucine, valine, threonine,
phenylalanine and tryptophan.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And this actually has consequences
for us because those of you who are

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
vegetarians probably know you have
to be kind of careful about your

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
diet.  If you're eating animal
protein you're getting essentially

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
all the different amino acids,
but if you're a vegetarian you have

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
to be careful because the major food
crops such as wheat and rice,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
for example, are very low in lysine.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
So if you just eat those you end up
with a lysine deficiency that's not

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
good.  But, on the other hand,
beans, lentils, the various

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
leguminous plants,
which also are those ones that form

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
the special associations with
bacteria that let them convert

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia,
legumes are high in lysine but low

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
in methionine.
So peoples all over the world

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
figured this out by trial and error.
So the Mexican diet is rice and

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
beans.  There's a reason for it.
What's happening actually is just

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
in the rice you're low in lysine,
but by having beans at the same time

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
you're balancing out the two.
Or the Native Americans in this pat

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
of the country had ìthe three
sistersî with the corn, the

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
squash and the beans.
And again they were balancing out

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
the diet by making sure that they
got the various amino acids,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
a balance of all the amino acids
that were necessary for life.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
It also actually was really good
gardening practice because the beans

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
were able to convert atmospheric
nitrogen into ammonia,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
which was fertilizer, and the squash
leaves shaded the ground so that the

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
ground didn't dry out,
and the corn could grow even when it

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
was short on water.
But what was really happening,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
as people grew without even
understanding about chemistry,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
they were compensating for the fact
that we're heterotrophs and needed

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
to do this.  So we'll start in the
next lecture on trying to talk about

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
how cells make energy and how it
makes some of this amazing

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
stuff happen.

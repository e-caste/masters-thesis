00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:27.570
PROFESSOR: Welcome
everyone, today.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.000
Today we're going to be talking
about advanced concepts.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.230
These are kind of
like what I would

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.021
consider the next
generation of solar cells

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.310
if these ideas pan out.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.268
Some of them are very
near and dear to my heart

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:39.400
because it's what my research
is mainly focused on.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.467
Also another quick
realization I had last week.

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:43.550
Probably Tonio mentioned
this to me at some point,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.880
but do you guys know
where 626 comes from,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.280
why the course is called that?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:58.770
So 6.26 times 10 to the minus
34th is Planck's constant.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.350
So haha, funny.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.670
Thought that was kind of cool.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.120
It's a little joke put in there.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.241
So anyhow without further ado,
one of the cool things-- cells

00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:11.740
are done.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.290
Yay.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.180
This is great news.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.880
I was very, very happy.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.872
So it didn't go quite
as well as expected.

00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:20.330
I think most of
you are finding out

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.580
that these are incredibly
[INAUDIBLE] limited.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.657
I'm going to talk about why
that might be in a second.

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:27.240
Hopefully that will
help you guide you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.656
through your
analysis, which we'll

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:31.170
be doing for the final
part of the quiz 2.3,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.590
which hopefully I'll be able to
post by tomorrow afternoon-ish.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.650
I'm still working
on that right now.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.280
But just to give you guys
kind of the processing

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.320
that you didn't get
to see, this is what

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.630
the contact firing looks like.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.080
It's a very, very,
very fast process.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.600
It's really remarkable
to me that this

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.530
combines so many
photlithographic steps

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.220
that if you wanted to
make this in the lab using

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.010
photlithography, and
condenses these six or seven

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.190
steps into one process.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.860
So it's pretty remarkable.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.630
So DuPont, the people who
made the pace-- so we used

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.630
PV16A if you guys are curious
for our front contacts

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.961
for silver paste.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.919
And we actually get--
the really important part

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.089
is this peaking
temperature, and you

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:15.380
can see we actually got pretty
close to the ramp times.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.680
Where it really starts
to deviate is here,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.690
and we hold it around 400,
a little bit longer, which

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.540
is several reasons for that, and
I'll go into that in a second.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.990
But what's important
is that all these are

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.650
fired in an oxygen atmosphere.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.420
So normally in
these belt furnaces,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.920
and this is again what's used
in industry-- this is actually

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.720
the same exact tool
that I use at Harvard--

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.390
it actually looks like this with
the giant CRT monitor on top.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.270
The only way to get the data
off is with a three and a half

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.076
floppy drive.

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:43.450
I can't tell you
how difficult it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.930
was to find a working three
and a half floppy drive.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.380
Most of them are
demagnetized at this point.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.330
I had to buy new ones.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.420
They're still being
made, by the way.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.753
If you want them, go to Staples.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.300
So anyhow, it's done in
an oxygen atmosphere,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.030
so they generally force airflow
into these giant belt furnaces,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.230
and these are really long.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.380
Like that's probably
about a foot

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.690
wide, maybe 18 inches wide.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.220
So this goes on for tens
of feet, or several meters,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.250
depending on where you're from.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.510
And it's done an oxygen
atmosphere, an air atmosphere,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.445
because it needs to burn
off a lot of the binders

00:03:17.445 --> 00:03:19.570
and some of the organics
that might still be there.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.944
And so those organics burn
off, and what you're left with

00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:26.410
are the little metal particles,
the frit, and some metal oxide

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.910
glass.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.430
It's usually lead oxide,
although DuPont will never

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.040
tell you, but from
papers I've read

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.690
this is generally what's used.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.930
So when that happens-- this
is that burn-off period.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.414
When it spikes, the
frit will actually

00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:44.080
burn through your
silicon nitride layer.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.954
You guys didn't have a
silicon nitride layer,

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:48.262
but if it was there, it
would help eat through it.

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:50.220
And so that way, you've
removed the dielectrics

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.460
so you can actually make metal
contact with your silicon

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.880
surface underneath.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.400
That firing will-- during
that peak also simultaneously,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.850
these middle particles
will melt and form

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.710
this triple eutectic point
with the silicon underneath it.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.790
And so the triple comes from
the silver, the silicon,

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.342
and the lead.

00:04:09.342 --> 00:04:11.440
The lead actually
dissociates from the glass.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.810
This lowers the melting
temperature of that mixture,

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.130
and you can make good ohmic
contact with the surface.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.720
So it's actually a pretty
remarkable, incredible process.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.380
It's still almost
kind of magic to me

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.560
on how the whole thing
works, and a lot of it's

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.972
just kind of guess and check
and still very proprietary.

00:04:24.972 --> 00:04:26.930
So the science is still
a little lacking there.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.430
You don't find a lot of
good articles explaining

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.180
the science of it.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.846
I have a few if you
guys are interested.

00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:36.381
NREL's put out a lot of really
interesting stuff, and some

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:37.880
of the ways they
actually figure out

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.540
the actual profile underneath
the contacts versus you

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.690
measure the temperature on
the side of the contacts,

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.840
so actually touching the silicon
or the silicon nitride surface,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.150
is you actually measure hydrogen
diffusion underneath it.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.530
And so they'll actually
etch off the contacts

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.110
and using secondary ion
mass spectroscopy measure

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.531
the hydrogen concentration
off the contact

00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:01.530
and underneath the contact,
and that'll actually

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.280
tell you what temperature it
saw based on that diffusion

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.100
profile.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.230
So there is some good
science going on,

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.080
but there's not a lot
of great papers on it.

00:05:11.297 --> 00:05:12.880
So anyhow, that just
kind of gives you

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.505
what I was working
on over the weekend,

00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:16.100
trying to get these cells fired.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.940
So I aggregated a
lot of the results

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.464
and tried to make sense
of what was going on.

00:05:21.464 --> 00:05:23.880
I think I showed some of you
different firing temperatures

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.050
and the fill factors
that we got and there

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.150
was kind of just noisy data, so
I couldn't get any real trends.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.219
The best trend I could
find was that if you

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:33.260
take the median of all
the short-circuit currents

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.430
of the cells and
you look at the ones

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.100
with four millimeter and
two millimeter spacing,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.220
the four millimeter spacing
has a slightly higher

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.994
short-circuit
current, presumably

00:05:39.994 --> 00:05:40.910
due to shading losses.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.950
If you look at the relative
areas that each of these

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.658
cover up, you would
expect a 4% increase.

00:05:44.658 --> 00:05:48.440
This is about 3%, so
I'll take that as fact.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.717
It's certainly within
the noise and the error

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.300
of the number of
samples that we have,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.730
but I thought it was
interesting nonetheless.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.090
Additionally, I plotted
the series resistance

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.110
that I calculated from
your dark IV curves

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.854
and plotted your maximum power.

00:06:02.854 --> 00:06:04.770
I also removed all the
cells that were broken.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.437
I'm sure if I actually
normalized them--

00:06:06.437 --> 00:06:08.228
some of the cells that
were broken actually

00:06:08.228 --> 00:06:10.650
performed a lot better,
and I'll get into maybe why

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.492
that was the case in a second.

00:06:13.492 --> 00:06:14.950
But really the
take-home message is

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.825
that our really best
performing cells are all

00:06:16.825 --> 00:06:18.300
clumped over here.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.290
And so you can see that our best
cells have a very low series

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.915
resistance.

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.040
That's not always the case.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.790
There's some outliers,
like this guy here,

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.869
and I don't know
how that happened.

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:30.660
So some really interesting
things going on,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.500
and I'm still trying
to sift through it.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.874
So I talked about
this I think yesterday

00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:37.040
in the analysis section,
but there's several sources

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.980
of series resistance.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.033
Any of you guys familiar
with what they are?

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:44.327
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] resistance
and emitter sheet resistance.

00:06:44.327 --> 00:06:46.285
PROFESSOR: Emitter sheet
resistance, and then--

00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:47.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.480
PROFESSOR: So there's line
resistance along the fingers

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.480
and then there's
contact resistance,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.760
so I'm going to draw
this out really quickly.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.915
So if you have--
this is your emitter.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.080
You have a contact here
and a contact here.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.430
If you generate an electron
here, it'll diffuse,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.450
hit the junction.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.029
Then it has to flow through
the emitter to the contact.

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:17.820
There's an associated
resistance with that.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.870
That's the series
resistance that we

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.510
taught in class that has to do
with the emitter resistance.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.571
Additionally to hop over that
metal semiconductor junction,

00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:27.070
there's actually a
resistance there.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.528
That's called a
contact resistance.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:45.010
So this is emitter and
this is our contact,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.304
and then it has to travel from
the line to the busbar here,

00:07:48.304 --> 00:07:49.595
and that's our line resistance.

00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:56.760
And I think what's
really limiting us,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.182
because when I looked at both
the shallow and deep emitters,

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:03.640
the series resistance
didn't really

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.579
have any noticeable trends.

00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:08.120
So I really think that this is
what's limiting us completely,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.752
is our contact resistance,
which is kind of too bad.

00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:13.460
So one of the reasons
I think that that's

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.810
the case additionally
is that the cells

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.497
that performed the best-- I know
Joel's did particularly well.

00:08:19.497 --> 00:08:20.580
What was your fill factor?

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.270
Do you remember?

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.596
AUDIENCE: Well, on the one side
it was 0.5, and on the other

00:08:24.596 --> 00:08:26.470
it was 0.64.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.290
PROFESSOR: OK, so
one side was better.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.252
So again, the inhomogeneity
of doing the measurement

00:08:31.252 --> 00:08:33.460
is also another indication
that our series resistance

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.630
across the contacts
is really poor.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.760
So some of the other
contacts if you look on the--

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.151
where's my good piece of chalk?

00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:43.650
Right.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.820
If here's our busbar, some
people saw delamination.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.600
Who saw their
contacts delaminated?

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.380
Yeah, so a couple people.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.940
And so what that means is
that these contacts actually

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.010
peeled up, and that's usually
showing that the-- what's

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.020
funny, though, is that
these areas in the middle

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.800
didn't delaminate.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.580
It was only the edges
here, and so that's

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.370
showing that some parts
are being properly fired

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.887
and some parts are
being underfired

00:09:11.887 --> 00:09:13.720
because when I fired
at higher temperatures,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.110
I was getting shunting.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.810
And that was due to shunting
through the center area.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.230
So I think that the RTA
that I was using-- this

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.870
wasn't the case on some of the
earlier cells I had processed,

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.480
but is rather
inhomogeneous in terms

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.244
of the temperature profile
it's delivering to our cells.

00:09:30.244 --> 00:09:32.493
So I think that could be
part of our problem, as well.

00:09:32.493 --> 00:09:34.910
AUDIENCE: How many cells did
he fire up at the same time?

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:35.860
Just one, or--

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.871
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it's one at a time,

00:09:37.871 --> 00:09:40.370
and there's some variability
in the peak firing temperature.

00:09:42.867 --> 00:09:44.450
So I've learned a
lot about when we're

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.310
going to buy an RTA for
our lab, what to look for.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.980
The temporal
resolution of the data

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.500
you get out of it and how it
records it is 0.6 seconds.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.080
And when this thing's
ramping at 100 C per second,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.484
your variability is quite large.

00:09:58.484 --> 00:10:00.900
So the temperature I read is
not just from the data point,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.150
but I do a linear interpolation
to actually figure out

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.600
what the peak is on
both sides of that peak,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.150
and it ends up being about
anywhere from 20 to 40

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.660
degrees Celsius higher
using that technique.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.050
And so the variability varies.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.960
It's about 20
degrees plus or minus

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.770
10 degrees Celsius in terms
of what I want the peak to be

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.910
and what it actually is.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.490
So the RTA that we're using now
is not incredibly reputable.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.130
Also, better RTAs will
have a different heater

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.620
on top and bottom, and
so you can actually

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.250
heat one side more
than the other.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:40.160
And generally belt furnaces,
so commercial ones,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.840
will have that same
kind of control.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.780
I know at 1366, they've
actually done optimization

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.906
to do heating the top
and bottom differently

00:10:48.906 --> 00:10:51.280
because they use different
pace, they have different heat

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.225
requirements,
thermal requirements.

00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:55.770
And so nailing that
temperature and that profile

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.025
actually takes a lot of
iteration and a lot of time.

00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:00.780
And it's really just learning
the tell as opposed to,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.460
the again, good
science behind it.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.270
So it can be rather difficult
and time-consuming to do.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.242
So that's what I have
to say about the cells.

00:11:10.242 --> 00:11:12.450
I think overall, though, I
think the efficiencies are

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.250
on the order of 6% to I think
9% for some of the cells,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.660
so that's not too bad.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.850
I'm still rather
pleased with that.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.927
Last time I think
Tonio stopped right

00:11:24.927 --> 00:11:27.260
before he was going to talk
about performance of modules

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.710
in the field and kind
of what's the difference

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.070
between your cell efficiency
and your module efficiency.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.480
Modules are put out in the sun.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480
They heat up.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.440
They can get shaded by
snow, rain, clouds, trees,

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.050
and also the modulus are made
up of many different cells that

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.460
are connected in
series and parallel,

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.120
and how does that affect
their overall performance

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.110
of the module?

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.230
And so that's what we're going
to talk about really quickly.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.050
So first off, why does
temperature matter?

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.114
So all solar cells when
they're measured either at NREL

00:11:56.114 --> 00:11:58.280
or in our lab, are measured
under standard operating

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.405
conditions-- or standard
testing conditions, sorry.

00:12:00.405 --> 00:12:03.390
Certainly not standard
operating conditions.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.060
Standard testing conditions
are done at 25 C.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.280
Generally the cells
are actively cooled

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.290
to maintain that temperature
of room temperature,

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.460
and most semiconductor
simulations you perform

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.280
are generally done
at 300 Kelvin.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.350
I know all the calculations
I did for fitting

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.100
your [INAUDIBLE] diode
curve were done at 300

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.640
K. Typical operation can
actually be pretty hot,

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.264
so 50 to 65 degrees Celsius.

00:12:25.264 --> 00:12:27.805
I actually don't know if that
is in Fahrenheit, but it's hot.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.240
It's hotter than
Phoenix, and I'm

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.250
sure they get even
hotter in Phoenix.

00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:47.800
So the effective temperature--
so how does it affect Voc?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.245
If you recall, this
is our diad equation.

00:12:50.245 --> 00:12:51.620
We have our
illumination current,

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.950
which we'll get to
how that's affected

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:53.890
by temperature in a second.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.140
But for now, just ignore that.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.270
Assume it stays constant.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.080
So one of things that's
really affecting your Voc-- so

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.930
remember, your Voc is going
to make your current go to 0,

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.300
and the main thing
that's being altered

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.060
is your saturation current,
so your intrinsic carrier

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.580
concentration, your diffusivity.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.590
So who here thinks
your Voc is going

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.720
to go up with temperature?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.480
Anyone?

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.690
And who thinks it'll go down?

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.620
Who has no idea?

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.050
OK, so who raised their
hand for it'll go down?

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.550
Sorry.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.800
Ben, do you have any ideas
why that might be the case?

00:13:35.288 --> 00:13:36.767
AUDIENCE: No.

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:38.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.735
PROFESSOR: So what's
going to happen to your I0

00:13:40.735 --> 00:13:41.860
with increased temperature?

00:13:42.892 --> 00:13:44.975
AUDIENCE: The intrinsic
carrier concentration, ni,

00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:48.010
is going to increase, and
that should increase I0?

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.060
PROFESSOR: That
should increase I0,

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.320
so therefore it's going to take
a smaller voltage to counteract

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.160
I sub L to make I equal to 0.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.490
And so why does N sub I
increase with temperature?

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.330
AUDIENCE: Greater
thermal energy present

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.170
increases the film probability
that electrons can be

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.100
excited from the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.933
PROFESSOR: Right, so
it increases the number

00:14:13.933 --> 00:14:16.230
of thermally-promoted carriers.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.270
And so that effect can
actually be pretty stark,

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.150
and now we go to a demo.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.640
Yay.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.260
All right, so what we have here
is our favorite solar cell.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.960
This came, again, from
those small little toy

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.740
cars that we pulled off, and
again, these solar cells,

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.730
the cars will
assume were nothing,

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.150
and these are about $10
apiece, so pretty cheap.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.566
Probably cheaper than your
solar cells that you guys made.

00:14:41.322 --> 00:14:43.030
And, well, certain I
know they are cheap.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.180
The wafers themselves, by
the way, were $16 apiece,

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.388
so saying they were a dollar
was a little inaccurate.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.020
So anyhow, we have this
hooked up to a multimeter

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.754
and we're going to measure
the voltage off of it.

00:14:56.754 --> 00:14:58.670
I'm going to illuminate
it with our desk lamp,

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.669
and we can actually get
a pretty decent voltage.

00:15:00.669 --> 00:15:02.660
I can't actually see this.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.830
So it's about 0.57
volts, and now we're

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.380
going to subject
it to temperature.

00:15:10.134 --> 00:15:11.800
This is obviously a
gross overestimation

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.670
of what's actually
going to happen,

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.360
but can someone read
off-- Joel, can you

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.610
read the temperature for me?

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.360
AUDIENCE: The temperature,
or the voltage?

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.200
PROFESSOR: Sorry, the voltage.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.825
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:32.300
We're at 0.561 and decreasing
down to 0.55, 0.54, 0.53--

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.410
PROFESSOR: So it's going down.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.700
So congratulations
the people who

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.015
said it would go down, correct.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.080
Wow, that's actually quite hot.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.420
Anyhow, so that's what
happens in the field.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.590
So when these cells heat up,
you actually lose on your Voc.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.220
And if you really want to, you
can go through all the math.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.450
You know what the
equation is for your Voc.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:02.030
It's shown here, and you can
go through this if you like.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.110
It's all on PVCDROM if you want
to go through the derivation.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.820
You then can take the derivative
with respect to temperature.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.260
And if you plug in values
for crystalline silicon,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.730
it comes to about 2.2
millivolts per degree Celsius,

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.270
which sounds like
a small number,

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.065
but it's at around 0.1
volts if you go up to 65 C,

00:16:18.065 --> 00:16:21.360
so that's actually quite
a substantial amount.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.000
And again, when you're
going from 0.6 to 0.59,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.780
these small margins can make or
break a lot of installations,

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.670
so that's an important one.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.810
OK, now this one's
a little harder.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:41.270
What do you think will
happen with your illumination

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.799
current, or your ISC?

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:45.090
Who thinks it's going to go up?

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.150
Anyone?

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.400
Who thinks it's
going to go down?

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.269
Who thinks it's going
to stay the same?

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:56.560
Who has absolutely no idea
and didn't raise their hand?

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.560
OK, that's totally fine.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.420
This confused me,
as well, by the way.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.060
So when we think about it, what
is our short-circuit current

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.329
proportional to generally?

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.040
Anyone?

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:09.172 --> 00:17:11.630
PROFESSOR: Right, so generally
your illumination intensity.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.846
And what photons generally
are we collecting?

00:17:14.846 --> 00:17:16.130
AUDIENCE: Super bandgap.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.250
PROFESSOR: Super bandgap.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.130
So what could be happening is
our bandgap could be changing.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.050
I sub L, as Ben pointed
out, should increase

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.829
the flux of photons
above the bandgap,

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:30.940
and EG actually decreases
the temperature.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.730
So your bandgap actually
usually increases--

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.946
the true bandgap of
silicon defined--

00:17:35.946 --> 00:17:37.320
most properties
of semiconductors

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.864
are actually
defined at 0 Kelvin,

00:17:39.864 --> 00:17:41.280
and semiconductors
are technically

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.790
insulators because they
don't conduct electricity

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.142
at 0 Kelvin.

00:17:45.142 --> 00:17:47.350
That just means semiconductor
is a class of materials

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.870
that have a small enough bandgap
that they can thermally promote

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.370
carriers that they can actually
conduct some electricity

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.970
at room temperature.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.900
But the true bandgap of
silicon's around 1.17.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.630
And as you increase
temperature, you

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.030
get a reduction of the bandgap.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.279
And so what should happen
is your ISC should increase,

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:06.060
but only very, very slightly.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.750
So if you go over the derivation
for the actual decrease

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.520
in the overall efficiency,
there's a few things.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.950
One, remember your
maximum power is

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.630
your Voc times your ISC
times your fill factor.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.730
So if you want the
derivative of your max power

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.596
with respect to
temperature, you need

00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:28.470
to do the partial
derivatives and sum them up

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.053
for all of those
different components.

00:18:30.053 --> 00:18:33.600
So that's what this
calculation's doing.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.540
And again, this is what
it is for fill factor.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.880
This is all in Martin
Green's paper down here

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.960
and also on PVCDROM if you
guys are interested in that.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.230
Martin Green's
tabulated a lot of this,

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.140
making these general
expressions and also

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.990
fitting it to experimental
data to get that information.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.800
And then it ends up being
not a negligible percent,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.940
but about half a percent per
degree Celsius for silicon.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.160
So if you go up
by 40 degrees, you

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.985
can see that temperature's a
non-negligible effect in terms

00:19:07.985 --> 00:19:08.610
of performance.

00:19:11.306 --> 00:19:13.529
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
silicon's kind

00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:18.220
of below the ideal bandgap for
a single-junction solar cell?

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:18.850
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.975
AUDIENCE: If you had a
semi-conductor with one that

00:19:20.975 --> 00:19:23.098
was above that, would an
increase in temperature

00:19:23.098 --> 00:19:25.223
increase the efficiency
because it's getting simply

00:19:25.223 --> 00:19:26.890
closer to that bandgap?

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.349
PROFESSOR: Oh,
that's a good point.

00:19:28.349 --> 00:19:30.723
Generally temperature's a lot
worse because you're really

00:19:30.723 --> 00:19:31.690
going to hurt your Voc.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.754
You would increase your J0
tremendously with temperature

00:19:34.754 --> 00:19:36.670
because you're creating
more thermal carriers,

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.336
so your diffusion current that's
counteracting your illumination

00:19:39.336 --> 00:19:41.470
current is going to
increase dramatically,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.410
so temperature is
always your enemy.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.360
There was a great
picture on PVCDROM

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.550
of a solar install in
Antarctica and its perform

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.250
well above spec,
which is kind of cool.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.870
So yeah, temperature's
generally an enemy.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.590
And so a lot of people's
ideas have often

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.075
been like to do active cooling
and use that for waste heat,

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:03.450
and there's a lot of reasons
why that doesn't necessarily

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.260
economically make sense.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.370
But when you do, let's
say concentrated solar,

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:08.910
for example, and
I think Tonio will

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.010
talk about this in
the next lecture,

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.290
but concentrated solar is
you're putting in not just

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.460
one sun but about
1,000, maybe 10,000 suns

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.206
on one small device.

00:20:17.206 --> 00:20:19.580
And the idea there is you can
have a really small device,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.082
have it be really expensive
but incredibly efficient,

00:20:22.082 --> 00:20:23.790
on the order of 40%
efficient because you

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.040
have these stacks of
difference semiconductors

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.590
that absorb different regions
of the light preferentially.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.410
And those heat up tremendously
when you're being subjective.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.235
It's like an ant under a
magnifying glass or something.

00:20:37.235 --> 00:20:37.860
It can burn it.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.770
So they actually active
cooling to cool those cells.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.020
And they also have to track
the sun, as well, in order

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.590
to concentrate it.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.430
And the last thing which you
guys did for your exam number

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.870
one was the effect of light
intensity, where you looked

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.500
at light intensity
throughout the day,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.590
assumed some sinusoid
for the incident light,

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.940
and you measured how
your efficiency changes.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.620
And you remember, your Voc
decreases with light intensity

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.350
with your JSC, and that's due
to the decrease in the photon

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.090
flux.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.970
And your efficiency
goes down according

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.735
to those two equations there,
and I think the derating factor

00:21:15.735 --> 00:21:18.350
if you assume a sinusoid
that hits at one sun

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.699
and then declines, you
should derate your--

00:21:21.699 --> 00:21:23.240
if you use instead
of using peak sun,

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.161
you want to derate
that by about 20%.

00:21:25.161 --> 00:21:26.660
So it's actually
pretty substantial.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.230
I was kind of surprised
at that finding.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.540
So when V cells go
out into the field,

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.760
they are not just
one individual cell.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.910
So oftentimes you string these
in series and then in parallel.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.850
So right now we're just going to
look at series and in parallel

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.480
solely, and what you see here
are your three different cells

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.460
all mounted in series.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.840
So the top of this
cell is connected

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.285
to the bottom of this
cell, the top of this cell

00:21:52.285 --> 00:21:54.290
is connected to the
bottom of this cell.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.080
Our bad cell, marked here with
the I guess the denim pattern.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.786
I don't know what that
was in PowerPoint.

00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:02.160
But what's important
here is that

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.550
because the current
flowing to this one

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.760
is also flowing to this
one is flowing to this one,

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.120
the voltages add and the
currents are all matched.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.620
So the current out of
this stack of cells

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.540
is limited by your weakest cell.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.030
It can't exceed your
short-circuit current

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.420
of your weakest cell.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.390
So you can see that your
operating point for these three

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.610
cells is not ideal for this one.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.157
It's definitely way off
the peak operating point

00:22:27.157 --> 00:22:28.990
for this cell and way
off the peak operating

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.720
point for that cell.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.550
So it can be a pretty
detrimental effect,

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.630
and this is why
often in industry

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.570
when you do a series of
testing on your cells,

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.080
each cell gets tested either
using suns Voc or a very, very

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.740
fast IV measurement.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.000
You can [? bin ?] cells
based on their performance

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.457
and then match them so that
if you all your cells are

00:22:50.457 --> 00:22:52.873
perfectly matched, they're all
operating at the peak power

00:22:52.873 --> 00:22:55.590
point and you're getting the
most out of all those cells.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:01.150
And so that's why reducing the
variability within your process

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.397
can really, really increase
your module performance,

00:23:03.397 --> 00:23:05.230
and that's something a
lot of companies work

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.730
really, really hard at.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.040
Now, the other reason why
series is important to study

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.530
is the effect of shading.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.940
So when you decrease--
so let's say

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.931
a leaf falls on your solar
panel or it's partially shaded

00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:18.180
because you put it near trees.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.240
If you look at the BigBelly
Solar ones right near campus,

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.420
they're always in shade.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.747
It makes no sense to me.

00:23:25.747 --> 00:23:27.580
I think they might get
one hour of sun a day

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.210
in certain times of the
Anyhow, And so if you partially

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.060
shade one of the
cells, you can see

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.840
that the IV curve drops
down, and now this cell

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.026
is running in reverse bias.

00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:42.800
And when you're in reverse bias,
you're running a lot of current

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.520
through your shunts.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.880
And for those who were
here this morning,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.630
we know that shunts
are really, really bad

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.963
because that's where all your
current's running through.

00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:53.107
And if your current's
running through one localized

00:23:53.107 --> 00:23:54.940
spot, that's where it's
heating up the most,

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.106
and it can heat up to
temperatures that can actually

00:23:57.106 --> 00:23:59.750
melt the encapsulant or
completely destroy the cell,

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.700
so this can actually
be rather destructive.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:07.750
And generally once your cells
are made and encapsulated

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.230
in the module, it's really
hard to remove them and replace

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.730
that module.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.620
Pretty much the whole
module's kaput at that point,

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.810
so it's pretty destructive.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.280
So what people
generally do for-- yeah?

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.320
AUDIENCE: So in maintenance,
like yearly maintenance,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.700
you should clean the
panel because of the dirt,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.560
or is there any other thing
that you should do [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.060
PROFESSOR: There's
important things.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.982
So you don't want--
it helps if they're

00:24:35.982 --> 00:24:38.550
angled so snow and other
things will fall off of it.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.520
You don't want to
put it in areas

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.103
next to a chimney, for example,
where certain parts of the day

00:24:43.103 --> 00:24:47.810
it will be shaded,
or things like that.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.870
So I've seen some
studies on cleaning,

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.080
and it all depends on if it
economically makes sense.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.132
If you want to pay someone
to clean your panels,

00:24:56.132 --> 00:24:56.840
that's expensive.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.710
Is it worth it for them
to do that if you're only

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:00.802
saving just a little bit?

00:25:00.802 --> 00:25:03.260
Obviously, the shading's so
bad that it could detrimentally

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.470
ruin and destroy your module.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.420
It's really-- you
want to do that?

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.120
Ways to prevent the destruction
is actually a lot of cells

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.470
will have bypass diodes.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.456
So if a string goes
down, the current

00:25:15.456 --> 00:25:17.080
will just [? flow ?]
through that diode

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.790
and won't destroy the
cell, and so that's one way

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.740
of kind of fixing that problem.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.740
That's a great question.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.140
So now we're stacking
ourselves in parallel.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.380
Normally, again, in a module,
you have them in series

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.940
and then these stacks
of cells in series

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.856
are actually put in
parallel, but there's just

00:25:38.856 --> 00:25:41.670
an easy illustration.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.740
Again, cells in parallel,
you're matching in voltage

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.580
and the currents
are what add in.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.190
And so if one cell let's say
has a low output voltage,

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:57.375
it's going to shift
the operating power

00:25:57.375 --> 00:26:00.175
point for the other two cells
off of their maximum power

00:26:00.175 --> 00:26:05.660
point and you're going
to get a reduced output.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.450
And so this is actually
very analogous to this idea

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.930
that when you make
your cells larger,

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.930
generally their efficiency
and performance go down.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:18.046
You have a higher chance
of inhomogeneities

00:26:18.046 --> 00:26:20.420
and other things that might
detrimentally hurt your cell.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.290
And this is kind of
analogous to saying

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:25.470
when you hook a whole
bunch of cells in parallel,

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.124
you're limited by
your worst cell.

00:26:27.124 --> 00:26:29.040
And in this case, you're
limited by your worst

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.690
region of that
cell, and so that's

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.670
the same kind of analogy.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.540
And I think it's kind
of cool, and so you

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.710
can see this for a lot
of different cells.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.550
So these are actually
getting pretty big.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.230
So when you're getting
to-- I don't know

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:42.700
if they make cells this big.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.540
But it's 100 by 100.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.545
That's a meter squared.

00:26:46.545 --> 00:26:48.170
Wow, so maybe Cad-tel
can get that big.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:48.920
Actually, they do.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.484
Look, here's First
Solar right here.

00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:52.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.935
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:26:53.935 --> 00:26:55.026
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:55.026 --> 00:26:56.650
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.
[INAUDIBLE] modules.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.300
So some of the
cells you can see.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.612
So here's cells--
amorphous, submodule.

00:27:02.612 --> 00:27:04.720
Anyhow, so the idea
is that you're, again,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:11.140
limited by your most
defective region in the cell.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.730
And again, illustrated
by this idea

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:17.720
here is that if you take a cell,
you split it up into a grid,

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.090
and you model it as a bunch
of many cells operating

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:28.410
in parallel, you're again
limited by that bad region.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:33.010
And so this looks
a little outdated.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.940
So this is 2006.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:39.430
So this is cell performance
versus module performance,

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.200
and you can see that it's
also quite significant.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.820
One of the other things
that's different about cells

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.930
and modules is that you
have glass in front.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.754
So when you optimize--
for example, in class

00:27:50.754 --> 00:27:52.420
we optimized our
silicon nitride coating

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.680
for an air-silicon interface.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.720
Modules, you optimize at silicon
nitride coating for a silicon

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.320
to glass interface.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:06.950
And the glass, which has an
index refraction of about 1.5,

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.340
you're automatically going
to reflect 4% of the light,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.050
so that light's lost.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.270
But it does help with
your reflection losses

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.430
because you now have a
graded index of refraction.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.567
So it does reduce some of
those reflection losses

00:28:18.567 --> 00:28:19.400
from that interface.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:19.899
Yeah?

00:28:19.899 --> 00:28:23.114
AUDIENCE: Is this just silicon?

00:28:23.114 --> 00:28:24.780
PROFESSOR: I'm guessing
yes because this

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.250
is from Richard Swanson.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:27.547
This is Tonio's slide.

00:28:27.547 --> 00:28:29.630
My guess would be yes, but
don't quote me on that.

00:28:30.586 --> 00:28:34.897
AUDIENCE: So for the modules,
how is voltage and current

00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:35.397
controlled?

00:28:35.397 --> 00:28:37.757
I'm assuming that they control
it at a specific point.

00:28:37.757 --> 00:28:39.840
PROFESSOR: Yes, so that's
a great, great question,

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.340
actually.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.370
So your modules are
hooked up to an inverter.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.420
The output of your solar
cells are direct current,

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.260
and so you have to convert
that to alternating current.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.700
And the inverters are
actually rather intelligent.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.831
They'll actually constantly scan
at a very high frequency where

00:28:53.831 --> 00:28:55.830
it should be operating
and taking the derivative

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:59.032
and finding where
that optimal point is.

00:28:59.032 --> 00:29:00.865
And so one of the other
ideas is that if you

00:29:00.865 --> 00:29:02.630
have a bunch of
modules, usually those

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.049
are also hooked up in parallel.

00:29:04.049 --> 00:29:05.840
And the idea is to have
instead of just one

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.190
inverter, a microinverter-- so
small inverters for each one.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.960
So that way, each of those are
operating at the maximum power

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.360
point.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.310
And I think problem is that
inverters are expensive

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.930
and the larger
they are, generally

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.710
the more efficient they
are and cheaper can be.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.675
So I don't know how far
that idea's been realized,

00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:26.127
but it's a good question.

00:29:26.127 --> 00:29:26.960
Does that answer it?

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.280
So we have-- good,
plenty of time.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.710
So now we're moving
onto advanced concepts,

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.952
which, again, area
that I'm working in.

00:29:40.952 --> 00:29:41.660
Kind of exciting.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:46.550
These are ideas that are
very, very high efficiency,

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.836
potentially very
low-cost, and that's

00:29:49.836 --> 00:29:50.960
kind of the allure to them.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.460
And they're great science
and research projects,

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.946
so they're really
exciting to be in.

00:29:56.946 --> 00:29:58.570
So one of things that
kind of motivates

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.766
this work-- I think you guys
have seen this equation.

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:02.890
I know I've used it before.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:07.410
But you know that the defining
metric for the performance

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.310
of a cell in terms
of its economic cost

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.100
is dollars per watt, so
dollars per watt peak.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.930
This is all defined at
your peak sun elimination.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.671
This makes it
location-blind, right?

00:30:17.671 --> 00:30:20.170
The really important thing when
integrating it onto the grid

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.100
is how much are you
paying in terms of cents

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:22.880
per kilowatt hour.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.600
But to make it
location-blind, you

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.252
put it into dollars per
watt, and dollars per watt

00:30:32.252 --> 00:30:33.460
is a function of many things.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.100
It's how much does it cost
to make the module itself?

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.030
So how many dollars
per given area?

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.400
You divide it by the insulation.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.900
For dollars per
watt peak, you'd set

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.790
that to aim 1.5 or 1,000
kilowatts per meter squared.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.690
Multiply that times
your efficiency,

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:51.190
and then by your yield, which
is a manufacturing parameter.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.980
So for some cells where if you
can reduce this number quite

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.890
dramatically, so
for example, suppose

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.100
you decide to go to very,
very thin wafers for silicon.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.690
You want to move to 20 micron
wafers, let's say, which

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:07.220
is something that a lot of
companies now are working on.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.792
What happens is that those
become very, very fragile.

00:31:09.792 --> 00:31:12.250
And when you handle them and
using all these pick and place

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.166
operations to move them
to different processes

00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:16.870
within the cell fab,
oftentimes they'll break.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.257
And so that yield parameter
can come very important

00:31:19.257 --> 00:31:21.340
and [INAUDIBLE] interplayed
with this number here,

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.990
and that's why it's there.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.851
So anyhow, what this
graph is is this

00:31:25.851 --> 00:31:27.540
is the dollars
per meter squared,

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.500
so the cost of
producing that cell.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.990
And then you have
this efficiency here,

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.980
and each of these
lines represents

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.300
a certain dollars per watt.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.800
And so I think the DOE has
wanted us to get to $1.00 per

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.909
watt, and you can do that by
either producing incredibly

00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:46.950
efficient cells, around
50%, which seems a little

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:48.990
unreasonable.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.450
And they can cost $500
per meter squared,

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:55.406
and that would be
actually a cheap panel.

00:31:55.406 --> 00:31:57.780
Or the other idea is to go to
very, very low cost and low

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.810
efficiency, and you can try
to hover around in here.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.752
And so this nomenclature
I'm about to use

00:32:03.752 --> 00:32:06.210
is a little outdated, but I
think still some people use it,

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.820
although rather loosely.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.220
What's known as
first-generation-- and again,

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.842
these terms I've
read papers now they

00:32:12.842 --> 00:32:14.550
claim that they're
third-generation where

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.550
they used to be classified
as second-generation.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:19.300
It doesn't really matter,
but the ideas behind them

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.550
are still relevant.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.550
So the first-generation
with the single bandgap,

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.499
it's crystalline silicon still
[INAUDIBLE] the market leader,

00:32:25.499 --> 00:32:27.540
and they're on the order
of 15% to 20% efficient,

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.580
but they're still
relatively high-cost.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.996
And there's actually
a lot of work

00:32:30.996 --> 00:32:33.980
now that says that this
can move in this direction,

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:38.800
moving to thinner wafers,
increased laser processing.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.170
Just tighter manufacturing can
really bring that cost down.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.495
So your second-generation
are your thin film.

00:32:45.495 --> 00:32:50.120
So this is either CIGS,
amorphous silicon, organics.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.830
A lot of these very, very
cheap to deposit, cheap

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.510
to manufacture,
but they generally

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:58.210
suffer in efficiency, so they
hover around in this area.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.170
And so far, this
idea hasn't really

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.170
fulfilled itself except
for maybe cad-tel,

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.625
which is a thin film material.

00:33:03.625 --> 00:33:05.250
And then what we're
about to talk about

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.340
is our third
generation of cells.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:11.640
So these are potentially
low-cost and potentially

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.585
incredibly efficient.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:19.520
So we're going to talk about
only a few types today.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.700
I encourage you to look up.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.650
There's a whole different types
of solar cells you can look up,

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.340
ideas, research being done.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.550
But I'm going talk--
this is what I work on,

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.180
our intermediate-band
solar cells, specifically

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.300
impurity-band photovoltaics.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.190
And I'm sure you're all
familiar with this picture,

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.920
but if you want to create
free mobile charges

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.530
within your
semiconductor, you have

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.180
to shine light on
it that has energies

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.230
greater than the bandgap.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:52.480
And so you lose these
low-energy photons.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.957
They're not collected,
and what's a way

00:33:54.957 --> 00:33:56.040
that we can collect these?

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:01.350
Well, one idea this
guy had was if you

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.120
can create a material that
has a density of states that

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.790
looks like this, you can
create a stepping stone

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.654
by putting a half-filled
band within your bandgap that

00:34:09.654 --> 00:34:12.070
allows you to promote to that
band and then from that band

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:13.330
into the conduction band.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.500
So the idea is that your
voltage output can still

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.625
be maintained for
the host material,

00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:20.250
but you can collect
that extra current.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.679
So your ISC will
increase substantially,

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.860
and so that's the promise.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.360
And if you do some theoretical
calculations similar

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.900
what Shockley and Queisser did,
assuming the radiative lifetime

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.659
is your limiting
factor-- and again,

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.560
that's certainly not the case
in some of the materials that

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.520
are worked on for this
idea-- and the idea

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.010
is you can actually get up
to around 63% efficient.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:44.194
And so what this graph is here,
here's your single gap limit.

00:34:44.194 --> 00:34:46.860
This is a calculation similar to
what Shockley and Queisser did.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.984
I think this is using
blackbody radiation, which is

00:34:48.984 --> 00:34:50.900
why the curves are so smooth.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.210
And it can actually
outperform a tandem cell,

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.445
which is again a
multi-junction cell that

00:34:55.445 --> 00:34:58.410
are two cells stacked.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:01.090
And it turns out the
best is something

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:03.810
that has a gap level
that's about 0.7 EV

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.410
from the conduction band and
has a larger band gap, so

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:11.520
that distance between
your valence band

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.490
and your conduction band of
around 1.9 electron volts,

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.070
and that's kind of
the ideal material

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.320
for an intermediate-band
solar cell.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.480
So theoretically, this
idea is a great idea.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.930
Problem is, how do you
make a material that

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.540
has this band structure?

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.090
And that's really
the challenge where

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.060
people are working right
now, and it's actually

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.150
rather difficult. And so
there's three approaches.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.700
One is the impurity
band, which I personally

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.890
like because it's a
much cheaper method.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.390
Other one is this band
anti-crossing idea

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.980
where you can actually
split the conduction band,

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.660
and it's generally done with
these mixed metal oxides

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.160
and these highly
mismatched alloys,

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.160
and they're really cool.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.100
And this is currently the
most successful material there

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.570
for intermediate-band
solar cells.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.310
And then there's quantum dot
arrays and quantum structures

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:04.930
that are also a possible
fabrication method.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:10.006
OK, so idea behind an
impurity photovoltaic

00:36:10.006 --> 00:36:12.130
is you start with let's
say a material like silicon

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.100
or some other high-bandgap
gap semiconductor,

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.340
you put in impurities that
have these deep-level states.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.520
Iron would be an example.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.270
So iron in very
low concentrations

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.850
can be incredibly detrimental.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.467
But as you increase
that concentration

00:36:25.467 --> 00:36:27.050
above some critical
limit often called

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.530
the [INAUDIBLE]
transition limit,

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:34.280
you can actually form a
band within the bandgap.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.180
And so the idea what's going
on here is that each of atoms

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.190
this has some
electron wave function

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.477
and some radius that it sees.

00:36:41.477 --> 00:36:43.310
And then as you increase
that concentration,

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.000
these wave functions
overlap and you

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.960
can have conduction through
those mid-level states.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.880
So that's one
idea, and I like it

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.680
because you use what I could
consider very dirty materials.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.790
The concentrations
you can put in here

00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:01.390
around are one atomic percent,
so your silicon's only 99.9%

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.340
pure at this point.

00:37:06.186 --> 00:37:09.810
Other idea is to use either
quantum dots or these quantum

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:10.310
wells.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.760
So I think the idea here
is that these are localized

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.290
and then this
becomes delocalized.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:19.895
So as you bring these quantum
well structures or quantum dots

00:37:19.895 --> 00:37:21.270
closer together,
you can actually

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.390
get tunneling
through these states,

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.150
and it basically
essentially forms

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.740
a band within your bandgap.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.242
Similar idea is to
do this locally--

00:37:29.242 --> 00:37:30.700
is that you have
one photon promote

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.490
to one of these confined states
in your quantum structure,

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:35.700
and then another photon
to keep promoting up

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:40.004
into your conduction
band to create carriers.

00:37:40.004 --> 00:37:42.236
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
would there

00:37:42.236 --> 00:37:44.468
be quantum [INAUDIBLE]
embedded in the silicon,

00:37:44.468 --> 00:37:47.795
or these are solar cells
made out of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:47.795 --> 00:37:50.420
PROFESSOR: It's usually stacked
between two other semiconductor

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:50.920
materials.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.000
So you have semiconductor,
quantum dot, semiconductor.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.560
If you look up this paper
among-- if you look up

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.940
anything-- so Antonio
Luque-- sorry, yeah.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.470
Luque and Marti are
two people in Spain

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.249
who've kind of promoted a lot
of the theory around this.

00:38:07.249 --> 00:38:08.790
And look up their
quantum dot papers,

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.430
and they'll really go
into the device structure

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:11.110
if you're curious.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.410
I'd recommend doing that, Joel.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:16.206
AUDIENCE: So the x-axis
on these figures are--

00:38:16.206 --> 00:38:18.070
PROFESSOR: Real space.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.240
AUDIENCE: So there will be
some portions of the device

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:26.348
where this is possible in--
it kind of depends upon

00:38:26.348 --> 00:38:29.059
how many quantum
wells you actually

00:38:29.059 --> 00:38:30.058
put into your structure.

00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:32.224
PROFESSOR: Right, and that's
one of limiting things,

00:38:32.224 --> 00:38:34.640
is the EQE of these devices
because they can't grow

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.157
so many are pretty limited.

00:38:37.157 --> 00:38:38.740
And again, these
also provide pathways

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.114
for traps and
other things, which

00:38:40.114 --> 00:38:42.560
is again a huge problem
for these types of devices

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.241
and ideas.

00:38:43.241 --> 00:38:44.740
And people are
working on that quite

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.406
extensively from the theory side
and from the experimental side,

00:38:47.406 --> 00:38:49.865
and trying to merge the two.

00:38:49.865 --> 00:38:50.365
OK.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:53.859
Sorry, Ben?

00:38:53.859 --> 00:38:55.442
AUDIENCE: The quantum
well [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:55.442 --> 00:38:57.150
on the right, where
[INAUDIBLE] functions

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:01.600
don't overlap, do those act
as recombination centers?

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.640
PROFESSOR: It seems to me
that they would act as traps.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.210
Again, I'm not an expert on
these types of materials,

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:10.940
but that would be
my inclination.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.360
I guess the idea is that you
have a very, very short well

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.818
and then you have
a field across it

00:39:14.818 --> 00:39:17.720
so there's not something
else to hop to.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.061
And it just pulls it
right out, so that

00:39:20.061 --> 00:39:21.310
would be one device structure.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.830
Again, these are generally
just like a few layers

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:25.740
of quantum dots.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.135
Oh, I didn't put
up the [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:34.135 --> 00:39:35.760
So this is the
band-anticrossing model.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.720
So this is they're using
these quaternary alloys.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.979
So these are, again,
very, very hard to grow,

00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:42.770
and they've done these
awesome measurements

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.700
where they can show your
valence band, conduction

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.450
band, and your impurity
bands, and they're

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:51.960
using a technique called
photomoduled reflectance,

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.860
so basically the reflectance
under oscillating fields.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.710
And from that, you
can get these kind

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.506
of resonance points between
the different transitions

00:40:00.506 --> 00:40:02.630
and you can figure out
where your energy state lie.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.430
It's a really cool technique.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.520
But what they did is
they've done some very, very

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.276
careful engineering and grown
these very, very carefully.

00:40:10.276 --> 00:40:11.650
And they can
actually demonstrate

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:15.130
the sub-bandgap response
where if they have,

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.420
let's say a photon that's
able to drive this transition

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.890
but it's too low in energy
to drive that transition,

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:22.300
they will get no current out.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:27.060
And then as soon as
they add the higher one,

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.040
the current will increase.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.560
And then if they turn off
that low-energy photon source,

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.306
the current
decreases but doesn't

00:40:35.306 --> 00:40:37.180
stop because the other
high-energy photon can

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.980
do both promotions.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.460
So this is actually one of
the only successful devices

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.280
of impurity-band
solar cells, and it

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:47.480
was quite an awesome feat.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:52.340
So I think one of
the few ones we'll

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.740
talk about for another advanced
concept is hot carrier cells.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.420
This is something I think
Martin Green pioneered,

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.810
and I believe it
still working on.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.570
I haven't heard much
about them recently,

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.180
so I don't know what
the progress is there.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.580
So the idea is that one
of the biggest losses,

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.030
as I'm sure you guys know
from I think homework 1 or 2,

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.200
is thermalization
in your solar cells.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.890
When you promote an electron
well up into the conduction

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:21.734
band, it then gives
off heat or phonons,

00:41:21.734 --> 00:41:23.400
which are just lattice
vibrations, which

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.140
is another way of
thinking about heat.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.490
In that process, the problem
is that's incredibly fast.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:29.990
If you look at the
time scales here,

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:32.240
so you come and you promote
this electron way up

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.780
into your conduction band.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.090
This is what it looks like
prior at that promotion,

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:40.450
and then it slowly decays,
and that decay happens over

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:42.360
about a picosecond.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.722
So if you want to move your
carrier in a picosecond,

00:41:45.722 --> 00:41:47.180
if you know what
your field is, you

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.880
can see how long that length
is, and that length scale

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.700
is also incredibly short.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:57.220
And so one of the ideas
is, OK, how either we

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.110
can decrease our path
length, or we can somehow

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.390
slow down thermalization,
and that's actually one idea.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.840
And to slow down
thermalization is something

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.360
that they call carrier cooling.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.990
And basically making certain
types of device structures

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:17.110
or material structures, you can
inhibit certain phonon modes.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.240
So when these
electrons get promoted,

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.410
they want to give off heat.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.201
They basically give
off lattice vibrations,

00:42:22.201 --> 00:42:24.280
so they want to shake
the atoms around them

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.430
and distribute that motion.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.410
If you prevent that
from happening somehow,

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.840
through certain
types of structures,

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.666
you can allow that
process to go slower,

00:42:37.666 --> 00:42:40.220
and that's one of the ideas.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.430
Extracting the carriers--
also kind of difficult.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:46.160
You need to have contacts
that are selective that

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.070
can take the hot carriers at
all the different energies

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.070
that they're promoted
at, and that's

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.740
also a really difficult idea.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.823
And some of the ideas that
they've been working on

00:42:54.823 --> 00:42:57.510
are these resonant
tunneling contacts.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.780
So again, this is
kind of hairy stuff.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.284
I think these slides
are rather old

00:43:02.284 --> 00:43:04.200
and I don't know what's
come of this research.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.200
So it's a really exciting
idea and I encourage

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.840
you guys to look more into it.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.840
OK, so now we're going
to move a little bit away

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.739
from advanced concepts and talk
about kind of bulk thin film

00:43:17.739 --> 00:43:19.280
materials, and I
think we're actually

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.780
going to end quite
early, which is fine.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:30.280
So the most common
commercially-available type

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.812
of material are these
wafer-based materials,

00:43:32.812 --> 00:43:34.270
so monocrystalline,
which you know,

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:35.769
which is what our
cells are made of.

00:43:35.769 --> 00:43:37.760
This CZ, or Czochralski
growth, probably

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.200
pronouncing that wrong.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.616
Silicon,
multichrystalline silicon,

00:43:41.616 --> 00:43:43.990
which I think Tonio was showing
you what that looks like.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:45.910
You can see the
different grains.

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.320
They're actually quite pretty.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.820
Ribbon silicon, which was
pioneered by Evergreen,

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.180
and I think now that
technology's gone.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.680
Evergreen went out of
business, so I don't think

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.090
that technology's still around.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.610
The [INAUDIBLE] still
might be making modules.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:04.264
Anyhow, so thin films.

00:44:04.264 --> 00:44:06.055
Cad-tel is still
currently-- or First Solar

00:44:06.055 --> 00:44:08.740
is still one of the
cheapest module makers.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:12.096
Their process was so cheap
that their efficiency really

00:44:12.096 --> 00:44:13.470
suffered because
they didn't even

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.840
have an ARC coating for
the first 5 or 10 years

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.700
of development.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.908
And they said we didn't need
it, and they were right.

00:44:18.908 --> 00:44:20.890
They were still
outperforming silicon people.

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:23.389
That's becoming less so the
case and one of the big problems

00:44:23.389 --> 00:44:26.840
with Cad-tel, as you guys
know, is the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.010
and also the toxicity,
which some people are

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.931
really concerned about.

00:44:33.931 --> 00:44:34.430
Yeah?

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:35.680
AUDIENCE: Just a note on that.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.470
So if we're debating
in this class

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:40.840
whether the should be allowed
to be imported into Japan.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.690
And my understanding,
from the reading,

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:46.070
was that Japan actually does
not allow cadmium telluride

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:46.850
imports.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.910
Is that correct?

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:51.260
AUDIENCE: I guess so, then yes.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.970
I don't actually know.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.990
I do know that Cad-tel
is a very stable compound

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.826
and I know people
who work with it here

00:44:57.826 --> 00:44:59.450
and they actually
work on recycling it,

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:03.820
so how to dissolve it and
separate the two elements.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.750
And they're not worried
about the hazards

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.650
of the actual raw
material because it's

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:12.610
a pretty stable compound, but a
lot of people do worry about it

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.530
and it's certainly
a valid concern.

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:19.591
But one of the thin film
replacements, well amorphic

00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:21.340
silicon-- you think
you guys know that is,

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.380
but that's deposited silicon.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:27.110
It has no real like lattice
structure to speak of.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.029
It's kind of a disordered
mess, which means

00:45:29.029 --> 00:45:30.320
it has a lot of dangling bonds.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:36.430
It has very, very low
lifetimes as a result,

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:39.680
and also in [INAUDIBLE]
low mobilities.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.450
You also deposit it and
you deposit with hydrogen

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:46.261
to passivate all of
those dangling bonds,

00:45:46.261 --> 00:45:48.760
and that's usually done with
either plasma-enhanced chemical

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.990
vapor deposition, and it's
done on either metal or glass.

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:56.120
And so it has the
potential to be very cheap.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.300
And then one of
things I think was

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.570
aimed to replace Cad-tel
was CIGS-- so copper,

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:03.970
indium, gallium, diselenide.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:07.720
I'll get to some of the
problems with CIGS in a second,

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.340
but there are few
startups around it.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:13.784
I think Nanosolar
is one, HelioVolt,

00:46:13.784 --> 00:46:16.200
and I think Solyndra was one,
although I don't really want

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.638
to say their name out loud.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:23.180
So problem with
CIGS is if you're

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.280
looking for
Earth-abundant films,

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.010
again if we want to scale-- if
we want solar energy to scale

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:30.530
to terawatt levels, if
we want it to provide all

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:32.450
of human energy
needs-- then we're

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:34.360
going to need to use
elements and materials

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.430
that are Earth-abundant, cheap
to find, cheap to produce,

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.660
and CIGS isn't going
to get us there.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.340
It's got indium and gallium.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.182
Indium, which is highly
used and the price

00:46:43.182 --> 00:46:44.640
has skyrocketed
now because I think

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.910
it's used in your
displays and televisions.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.148
There's indium in here.

00:46:50.148 --> 00:46:51.064
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:53.057 --> 00:46:55.140
PROFESSOR: OK, so that's
where it comes from then.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.110
Thank you.

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:58.780
So what people have
been working or trying

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:03.320
to look at replacements--
so this is CZTS.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.740
So it's copper, zinc, tin,
it's sometimes sulfide.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.700
This is selenide,
but they are also

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.240
working on replacing the
selenium with sulfur, something

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.110
a little more Earth-abundant.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:19.410
And this was done at IBM and
it was pretty remarkable,

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.260
actually, because I think
within a very, very short period

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.300
of time, they were able
to get efficiencies

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.240
around 9.6%, which for
a fledgling material

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.610
is incredible, and
I'll get to why that

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:33.987
was so incredible in a second.

00:47:33.987 --> 00:47:36.320
But again, when thinking about
Earth-abundant materials,

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.153
I really recommend you
guys read this paper.

00:47:38.153 --> 00:47:40.200
This is a paper by Cyrus Wadia.

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.220
It's "Environmental
Science and Technology"

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.261
and it looks all of these
different semiconductor

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:46.300
materials and it
looks at in yellow,

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.800
this is what you
could get if you

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:54.010
look at annual production of
that semiconductor material

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.360
now in terms of what is
being produced to produce

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.140
the raw materials that make it.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.610
And then the known
economic reserves,

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:03.840
what can we mine and
get economically today,

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.220
how much could it produce?

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.990
And your worldwide
consumption is on this line,

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:11.280
and you can see Cad-tel is
just barely eking it out.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.590
And the ones of note
for this discussion

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.320
are Cad-tel, CIGS, which
is slightly better,

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.430
and then CZTS, which is
rather plentiful even

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:23.057
with reserves that are
currently being mined now,

00:48:23.057 --> 00:48:24.890
and so that's kind of
the take-home message.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.200
The other thing also
really interesting

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.620
is the actual raw material cost.

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.200
Cad-tel, turns out,
it's not that great

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.860
when you compare it
to CIGS and then CZTS.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.360
It's a whole lot cheaper.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:44.180
So one of the other things
about CZTS that's so cool

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.030
is that there's basically
this huge growth parameter

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:49.300
space for making these
quaternary alloys,

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.910
and IBM on their first shot
just kind of nailed it.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:57.090
So they didn't really look at
this whole parameter space.

00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:00.510
It was just kind of their
first shot was right there,

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:03.160
and so it might already be
optimized, and a lot of people

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.316
are kind of
concerned about that.

00:49:05.316 --> 00:49:07.440
But I think it's certainly
a very interesting field

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.744
and really cool to
work in, so I think

00:49:11.744 --> 00:49:12.910
hopefully there's hope here.

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:15.240
So actually we're
ending way early,

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.040
but that concludes
the lecture today.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.206
If you guys want to stick
around for more questions,

00:49:19.206 --> 00:49:22.010
that's totally fine, but that's
all I had prepared for today.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.980
So thank you.

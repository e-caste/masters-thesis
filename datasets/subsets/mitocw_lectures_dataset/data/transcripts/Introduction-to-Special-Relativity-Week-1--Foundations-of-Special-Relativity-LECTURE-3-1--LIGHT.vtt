[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:03.976

00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:07.455
[CLICKING]

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.710
PROFESSOR: Welcome back to 8.20.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.000
In this section, you want to
look at light, what is it,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.470
and how does it propagate.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.020
In this video, specifically,
I give you a little bit

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.820
of a preview of 8.02.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.700
And I don't do this in
a very topological way.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.180
I just give you
some information.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.860
So if we study 8.02, we'll
see Maxwell equations

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.920
are being developed in there.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.805
We look at Maxwell equations
for electric and magnetic field

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.830
E and B in vacuum.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.345
We can rewrite the
Maxwell equations

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:45.790
and define wave equations.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.290
The solutions of
the wave equation,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.975
as the name tells
you, are waves.

00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:51.350
So what we are
looking at here is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.650
you want to describe
the propagation

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.430
of electric and magnetic
fields in vacuum.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.220
In this situation, this is maybe
at some time, t equal to 0,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.010
we have an electric
field in this point here,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.470
and a magnetic field--
electric field points

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.420
into the y direction,
the magnetic field

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.800
into the z direction.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.410
And what the
equations now describe

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.320
is how the wave propagates
in space and in time.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.270
And you can already tell
from the name, wave equation,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.480
the solutions of this equation--

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.480
these differential
sines and cosines.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.790
So one solution here
is are Ey equal to E0,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.190
times cosine, kx minus omega t.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.190
We find then that the speed
in which the wave propagates--

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.120
you pick one peak
of a wave, and you

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.310
see how it propagates--
one point of variance

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.270
here propagates.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.590
The speed in which it propagates
is the speed of light, c.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.170
And you can find c here through
those constants in the Maxwell

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.450
equations and wave equations.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.980
Find c is 1 over square
root epsilon 0 and mu 0.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.380
The permeativity and
the permeability,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.930
the product of the two gives
you the speed of light.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.400
So if you look at
this some more,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.470
and connect the Maxwell
equation to the Lorentz force,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.180
again, as a reminder, for
those who had had 8.02 already,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.705
the force on the
charged particle

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:39.580
in an electromagnetic
field is given by 2 times

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.270
E, plus 2 times V cross B.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.660
If you have two charges, the
force between those two charges

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.160
is the product of the 2
divided by r squared, times 1

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.570
over 4 pi x mu 0.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.950
Again, [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.230
And the force
between two wires--

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.850
this current-- current
i1 and current i2--

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.540
is equal to the product of the
two currents, divided by r,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.620
times l-- the length
of the wires--

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.098
times mu 0 over 2 pi.

00:03:12.098 --> 00:03:13.640
So this is fantastic,
because now you

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.770
can calculate the
speed of light by just

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.690
measuring the forces
between charges

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.900
and current in wire's centers.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.870
The value of c is
also very interesting.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.060
It's large-- very large.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.000
3 times 10 to the 8
meters per second.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.420
So just let that sink in.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.110
We, as humans, move with
a few meters per second.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:46.420
Light travels-- a few
nanoseconds is needed for light

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.920
to travel about 1 meter.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.120
It takes just nanosecond.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.060
Let's stop the video here.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.470
The next thing I want
to do is an exercise.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.680
I want to have you play with
this differential equation,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.470
and there's a solution of
the differential equation.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.060
But the challenge
or the exercise

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.920
is to show that if you have a
function which you can write

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.120
as f0, which is an
arbitrary function, which

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.920
is a function of x minus
ct, those functions,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.720
regardless in how
they look like,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.000
are solutions of this
differential equation.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.135
Note that I replaced our
constant epsilon 0 and mu

00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:29.460
0 now with 1 over c squared.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.310
So f0 can really be
an arbitrary function.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.580
You need to be able to build
the derivative, though.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.830
So I do the function
here as a function

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.100
of x for some time equal t0.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.260
And then I drew the same
function 4 times equal to 1.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.750
And so you can,
from this picture,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.110
see that the delta x over delta
t is minus c in this case.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.930
So my function-- my wave is
moving with the speed of light

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.280
in minus direction.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:12.180
So I want you to show that this
kind of equation [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.180
wave equation.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.820
So I would like you to do
this, and stop the video,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.810
and show you the solution next.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.200
So the way to approach this is
simply applying the chain rule.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.780
And that might be something
you want to remind yourself of.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.500
So after I do this, I'll define
this little helper function

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.180
here u is equal to x minus ct.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.830
And this makes our
function a function

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.710
of u, which is itself
a function of x and t.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.990
So if I built a
derivative with x,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:49.230
I have this df of
u, du times du dx.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.860
If I build a second
derivative, there

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.970
is a product you
have to take care of.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:01.130
So I find that d is the second
derivative of f of u here,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.180
times du dx squared.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.670
And then I have to add df du
times second derivative of u.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.090
This follows very similar
for the derivative of t.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.500
And then I can
investigate what we find.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.210
So my du dx is equal to 1--

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.790
du dx.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.550
If I build the derivative of
x minus et, this x, I find 1.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.810
I do the same with t--

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.110
I find minus c.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.940
I will use this second
derivatives of u.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.550
x and t are all 0.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.350
If I put this now
in my equation,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:50.930
I find second derivative of
f with u is of 1 minus c--

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:58.950
sorry, 1 minus 1 over c squared
times c squared is equal to 0.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.590
And since this is
always 0, we have just

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.070
proven that any sort
of function which

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:18.350
I can build the derivative of
which is of the from x minus ct

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.020
solves that equation.

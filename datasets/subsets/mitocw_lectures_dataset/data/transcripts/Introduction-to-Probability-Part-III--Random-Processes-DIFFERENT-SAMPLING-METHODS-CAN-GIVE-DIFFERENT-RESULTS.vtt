00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.300
In this segment, we want
to reinforce the message

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.780
that how you choose to sample
can give different results,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.180
and the choice of
sampling is important.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.810
Suppose you're interested in
measuring the average family

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.260
size in some population.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.450
Suppose that there are
families that are small

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.890
and have just one
person in them,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.770
and there's also a family
that has many people in it.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.250
What does it mean to measure
the average family size?

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.760
One possibility is to pick at
random a family, each family

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.750
being chosen with
equal probability,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.810
and talk about the expected
value that you get,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.190
or the average value
if you sample that way.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.410
In this particular example
with probability 1/4,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.190
you get a 1, with
probability 1/4, you get a 1

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.480
with probability
1/4, you get a 1.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.420
So the answer would be with
probability 3/4 you get a 1,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.360
and with probability
1/4, you get a 6.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.120
But suppose that instead,
you pick a person at random

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.680
and you ask for that person,
how big is your family?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.420
What's the expected value of
the answer you're going to get?

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.630
Here we have nine people.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.940
Out of those nine
people, 3 of them

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.870
will give you an answer
my family has size one,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.229
and six of those people
will give you an answer,

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.970
my family has a size of six.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.770
And this number is
going to be larger

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.330
than the previous number.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.920
You're going to get
different answers.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.220
So it is possible to
have a situation where

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.340
you can make a statement
such as the following.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.759
The average family
size is three,

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.070
but the average person lives
in a family of size four.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.840
There is no contradiction
between these two statements

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.730
because we're measuring
different things.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.259
Another example of
the same flavor.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.250
You're interested in the
average bus occupancy.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.500
You're interested in whether
buses are crowded or not

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.050
in your city.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.850
One way of carrying
out this calculation

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.400
is to pick buses
at random, each bus

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.530
is equally likely to
be picked, and see

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.640
how many people are
riding this bus.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.030
Another possibility is to
take a typical passenger,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.290
a random passenger, and ask
them, how crowded was your bus?

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.930
Take an extreme case.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.860
Suppose that half of the
buses have 0 people in them,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.440
and half of the buses
have 50 people in them.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.050
If you look at random buses,
then the average occupancy

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.150
would be 25.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.720
But if you ask passengers,
all of the passengers

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.020
would report 50, and it would
be, again, a different answer.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.900
A similar situation is if you're
talking about average class

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.280
sizes.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.060
One method is to look
at all the classes,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.410
see how many students
there are in each class,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.079
and take the average.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.860
Another method would be
to ask a typical student,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.150
how large is your class?

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.240
Because more students are
in large classes, when

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.430
you pick a student
at random, you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.710
are likely to get a
higher answer, as opposed

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.770
to when you look
at a random class.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.250
The moral from
all these examples

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.450
is that it is very
important to be

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.730
careful about what
you choose to sample.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.860
When you pick at
random, what exactly

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.720
are you picking at random?

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.390
And you need to be aware
that different sampling

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.000
methods measure
different things,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.300
and will generally give
you different results.

WEBVTT

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.450
PROFESSOR: But you
all knew that.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.219
That is quite a mouthful.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.700
So if you like, you can
refer to it as SST.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.430
And today, we're taking off.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.780
So my name, for those of
you who don't know

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.340
me, is Bernardt Wuensch.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.210
My room number is 13-4037, The
office that's become a legend

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.440
in its own time.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:58.530
And my extension number
is 3-6889.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.630
And hey, just to get you
sensitized and thinking about

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.090
the right things, let me point
out that my extension number

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.820
has a point of 180 degree
rotational symmetry right in

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.720
the middle.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.020
You can pick it up,
turn it head over

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990
heels by 180 degrees.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.790
And it's mapped into coincidence
with itself.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.920
Just happened to get it.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.990
You might think I would have had
to have fought for years

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.560
to get an extension
number like that.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.290
But no, it just happened
to come my way.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.195
OK, some words about the
formalities of the subject.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.090
First of all, the format of
the class is unusual.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.155
We meet four hours a week, but
because most if not all of you

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:50.260
are graduate students anxious
to get some work done in the

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.610
laboratory, we do this in
two two-hour chunks.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.580
So we meet Tuesday and Thursdays
for two hours.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.900
Two hours is a lot of time for
anything, however good.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.710
So what we do is to take a
long intermission halfway

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.449
through and let you go out and
enjoy what's left of the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.690
lingering summer for
10 or 12 minutes.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.590
And then, come back refreshed
and we will resume.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.330
Most graduate students like this
arrangement because it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.180
gives them a chance to duck out
and make a setting on a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.670
furnace or turn something
off in the laboratory.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.240
And it works out better for them
than having a one hour

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.900
time chunk every day of the week
or four of the five days

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.990
of the week.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.200
In any case, nobody's
complained about it.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.660
So I assume that will work

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.280
satisfactorily for you as well.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.080
The other question that one
immediately asked at the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.305
beginning of the term,
how many quizzes?

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.290
And we're supposed to tell
you that straight up.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.575
There will be three quizzes.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.780
No final examination--

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.060
do I look like the kind of
Scrooge that would prevent you

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.000
from getting a good flight home
at Christmas time or have

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.570
you working, cramming for a
final examination a few days

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.070
before Christmas?

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.720
And for my part, I can remember
the good old days--

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.150
or not so good old days--
when I did give a final.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.530
And there I would be, lying down
on my stomach under the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.260
Christmas tree grading
final examinations.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.025
And every time one of my little
kids would come near,

00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:33.250
I'd lash out with my foot and
say, get out of here, kid!

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.840
Can't you see Daddy's got
papers to correct?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.100
Well, no Scrooge.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.770
No final examination.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.360
We'll have three quizzes.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.990
The quizzes will also be
a little bit unique.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.250
Since we have two hour chunks of
time, I found by experience

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.960
that if I give the quiz during
the first hour everybody is

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.870
sitting around glassy-eyed,
absolutely brain dead and pay

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.470
no attention to the lecture
that follows.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.040
If I give the quiz in the second
hour, everybody is

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.080
pretending to pay attention
and then sneaking

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.670
surreptitious looks at their
notes just so they can have

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.490
everything packed away before
they have to write on paper.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.480
So my quizzes are two hour
quizzes which lets you not

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.840
work for two hours, but gives
you all the time you could

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.700
possibly want.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.780
And people start leaving after
about an hour and a quarter.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.820
But you can stay for the entire
two hours if you want.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.260
Even at that, I found by
experience that if I give you

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.390
two hours for the quiz, after
about an hour and a half,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.130
everybody's looking out the
window, looking back at the

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.000
ceiling, not a single
pencil is moving.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.720
Then I will say, OK,
you all done?

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.450
Everybody starts writing
again and going through

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.660
their papers once more.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.450
And even after two hours I find
that in order to get the

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.850
quiz papers, I have to plant one
foot on the edge of your

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.690
table, grab hold of your quiz
with both hands and drag it

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.470
out of your clutching fingers.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.390
So you can take the
full two hours.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.730
But it should not be necessary
for you to

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.740
consume that much time.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.390
The quizzes will come-- and this
is something else we're

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.800
supposed to explain to you--

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.925
they will come at one third of
the way through the term, two

00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:27.280
thirds of the way through the
term, and 2.983/3 of the way

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.510
through the term.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.070
And if you're wondering where
that number comes from, this

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.970
lets me put the quiz just before
the final week of the

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.860
term when we're not supposed
to give examinations.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.230
So there'll be three quizzes.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.600
You will have opportunity
for lots of

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.370
practice with problems.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.640
We will have on the order
of 15 problem sets.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.530
And for the most part, they
will be very short, or

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.960
modestly short, and designed to
give you some practice in

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.530
working with the material.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.350
Because as the nature of this
subject begins to unfold,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.300
you'll see that it involves
a type of mathematics that

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.260
you've really perhaps not
had much practice with.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.750
It involves geometrical
relations.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.220
And to really master it, you
have to work with the material

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.470
and get some practice.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.050
Another question that's
perennially asked if not

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.580
outright raised in private,
what do the quizzes count?

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.640
What do the problem
sets count?

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.590
The answer to that is that the
problem sets will count a lot

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.080
towards your understanding
of the material.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.850
But I'm not going
to grade them.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.360
And I'm not going to factor them
in along with the quizzes

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.550
to decide your final eventual
fortunes in this class.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.460
The problem sets, moreover,
there are a lot of them.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.030
But they will be optional in the
sense that if you do them,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.320
I will carefully correct them,
add words of inspiration and

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.910
advice, correct things where
you've gone wrong and then

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.460
return them to you as
quickly as possible.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.080
But if you how to do the
problem, you say, ah!

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.110
Why does he wants us to do this
and waste our time with a

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.650
silly problem like this?

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.810
Don't do it.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.510
Don't do it, because if you
know how to do the problem

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.680
set, that's fine.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.870
And you've got better things
to do with your time.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.410
And I've got better things
to do with my time if the

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.950
feedback is not going to
be of benefit to you.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.370
So I hope you will do them.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.410
And as I said, if you do them,
I will correct them promptly

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.080
and thoroughly.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.450
And if you haven't got the
foggiest idea how to do the

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.230
problem, do what you can.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.530
And then, write down
a plea of help--

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.000
I don't understand what's
going on here!

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.770
OK, and then I will take the
time to write out what's going

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:57.370
on, hopefully to your
benefit and use.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.160
Will I turn out solutions?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.710
Only on an individual
basis in the fashion

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.610
that I've just described.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.460
I find that if I write out a
solution to each of these

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.160
problems, you don't do them.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.560
And you say, oh, so that's how
you do that, throw it in a

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.850
file, and not look at it until
the night before the quiz.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.960
So there will not be solutions
handed out other than

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.280
correction on an individual
basis on your papers.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.650
Is that all that I
wanted to say?

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.510
I think that's about all
for the formalities.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:39.340
Actually, I should add one
postscript to say the problem

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.390
sets don't count anything
toward your final grade.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.510
They do in one minor sense.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.010
When you have a large class and
you plot up the grades and

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.080
there are no lumps with gaps
in between, there comes a

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.780
point where you have
to separate

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.690
one grade from another.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.420
And if you've done well on the
quizzes and you've done well

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.260
on the problem sets and there's
just one quiz that's a

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.660
little bit, I say, OK,
he or she had a

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.610
bad day that afternoon.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.880
And I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.420
And even though I'm not a
vindictive sort, if you're

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.780
right on the fence and you
haven't done any of the

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.810
problems, then without
malice I say, gotcha!

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.350
And you go down [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.090
on the low side of
the barricade.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.930
And I think that's only a
natural indication because

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.490
there are some cases where, with
Solomonic judgement, you

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.020
have to decide who
gets what grade.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.570
OK, let me say a little
bit about the texts.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:49.030
There are a number of
books that deal with

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.360
crystallography.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.060
For the most part, though,
they consists of an

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.550
introductory chapter.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:02.040
Every single book on the solid
state feels compelled to write

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.450
some sort of half baked chapter
on crystal structure

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.320
or crystallography.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.550
And usually, these chapters
consist of big tables.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.720
And they say, there
are 14 of these.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.430
There are 17 of these.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.190
There are 32 of these.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.190
There are like 230 of these.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.310
There are 1,170 of these.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.050
And then, that has all the
excitement and stimulation of

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.850
reading the telephone
directory.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.450
It's a crazy cast of characters,
but it's awfully

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.950
hard to see the plot.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.320
So what we will do all the way
through is derive everything.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.080
So you can not only see how it
turns out, but why it has to

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.380
be that way.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.380
And that's the way, in my
opinion, one really learns

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.630
this material.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.830
A couple of other very pedantic

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.695
comments about the material.

00:10:57.695 --> 00:11:00.980
In the early part of the term,
the first half in fact, we're

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.940
going to use plain
old geometry.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.210
Now, geometry really
doesn't cut much

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.160
mustard around the Institute.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.680
If you can't integrate it or
take its Fourier transform,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.916
that's a mathematics you don't
have to take seriously.

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:20.530
Well, geometry is a perfectly
valid branch of mathematics.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.280
And one can do what we're going
to do in more complex

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.740
terms using the language
of group theory.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.520
And we will, in fact, use a
little bit of that later on.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.790
But for the most part, just
diagrams with simple geometry

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.260
are going to be one of the
principle tools in the initial

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.470
part of the class.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.130
About halfway through, we'll
switch over to something that

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.000
is much more mathematical in
the traditional sense.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.180
Here, a little bit of linear
algebra and matrix algebra

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.120
will help you.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.440
If you haven't had that or
haven't looked at it for a

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.250
while, we'll build it up from
ground zero so that you'll be

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.410
able to fully understand it.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.360
We'll hit a few eigenvalue
problems towards

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.190
the end of the term.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.650
If that doesn't get your
adrenaline pumping, that will

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.600
be developed in a physical
context so that you're doing

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.480
the sort of problem before you
even know what it's called.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.800
So it's going to be a user
friendly course that doesn't

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.630
rely on something that
you may have had two

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.880
or three years ago.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.310
OK, but the other thing that I
wanted to say was that this

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.920
class is not like many classes
in that you talk about

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.470
something for one week.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.490
And then, you put it aside and
you talk about something

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.730
completely different
the next week.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.800
Our first half of the
course will be one

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.510
long process of synthesis.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.070
We're going to start out very,
very simply with little

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.930
mapping transformations.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.220
This is picked up and rotated
and slid over to here.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.530
And you'll say, ho-hum,
let's get on with it.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.850
Come on, go faster.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.990
But we'll build on this and then
build on what we've just

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.850
done to what comes next.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.960
And unlike most of the classes
in science that you take where

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.280
you start with general terms and
you zero in on some little

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:16.690
nugget like f equals ma, e
equals mc squared, lambda

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.220
equals 2d sin (theta), a little
nugget like a bullion

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.280
cube that you can drop
in your pocket.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.910
And then when you need it later
on, you pull it out and

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.740
add hot water.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.260
And then, you have a tool
that you can use.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.610
We will do something
that's completely

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.700
different in its structure.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.160
It will start out simple.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.040
It will grow.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.090
It will blossom like an
elegant [? Filigree ?]

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.280
structure that gets more and
more complicated and diverges

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.900
rather than converging to a
nice, tight, little nugget.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.010
It's going to get very,
very complicated.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.700
And the reason for doing this
gradually and thoroughly is so

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.430
that you can understand
the complexity and

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.360
where it comes from.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.920
OK, so my moral here
is keep up.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.670
It may seem easy
when you start.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.450
But we're going to assume that
you've got that down cold

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.560
before we go on to
the next step.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.800
OK, texts.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.120
Apart from these half baked
treatments which I just keep

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:24.580
[INAUDIBLE] on, one of the very
best books is by an old

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:32.610
MIT guy, Martin Buerger, who
was one of MIT's most

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.730
distinguished faculty.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.560
He was the very first faculty
member to be honored with the

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.290
title Institute Professor,
the very first one.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.740
Chairman of the Faculty, all
sorts of awards from

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.270
professional societies--

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.260
he has a book called Elementary
Crystallography.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.235
This is published by Wiley.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.810
There's some who dispute the
term "elementary." But he

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.780
really has a book which uses,
at the outset, nothing more

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.610
than geometry.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.290
He doesn't throw in comments
like, "It can be shown that,"

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.080
or "By further work, it
turns out--." He does

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.610
everything for you.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.020
Everything is down there so you
can see how it's done and

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.270
what the results are.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.820
To me, it is the best
book on the subject.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.360
That's the good part.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.750
The bad part is that it's
been out of print

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.750
for about 15 years.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:43.980
So what I am going to
do is to make--

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.890
now that I know how many of you
are going to be present--

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.340
I'm going to make a Xerox
copy for you of the

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.480
first half of the book.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.110
What a department!

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.600
What a class!

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.780
You're going to get a classic
text, 50% of it, without

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.360
spending a nickel.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.310
And that'll be the text for the
first part of the class.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.760
We will be doing some
derivation that

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.060
are not in this book.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.130
And for that, I will have notes
that I have written out.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.990
And you'll get Xerox
copies of that.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.120
So we'll have lots and lots of
handouts during the course of

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.370
this semester.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.560
I'd like to call your attention,
though, to two

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.630
other books.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.970
These are not textbooks.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.920
These are reference books.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.600
And you can see from the shape
of this one that this is one

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.880
of my favorite volumes.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.490
It's thoroughly worn out.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.360
This is something that is
called The International

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.533
Tables for X-ray
Crystallography.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.760
And it is published by an
organization called the

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.715
International Union for
Crystallography.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.660
The funny sounding term,
"International Union for

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.640
Crystallography," sounds like
an organization under which

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.430
diffractionists go out and
strike for higher pay.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.410
But no, this is actually a
federation of all of the

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.970
national societies of
crystallography from

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.810
all over the world.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.490
And among the useful things that
they do, besides having a

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.010
splendid conference every couple
of years, is to publish

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.670
these tables.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:48.440
And volume one is called
Symmetry Tables.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.880
And everything that we will
derive and all of its

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.680
properties--

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.500
physical and geometrical--

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.900
are tabulated in this book.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.790
It is, however, a reference
book and not a textbook.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.110
You don't learn it for the first
time from this book.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.760
But in terms of generating
atomic arrangements from the

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.320
data that's present in the
literature, looking at the

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.460
arrangement of symmetry elements
in space, and how

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.050
they move atoms around, it is
the code book that tells you

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:30.610
how to crack the arcane language
in which diffraction

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.060
and structural results are
recorded and find out how to

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.330
unravel it.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.030
I call also to your attention,
although it will not be

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.960
germane to this class, there
are four other volumes.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.030
Volume two is called
Mathematical Tables.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.810
And this has all sorts
of useful stuff.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.860
If you've ever done diffraction,
you know that

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.690
depending on the symmetry of
the crystal, there are some

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:11.120
planes for which h squared plus
k squared plus l squared

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.890
divided by 2 pi is not a
reflection [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.450
if the crystal is green, and
other arcane rules like that.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.040
All of these are summarized
in these books.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.680
There are quantities that you
need to calculate, things like

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.820
interplanar spacings.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.350
Tables are available there.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.120
So this is a handy thing
primarily for diffraction.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.645
Volume three is called
Physical Tables.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.090
And this is where you find
things like absorption

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.030
coefficients for x-rays
and for neutrons.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.580
It's where you find the latest
values of absorption

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.320
coefficients, neutron
scattering length.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.030
And since these things are
derived experimentally, the

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.820
values improve and change
from time to time.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.220
So this is where you find the
most up to date values of

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.880
physical constants and items
that are necessary for

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.130
diffraction.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:17.120
It never ceases to amaze me how
somebody who has the good

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.040
fortune of having to use the
diffraction for a thesis will

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.260
labor carefully over making
the measurements and

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.620
reducing the data.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.670
And then when it comes to using
a wavelength, which is

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.200
how the final numbers will
be determined, goes to an

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.190
appendix of a book on
diffraction that was published

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.530
20 years ago.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.740
And that's not the most
up to date value.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.560
Scattering powers of x-rays by
the electrons on the atoms are

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.320
calculated from wave functions,
which constantly

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.950
get better from year to year.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.100
And the value of the scattering
powers of the

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.460
function of angle gets better
from year to year.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.770
So this is where you want to
go if you need any of that

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.780
physical data.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:04.980
And finally, volume four is--

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.700
it's not its title, but it's
essentially an update of the

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.230
Physical Tables, giving later
values which came out about 10

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.480
years later.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.970
OK, this series was getting
out of hand.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:23.770
So I have to bend my knees
and use two hands when I

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.030
pick up this one.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.770
This is a continuation of
the series, essentially.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.770
But this one is called
International Tables for

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:37.020
Crystallography, period, no
x-rays because neutrons and

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.320
electrons are just as important
today for doing

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.140
scattering experiments.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:48.025
And this is International Tables
for Crystallography.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.990
No x-ray in there.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.660
And there are now something
like six volumes out.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.340
They're not called one, two,
three, and four, but they're

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.200
called A, B, and C to
avoid confusion.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.465
And volume A is one called
Space Group Symmetry.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.590
And then, there are a whole
series of other ones.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.880
As I say, I think there's six
of them that give physical

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.480
data and all sorts
of useful guides.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.580
I have mixed feelings about
the new series.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:45.610
You will see that it is about
three times as large and three

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:51.040
times as heavy, which means it's
nine times as expensive.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.180
And to me, it's almost the
case for most people of a

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:01.030
situation where if it wasn't
broke, you shouldn't fix it.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.020
And what they've done is that
they've put in all sorts of

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:09.690
esoteric theory which probably
is going to be of interest and

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.960
use to perhaps 5%
of the readers.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.090
But nevertheless, if you wanted,
you'll find it there,

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.000
which is something that could
not be said before.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.130
They've added a few things which
are useful, but a lot of

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.750
additional information which
you don't really need.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.430
And you pay for that whether
you want it or not.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.740
Nevertheless, it's been done.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.490
You can't buy the old
volumes any longer.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.350
You have to buy the
new volumes.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.550
So anyway, this is what you'll
find in the library now.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:45.020
Maybe they do still have the old
volumes, one through four.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.220
This, we will make reference to
in the course of the term.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.050
I will give you some copies of
certain pages in here as

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.530
handouts when we need
them for purposes of

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.070
illustration or for use.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.990
But I spent the last five
minutes just to make you aware

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.860
of the existence
of these books.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.830
And these are really the
penultimate source of

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:12.470
information and numerical
quantities that will be used

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.200
in diffraction, one of the
principle applications of

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.960
crystallography.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.170
I think I have just
enough enough--

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:24.630
to start things off, I have a
syllabus for the course that

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:28.500
is, in very dense form, exactly
what we will be

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.750
covering this term.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.070
And I'd like to lead you by
the hand through this.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.710
All right, what we will be doing
in the first half of the

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.503
term is something that is known
as crystallography.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.870
OK, the meaning of the word is
almost self-explanatory.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.700
The first part is crystal.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.870
We're going to be
dealing with the

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.600
crystalline state of matter.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.240
To me, amorphous materials,
although they may be

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.130
important, have all the interest
of a piece of steak

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.610
before it's been cooked.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.740
The atoms in amorphous
materials are fine.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.320
But they really get interesting
when they organize

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.910
themselves into an
ordered fashion.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.540
So the name is self-explanatory.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.680
The first part, crystal, means
we're going to deal with the

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.210
crystalline state.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.350
What does the graphy mean?

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.410
That means mapping
or geometry.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.950
And let me give you an example
of a few other words that have

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.950
the same sort of structure.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.870
Geo--

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.400
the Earth--

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:58.290
followed by graph, geography,
is the mapping of the Earth.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.910
And there are many other terms
that involve these two

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.960
separate parts.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.760
Crystallography, though, is
very often subdivided into

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.660
different flavors.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.210
There is something well
defined called x-ray

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.460
crystallography.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:27.540
And this is the experimental
determination of the

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:32.620
crystallography of a material
using diffraction, usually

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.500
x-rays because they're
relatively inexpensive and

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.970
they're widely available.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:42.080
But increasingly, neutron
scattering or electron

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.740
scattering is used
for this purpose.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:49.960
And there are a number of very
powerful, very exciting

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.780
sources of neutrons, either
from reactor sources of

00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:00.810
unprecedented intensity or
from what's called a

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:07.340
spallation source, where an
entire synchrotron is built

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.020
just to direct a beam
of particles onto

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.640
a heavy metal target.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.390
And those high energy particles
split off neutrons

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.420
from the nuclei of the
target material.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.240
Doesn't really matter what
the material is.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.820
It helps if it's
a heavy metal.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.800
The nice thing about these
sources of neutron radiation

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.660
is that they're so expensive
they are all national

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.640
facilities.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.770
And the consequence of that is
that anybody with a good idea

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:42.800
and a project worth doing
can apply for beam time.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.470
And if it's a good problem,
you get it.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:48.550
So you're using a facility
that cost $1 billion.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:51.380
You have people whose sole
function in life is to help

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.630
you do the experiment and make
sure you're doing it properly.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:59.400
And this is a very, very
exciting time to be somebody

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.840
working with diffraction using
these neutron sources.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.170
There's another branch of
crystallography which is

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.470
called optical crystallography.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.900
And this is the characterization
and study of

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.150
crystalline materials using
polarized light.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:26.020
You can identify unknowns using
their optical properties

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.410
if they're transparent about 10
times faster than you can

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.000
do with x-ray diffraction.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.590
It's a technique that today
is little used.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.690
But it's a very powerful
technique.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.430
And all it takes is
a microscope, and

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.310
you're off and running.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:46.380
Some other flavors of
crystallography, well, I'll

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.440
mention the one that
we're going to use.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.730
What we're going to talk about
is something called

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:55.080
geometrical crystallography, to
distinguish it from these

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.330
other branches.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.920
And this is synonymous
with symmetry theory.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.860
So that's what we'll do
for the first month

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.110
and a half or so.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:29.700
All right, let me introduce
now some basic concepts.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.190
Geometrical crystallography is
the study of patterns and

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.450
their symmetry.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:42.370
So let me give you an example
of some very simple patterns

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.130
that extent in one dimension.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:49.450
And let me put in a figure.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.980
The thing that is in the pattern
is something that's

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.780
called the motif.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.210
And let me use a plump,
little fat comma.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.310
And I'll make a chain
of these things

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:07.200
extending in one dimension.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.430
The nice thing about this fat
little comma is that it is a

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.220
figure which, in itself, has
no inherent symmetry.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.990
So it is asymmetric,
without symmetry.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:22.440
And imagine this is being
repeated without limit in both

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.710
directions, both to the
left and to the right.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.400
We then draw another
pattern with a

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.810
different sort of motif.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:36.190
And let me use a rectangle
with one concave side.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.690
OK, and I think you get the
picture of this one.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.130
And imagine that as extending
without limit indefinitely to

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:58.260
the left and to the right.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.390
Then, I'm getting tired of
inventing new motifs.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.980
So let me use the same motif the
second time, but arrange

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.780
it in a slightly
different way.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.605
And again, imagine that as
extended indefinitely.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:30.700
OK, having now generated these
three patterns in two

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.790
dimensions but extending
periodically in two

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.380
dimensions.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.370
Let me ask the question now.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:39.830
And even if you have not the
foggiest idea, you have a 50%

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.260
chance of being right.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.240
Are any of these patterns
the same?

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.900
Or are they all different?

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.670
Are any of the patterns
the same?

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:51.920
Or are they different?

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.030
Well, that's a-- yeah?

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:03.650
PROFESSOR: OK, that is an answer
that's right because

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.196
the bottom two involve the
same sort of figure.

00:32:07.196 --> 00:32:10.900
They have the same sort
of the motif.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.150
They both have the
same rectangle

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:13.490
with one concave side.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.422
And that's a valid answer.

00:32:15.422 --> 00:32:16.540
Do you have a different
answer?

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.940
AUDIENCE: The first and
third are the same.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.330
PROFESSOR: First and
third are the same.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.530
Why do you say that?

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.720
AUDIENCE: They both have
[? rotational symmetry. ?]

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.040
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.190
This is the point I was
trying to introduce.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:29.060
And that is your choice of
answering the question, one is

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.400
the nature the motif.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.780
And you're absolutely correct.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.990
This pattern and this
pattern are both

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.900
based on the same motif.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:43.130
But in patterns, we are less
concerned with the motif that

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:48.750
is in the pattern than we are
with the relations between one

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:52.340
motif and all of the others.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:57.800
And in that context, the first
and the third pattern,

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.290
although they look entirely
different, are really exactly

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.780
the same sort of pattern.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:08.100
So let's begin to analyze what
sort of operations are in

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.350
these patterns that
take one motif--

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.190
and obviously, they're
all the same--

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.400
and relate it to all
of the others.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.890
First of all, there is an
operation which I'll call

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.100
translation for obvious
reasons.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.010
And I'll represent that by a
vector, T, since a translation

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:34.700
has magnitude and direction
but no unique origin.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.000
I could take this pair of
objects sitting nose to nose,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.420
pick them up, slide them over
by T, put them down again.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.410
And I have the relation
that gives me

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.570
this neighboring pair.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.570
Pick it up again, move it
to the right by the same

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:54.370
translation in the same
direction, put it down again.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.600
And I've got this pair.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.410
So that is one operation that
can exist in patterns.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.930
This is the operation
of translation.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.470
So let me call that by
a vector relation.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.749
And it has magnitude.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:23.920
It has direction, but no unique
origin, just like a

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.350
plain old vector.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:29.750
So in other words, I can't say
that the translation moves us

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.949
from here to here or
from here to here.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:34.360
It's all the same thing--

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.889
magnitude and direction,
no unique origin.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.429
In fact, all of these patterns
have translational

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:48.900
periodicity.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.030
There's a translation in this
bottom pattern and another

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.800
translation from here to here
in the middle pattern.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:03.510
The thing that makes a crystal
a crystal is that it is an

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:08.320
arrangement of atoms or
molecules which is related one

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.560
part to another by the operation
of translation.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.730
If you don't have translational
periodicity, you

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.250
do not have a crystal.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.670
So that comes to the
essence of what

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.040
crystallography is about.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:27.470
You can imagine, in one sense,
the generation of this pattern

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:31.530
by a rubber stamp sort
of operation.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.600
Suppose I have a rubber stamp.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.880
And I put on the rubber stamp
the pair of motifs like this.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.920
Pick it up, move
it over, chunk.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.560
Pick it up, move
it over, chunk.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.830
And I can stamp out the pattern
in that fashion.

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:51.400
Notice that my statement about
no unique origin in these

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.210
terms can be stated that it
doesn't matter where the two

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.690
motifs are on the stamp.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.860
they could be up in the upper
left hand corner, right in the

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.320
middle, down in the bottom.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.100
As long as I move the stamp
through the same distance and

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.430
the same direction, I get
the same pattern.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.630
Now, that's not bad for
an introduction.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:17.740
But I want to be more general
than this because when I deal

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.940
in terms of a rubber stamp
operation, that is a

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.830
transformation that involves
taking one little chunk of a

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:30.300
two dimensional space, picking
it up, and putting it down in

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:37.850
another location to another
unique location in space.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:42.270
So I'm going to now make another
generalization that

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.760
operations, which we've
begun to define,

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.470
act on all of space.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.660
So I don't want you to think of
this repetition in terms of

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.550
a rubber stamp, although we
could get the pattern that way

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.780
and it's conceptually
appealing.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:10.130
But I'm going to say now that
this string of motifs has

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:16.610
translational periodicity if,
when I pick it up, move it by

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.200
T in a particular direction,
and drop the whole infinite

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.310
chain back down again,
it is mapped into

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.558
congruence with itself.

00:37:26.558 --> 00:37:30.940
Which leads me to another
definition--

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:54.670
an object or a space possesses
symmetry when there is an

00:37:54.670 --> 00:38:19.230
operation or a set of operations
that maps it into

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.480
congruence with itself.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.790
In other words, in plain words,
you can't tell that

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.040
it's been moved.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.660
OK, is there anything else that
is a transformation which

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:09.470
leaves the set invariant?

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:13.930
OK, if we look at the first
pattern, there are [? rho ?]

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:19.030
sides such as this one here, or
this one here, or this one

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:26.630
here, about which I can rotate
one motif into its neighbor

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.660
or, for that matter, pick up the
entire chain and flip it

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:34.370
end over elbow through
180 degrees.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:39.060
And it will be mapped into
coincidence with itself.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.410
And that is an operation, and
another sort of distinct

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.770
operation of transformation.

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.520
And this is one that
I could call

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.530
rotation for obvious reasons.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.230
And there are two things I
have to tell you about a

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:59.050
rotation operation.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:03.230
The first one is the point about
which the rotation takes

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.080
place, and that's going
to be some point.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:18.590
And let me call this point here
A. So this will be some

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:23.015
labelled point that is the
location of the rotation axis.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.160
But then, the other thing that
I have to tell you is the

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.730
angle through which I'm
going to rotate.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:36.700
And I'll append to the
A as a subscript

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.950
the angle of rotation.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:49.070
So this particular operation,
called a twofold rotation

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.120
because it rotates through half
of a circle, would be the

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.520
operation A pi.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.690
This point is A. We rotate
through an angle pi.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:07.390
This pattern here has also
rotational symmetry.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.400
In addition to the translation,
there is a

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.860
rotation operation, A pi,
in the lower pattern.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:18.710
So the follow who is unfortunate
enough not to have

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.270
a seat-- and I should
have given you this

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:21.520
one a long time ago.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.260
I'll give that to you
as your reward for

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.970
giving the best answer.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:29.800
And you get a seat wherever you
would like to place it.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.130
The first and the final pattern
are the same in the

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.240
sense that they contain
two operations,

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.160
translation and rotation.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.810
This pattern is a much
more interesting one.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:44.370
This also has a rotational
symmetry, A pi.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.160
It also is based on
a translation.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.240
But now, there's another
operation that we can do to

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.960
leave the pattern invariant.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.580
There exists [? rho sides ?]

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.510
that pass through the center
of this rectangular figure

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:10.380
across which I could flip an
individual motif, or for that

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.810
matter the entire pattern,
from left to right.

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:18.280
It's a reflection sort
of operation.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.606
So this is a new type
of transformation.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.500
So we'll add that to our list.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:40.300
And the symbol that's usually
used to indicate the locus of

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:44.070
this operation is m, standing
from mirror.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.770
And that does it for these
particular patterns.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.210
Three sorts of operations--

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:57.700
translation, rotation,
and reflection.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:02.840
And in fact, that is all
you can have in a

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.610
two dimensional space--

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.570
not necessarily a
rotation that's

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:08.740
restricted to 180 degrees.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:12.920
If these patterns are
translational periodic in more

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.780
than one direction, you can
have higher symmetries.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:24.390
One of the things I would like
to suggest to you is that you

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:29.770
look around you in everyday life
at the sort of patterns

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:32.330
that enrich your environment.

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:35.850
I see a one dimensionally
periodic pattern there, the

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:37.630
black and white stripes.

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:40.770
It's translationally periodic,
going up and down.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:44.640
It also has mirror planes
running through the black

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.366
stripes and the white stripes.

00:43:47.366 --> 00:43:51.740
I see another two dimensional
pattern back there.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.700
That has translation.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:56.920
But you could rotate--

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.970
no, you can't do anything.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.710
That just has translation,
nothing else.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:00.650
Get a new shirt.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.420
That's not terribly
interesting.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.670
There's another one there that's
so complex I don't

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:09.390
think I can look at it without
climbing all over him and

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:13.050
drawing some translational
vectors and things like that.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.610
But that's a nice periodic
pattern.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.210
That's a good one.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.410
But there's lots of
stuff like that.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.350
Look at the grills in
the ventilators.

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:22.820
They have mirror planes.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.960
They are translationally
periodic in one direction.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.170
We've got floor tiles.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:33.450
These are lovely because these
have examples of 90 degree

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.500
rotational symmetry.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.830
Same is true of the tiles
up in the ceiling,

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:40.330
same sort of pattern.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:42.780
And there's another pattern with
four-fold symmetry in the

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:50.360
grills that are underneath
the fluorescent fixtures.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.495
So symmetry is everywhere.

00:44:51.495 --> 00:44:52.860
It surrounds us.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.090
We wear it.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:55.030
We walk on it.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:56.400
We sit on it.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.660
And think how much richer your
life will be when you can

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.575
understand this part of
your environment.

00:45:01.575 --> 00:45:05.070
Hey, that's a good, chauvinistic
note, overstated,

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.140
on which to end.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.060
So why don't we take
our break?

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.800
I'll hang around if you have
any questions or get you a

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.680
copy of anything that
came around that you

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.100
missed getting one of.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:19.100
And it is now, according to my
Timex watch, about three

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.420
minutes before the hour.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.630
So let's take a break and
stretch for 10 minutes.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.020
Ya'll come back because I've
got your name's on a list.

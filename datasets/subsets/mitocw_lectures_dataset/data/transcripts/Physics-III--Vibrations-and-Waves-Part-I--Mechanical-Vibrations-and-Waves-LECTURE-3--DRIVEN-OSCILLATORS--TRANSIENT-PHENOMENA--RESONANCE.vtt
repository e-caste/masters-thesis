00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.350
YEN-JIE LEE: OK, so
welcome back everybody.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.850
Happy to see you again.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.210
So today, we are going to
continue our exploration

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.830
and understand single
harmonic oscillator.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.690
And this is actually
a list of our goals.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.420
And we would like to
learn how to translate

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.560
physical situations into
mathematics so that we can

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.670
actually solve the
physical problem,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.510
so we actually have
and predict what

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.760
is going to happen afterward.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.210
And we also sort of
started this course

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.440
by solving really
simple examples,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.000
single harmonic oscillators.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.400
And as a function
of time, you will

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.060
see that, for our next
class, the next lecture,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.460
we are going to bring in
more and more objects.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.150
And of course, more objects
means more excitement also,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.060
in terms of phenomena,
but also more complication

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.610
on the mathematics.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.990
So we will see how things go.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.600
And then after
that, we are going

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.420
to go through infinite
number of oscillators

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.670
to see what will happen.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.340
Of course, we will
produce waves.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.690
That's very exciting.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.390
Then we'll do all kinds
of different tricks

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.500
to do those waves.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.260
So what we have we
learned last time?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.740
So last time we
went over example,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.740
a simple harmonic oscillator.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.100
It says you have a
rod fixed on the wall,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.750
and you can actually
go back and forth.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.390
And we also introduced a model
of the drag force, or drag

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.200
torque, and that's actually
proportionate to the velocity

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.050
of the motion of
that single particle.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.840
And the interesting thing
we learned last time

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.520
is that we have three
completely different behaviors

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.660
if we actually turn
on the drag force.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.880
The first one is on that damped.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.790
Damping is actually very small.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.680
Then we have the
solution in this form.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.580
It's oscillating.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.740
The amplitude is
decaying exponentially.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.750
As we make the drag
force larger and larger,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.850
you will pass a critical
point, which actually give you

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.290
a solution, which you don't
have oscillation anymore.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.550
The cosine disappeared.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.760
Finally, if you actually put
the whole system into water

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.700
or introduce something
really dramatic--

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.490
a very, very big drag force--

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.160
then you have
overdamp situation.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.660
And there you see that
the solution is actually

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.490
a sum of two
exponential functions.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.800
So this is actually
the one equation

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.850
which actually works for all the
damped situation we discussed

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.370
up to now.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.330
And this is actually the map.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.200
Basically, if gamma
goes to zero--

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.100
gamma actually controls
the size of the drag force.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.430
Then we got no damping.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.600
Then you have a pure,
simple harmonic motion.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.950
And as we increase
the gamma, then you

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.780
get see that the
behavior is changing

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.690
as we increase the gamma.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.590
So you can see that we
can use a quantity, which

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.705
is called Q. Q is actually
defined as a ratio of omega

00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:01.680
at zero, which is basically
the natural angular

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.500
frequency of the system.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.230
And gamma is a measure of
how big the drag force is.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.110
If we make a ratio
of this to quantity,

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.959
then you'll see that,
at Q equal to 0.5,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.125
it reaches a critical point,
which actually the behavior

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:24.570
of the whole system changed.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.150
And you can see that the
oscillation completely

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.400
disappeared.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.450
So that is actually what
we have learned last time.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.280
So what are we
going to do today?

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.940
We have been really
doing experiments really

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.410
with our hands, hands-on, right?

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.170
So basically we will
prepare the system.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.850
Then we release it.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.330
Then we don't touch it again
and see how this system actually

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.380
evolves as a function of time.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.500
So that's what we
have been doing.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.530
So today, what we
are going to do

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.100
is to start to
drive this system.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.250
We can introduce some
kind of driving force

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.230
and see how the system will
respond to this external force.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.320
So that is actually
what we are going to do.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.030
And that will bring
us to the situation

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.380
of damped driven
harmonic oscillator.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.220
So let's immediately
get started.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.280
So we will use the example
which we went through last time

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.110
as a starting point.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.270
So set example from
the last lecture

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.730
is a rod, which is
fixed on the wall.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.040
And the lens of this
rod is over two.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.130
And I define a counter-clockwise
direction to be positive.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.650
And I measure the
position of the rod

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.660
by this theta,
which is the angle

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.770
between the vertical direction
and the pointing direction

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.110
of the rod.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.890
And we have went
through with the math,

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.130
and we got the
equation of motion

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.660
without external
force, which is already

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.850
shown on the blackboard.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.560
So now, as I mentioned
at the beginning,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.250
I would like to add
a driving force,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.835
or driving torque, tau drive.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:36.490
This is equal to d0
cosine omega d t.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:43.494
So I am adding a driving torque.

00:06:43.494 --> 00:06:48.520
The amplitude of the
torque is actually d0.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.530
And there's actually also a
harmonic oscillating force,

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.670
or torque, and the angle
frequency of this torque

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.270
is omega d.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.700
And that means our
total torque, tau of t,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.120
will be equal to tau g t--

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.360
this is actually coming from
the gravitational force--

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.495
plus tau drag, which is to
account for the drag force.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.990
So this time we are
adding in a tau drag.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.190
So I'm not going to go over
all the calculations on how

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.080
did the right from the
beginning to the end.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.500
But I will just continue
from what we actually

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.940
started the last time.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.100
So if I have additional
driving torque there,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.030
that means my equation of motion
will be slightly modified.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.920
This time, my equation
of motion will

00:07:51.920 --> 00:08:00.980
become theta double dot plus
gamma theta dot plus omega 0

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:06.330
squared theta, and that
is equal to d0 divided

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.540
by I. This is actually
divided by I because, in order

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.490
to get the
acceleration, I'll need

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.970
to divide my torque by
a movement of inertia

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.960
of this system and
cosine omega d t.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.520
This is actually the
oscillating frequency

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.910
of the driving torque.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:37.100
And just a reminder, gamma is
defined to be equal to 3b m l

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.270
squared.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.270
And the omega 0 is
actually defined

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:48.350
to be square root of 3g over 2l.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.810
So as I mentioned
in the beginning,

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.490
this is actually
giving you a sense

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.850
of the size of the drag force.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.060
And the right hand
side, the omega 0

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:04.190
is actually the natural
angular frequency.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.470
So, of course, we can
actually simplify this

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:12.170
by replacing this term, or
this constant, by symbol.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.350
So the symbol I'm
choosing is f0.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:23.390
And this is defined to be
d0 divided by I. Therefore,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.930
I arrive at my final
equation of motion--

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:35.390
theta double dot plus gamma
theta dot plus omega 0

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:44.294
squared theta, and that is
equal to f0 cosine omega d t.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.810
So I hope this looks pretty
straightforward to you.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.140
So this is our
equation of motion

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.650
you can see from this slide.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.890
So we have three
terms in addition

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.780
to the theta double dot.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.730
The first one is
actually related

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.700
drag force, or drag torque.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.820
The second one is actually
related to so-called spring

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.840
force.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.920
So that is actually be
related to the spring constant

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.790
or, because of the
restoring force

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.470
of the gravitational force.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.715
The third one is actually
what we just add in

00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:31.540
as a driving force.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:37.600
So one question which I
would like to ask you is--

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.440
so now I bring one more
complication to this system.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.990
So now I am driving this system
with a different frequency,

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.232
which is omega d.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:52.920
The question is, what would
be the resulting oscillation

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.810
frequency of this driven
harmonic oscillator?

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.350
What is going to happen?

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.950
Well, this system
actually follows

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:09.950
the original damped oscillator
frequency, omega, which

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.040
is actually close to omega 0.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.990
Or what this system actually
follows the driving force

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.890
frequency.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.270
Finally, maybe
this system chooses

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.520
to do something in between.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.760
We don't know what
is going to happen.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.260
So our job today is to solve
these equation of motion

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.150
and to see what we can
learn from the mathematics.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:43.660
Then we can actually
check those results

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.310
to see if that agrees with
the experimental result, which

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.580
is through those demos, OK?

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:55.160
So as usual, I have this
equation of motion here.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.420
So one trick, which
I have been using,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.230
is to go to complex
notation, right?

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:08.440
Therefore, I can now re-write
this thing to be Z double dot

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:16.540
plus gamma Z dot plus
omega 0 squared Z,

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:25.750
and that is equal to f0
exponential i omega d t.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.300
So basically, I just go
to the complex notation.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.765
And we would like to
solve this equation.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.980
So in order to
solve this equation,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.245
I make a guess, a test function.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.570
I guess Z of t has
this functional form.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.156
This is equal to A--

00:12:51.156 --> 00:12:53.940
some kind of amplitude--

00:12:53.940 --> 00:13:01.600
exponential i omega
d t minus delta.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.550
Delta is actually
some kind of angle,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:11.070
which is actually to account
for the possible delay

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.620
of the system.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.370
So if I start to try--

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.730
for example, this is a system,
which I am interested--

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:22.320
I start to drive this
system, it may take some time

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.520
for the system to react
to your driving force.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.970
So that's actually accounted
for by this delta constant.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.880
And the amplitude is actually
what we were wondering,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.320
what would be the amplitude.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.420
Therefore, you have some
kind of a constant in front

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.720
of the exponential function.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.180
And you can see that this
exponential is actually having

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.550
angular frequency, omega d.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:55.410
And that is actually designed to
cancel this exponential i omega

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.950
d t here in the drag force.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:04.920
So now we can as you
calculate what z dot of t

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:12.600
would be equal to i omega
d Z. Z double dot t will

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.680
be equal to minus omega
d squared Z. With those,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.000
we can now plug that back
into this equation of motion

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.360
and see what we can
actually learn from there.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.340
So basically, what
I'm going to do

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.740
is to insert all
those things back

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.450
into the equation of motion.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.080
And that is actually
going to be like this.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.690
Basically, the first
term, the double dot,

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:45.690
you get a minus omega
d squared out of it.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.200
The second term, gamma Z dot--

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.060
I have Z dots here.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:58.485
Basically, I would get
plus i omega d gamma out

00:14:58.485 --> 00:15:00.660
of the second term.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:06.470
That's third term, I get
omega 0 squared out of it.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.660
And that is actually
multiplied by Z.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:16.490
And this is equal to f0
exponential i omega d t.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:29.120
All right, and we also
know from this expression

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.500
Z is equal to A exponential
i omega d t minus delta.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.020
That's the test function.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:42.030
So this is actually equal
to A exponential i omega d

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.730
t minus delta.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.150
So now what I can do is--

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.020
I have some constant
in the front.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.290
Multiply it by
exponential i omega d t.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:01.110
And now I can actually cancel
this exponential i omega d t

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.000
with the right hand side term.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.540
Very good.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.680
The whole equation is
actually exponential free.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.560
Now I don't have any
exponential function left.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.430
And exponential i delta is
actually just a constant.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.764
So now this equation is
actually independent of time.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.110
So what I getting is
like this-- basically

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.860
if I multiply the both sides
by exponential i delta,

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:45.610
then I get minus omega d squared
plus i omega d t plus omega 0

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:50.240
squared A. And
this is going to be

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:56.540
equal to f exponential i delta
because I multiply both sides

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.620
by exponential i delta.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:11.410
And this is equal to f cosine
delta plus i f sine delta.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.115
Just your last equation.

00:17:14.115 --> 00:17:14.990
Any questions so far?

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.410
So look at what I
have been doing.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:25.485
So I have this
equation of motion.

00:17:25.485 --> 00:17:30.040
As usual, I go to
complex notation.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.620
Then I guess Z equal to
A exponential i omega d

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.910
t minus delta because my
friends from the math department

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.650
already solved this, and
I'm just following it.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:49.660
Then I can calculate all
those terms, plug in e,

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.440
and basically, you will
arrive at this equation.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.090
This equation is a
complex equation.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.350
So what does that mean?

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.250
That means one equation
is equal to two equations

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:09.360
because you have the real part,
you have the imaginary part.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.980
Therefore, that's very nice
because I have two unknowns.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.040
The first one is A, a constant.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.840
And the second one is delta.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.210
Now I have two
equations I can solve

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.660
what would be the functional
form for A and the delta.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:30.910
And let me go immediately
solve this equation.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:37.110
So if I take the real
part from this equation,

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.970
basically what I'm going
to get is omega 0 squared--

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.680
this is real-- minus
omega d squared--

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.080
this is also real--

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.260
times A. A is actually
some real number.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.621
This is actually
equal to f cosine--

00:18:56.621 --> 00:18:57.120
f0.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.690
Sorry, I missed a zero here.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.970
So that zero I missed.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.310
This should be f0.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:11.100
f0 cosine delta.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.580
And I can also
collect all the terms,

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.520
which is imaginary terms.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.170
Then I get only the second
term from the left hand side

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.900
is with i in front of it.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:33.000
Therefore, I get omega d gamma
A from the left hand side.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.620
And from the right
hand side, there's

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.320
only one imaginary term.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:46.920
Therefore, I get-- this
is equal to f0 sine delta.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.620
So now I have two equations.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.330
I have two unknowns.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.310
Therefore, I can easily
solve A and delta.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.130
So I call this
equation number one.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.310
I call this equation number two.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:08.760
So now I can-- sounding in
quadrature the two equations--

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.010
in quadrature.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.700
And the left-hand
side will give you

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:21.200
A squared omega 0
squared minus omega

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:29.250
d squared squared plus omega
d squared gamma squared.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.940
That is actually coming
from the second equation.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.030
That gives you the
left hand side.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:45.140
It's a square of the sum the
first and second equation.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:56.060
And the right hand side will
become f0 square cosine delta

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.963
cosine squared delta
plus sine squared delta.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.752
And this is equal to 1.

00:21:05.752 --> 00:21:10.470
So that's actually the
trick to get rid of delta.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:15.830
Then I can get what will be
the resulting A. A is actually

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:19.940
a function of omega d.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.350
Omega d is given to you.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.890
It's actually
determined by you--

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.600
how fast do you want to
oscillate this system.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:37.350
And this is equal to f0
divided by square root

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.150
of this whole thing.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.510
So this will give
you omega 0 squared

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:48.920
minus omega d squared
squared plus omega

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.930
d squared gamma squared.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.910
Then we can also calculate
what would be the delta.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:07.800
The trick is to take a ratio
between equation number two

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.080
and the equation number one--

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.790
2 divided by 1.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:16.820
Basically, you will
get tangent delta.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.370
This is sine divided by cosine.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.260
f0 actually cancel.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.540
This is equal to what?

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.030
Equal to the ratio
of these two terms.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.480
After you take the
ratio, A drops out.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.760
Basically, what you
get is gamma omega

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:43.790
d divided by omega 0 squared
minus omega d squared.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:54.890
So we have solved A and the
delta through this exercise.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.450
So what does that mean?

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:06.280
Originally, I assume my solution
to be A exponential i omega d

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.500
t minus delta.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:17.100
Therefore, I would like to go
back to the real world, which

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.950
is actually theta.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.560
So basically, if I
take the real part,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:29.150
I would get theta of t, which
is actually the real part of Z.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:41.840
And that will give you A omega d
cosine omega d t minus delta is

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.749
also a function of omega d.

00:23:47.581 --> 00:23:50.490
So we have done this exercise.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.810
And you can see that the
first thing which we see here

00:23:54.810 --> 00:24:01.220
is that there's no free
parameter from this solution.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.310
A is decided by omega d.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.340
And delta is also
decided by omega d.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.200
There's a lot of
math, but actually we

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.090
have overcome those and
that we have a solution.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:18.310
But it is actually clear to you
that this cannot be the full

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.340
story.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.040
Because you have a second-order
differential equation,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.940
you need to have two free
parameters in the solution.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.220
What is actually missing?

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.152
Anybody can tell
me what is missing.

00:24:31.152 --> 00:24:32.610
AUDIENCE: The
homogeneous solution.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:34.170
YEN-JIE LEE: Very good.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.810
The homogeneous
solution is missing.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.960
So that's actually
why we actually

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.910
have no free parameter here.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.960
Once is the omega
d is determined,

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.120
once the f0 is given, then you
have the functional form which

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.930
decides what is actually theta.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:59.360
So what in actually
the full solution?

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.170
A full solution should
be, as you said,

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.290
a combination of
homogeneous solution

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.960
and the particular solution
which we actually got here.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:17.990
So if I prepare the system to be
in a situation of, for example,

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.420
underdamped situation.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.780
Then what I'm going to do
is actually pretty simple.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:30.350
What I am going to do is to just
copy the underdamped solution

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.300
from last lecture
and combine that

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.900
with my particular solution,
which I obtained here.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.990
So that actually to
see what actually

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.870
the full solution looks like.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:49.545
I have A omega d
cosine omega d t minus

00:25:49.545 --> 00:25:54.990
delta is a function of omega d.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:26:03.565
This is actually so-called
steady-state solution.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.420
And, of course,
as you mentioned,

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.394
I need to also add the
homogeneous solution

00:26:13.394 --> 00:26:15.060
and basically the no
-- this actually --

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.610
according to what
I wrote there, I

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.150
have a functional form of
exponential A exponential

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:26.220
minus gamma over 2t equals
sine omega t plus alpha.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.560
So I changed A to B because I
already have the A there just

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.490
to avoid confusion.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:36.125
Then basically, you get
B exponential minus gamma

00:26:36.125 --> 00:26:45.540
over 2t cosine
omega t plus alpha.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:52.120
Basically, they are two free
parameters, B and alpha.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:56.070
Those two free parameters
can be determined

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.740
by initial conditions.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:05.290
So, for example, initially
I actually release the rod

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:10.050
at some fixed angle
of theta initial.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.750
And also the initial
velocity is 0.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.930
Then I can actually
practice solution A

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:22.200
using those initial conditions
to solve B and alpha.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.431
Any questions so far?

00:27:24.431 --> 00:27:24.930
Yes.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.249
AUDIENCE: Are we assuming
it's underdamped?

00:27:27.249 --> 00:27:29.290
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah, I'm
assuming it's underdamped,

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.000
the situation.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.350
So that's the assumption.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:39.960
So it depends on the size
of gamma and the omega 0.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.115
Then you have actually four
different kinds of solution.

00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:48.460
If gamma is equal to 0, then
what you are going to plug in

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:55.890
is the solution from no damping
as a your homogeneous solution.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.640
And if you prepare
this system underwater,

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.030
damping is colossal,
it's huge, then

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:08.940
you actually plug in
the overdamped solution

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.960
to be your homogeneous
part of the solution.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.619
Any other questions?

00:28:14.619 --> 00:28:15.410
Very good question.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:24.020
So now maybe you
got confused a bit.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.200
I have now omega d.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.050
I have also omega.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.830
And there's another one
we just called omega 0.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.480
What are those?

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:41.405
So omega 0 is the
natural angular frequency

00:28:41.405 --> 00:28:44.260
without given the drag force.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.465
If you remove
everything just like

00:28:47.465 --> 00:28:51.230
without considering any
drag force, et cetera,

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.100
and that is actually the
natural frequency of the system.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.470
And what is omega?

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.050
Omega, according
to the function,

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:04.130
omega is defined to be omega
0 squared minus gamma squared

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.740
over 4 square root of that.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:10.970
That is actually the oscillation
frequency, which we actually

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.480
discussed last
lecture, after you

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.680
add drag force into it again.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:25.560
Finally, omega d is how fast
you actually drive this system.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.450
So that is actually
the definition

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.890
of these three omegas.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:38.070
So you can see that, if
I prepare my solution

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:43.055
to be underdamped situation,
then basically you

00:29:43.055 --> 00:29:45.720
will see that this is actually
so-called a steady-state

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.730
solution because A
omega d is a constant.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.165
So it's going to
be there forever.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:00.210
And the second term is actually
B exponential minus gamma

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.146
over 2t.

00:30:02.146 --> 00:30:05.200
It's decaying as a
function of time.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.690
So if you are patient
enough, you wait,

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.350
then this will be gone.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.260
So that is actually how
we actually understand

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.900
this mathematical result.
And now, of course, you

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.880
can actually take
a look at this.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.770
This is actually just assuming
some kind of initial condition

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:30.870
and plug in the solution and
plot it as a function of time.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.970
And you can see that this
function looks really

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.520
weird, looks a bit surprising.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.780
What does that mean?

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.160
It looks really strange.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.890
But at some point,
this superposition

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.240
of these two functions--

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.050
because one of the functions
actually dies out, disappears--

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.900
then you will see that,
if you wait long enough,

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:55.110
then you actually only see
a very simple structure,

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.950
which is oscillation
frequency of omega d.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.520
And that means a large t.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.840
In the beginning, the
system will not like it.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.110
You drive it, and the
system don't like it.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.820
Like if I go and shake
you, in the beginning,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.400
you would not like it--

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:14.970
maybe.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:18.950
And if I shake you long enough,
and you say, come on, OK, fine.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:21.210
I accept that.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.350
So that is actually what is
going to happen to the system.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:31.900
So now I would like to go
through a short demonstration,

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.480
which is actually the air
cart, which you seen before.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.120
There's a mass and there
are two springs in the front

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.940
and the back of this cart.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.260
And, of course, as usual,
I would turn on the air

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.950
so that I make the
friction smaller,

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.240
but there's still some
residual friction.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.630
And you will see that
this mass is actually

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.630
oscillating back and forth.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.290
And the amplitude can
become smaller and smaller

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:07.460
as a function of time.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.310
Now in the right hand
side, I have a motor,

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:14.220
which actually can drive this--

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.540
I can actually
shorten or increase

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.430
the length of the
right hand side string.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:23.960
Then I actually
introduce a driving force

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.280
by the right hand side motor.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:32.670
If I turn it down, this is
what is going to happen.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:38.850
So we can see now this motor is
actually going back and forth.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:43.830
And it has a slightly
higher frequency compared

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.135
to the natural frequency.

00:32:46.135 --> 00:32:49.680
So the frequency of
the motor is higher.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:55.320
And you can see that this
cart is actually oscillating.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.404
But you can see that sometimes
it pulls and sometimes it

00:33:00.404 --> 00:33:00.945
moves faster.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.840
So you can see that
it's actually moving.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.410
And it stops a little
bit because they

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:16.290
are all superposition of two
different kinds of oscillating

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:17.930
functions come into play.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.550
You can see that now.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.600
It got slowed down,
and it can become

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.820
faster and slower and faster.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:30.100
But eventually, if
you wait long enough,

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.760
what is going to happen?

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.960
What is going to happen?

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.250
If we wait long enough--

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.648
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.380
YEN-JIE LEE: Exactly.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.500
So basically, if you wait
long enough, as you said,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.261
you will actually just oscillate
at the frequency of the driving

00:33:47.261 --> 00:33:47.760
force.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:52.440
You can see that this motion
looks really bizarre, right?

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.120
Sometimes it stops,
and sometimes

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.600
it actually continues to move.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.217
And are you surprised?

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.880
Probably you are not
surprised anymore

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.510
because we know math is the
language to describe nature.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:14.260
And indeed it predicts
this kind of behavior.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.120
That's really pretty cool.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:23.260
In order to help you to learn
a bit how to actually translate

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.679
a physical situation into
mathematics, what I am going

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:31.000
to do is to introduce
you another example so

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.420
that actually we can
actually solve it together.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.830
So now I would like
to drive a pendulum.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:50.395
So I prepare a pendulum
at time equal to 0.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:35:01.210
This is a string attached to
a ball with mass equal to m.

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:04.870
And the length of the
string is equal to l.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:08.410
And the angle between
the vertical direction

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:14.440
and the direction of
the string is theta.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:18.000
And, of course, I can actually
give you initial condition X

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.010
initial, which is
actually measured

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:32.620
with respect to the vertical
direction, and time equal to t.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:37.430
This is actually the
original vertical direction,

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.350
the same as this dashed line.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:48.800
And I can actually move the top
of the string back and forth

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.750
to some position.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:57.620
And, of course, this string
is connected to the ball.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:02.960
And this system is actually
driven from the top

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.780
by the engine's
hand, so the engine

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.750
is actually shaking this
system from the top.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.220
And I do it really nicely.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:16.440
So basically, I define
that the displacement, d,

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:22.650
as a function of time, is
equal to delta sine omega d t.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.660
So that is actually
what I'm going to do.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.740
OK, and I would like
to see what is going

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.910
to happen to this pendulum.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:40.200
So, as usual, the first step
towards solving this problem

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.702
is to define a
coordinate system.

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.410
So what is actually
the coordinate system

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.800
I'm going to use?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:53.760
So now I define
pointing upward to be y.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.660
I define the
horizontal direction

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:02.220
pointing to the right hand
side of the board to be x.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.810
So that's not good enough.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.480
I still need the origin, right?

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:12.870
So now I also define my origin
to be the original position

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:21.270
of the ball which is
actually completely addressed

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.340
before I do the experiment.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.250
So that this is actually
the equilibrium position

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.150
of this system actually.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:33.130
Then I define here to be 0, 0.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:37.170
So once I have that
defined, I can now

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:42.840
express the position of
this mass of this ball

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.210
to be xt and yt.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:53.020
And see what we
are going to get.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.780
Of course, as
usual, we are going

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:04.270
to analyze the force
actually acting on this ball.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:08.455
So therefore, as usual, we
will draw a force diagram.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.080
So basically, you have
the little mass here,

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:25.990
and you have actually two forces
acting on this little mass,

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.806
or little ball.

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:31.980
This is Fg pointing downward.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.880
It's a gravitational force.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:38.290
And now this is actually
equal to minus mg y.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:46.400
And there's also
a string tension,

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:54.790
T. Since we have this definition
of theta here, basically

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.640
I have a T which is
actually pointing

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.940
to the upper left
direction of the board.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.890
Oh, don't forget--
actually there's

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.110
a third force, which
is actually the F drag.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:18.470
F drag is actually
equal to minus bx

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:21.294
dot in the x direction.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:33.450
Now I would like to write
down the expression for also

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.390
the string tension,
T. The T is actually

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:43.320
equal to minus T sine
theta in the x direction

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.430
because the T is pointing
to upper left direction.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.390
So therefore, the
position to x direction

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:57.560
will be minus sine
theta and plus T cosine

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.260
theta in the y direction
because the tension is actually

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.725
pointing upper left.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:10.750
As usual, this is actually
pretty complicated to solve.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:11.920
I have this cosine.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.540
I have this sine there, right?

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:22.530
So what I'm going to do is
to assume that this angle

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:27.340
theta is very small, as usual.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.160
So I will take small
angle approximation.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.940
Then basically,
you have sine theta

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:38.080
is roughly to be equal to
theta, and that is actually

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.060
equal to what?

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.440
Equal to-- here.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.600
Basically, you can
actually calculate

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.820
what will be the theta.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.090
The sine theta,
or theta, would be

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:56.700
equal to x minus d divided by l.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.180
And of course, taking a
small angle approximation

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:09.940
will bring cosine theta to be 1.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.020
Then after this
approximation, my T

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:20.670
will become minus
T x minus d divided

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:30.280
by l in the x direction
plus T in the y direction

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:35.170
because sine theta is replaced
by this approximated value

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:39.440
because sine theta is
actually replaced by 1.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.720
Any questions?

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.601
Yes.

00:41:42.601 --> 00:41:54.702
AUDIENCE: Is that a constant
or is that the change in sine?

00:41:54.702 --> 00:41:55.910
YEN-JIE LEE: It's a constant.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.180
Yeah, I was going too fast.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:02.149
So this is actually a
constant of my amplitude.

00:42:02.149 --> 00:42:05.600
AUDIENCE: And the drag force
is only in the x direction?

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.700
YEN-JIE LEE: Yes, it's
only in the x direction.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:13.170
So I'm only trying to actually
move this point back and forth

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.157
horizontally.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:26.010
So now I have all the
components T, Fg, f drag.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.860
And, of course, you can see
that I already ignored the drag

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.460
force in the y direction
from that formula

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:36.090
because I am only
considering the system to be

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.940
moving in the x direction.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:44.790
Therefore, I can now collect all
the terms in the x direction.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:49.060
Basically, you will
have m x double dot.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:54.360
This is equal to minus b
x dot, which is actually

00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:05.860
coming from the drag force,
minus T x minus d divided by l.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:11.960
This is actually coming from
this term in the x direction.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.140
Let's look at those
in the y direction.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.320
And y double dot would
be equal to minus mg

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:26.830
plus T. The minus mg is from
the gravitational force.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.940
And this T is coming from
the y component of the string

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.640
tension.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.910
And of course, since we are
taking a very small angle

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:42.401
approximation, there will
be no vertical motion.

00:43:42.401 --> 00:43:42.900
Yes.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.316
AUDIENCE: Why did we use
the small approximation

00:43:46.316 --> 00:43:49.244
for sine theta when
we're going to use

00:43:49.244 --> 00:43:53.136
x minus d over l, which
represents psi instead of just

00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:53.636
theta?

00:43:53.636 --> 00:43:55.990
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah,
so also in this case,

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:59.230
they happen to be
exactly the same.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.260
And why I care is
actually the cosine theta.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.930
Otherwise, I would have
to deal with cosine theta.

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.090
And also, this y
double dot would not

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:12.340
be equal to 0, which is what
I'm going to assume here.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.010
Good question.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.060
So the question was, why do I
need to take an approximation?

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.750
Because I want to get
rid of cosine theta.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:22.800
So now from this
y direction, I can

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:29.050
solve T will be equal to mg
because I assume that there's

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.170
no y direction motion.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.780
And I can conclude that--

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.610
originally, I don't know what
is actually the string tension.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:41.330
It's denoted by T. Now,
from this second equation,

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:45.100
I can conclude that T
will be equal to mg, which

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.260
is the gravitational force.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:54.670
Then, once I have that, I
can go back to x direction.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:58.210
Basically, I get m x double dot.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:06.130
This is equal to minus b x
dot minus mg over l x minus d.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:13.880
Everything is working very well.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:23.870
And I just have to really write
down the d function explicitly.

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:25.070
What is d?

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:31.570
d is just a reminder,
delta sine omega d t.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:33.980
So I will plug that
into that equation.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:38.900
And also I will
bring all the terms

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.740
related to x to
the left hand side

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:49.060
just to match my convention.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.740
All right, so now I will
be able to get the result,

00:45:53.740 --> 00:46:04.420
m x double dot plus b
x dot plus mg over l x.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:11.290
And that is actually
equal to mg over l d.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:20.740
And this is equal to mg
over l delta sine omega dt.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.940
So basically, I
collect all the terms,

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.460
put it to the left hand side.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:29.980
And I write down T
explicitly, which is this.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.770
Then I can divide
everything by m.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:41.710
Then I get m x double dot plus
b over m x dot plus g over l x.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:49.760
And that would be equal to g
over l delta sine omega dt.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.960
Now, of course, as usual, I
will define this to be gamma,

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.170
define this to be
omega 0 squared.

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:03.840
And I would define
this to be f0, which is

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.630
equal to omega 0 squared delta.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.970
It happened to be
equal like that.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:12.060
And then this actually
becomes x double

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.920
dot plus gamma x
dot plus omega 0

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:22.440
squared x equal to
f0 sine omega dt.

00:47:25.266 --> 00:47:27.840
Am I going too fast?

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.530
OK, everybody is following.

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.910
So we see that ha!

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:34.350
This equation-- I know that.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:36.510
I know this equation, right?

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:42.210
Because we have just solved
that a few minutes ago.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:47.020
Therefore, I know immediately
what will be the solution.

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.650
The solution is here already.

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:55.070
I have A omega d and the tangent
delta, the function of force

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:56.550
there.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:03.010
Therefore, I can now write
down what will be the A.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:08.800
So A is actually just
equal to f0 divided

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.790
by square root of
omega 0 squared

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:17.110
minus omega d squared
squared plus omega

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.300
d squared gamma squared.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:31.610
So now the question is--

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:36.650
what does the result
actually mean.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:38.930
I have this function.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.070
I have that function,
tangent delta.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.210
It's solved.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:48.860
It's actually the amplitude
of the steady-state solution

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:53.180
and also the phase difference
between the drag force

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:59.570
phase and the steady-state
oscillation phase.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:02.690
So that's actually
the amount of lag

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:05.900
and the size of the amplitude.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:10.820
But through this equation it is
very difficult to understand.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:14.105
So what I'm going to do
is to take some limit

00:49:14.105 --> 00:49:18.080
so that actually we can help you
to understand what is going on.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:25.550
So suppose I assume
that omega d goes to 0.

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:27.260
So what does that mean?

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:32.060
This is the engine's hand
and is moving really slowly

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.420
and see what is going to happen.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:42.090
If I do this, then you
will find that A omega d--

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:47.720
since omega goes to 0,
this is gone, this is gone.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.680
Therefore, you will see
that omega A will be

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.930
equal to omega 0 divided by--

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:58.860
I'm sorry-- of f0 divided
by omega 0 squared.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.420
And that is actually
equal to g delta

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.720
over l divded by g over l.

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:09.320
And that will give you delta.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.860
So what does that mean?

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:16.430
This means that, if I drive
this thing really slowly,

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:21.530
then the amplitude
of the mass will

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:27.722
be equal to how much I
actually move, which is delta.

00:50:27.722 --> 00:50:28.222
OK.

00:50:28.222 --> 00:50:30.820
Do you get it?

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:37.360
In addition to that,
tangent delta--

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.980
since I am taking the
limit omega d goes to 0.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.460
Therefore, tangent delta
will be equal to 0,

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:52.020
and that means delta
will be equal 0.

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:55.080
Any questions?

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.540
So that means there will
be no phase difference.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:02.220
The system has enough time
to keep up with my speed.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:11.410
The second limit, obviously,
omega d goes to infinity.

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:12.670
What does that mean?

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:16.730
That means I'm going to
hold this as a string

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:21.220
and shake it like
crazy really fast

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.920
and see what will happen, OK?

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.490
So in that case,
you will get A omega

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:31.950
d, and that one goes to
0, because omega d goes

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:33.260
to infinity.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.090
This one goes to 0.

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:41.930
And also, tangent delta
will go to infinity.

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:45.430
Therefore, delta will go to pi.

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:48.100
So that means they
will be out of phase.

00:51:50.682 --> 00:51:52.390
Any questions so far
in these two limits?

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:58.760
OK, so what I'm
going to do now is

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:03.580
to take a small toy, which
I made for my son, who

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.170
is one-year-old now.

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:09.200
Because I would like him to
learn wavelength vibration

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.200
before he goes to
quantum, right?

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.050
Hey?

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:13.700
So I made this toy.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:17.420
And he looked at it.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.240
So you can see now,
I can demonstrate

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:26.872
what is going to happen when
omega is approaching to 0.

00:52:26.872 --> 00:52:27.372
OK?

00:52:30.844 --> 00:52:33.460
I am already doing it.

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.640
Can you see it?

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.290
No?

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:40.686
It's a very exciting experiment.

00:52:40.686 --> 00:52:42.550
Can you see that?

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:48.420
You see that this is the
origin vertical direction.

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:53.700
If I do it really,
really, really slowly,

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:59.140
you can see that the
amplitude of the ball

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:04.200
is actually exactly the same as
the displacement I introduced.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.160
So that's kind of obvious.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.170
So now, let's see what
is going to happen if I

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:15.950
drive this system like crazy.

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.350
OK, not going up and down.

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:21.180
Eeeee-- that's the
maximum speed I can do.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.290
Maybe you can do it faster.

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:27.900
But you can see that
nothing happened.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:31.660
So amplitude is close
to 0, because what

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.690
you have been doing is--

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:40.050
disappear, you sort
cancelling each other.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.590
And it's actually not
going to contribute

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:47.040
to the motion of this ball.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.960
So now, you can see that I can
also test, what is actually

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.580
the natural frequency?

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.890
And what I am going
to do is to oscillate

00:53:55.890 --> 00:54:01.900
at around the natural frequency
to see what is going to happen.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.990
Let's see what is
going to happen.

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:08.130
You can see that the delta
is really small, right?

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:09.535
Can you see the delta.

00:54:09.535 --> 00:54:12.910
It's really small-- very small--

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:16.480
very small.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:21.145
But you can see that the
amplitude, the A, is huge.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.370
What does that tell us?

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:29.841
What does that tell us?

00:54:29.841 --> 00:54:30.340
Yeah?

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.348
AUDIENCE: Well, we're
experiencing resonance.

00:54:32.348 --> 00:54:35.810
YEN-JIE LEE: Yes, we are
experiencing resonance.

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:40.230
And also, that also
tells you that the system

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:43.440
is under-damped very much.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.940
The Q value is very big.

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:53.470
So if I calculate
the amplitude, A--

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:59.144
now, I can calculate
the amplitude, A,

00:54:59.144 --> 00:55:02.760
at natural frequency.

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.170
What I'm going to get is--

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:13.440
now, I can actually plug in
omega d equal to omega 0.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.200
So if I plug in omega d--

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.460
omega d equal to omega 0--

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.290
then what is going to happen?

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.500
So this term is working.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:40.880
So you have A is equal to
f-0 divided by omega 0 gamma.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.630
Omega-d is now equal to omega 0.

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:48.770
And that is going to give you--

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:55.890
so f-0 is actually
omega 0 square delta

00:55:55.890 --> 00:56:00.190
divided by omega 0 gamma.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.760
And the one omega
0 actually cancels.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:10.830
Then, basically, you
will get Q times delta.

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:12.060
What is Q?

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.640
Just a reminder, it's
actually the ratio

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.330
of omega 0 and the gamma.

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.850
When the Q is very large,
what does that mean?

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:25.800
That means it's so close
to an idealized situation

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.780
that direct force is very small.

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:32.390
You can see that in the example
which I have been doing.

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:37.050
So you can see that, ah,
it is really the case.

00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:42.570
So you can see that if my delta
is something like 1 centimeter,

00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:48.767
but the amplitude is actually
at the order of 1 meter, maybe.

00:56:48.767 --> 00:56:49.600
What does that mean?

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:55.200
That means that Q is
actually, roughly, 100.

00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:00.410
So you can actually even get
a Q out of this experiment.

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:01.451
Any questions so far?

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:07.350
OK, that's very good.

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:09.990
So now, we can go
ahead and take a look

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:15.720
at the structure of
the A and the delta.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.030
As we demonstrated
before, we make

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:23.140
sense of those three different
kinds of situations--

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:27.670
omega d goes to 0, omega
d goes to infinity.

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.060
And of course, I would
like to know the force

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:33.480
structure of A and delta.

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.685
Therefore, what I'm going
to do is to plug A omega

00:57:36.685 --> 00:57:41.850
d as a function of omega d.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:50.010
So what I'm going to get is
this will be equal to delta

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.810
when omega d goes to 0.

00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:54.990
We just demonstrated that.

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:58.230
And this will increase
to a large value

00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:06.060
and drop down to 0, when
omega d goes to infinity.

00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:10.410
And you can see that
this is around omega 0.

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:16.440
And you are going to get a huge
amplitude at around omega 0.

00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.220
But not quite.

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:22.020
The maxima is actually
slightly smaller than omega 0.

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:26.670
You can actually calculate
that as part of the homework.

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:28.320
So that makes sense.

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:36.540
Now, I can also plug the delta,
which is the phase difference--

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:39.270
and you can see that
this phase difference

00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:44.560
will be, originally, 0, when
the omega d is very small.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:47.530
And this is actually
the omega 0.

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:49.920
I hope you can see it.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.820
And this will be
increasing rapidly here

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.990
and approaching to pi.

00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:01.320
So that means, when you
are shaking this system

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.040
like crazy--

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.880
very high frequency-- then
the system cannot keep up with

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.680
the speed.

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.500
The amplitude will
be very small.

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:16.530
And also, the amplitude will
be out of phase completely.

00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:20.920
So let's actually do us
another demonstration,

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:26.260
using this little device here.

00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:28.640
This is actually
what you see before,

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.800
the ball with a Mexican hat.

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:36.260
And you can see that there is a
spring attached to this system.

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:39.360
And on the top, what
I am going to do

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:46.430
is to use this motor to drive
this system up and down,

00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:49.140
as a direct force.

00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:55.410
So now, what am I going to
do is to come from a very

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:58.720
low-frequency oscillation.

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.770
So you can see that the natural
frequency is sort of like this.

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:07.880
And you can see that, now, I
am driving this system really

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.306
slowly.

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:13.720
You can see, this is
actually going up and down

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.180
really slowly.

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:19.630
And you see that-- huh--

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:24.330
the amplitude is
actually pretty small.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.480
There's no excitement
for the moment.

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:35.570
All right, so what
I'm going to do is,

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:42.090
now, I increase the speed of the
motor and see what will happen.

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:45.620
So you can see,
now, it's actually

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.470
driving it with higher
and higher frequency.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.830
You see that-- huh--
something is happening.

01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:58.280
You can see the amplitude is
getting larger and larger.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.010
I'm still increasing
the frequency--

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:07.230
increasing, increasing-- until
something-- something happened!

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.210
Right?

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:09.780
Did you see that?

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:13.950
It starts to
oscillate up and down.

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:16.170
Because right now,
you can see that--

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:18.540
look at the top.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.120
The frequency of
the motor is now

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:28.980
really close to the natural
frequency of this system.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:32.550
So a resonance
behavior will happen.

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:36.890
And what you are going
to get is that, OK,

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:38.640
omega d around omega 0.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.680
Then you are going to
get large time amplitude.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.360
So now, what I am going
to do is to continue

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.950
to increase the
driving frequency

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.110
to a very large value.

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:57.850
OK, now it's actually
doing the "mmmmm"--

01:01:57.850 --> 01:01:59.290
doing it really fast.

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:00.750
You can see on the top--

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:01.440
very fast.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.910
OK, I even get it even faster.

01:02:06.545 --> 01:02:10.940
You see that-- huh--
indeed, this system

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:15.440
is now oscillating at
a larger frequency.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.800
It's trying to keep up
with the driving force.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.510
But you can see that the
amplitude is actually

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:25.650
much smaller than what
had happened before.

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:29.610
So before the class, you
may actually think that,

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.500
OK, drive it really fast.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.870
Maybe we'll increase
the amplitude.

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.720
But in reality, actually,
it will give you

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.877
a very small amplitude.

01:02:38.877 --> 01:02:40.710
Another thing, which
is interesting to know,

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:46.300
is that you can see that, when
the driving force is actually

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.350
at the maximum.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:52.835
And actually the
position of this mass

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:54.660
is actually at the minimum.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.720
So they are actually
out of phase.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.340
I hope you can see it.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.230
It's like this.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:17.480
OK, so what you can see is that,
when I understand the system

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.280
and I try to drive it with
the natural frequency, what

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.210
is going to happen
is that I'm exciting

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:28.880
this system to a
state of resonance.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.420
So basically, you'll get
some resonance behavior.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:35.510
So I have shown
you that this works

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:40.220
for driven mechanical
oscillator.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:44.240
It also works for the
spring-mass system.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.470
And there are many other
things which also work,

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:50.930
which is around you.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:55.550
For example, if you happen
to be my office hour,

01:03:55.550 --> 01:04:00.880
you would notice that the
air-condition in my office

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.590
is actually creating
a resonance behavior.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.853
You'll see low frequency sound--

01:04:05.853 --> 01:04:10.150
"mm mm mm"--
something like that.

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:13.590
And that is because
the pipe actually

01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:17.061
happens to have the frequency
match with the resonance

01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:17.560
frequen--

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:23.230
OK, the airflow actually
happened to excite the pipe,

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:27.930
so that it's actually
oscillating up and down

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:28.680
at that frequency.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.950
So what I did was I tried
to turn it down to low

01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:34.300
and see what happened.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:39.760
But unfortunately, it actually
excited another resonance.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.640
I see, now, not a
low-frequency sound, but a very

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:43.890
high-frequency sound.

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:46.480
I will post a video,
actually online.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.660
So my life is hard, right?

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.670
But I'm a physicist.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:55.110
Is So I choose to
use the median.

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:58.590
Then I actually stay
between the two resonances.

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:04.900
Then I don't hear the additional
sound, which bothers me.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:11.050
Another example is that, when
I was in Taiwan as a undergrad,

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:13.700
I was living outside
in a apartment.

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:20.650
And with my flat-mate, we owned
a very old washing machine.

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:23.920
So in the middle of the
night, the washing machine

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.680
would started to walk
around, like my flat-mate.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.845
And we are not scared.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:35.740
That is because the oscillation
frequency-- actually,

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.840
the rotation--

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.490
happened to match
with the frequency

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:41.050
of the washing machine.

01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:43.690
Therefore, when we started
to wash our clothes,

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:47.830
it start to walk
around in the room.

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:51.400
So as a physicist,
what we have decided

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:57.940
is to make the spin slightly
slower, or even faster.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.710
Then, actually,
you can see that,

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:03.370
when you do that, then you get
rid of the resonance behavior.

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:05.590
So it's not walking
around any more.

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:06.580
We can control it.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.630
Another thing which
is interesting

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:13.930
is that the resonance
behavior is not only

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:16.600
in the physical objects,
which we actually

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.530
deal with these days also.

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:21.340
But either you learn
quantum mechanics

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.440
and upon the field
theory, you will

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:30.160
find that there are resonance
also in a mass wave function.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.360
So basically, you can see
that these are examples

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:38.080
of the Z boson resonance peak.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:44.800
So if you scatter a
electron and positron then,

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.840
basically, you'll see that the
cross-section have a resonance

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.980
peak at around 90 GeV.

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:58.570
And that is actually another
very interesting example

01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:01.475
of a resonance in
particle physics.

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:08.780
Finally, the last example,
which I am going to go through

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:14.330
is an example involving a glass.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:18.290
We have prepared a very
high-quality glass here.

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:26.430
Maybe you have seen
this glass before.

01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:28.250
They are pretty nice.

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:38.590
And I usually use it to enjoy
my red wines, which you cannot,

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:39.780
enjoy, probably now.

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:45.980
So you can see that
this is the glass.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:49.300
And if I put a little bit of
water on my hand and I rub it--

01:07:53.584 --> 01:07:54.536
[VIBRATING TONE]

01:07:54.536 --> 01:07:59.860
--carefully, I can
actually excite one

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:03.250
of the resonance frequencies.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:06.040
So you can see that we
have all everything working

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.890
on a single particle.

01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:13.330
And that will give you
one resonance frequency.

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:15.550
If I work on two
particles, which

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:18.100
you will see that
in the next lecture,

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.710
I would get two
resonance frequencies.

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:27.220
And this glass is made of
infinite number of particles.

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:30.490
Therefore, I will
have infinite number

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:33.250
of resonance frequencies.

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:36.160
When I'm rubbing
it, I'm actually

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:42.220
giving input of all kinds
of different frequencies.

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:46.330
But the glass will
be smart enough so

01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:50.260
that it will pick up the
one it likes the most, which

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.420
is the resonance frequency.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:58.741
So you can see that the sound
is actually, roughly, 683 Hertz.

01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:06.279
And you can actually
measure it with your phone.

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:10.810
So on the TV commercial,
you may have seen

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:13.760
that there's a lady singing.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.710
And she's singing so loudly
such that the glass--

01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:20.689
"bragh!"-- breaks.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:24.590
Can we get a volunteer today
to sing in front of us?

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:28.210
Oh-- singing.

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:30.240
Can you sing it--

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.479
high frequencies?

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:33.834
"Ahhhh."

01:09:33.834 --> 01:09:37.140
[LAUGHTER & APPLAUSE]

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.069
Very good try.

01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:41.540
But it didn't work.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.350
OK, I guess it's
really difficult

01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:49.819
to perform that in front of
so many people unprepared.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:52.430
But fortunately, we are MIT.

01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:56.270
So we have designed a
device, which actually

01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:59.990
can help us to achieve this.

01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:06.140
So this device actually
contain a amplifier here.

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:12.770
And I can now control the
frequency of the sound

01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:14.330
through this scope.

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:18.410
And this amplifier will
actually amplify the signal

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:26.750
and produce a sound wave and try
to actually isolate this glass.

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.820
So we are going to
do this experiment.

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:32.780
So we will need to change
the loud setting a bit.

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:36.710
Because the sound is going
to be, probably, too loud.

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:42.527
Just for safety-- some
of you may not survive.

01:10:42.527 --> 01:10:43.840
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.830
So I'm handing out these.

01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:55.110
OK, who is closer?

01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:56.768
OK, maybe you.

01:10:56.768 --> 01:10:58.672
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:58.672 --> 01:10:59.616
YEN-JIE LEE: Oh.

01:10:59.616 --> 01:11:00.977
Oh, sorry.

01:11:00.977 --> 01:11:02.260
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.960
I'm so sorry.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.170
What?

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:07.080
I don't need that.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:07.580
OK.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.530
So just for safety,
I will put this on.

01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:20.540
And what I am going to do
is also put these glass on.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.290
OK, maybe I'll do this first.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:39.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:41.960
YEN-JIE LEE: OK, so what
I am going to do now

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.512
is to start
producing sound wave.

01:11:45.512 --> 01:11:47.356
[LOUD TONE]

01:11:48.278 --> 01:11:50.550
So through the
camera, you should

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:55.916
be able to see what is
actually shown on the screen.

01:11:55.916 --> 01:12:04.715
So you can see that, if this
glass is actually moving,

01:12:04.715 --> 01:12:07.770
the wood inside
would also vibrate.

01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:11.730
So you can see that, clearly,
we don't have resonance yet.

01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:17.440
So what I am going to do is
to increase the frequency

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.590
and see what happens.

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:24.240
So now, it's actually 643.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.585
It's actually still below
the resonance frequency.

01:12:28.585 --> 01:12:31.650
Now, I have measured
the frequency.

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.860
It should be 684.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.296
So now, it's actually 653--

01:12:39.595 --> 01:12:45.840
663 Hertz-- 673 Hertz.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:46.900
Can you see the movement?

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:51.200
You cannot see the movement yet.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.410
683-- you see?

01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:55.350
You see, now--

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.960
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:58.512
YEN-JIE LEE: --the
frequency of the sound

01:12:58.512 --> 01:13:03.200
is actually matching with one
of the natural frequencies

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.020
of the glass.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.340
Apparently, the glass likes it.

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:14.990
And now, you can see that
it is still vibrating.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.990
And the next step, which
we are going to do,

01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:21.920
is to try to increase
the amplitude,

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.250
increase the volume of the
sound, and see what happens.

01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:29.041
Maybe you want to cover
your ears, just for safety.

01:13:29.041 --> 01:13:30.845
[LOUD TONE]

01:13:30.845 --> 01:13:37.852
OK, then the glass may
break, if we are lucky.

01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:41.788
Let us see what is
going to happen.

01:13:41.788 --> 01:13:44.248
[INCREASINGLY LOUDER TONE]

01:14:01.046 --> 01:14:02.462
That's the quickest
one we've had.

01:14:02.462 --> 01:14:04.260
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah,
thank you very much.

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.830
Thank you, glass.

01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:07.120
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:11.440
So you can see the
power of resonance.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:19.110
So if I tune down the
frequency slightly more,

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:22.800
then you will be where?

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.570
You'll be here.

01:14:24.570 --> 01:14:31.050
Then you will not have enough
amplitude to break the glass.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:35.100
And also, as we
discussed before,

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:39.350
the quality of the glass should
be really, really high, such

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:42.880
that the resulting amplitude
will be very large.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.940
Then you can actually break
it with a external sound wave.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.580
And if we go above the
resonance frequency,

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.020
then you would not
also move a bit.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:56.940
Because if you go to
very large omega d,

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.690
then amplitude will
be pretty small.

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:09.116
OK, let me try to switch
back to my presentation.

01:15:09.116 --> 01:15:10.062
I think we did.

01:15:10.062 --> 01:15:10.562
Sure.

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:20.200
So this is actually what
we have learned today.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:27.540
We have learned the behavior
of a damped driven oscillator.

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:30.600
We have learned the
transient behavior.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.420
So what is actually
transient behavior

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:42.420
is a mixture of steady
state solution, which

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.850
was coming from
the driving force,

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:48.900
and the homogeneous solution.

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:53.530
If you wait long enough, this
will decay and disappear.

01:15:53.530 --> 01:15:57.770
Is

01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:59.960
And we have learned resonance.

you actually solved that

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.870
in your P-set, in pendulum,
which I just show you,

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:13.370
which helped my son to learn
wavelength vibrations--

01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:20.030
and air condition,

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.830
We can see damped os--

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:29.300
driven oscillator or
resonance almost everywhere.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:32.650

enjoyed the lecture today.

And what we are
going to do next time

01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:39.710
is to put multiple objects
together so that you

01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:44.320
see the interaction between one
particle to the other particle

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.020
and see how we can actually make
sense of this kind of system.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.610
MEHRAN KARDAR: You
decide at first look

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.830
at the our simple system,
which was the ideal gas.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.250
And imagine that we
have this gas contained

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.630
in a box of volume V that
contains N particles.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.970
And it's completely isolated
from the rest of the universe.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.240
So you can know the amount
of energy that it has.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.770
So the macroscopic
description of the system

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.015
consists of these three
numbers, E, V, and N.

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:07.540
And this was the characteristics
of a microcanonical ensemble

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.600
in which there was no
exchange of heat or work.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.540
And therefore,
energy was conserved.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.710
And our task was somehow to
characterize the probability

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.370
to find the system
in some microstate.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.410
Now if you have N
particles in the system,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.180
there is at the microscopic
level, some microstate that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.520
consists of a description of
all of the positions of momenta.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.690
And there is
Hamiltonian that governs

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.850
how that microstate evolves
as a function of time.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.660
And for the case of ideal gas,
the particles don't interact.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.070
So the Hamiltonian can be
written as the sum of n terms

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.680
that describe essentially
the energy of the end

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.770
particle composed of
its kinetic energy.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.490
And the term that is really
just confining the particle

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.240
is in this box.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.990
And so the volume of
the box is contained.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.510
Let's say that in
this potential,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.050
that it's zero inside the
box and infinity outside.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.900
And we said, OK, so given that
I know what the energy, volume,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.910
number of particles
are, what's the chance

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.350
that I will find the system
in some particular microstate?

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.490
And the answer was
that, obviously, you

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.450
will have to put zero if the
particles are outside box.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.520
Or if the energy, which is
really just the kinetic energy,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.560
does not much the energy that
we know is in the system,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.030
we sum over i of P
i squared over 2m

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.071
is not equal to the
energy of the system.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.170
Otherwise, we say that if
the microstate corresponds

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.010
to exactly the right
amount of energy, then

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.710
I have no reason to exclude it.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.960
And just like saying
that the dice can

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.400
have six possible
faces, you would

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.650
assign all of those possible
phases equal probability.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.050
I will give all of
the microstates that

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.720
don't conflict
with the conditions

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.800
that I have set out
the same probability.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.400
I will call that
probability 1 over

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.530
some overall constant omega.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.140
And so this is one otherwise.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.590
So then the next
statement is well

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.980
what is this number omega
that you have put it?

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.960
And how do we determine it?

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.100
Well, we know that this
P is a probability so

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.640
that if I were to integrate
over the entirety of the face

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:25.480
space of this probability,
the answer should be 1.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.700
So that means this
omega, which is

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.250
a function of these parameters
that I set out from the outside

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.190
to describe the
microstate, should

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:53.660
be obtained by integrating over
all q and p of this collection

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.620
of 1s and 0s that
I have out here.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.330
So I think this box of
1s and 0s, put it here,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.060
and I integrate.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.940
So what do I get?

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.850
Well, the integration
over the q's is easy.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.890
The places that I get 1 are
when the q's are inside the box.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.280
So each one of them will
give me a factor of V.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.290
And there are N of them.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.490
So I would get V to the N.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.090
The integrations over
momenta essentially

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.960
have to do with seeing whether
or not the condition sum

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.730
over i Pi squared over 2m
equals to E is satisfied or not.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.232
So this I can write
also as sum over i

00:05:46.232 --> 00:05:55.180
P i squared equals to 2mE,
which I can write as R squared.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.690
And essentially, in
this momentum space,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.200
I have to make sure that the
sum of the components of all

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.320
of the momenta squared
add up to this R. squared,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.950
which as we discussed
last time, is

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:29.620
the surface of hypershpere
in 3N dimensions of radius

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.370
R, which is square root of 2mE.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.350
So I have to integrate
over all of these momenta.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.820
And most of the
time I will get 0,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.850
except when I heat the
surface of this sphere.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.500
There's kind of a little
bit of singularity

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.010
here because you have a
probability that there's 0,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.960
except at the very sharp
interval, and then 0 again.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.660
So it's kind of like a delta
function, which is maybe

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.930
a little bit hard to deal with.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.860
So sometimes we
will generalize this

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.900
by adding a little
bit be delta E here.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.130
So let's say that the energy
does not have to be exactly E,

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.970
but E minus plus
a little bit, so

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.850
that when we look at
this surface in three

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.520
n dimensional space--
let's say this was two

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.220
dimensional space--
rather than having

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.940
to deal with an
exact boundary, we

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:42.720
have kind of smoothed that
out into an interval that

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.340
has some kind of a thickness
R, that presumably is related

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.690
to this delta E
that I put up there.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.860
Turns out it doesn't
really make any difference.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.970
The reason it doesn't
make any difference I

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.960
will tell you shortly.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.750
But now when I'm integrating
over all of these

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.360
P's-- so there's P. There's
another P. This could be P1.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.650
This could be P2.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.730
And there are
different components.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:13.530
I then get 0, except
when I hit this interval

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.150
around the surface
of this hypersphere.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:22.280
So what do I get as a result
of the integration over this 3N

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.110
dimensional space?

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:29.250
I will get the volume
of this element, which

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.950
is composed of the
surface area, which

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.380
has some kind of a solid
angle in 3N dimensions.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.429
The radius raised to
the power of dimension

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:45.330
minus 1, because it's a surface.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.620
And then if I want to
really include a delta R

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.960
to make it into a volume, this
would be the appropriate volume

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.640
of this interval
in momentum space.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.395
Yes.

00:08:59.395 --> 00:09:01.135
AUDIENCE: Just to
clarify, you're

00:09:01.135 --> 00:09:02.910
asserting that
there's no potential

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.782
inside the [INAUDIBLE] that
comes from the hard walls.

00:09:05.782 --> 00:09:06.740
MEHRAN KARDAR: Correct.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.490
We can elaborate
on that later on.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.710
But for the description of the
ideal gas without potential,

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.300
like in the box, I have
said that potential

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.610
to be just 0 infinity.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.110
OK?

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.350
OK, so fine.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.080
So this is the description.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.620
There was one
thing that I needed

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:41.550
to tell you, which is the d,
dimension, of solid angle,

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:47.020
which is 2pi to the
d over 2 divided

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.100
by d over 2 minus 1
factorial So again,

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.330
in two dimensions, such as the
picture that I drew over here,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.210
the circumference of a
circle would be 2 pi r.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.065
So this s sub 2--
right there'd be 2 pi--

00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:06.380
and you can show that
it is 2 pi divided

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.490
by 0 factorial, which is 1.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.850
In three dimensions it should
give you 4 pi r squared.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.340
Kind of looks
strange because you

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.090
get 2 pi to the 3/2 divided
by 1/2 half factorial.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.530
But the 1/2 factorial
is in fact root 2

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.670
over pi-- root pi over 2.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.670
And so this will work out fine.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.840
Again, the definition of
this factorial in general

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.280
is through the gamma
function and an integral

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.270
that we saw already.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:43.910
And factorial is the integral
0 to infinity, dx, x to the n

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.680
into the minus x.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.990
Now, the thing is that
this is a quantity that

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:55.990
for large values of dimension
grows exponentially v E d.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:00.750
So what I claim is that if I
take the log of this surface

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:06.610
area and take the limit that
d is much larger than 1,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.280
the quantity that I
will get-- well, let's

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.340
take the log of this.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.390
I will get log of 2.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:23.840
I will get d over 2 log
pi and minus the log

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.680
of this large factorial.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.650
And the log of the factorial
I will use Sterling's formula.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.870
I will ignore in
that large limit

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.920
the difference between d
over 2 and d over 2 minus 1.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.530
Or actually I guess
at the beginning

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:46.380
I may even write it d over 2
minus 1 log of d over 2 minus 1

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.337
plus d over 2 minus 1.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.340
Now if I'm in this
limit of large d again,

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.210
I can ignore the 1s.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:06.020
And I can ignore the log 2
with respect to this d over 2.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.070
And so the answer in this
limit is in fact proportional

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.950
to d over 2.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.390
And I have the log.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.550
I have pi.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.290
I have this d over 2 that
will carry in the denominator.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:26.460
And then this d over 2 times 1
I can write as d over 2 log e.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.520
And so this is
the answer we get.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:38.590
So you can see that the
answer is exponentially large

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.530
if I were to again write s of d.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.500
S of d grows like
an exponential in d.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.930
OK, so what do I
conclude from that?

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:59.740
I conclude that s over Kd--
and we said that the entropy,

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:05.080
we can regard as the entropy of
this probability distribution.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.065
So that's going to give
me the log of this omega.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:16.460
And log off this omega,
we'll get a factor

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.970
from this v to the n.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:24.190
So I will get N
log V. I will get

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:30.130
a factor from log of S of 3N.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:35.260
I figured out what that
log was in the limit

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.110
of large dimensions.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:46.340
So I essentially have 3N over 2
because my d is now roughly 3N.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.980
It's in fact exactly 3N, sorry.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.645
I have the log of 2 pi e.

00:13:53.645 --> 00:13:56.900
For d I have 3N.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.940
And then I actually
have also from here

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:09.600
a 3N log R, which I can write
as 3N over 2 log of R squared.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.506
And my R squared is 2mE.

00:14:13.506 --> 00:14:14.464
The figure I have here.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:24.950
And then you say, OK,
we added this delta R.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.250
But now you can
see that I can also

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:33.230
ignore this delta R, because
everything else that I have

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:37.240
in this expression is
something that grows radially

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:43.400
with N. What's the worse
that I can do for delta R?

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:49.910
I could make delta R even as big
as the entirety of this volume.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.680
And then the
typical volume would

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.530
be of the order of the energy--
sorry, the typical value of R

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.220
would be like the
square root of energy.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.310
So here I would
have to put this log

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.680
of the square root
of the energy.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.495
And log of a square roots
of an extensive quantity

00:15:07.495 --> 00:15:10.400
is much less than the
extensive quantity.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.470
I can ignore it.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.870
And actually this reminds me,
that some 35 years ago when

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.680
I was taking this course,
from Professor Felix Villiers,

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.370
he said that he
had gone to lunch.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:30.515
And he had gotten to this
very beautiful, large orange.

00:15:30.515 --> 00:15:32.780
And he was excited.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.700
And he opened up the
orange, and it was all skin.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.500
And there was just a
little bit in the middle.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.560
He was saying it is like this.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.370
It's all in the surface.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:48.560
So if Professor Villiers had
an orange in 3N dimension,

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.040
he would have exponentially
hard time extracting an orange.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:16:00.880
So this is our formula for
the entropy of this gas.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.110
Essentially the
extensive parts, n log v

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.590
and something that
depends on n log E.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:10.100
And that's really all
we need to figure out

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.950
all of the thermodynamic
properties,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:18.540
because we said that
we can construct--

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:25.710
that's in thermodynamics--
dE is TdS minus PdV plus YdN

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.440
in the case of a gas.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.950
And so we can
rearrange that to dS

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:43.410
be dE over T plus P over
T dV minus Y over T dN.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.630
And the first thing
that we see is

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.090
by taking the derivative of S
with respect to the quantities

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.010
that we have
established, E, V, and N,

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:57.780
we should be able to read
off appropriate quantities.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.040
And in particular,
let's say 1 over T

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:06.819
would be dS by dE
of constant v and n.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:10.480
S will be proportional to kB.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.829
And then they dependents
of this object on E

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:19.599
only appears on
this log E. Except

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:23.210
that there's a factor
of 3N over 2 out front.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:30.110
And the derivative of log E
with respect to E is 1 over E.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.820
So I can certainly
immediately rearrange

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.720
this and to get that
the energy is 3/2 N k

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:46.160
T in this system of ideal point
particles in three dimensions.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.067
And then the
pressure, P over T, is

00:17:51.067 --> 00:17:54.380
the S by dV at constant e and n.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.520
And it's again, kB.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.850
The only dependence on V
is through this N log V.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:06.365
So I will get a factor of N over
V, which I can rearrange to PV

00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:12.150
is N kB T by the ideal gas law.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.530
And in principle,
the next step would

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.670
be to calculate the
chemical potential.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.800
But we will leave that
for the time being

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.830
for reasons that
will become apparent.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:46.480
Now, one thing to note is that
what you have postulated here,

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.640
right at the beginning, is
much, much, more information

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.390
than what we extracted here
about thermodynamic properties.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.760
It's a statement about a
joint probability distribution

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.160
in this six N
dimensional face space.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.210
So it has huge amount
of information.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.290
Just to show you part
of it, let's take

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.670
a note at the following.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.820
What it is a probability
as a function of all

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.540
coordinates and momenta
across your system.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.470
But let me ask a
specific question.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:31.420
I can ask what's the probability
that some particular particle--

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.160
say particle number
one-- has a momentum P1.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.990
It's the only
question that I care

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:42.460
to ask about this huge
amount of degrees of freedom

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.090
that are encoded in P of mu.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.070
And so what do I do if I
don't really care about all

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.690
of the other degrees of freedom
is I will integrate them.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:57.810
So I don't really care where
particle number one is located.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.470
I didn't ask where
it is in the box.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:05.750
I don't really care where part
because numbers two through N

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.680
are located or which
momenta they have.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.410
So I integrate over
all of those things

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:17.200
of the full joint
probability, which

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.161
depends on the entirety
of the face space.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.140
Fine, you say, OK.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.450
This joint probability actually
has a very simple form.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:35.670
It is 1 over this
omega E, V, and N,

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.990
multiplying either 1 or 0.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:45.210
So I have to integrate
over all of these q1's, all

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.020
of these qi P i.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:56.420
Of 1 over omega or 0
over omega, this delta

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.890
like function that
we put in a box

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.070
up there-- so this is
this delta function that

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.850
says that the particular
should be inside the box.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.690
And the sum of
the momenta should

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.900
be on the surface
of this hypershpere.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.390
Now, let's do
these integrations.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.555
Let's do it here.

00:21:19.555 --> 00:21:22.020
I may need space.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.830
The integration over
Q1 is very simple.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.490
It will give me a factor of V.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.505
I have this omega E, V,
N, in the denominator.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:41.340
And I claim that the numerator
is simply the following.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:50.550
Omega E minus P1 squared
over 2m V N minus 1.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.250
Why?

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:59.230
Because what I need to do over
here in terms of integrations

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.320
is pretty much what I would
have to integrate over here

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.040
that gave rise to that surface
and all of those factors

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.900
with one exception.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.540
First of all, I integrated
over one particle already,

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.520
so the coordinate momenta here
that I'm integrating pertains

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.280
to the remaining N minus 1.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.470
Hence, the omega
pertains to N minus 1.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.900
It's still in the
same box of volume V.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.250
So V, the other
argument, is the same.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.530
But the energy is changed.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:34.030
Why?

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.430
Because I told you
how much momentum

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.460
I want the first
particle to carry.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.520
So given the knowledge
that I'm looking

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.030
at the probability of the first
particle having momentum P1,

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.810
then I know that the
remainder of the energy

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:54.570
should be shared among the
momenta of all the remaining

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.650
N minus 1 particles.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:03.580
So I have already calculated
these omegas up here.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.710
All I need to do is to
substitute them over here.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.500
And I will get this probability.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:16.000
So first of all, let's check
that the volume part cancels.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.090
I have one factor a volume here.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:23.540
Each of my omegas is in fact
proportional to V to the N.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.080
So the denominator
has V to the N.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.060
The numerator has a
V to the N minus 1.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.930
And all of the V's
would cancel out.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:39.900
So the interesting thing really
comes from these solid angle

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.720
and radius parts.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.240
The solid angle is a ratio of--
let's write the denominator.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.300
It's easier.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:54.130
It is 2 pi to the 3N over
2 divided by 3N over 2

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.200
minus one factorial.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.670
The numerator would be 2
pi to the 3 N and minus 1

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:09.745
over 2 divided by 3 N minus
1 over 2 minus 1 factorial.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.620
And then I have these
ratio of the radii.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:34.980
In the denominator I have 2mE to
the power of 3 N minus 1 over 2

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.130
minus 1.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:48.770
So minus 3N-- it is
3N minus 1 over 2.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.010
Same thing that we have
been calculating so far.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:59.490
And in the numerator it is 2m
E minus P1 squared over 2m.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:05.350
So I will factor out the E.
I have 1 minus P1 squared

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.380
over 2m E. The whole
thing raised to something

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:14.338
that is 3 N minus
1 minus 1 over 2.

00:25:25.954 --> 00:25:31.300
Now, the most
important part of this

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:39.360
is the fact that the dependence
on P1 appears as follows.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:45.320
I have this factor of 1
minus P1 squared over 2m E.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.400
That's the one place
that P1, the momentum

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.760
of the particle that
I'm interested appears.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.280
And it raised to
the huge problem,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.080
which is of the
order of 3N over 2.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.160
It is likely less.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.290
But it really doesn't
make any difference

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:06.050
whether I write 3N over 2, 3N
over minus 1 over 2, et cetera.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.720
Really, ultimately,
what I will have

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.260
is 1 minus the very small
number, because presumably

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.920
the energy of one
part they can is

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.030
less than the energy of the
entirety of the particle.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.670
So this is something that is
order of 1 out of N raised

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.420
to something that is
order of N. So that's

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.520
where an exponentiation
will come into play.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.680
And then there's a whole
bunch of other factors

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.320
that if I don't make any
mistake I can try to write down.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.300
There is the 2s
certainly cancel when

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.480
I look at the factors of pi.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.670
The denominator with
respect to the numerator

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.780
has an additional
factor of pi to the 3/2.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.430
In fact, I will
have a whole bunch

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.840
of things that are raised
to the powers of 3/2.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.980
I also have this
2mE that compared

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.420
to the 2mE that
comes out front has

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.940
an additional factor of 3/2.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.220
So let's put all
of them together.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.760
2 pi mE raised to
the power of 3/2.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.230
And then I have the ratio
of these factorials.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:22.350
And again, the factorial that
I have in the denominator

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:27.940
has one and a half times
more or 3/2 times more

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.420
than what is in the numerator.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.480
Roughly it is something
like the ratio

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.390
of 3 N over 2
factorial divided by 3

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.065
N minus 1 over 2 factorial.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.390
And I claim that, say,
N factorial compared

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:55.430
to N minus 1 factorial is
larger by a factor of N.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:59.990
If I go between N factorial
N minus 2 factorial is

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.960
a factor that is
roughly N squared.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.810
Now this does not shift either
by 1 or by 2, but by 1 and 1/2.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.250
And if you go through
Sterling formula, et cetera,

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.650
you can convince yourself that
this is roughly 3 N over 2

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.335
to the power of 1 and 1/2-- 3/2.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:28.180
And so once you do all of your
arrangements, what do you get?

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.210
1 minus a small quantity
raised to a huge power,

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.580
that's the definition
of the exponential.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:41.650
So I get exponential of
minus P1 squared over 2m.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:46.060
And the factor that
multiplies it is E.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.260
And then I have 3N over 2.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:02.160
And again, if I have
not made any mistake

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.890
and I'm careful with all of
the other factors that remain,

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:12.340
I have here 2 pi m
E. And this E also

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:17.040
gets multiplied by the
inverse of 3N over 2.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.890
So I will have this
replaced by 2E over 3N.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:34.650
So statement number
one, this assignment

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.500
of probabilities according
to just throwing the dice

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.970
and saying that everything
that has the same right energy

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:45.080
is equally likely is
equivalent to looking

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.680
at one of the
particles and stating

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.455
that the momentum of that part
again is Gaussian distributed.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:30:00.200
Secondly, you can check that
this combination, 2E divided

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.330
by 3N is the same thing as kT.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.360
So essentially
this you could also

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.030
if you want to
replace 1 over kT.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.120
And you would get the
more familiar kind

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.370
of Maxwell type of
distribution for the momentum

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.320
of a single particle
in an ideal gas.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.540
And again, since
everything that we did

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.760
was consistent with the
laws of probability,

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.200
if we did not mix up the
orders of N, et cetera,

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.860
the answer should be
properly normalized.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:38.520
And indeed, you can check that
this is the three dimensional

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.490
normalization that you
would require for this gas.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:49.790
So the statement of saying
that everything is allowed

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:56.220
is equally likely is a
huge statement in space

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.390
of possible configurations.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.980
On the one hand, it gives
you macroscopic information.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.580
On the other hand, it
retains a huge amount

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.640
of microscopic information.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.340
The parts of it
that are relevant,

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.257
you can try to
extract this here.

00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:13.860
OK?

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.820
So those were the successes.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.470
Question is why didn't
I calculate for you

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.840
this u over T?

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.300
It is because this
expression as we wrote down

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.450
has a glaring problem
with it, which in order

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:43.870
to make it explicit, we will
look at mixing entropies.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.580
So the idea is
this is as follows.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.585
Let's imagine that we
start with two gases.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:11.080
Initially, I have N1 particles
of one type in volume 1.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:16.640
And I have N2 particles of
another type in volume 2.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.600
And for simplicity I will
assume that both of them

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.430
are of the same temperature.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:27.590
So this is my initial state.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.720
And then I remove the partition.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.770
And I come up with
this situation

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:38.950
where the particles are mixed.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:44.070
So the particles of type
1 could be either way.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:48.100
Particles of type 2
could be in either place.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:55.715
And let's say I have a box
of some toxic gas here.

00:32:55.715 --> 00:32:57.510
And I remove the lid.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.080
And it will get
mixed in the room.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.740
It's certainly an
irreversible situation

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.075
where is an increase of
entropy i associated with that.

00:33:07.075 --> 00:33:10.310
And we can calculate
that increase of entropy,

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.400
because we know what the
expression for entropy is.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.060
So what we have to do is to
compare the entropy initially.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.315
So this is the initial entropy.

00:33:23.315 --> 00:33:26.430
And I calculate
everything in units of kB

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:30.610
so I don't have to write
kB all over the place.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.940
For particle number
one, what do I have?

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.030
I have N1 log V1.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:50.100
And then I have a contribution,
which is 3 N 1 over 2.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.970
But I notice that whatever
appears here is really

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:59.690
only a function of
E over N. E over N

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.970
is really only a
function of temperature.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:11.840
So this is something that I can
call a sigma of T over here.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:21.139
And the contribution of box 2
is N2 log V plus 3N 2 over 2.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:28.179
This-- huh-- let's
say that they are--

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.000
we ignore the
difference in masses.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.840
You could potentially have
here sigma 1, sigma 2.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.330
It really doesn't
make any difference.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:45.780
The final state,
what do we have?

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:50.179
Essentially, the one
thing that changed

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:53.770
is that the N1 particles now
are occupying the box of volume

00:34:53.770 --> 00:35:00.420
V. So if call V to the
V1 plus V2, what we have

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:10.620
is that we have N1 log
of V plus N2 log of V.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:15.240
My claim is that all
of these other factors

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.500
really stay the same.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:28.150
Because essentially what is
happening in these expressions

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:35.900
are various ratios of E over N.
And by stating that initially I

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.480
had the things at
the same temperature,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:44.850
what I had effectively
stated was that E1 over N1

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.430
is the same thing as E2 over N2.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:51.640
I guess in the ideal
gas case this E over N

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.350
is the same thing as 3/2 kT.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:07.180
But if I have a
ratio such as this,

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:14.330
that is also the same as E1
plus E2 divided by N1 plus N2.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:19.090
This is a simple manipulation
of fractions that I can make.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:26.510
And E1 plus E2 over N1 plus N2,
by the same kinds of arguments,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.220
would give me the
final temperature.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:35.060
So what I have to compute is
that the final temperature

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.210
is the same thing as
the initial temperature.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.320
Essentially, in this
mixing of the ideal gases,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.880
temperature does not change.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:48.870
So basically, these
factors of sigma

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.630
are the same before and after.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:56.630
And so when we calculate
the increase in entropy, Sf

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.690
minus Si, really
the contribution

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:05.720
that you care about comes
from these volume factors.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:10.620
And really the statement is
that in one particle currently

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.190
are occupying a
volume of size V,

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:15.990
whereas previously
they were in V1.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.760
And similarly for
the N2 particles.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:26.550
And if you have more of these
particles, more of these boxes,

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.980
you could see how the
general expression

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.550
for the mixing entropy goes.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.930
And so that's fine.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.110
V is certainly
greater than V1 or V2.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.940
Each of these logs gives
you a positive contribution.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.045
There's an increase in
entropy as we expect.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.430
Now, there is the following
difficulty however.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:04.050
What if the gases are
identical-- are the same?

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.930
We definitely have to do this
if I take a box of methane here

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:18.615
and I open it, we all know
that something has happened.

00:38:18.615 --> 00:38:21.920
There is an irreversible
process that has occured.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.020
But if the box--
I have essentially

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.310
taken the air in this
room, put it in this box,

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:30.632
whether I open the lid
or not open the lid,

00:38:30.632 --> 00:38:32.710
it doesn't make any difference.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.250
There is no
additional work that I

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.300
have to do in order to
close or open the lid.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.430
Is no there no increase of
entropy one way or the other.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.450
Whereas if I look
at this expression,

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.530
this expression only
depends on the final volume

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:50.860
and the initial
volumes, and says

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.690
that there should an
increase in entropy

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:57.650
when we know that
there shouldn't be.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:02.500
And of course, the
resolution for that

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.780
is something like this.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:15.280
That if I look at my two boxes--
and I said maybe one of them

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.420
is a box that contains methane.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.000
Let's call it A.
And the other is

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.820
the room that contains the air.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.480
Now this situation
where all of the methane

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.750
is in the box and the oxygen
freely floating in the room

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.820
is certainly different
from a configuration

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:44.140
where I exchange these two
and the methane is here

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.148
and the oxygen
went into the box.

00:39:48.148 --> 00:39:50.340
They're different
configurations.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:54.320
You can definitely
tell them apart.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:01.570
Whereas if I do the same
thing, but the box and outside

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:11.710
contain the same entity, and
the same entity is, let's say,

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:16.520
oxygen, then how can you tell
apart these two configurations?

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.740
And so the meaning of-- yes.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.192
AUDIENCE: Are you
thinking quantum

00:40:21.192 --> 00:40:22.644
mechanically or classically.

00:40:22.644 --> 00:40:25.064
Classically we can
tell them apart, right?

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.820
MEHRAN KARDAR:
This is currently I

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.810
am making a
macroscopic statement.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:36.410
Now when I get to the
distinction of microstates

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.590
we have to-- so I was
very careful in saying

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.210
whether or not you
could tell apart

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.970
whether it is methane or oxygen.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.960
So this was a very
macroscopic statement as to

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.570
whether or not you
can distinguish

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:53.660
this circumstance versus
that circumstance.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.090
So as far as our senses of
this macroscopic process

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:02.940
is concerned, these two cases
have to be treated differently.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:08.560
Now, what we have calculated
here for these factors

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.130
are some volume of phase space.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.190
And where in the
evening you might

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.790
say that following
this procedure

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:23.690
you counted these as
two distinct cases.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:26.730
In this case, these
were two distinct cases.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.050
But here, you can't
really tell them apart.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:31.990
So if you can't
tell them apart, you

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.580
shouldn't call them
two distinct cases.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.950
You have over counted phase
space by a factor of two here.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.620
And here, I just looked
at two particles.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.080
If I have N
particles, I have over

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.980
counted the phase space
of identical particles

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.110
by all possible permutations of
n objects, it is n factorial.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:42:03.680
So there is an over
counting of phase space

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:19.020
or configurations of
N identical particles

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:24.300
by a factor of N factorial.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:38.390
I.e., when we said that particle
number one can be anywhere

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:42.060
in the box, particle
number two can be anywhere

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:46.250
in the box, all the way
to particle number n,

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:50.370
well, in fact, I can't
tell which each is which.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:53.060
If I can't tell which
particle is which,

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.195
I have to divide by the number
of permutations and factors.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.105
Now, as somebody was
asking the question,

00:43:02.105 --> 00:43:06.950
as you were asking the
question, classically,

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:11.240
if I write a
computer program that

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.620
looks at the trajectories
of N particles

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:18.780
in the gas in this room,
classically, your computer

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.670
would always know the particle
that started over here

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.430
after many collisions
or whatever

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:28.960
is the particle that
ended up somewhere else.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.010
So if you ask the
computer, the computer

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:37.600
can certainly distinguish
these classical trajectories.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.180
And then it is kind of
strange to say that, well, I

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.860
have to divide by N factorial
because all of these

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:45.760
are identical.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.950
Again, classically
these particles

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:51.070
are following
specific trajectories.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:54.170
And you know where in
phase space they are.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:58.530
Whereas quantum mechanically,
you can't tell that apart.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:02.670
So quantum mechanically, as
we will describe later, rather

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:04.820
than classical statistical
mechanics-- when

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.880
we do quantum statistical
mechanics-- if you have

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.580
identical particles,
you have to write down

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.820
of a wave function that
is either symmetric or

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.960
anti-symmetric under the
exchange of particles.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.500
And when we do eventually
the calculations

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:23.070
for these factors of
1 over N factorial

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.070
will emerge very naturally.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:31.070
So I think different people
have different perspectives.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:34.540
My own perspective is
that this factor really

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:39.130
is due to the quantum
origin of identity.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:42.290
And classically, you have to
sort of fudge it and put it

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:43.670
over there.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:46.710
But some people say that really
it's a matter of measurements.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:50.090
And if you can't really tell
A and B sufficiently apart,

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.800
then you don't know.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.890
I always go back
to the computer.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.260
And say, well, the
computer can tell.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.990
But it's kind of
immaterial at this stage.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:03.390
It's obvious that for all
practical purposes for things

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:08.040
that are identical you have
to divide by this factor.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.210
So what happens if you
divide by that factor?

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:17.180
So I have changed all
of my calculations now.

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:24.040
So when I do the log of--
previously I had V to the N.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:29.300
And it gave me N log
V. Now, I have log of V

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.550
to the N divided by N factorial.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:36.780
So I will get my Sterling's
approximation additional factor

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:42.300
of minus N log N plus N, which
I can sort of absorb here

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.110
in this fashion.

00:45:48.825 --> 00:45:53.450
Now you say, well, having
done that, you have to first

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:57.610
of all show me that you
fixed the case of this change

00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:00.960
in entropy for
identical particles,

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.380
but also you should show me
that the previous case where

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.570
we know there has to be an
increase in entropy just

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:12.640
because of the gas being
different that that is not

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.530
changed because of this
modification that you make.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:17.280
So let's check that.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:25.490
So for distinct gases, what
would be the generalization

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:29.648
of this form Sf minus
Si divided by kV?

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:38.820
Well, what happens here?

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:51.000
In the case of the final object,
I have to divide N1 log of V.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:58.640
But that V really becomes
V divided by N1, because

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.920
in the volume of size
V, I have N1 oxygen

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.630
that I can't tell apart.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:08.630
So I divide by the N1
factorial for the oxygens.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:13.020
And then I have N2 methanes
that I can't tell apart

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:18.560
in that volume, so I divide by
essentially N2 factorial that

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.840
goes over there.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:30.450
The initial change is over
here I would have N1 log of V1

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:32.440
over N1.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:41.980
And here I would have
had N2 log of V2 over N2.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.100
So every one of these
expressions that was previously

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:51.870
log V, and I had four
of them, gets changed.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:57.150
But they get change precisely in
a manner that this N1 log of N1

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:00.530
here cancels this N1
log of and N1 here.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:05.140
This N2 log of N2 here cancels
this N2 log of N2 here.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.320
So the delta S that I get
is precisely the same thing

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.960
as I had before.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:18.230
I will get N1 log of V over
V1 plus N2 log of V over V2.

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:27.240
So this division,
because the oxygens were

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.370
identical to
themselves and methanes

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.670
were identical to
themselves, does not

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:37.110
change the mixing entropy
of oxygen and nitrogen.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.520
But let's say that both
gases are the same.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.380
They're both oxygen.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.130
Then what happens?

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:55.500
Now, in the final
state, I have a box.

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:59.110
It has a N1 plus N2 particles
that are all oxygen.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:01.370
I can't tell them apart.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:07.140
So the contribution
from the phase space

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:14.450
would be N1 plus N2 log of the
volume divided by N1 plus N2

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:15.240
factorial.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.460
That ultimately will give me
a factor of N1 plus N2 here.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.800
The initial entropy
is exactly the one

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.706
that I calculated before.

00:49:26.706 --> 00:49:32.040
For the line above,
I have N1 log of V1

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:37.157
over N1 minus N2
log of V2 over N2.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.840
Now certainly, I still expect
to see some mixing entropy

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:53.870
if I have a box of oxygen
that is at very low pressure

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.340
and is very dilute,
and I open it

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.185
into this room, which is
at much higher pressure

00:49:59.185 --> 00:50:01.600
and is much more dense.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.520
So really, the
case where I don't

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.210
expect to see any
change in entropy

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:09.505
is when the two boxes
have the same density.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.860
And hence, when I mix
them, I would also

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.255
have exactly the same density.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:26.090
And you can see that, therefore,
all of these factors that

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:30.370
are in the log are of the
inverse of the same density.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:33.320
And there's N1 plus N2
of them that's positive.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.100
And N1 plus N2 of
them that is negative.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.830
So the answer in
this case, as long

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:44.020
as I try to mix identical
particles of the same density,

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.340
if I include this
correction to the phase

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.586
space of identical
particles, the answer

00:50:48.586 --> 00:50:54.438
will be [? 0. ?] Yes?

00:50:54.438 --> 00:50:58.422
AUDIENCE: Question,
[INAUDIBLE] in terms

00:50:58.422 --> 00:51:04.398
of the revolution
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:04.398 --> 00:51:09.400
there is no
transition [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:13.388
so that your temporary, and say
like, oxygen and nitrogen can

00:51:13.388 --> 00:51:15.778
catch a molecule, put it
in a [? aspertometer. ?]

00:51:15.778 --> 00:51:18.168
and have different isotopes.

00:51:18.168 --> 00:51:20.668
You can take like closed
isotopes of oxygen

00:51:20.668 --> 00:51:22.604
and still tell them apart.

00:51:22.604 --> 00:51:25.992
But this is like
their continuous way

00:51:25.992 --> 00:51:28.684
of choosing a pair
of gases which

00:51:28.684 --> 00:51:31.980
would be arbitrarily
closed in atomic mass.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.500
MEHRAN KARDAR: So,
as I said, there

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:38.030
are alternative explanations
that I've heard.

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.530
And that's precisely
one of them.

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:44.620
And my counter is that
what we are putting here

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.670
is the volume of phase space.

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:52.180
And to me that has a
very specific meaning.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:55.120
That is there's a set of
coordinates and momenta

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.960
that are moving according
to Hamiltonian trajectories.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:03.690
And in principle, there
is a computer nature

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:06.060
that is following
these trajectories,

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.800
or I can actually put
them on the computer.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.920
And then no matter
how long I run

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.980
and they're identical
oxygen molecules,

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.010
I start with number one
here, numbers two here.

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:21.420
The computer will say that this
is the trajectory of number one

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.760
and this is the
trajectory of numbers two.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.030
So unless I change my
definition of phase space

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:32.710
and how I am calculating
things, I run into this paradox.

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:36.050
So what you're saying
is forget about that.

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:39.720
It's just can tell isotopes
apart or something like that.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.140
And I'm saying that that's fine.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.480
That's perspective,
but it has nothing

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.091
to do with phase space counting.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:51.800
OK?

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.100
Fine, now, why didn't
I calculate this?

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:02.220
It was also for the
same reason, because we

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:07.460
expect to have quantities
that are extensive

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.362
and quantities
that are intensive.

00:53:11.362 --> 00:53:13.950
And therefore, if I
were to, for example,

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:16.630
calculate this object,
that it should be something

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:18.672
that is intensive.

00:53:18.672 --> 00:53:22.420
Now the problem is that if I
take a derivative with respect

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:26.470
N, I have log V.
And log V is clearly

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:30.590
something that does not
grow proportionately to size

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:33.890
but grows proportionately
to size logarithmically.

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:36.640
So if I make volume
twice as big,

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:40.590
I will get an additional factor
of log 2 here contribution

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:42.470
to the chemical potential.

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:45.500
And that does not make sense.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:52.520
But when I do this identity,
then this V becomes V over N.

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:56.270
And then everything
becomes nicely intensive.

00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:02.520
So if I allowed now to
replace this V over N,

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:14.774
then I can calculate V over T
as dS by dN at constant E and V.

00:54:14.774 --> 00:54:17.470
And so then
essentially I will get

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:22.880
to drop the factor of log N that
comes in front, so I will get

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:28.840
kT log of V over
N. And then I would

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:40.060
have 3/2 log of something, which
I can put together as 4 pi N

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:45.030
E over 3N raised
to the 3/2 power.

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:53.980
And you can see that
there were these E's

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:57.500
from Sterling's
approximation up there that

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:01.265
got dropped here, because
you can also take derivative

00:55:01.265 --> 00:55:04.260
with respect to the
N's that are inside.

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:07.310
And you can check that the
function of derivatives

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:09.320
with respects to the
N's that are inside

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.415
is precisely to get
rid of those factors.

00:55:15.841 --> 00:55:16.340
OK?

00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:26.610
Now, there is still
one other thing

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:30.950
that is not wrong, but
kind of like jarring

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:32.430
about the expressions
that they've

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:39.280
had so far in that right
from the beginning,

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.510
I said that you can certainly
calculate entropies out

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:49.710
of probabilities as minus
log of P average if you like.

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:51.610
But it makes sense
only if you're

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:55.170
dealing with discrete
variables, because when you're

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:57.220
dealing with continual
variables and you

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.870
have a probability density.

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:01.590
And the probability
density depends

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:03.490
on the units of measurement.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.240
And if you were to change
measurement from meters

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.580
to centimeters or
something else,

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:13.460
then there will be changes
in the probability densities,

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:17.750
which would then modify the
various factors over here.

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.080
And that's really also
is reflected ultimately

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.720
in the fact that these
combinations of terms

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:28.890
that I have written
here have dimensions.

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:32.250
And it is kind
of, again, jarring

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:36.450
to have expressions inside the
logarithm or in the exponential

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:39.550
that our not dimensionless.

00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:43.480
So it would be good
if we had some way

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.500
of making all of
these dimensionless.

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.570
And you say, well,
really the origin of it

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:53.430
is all the way back
here, when I was

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:56.050
calculating volumes
in phase space.

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.060
And volumes in phase
space have dimensions.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:03.560
And that dimensions of
pq raised to the 3N power

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.240
really survives all
the way down here.

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:12.150
So I can say, OK, I
choose some quantity

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:15.775
as a reference that has the
right dimensions of the product

00:57:15.775 --> 00:57:18.690
of p and q, which is an action.

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:22.790
And I divide all
of my measurements

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:28.140
by that reference unit, so
that, for example, here I

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:32.130
have 3N factors of this.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:34.120
Or let's say each
one of them is 3.

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:39.720
I divide by some quantity
that has units of action .

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.680
And then I will be set.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:47.008
So basically, the units of this
h is the product of p and q.

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:56.050
Now, at this point
we have no way

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:59.330
of choosing some h as
opposed to another h.

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:04.070
And so by adding that factor,
we can make things look nicer.

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:08.610
But then things are undefined
after this factor of h.

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:11.150
When we do quantum
mechanics, another thing

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:14.640
that quantum mechanics
does is to provide us

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.670
with precisely [? age ?] of
Planck's constant as a measure

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:21.900
of these kinds of integrations.

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:25.390
So when we eventually
you go to calculate, say,

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:28.900
the ideal gas or any
other mechanic system

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:32.180
that involves p and q
in quantum mechanics,

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.400
then the phase space
becomes discretized.

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:39.030
You would have-- The
appropriate description

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:42.730
would have energies that are
discretized corresponding

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:46.650
to various other discretization
that are eventually

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:52.670
the equivalent to dividing
by this Planck's constant.

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:56.400
Ultimately, I will
have additionally

00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:01.600
a factor of h squared
appearing here.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:05.920
And it will make everything
nicely that much [? less. ?]

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:16.700
None of these other quantities
that I mentioned calculated

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:18.572
would be affected by this.

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:31.250
So essentially,
what I'm saying is

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:38.340
that you are going to
use a measure for phase

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:43.960
space of identical particles.

00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:59.270
Previously we had a product,
d cubed Pi, d cubed Qi.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:02.430
This is what we were
integrating and requiring

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:06.540
that this integration
will give us [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:11.950
Now, we will change this to
divide by this N factorial,

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:14.920
if the particles are identical.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:21.560
And we divide by h
to the 3N because

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.386
of the number of pairs of
pq that appear in this.

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:35.020
The justification to come when
we ultimately do quantum study.

01:00:40.597 --> 01:00:41.180
Any questions?

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:04.780
So I said that this
prescription when

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:08.480
we look at a system
at complete isolation,

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.360
and therefore, specify
fully its energy

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.300
is the microcanonical
ensemble, as opposed

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:27.440
to the canonical
ensemble, whereas the set

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.145
of microscopic parameters
that you identified

01:01:32.145 --> 01:01:39.400
with your system, you replace
the energy with temperature.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.630
So in general,
let's say there will

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:48.590
be some bunch of
displacements, x, that give you

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:51.490
the work content to the system.

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:54.550
Just like we fixed over there
the volume and the number

01:01:54.550 --> 01:02:00.420
of particles, let's say that
all of the work parameters,

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.130
such as x
microscopically, we will

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:06.130
fix in this canonical ensemble.

01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:09.040
So however, the
ensemble is one in which

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.640
the energy is not specified.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.550
And so how do I
imagine that I can

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:18.120
maintain a system
at temperature T?

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.740
Well, if this room is at
some particular temperature,

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:25.150
I assume that smaller objects
that I put in this room

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:27.480
will come to the
same temperature.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.260
So the general prescription
for beginning something other

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.860
than temperature T is
to put it in contact

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.550
with something that
is much bigger.

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:39.390
So let's call this
to be a reservoir.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:48.420
And we put our system, which
we assume to be smaller,

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.580
in contact with it.

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:53.810
And we allow it to exchange
heat with the reservoir.

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:04.600
Now I did this way of
managing the system

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.750
to come to a
temperature T, which

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.990
is the characteristic
of a big reservoir.

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:11.980
Imagine that you have a lake.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.390
And you put your gas or
something else inside the lake.

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:21.140
And it will equilibrate to
the temperature of the lake.

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:23.900
I will assume that
the two of them,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.610
the system and the
reservoir, just

01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:30.450
for the purpose of my being
able to do some computation,

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:33.230
are isolated from the
rest of the universe,

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:38.750
so that the system plus
reservoir is microcanonical.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:52.620
And the sum total of their
energies is sum E total.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:05.120
So now this system still
is something like a gas.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.970
It's a has a huge number of
potential degrees of freedom.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:12.270
And these potential number
of degrees of freedom

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:16.020
can be captured through the
microstate of the system,

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.660
u sub s.

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:21.390
And similarly, the water
particle in the lake

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:22.600
have their own state.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.330
An there's some
microstate that describes

01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:28.880
the positions and the momenta
of all of the particles

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.150
that are in the lake.

01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.940
Yes?

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.400
AUDIENCE: When you're writing
the set of particles used

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.750
to describe it, why
don't you write N?

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:39.874
Since it said the number
of particles in the system

01:04:39.874 --> 01:04:40.560
is not fixed.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.800
MEHRAN KARDAR: Yes, so I
did want to [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.660
but in principle I could add N.
I wanted to be kind of general.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.800
If you like X,
[? it ?] is allowed

01:04:51.800 --> 01:05:04.210
to include chemical
work type of an X.

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:09.020
So what do I know?

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:14.940
I know that there is also if
I want to describe microstates

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.260
and their revolution,
I need to specify

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:21.260
that there's a
Hamiltonian that governs

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.780
the evolution of
these microstates.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.930
And presumably
there's a Hamiltonian

01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:31.610
that describes the evolution
of the reservoir microstate.

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:35.910
And so presumably the
allowed microstates

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:40.180
are ones in which
E total is made up

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:44.090
of the energy of the system plus
the energy of the reservoir.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:06:04.300
So because the whole thing
is the microcanonical,

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.810
I can assign a probability,
a joint probability,

01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:15.070
to finding some particular
mu s, mu r combination,

01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:18.040
just like we were
doing over there.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.180
You would say that
essentially this

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:25.120
is a combination
of these 1s and 0s.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.940
So it is 0 if H of--
again, for simplicity I

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:38.030
drop the s on the
system-- H of mu s plus H

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:43.660
reservoir of mu reservoir
is not equal to E total.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:52.595
And it is 1 over some omega
of reservoir in the system

01:06:52.595 --> 01:06:53.095
otherwise.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:02.010
So this is just again,
throwing the dice,

01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:05.860
saying that it has so many
possible configurations, given

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.210
that I know what
the total energy is.

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:13.290
All the ones that are consistent
with that are allowed.

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:17.150
Which is to say, I don't
really care about the lake.

01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:21.720
All I care is about to
the states of my gas,

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.550
and say, OK, no problem, if
I have the joint probability

01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:27.950
distribution just
like I did over here,

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:29.980
I get rid of all of
the degrees of freedom

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.190
that I'm not interested in.

01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:37.370
So if I'm interested only
in the states of the system,

01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:41.680
I sum over or integrate
over-- so this would be a sum.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.200
This would be an
integration, whatever--

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.085
of the joint probability
distribution.

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:54.330
Now actually follow the
steps that I had over here

01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:58.040
when we were looking at the
momentum of a gas particle.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.940
I say that what
I have over here,

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:04.165
this probability see
is this 1 over omega R,

01:08:04.165 --> 01:08:09.110
S. This is a function
that is either 1 or 0.

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:13.660
And then I have so sum
over all configurations

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:16.120
of the reservoir.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:23.050
But given that I said what
the microstate of the system

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:30.735
is, then I know that the
reservoir has to take energy

01:08:30.735 --> 01:08:35.149
in total minus the amount
the microstates has taken.

01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:39.040
And I'm summing over all
of the microstates that

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.830
are consistent with
the requirement

01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:44.569
that the energy in
the reservoir is

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:48.050
E total minus H of microstate.

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:50.910
So what that is that
the omega that I

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:54.390
have for the reservoir--
and I don't know what it is,

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:59.010
but whatever it is,
evaluated at the total energy

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:03.250
minus the energy that is
taken outside the microstate.

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:07.390
So again, exactly the reason
why this became E minus Pi

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:08.670
squared over 2.

01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:14.000
This becomes E total
minus H of mu S. Except

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.640
that I don't know either
what this is or what this is.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.790
Actually, I don't really
even care about this

01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:26.695
because all of the H dependents
on microstate dependents

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:28.359
is in the numerator.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:31.890
So I write that as
proportional to exponential.

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:36.060
And the log of omega
is the entropy.

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:40.470
So I have the entropy of the
[INAUDIBLE] in units of kB,

01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:54.980
evaluated at the argument that
this E total minus H of mu S.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:57.370
So my statement is
that when I look

01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:02.030
at the entropy of the
reservoir as a function of E

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:06.650
total minus the energy
that is taken out

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:11.490
by the system, my
construction I assume

01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:16.440
that I'm putting a small
volume of gas in contact

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.150
with a huge lake.

01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:24.520
So this total energy is
overwhelmingly larger

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.230
than the amount of energy
that the system can occupy.

01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:32.530
So I can make a Taylor
expansion of this quantity

01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:39.920
and say that this is S R of E
total minus the derivative of S

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.290
with respect to its energy.

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:44.310
So the derivative
of the S reservoir

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:47.990
with respect to the energy
of the reservoir times

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:54.010
H of the microstate and
presumably higher order terms

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:55.090
that are negligible.

01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:02.090
Now the next thing that is
important about the reservoir

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.150
is you have this huge lake.

01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:07.850
Let's say it's exactly at some
temperature of 30 degrees.

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:11.030
And you take some small
amount of energy from it

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:12.610
to put in the system.

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:14.910
The temperature of the
lake should not change.

01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:17.590
So that's the definition
of the reservoir.

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:22.930
It's a system that is so big
that for the range of energies

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:26.420
that we are considering,
this S by dE

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:30.706
is 1 over the temperature that
characterizes the reservoir.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.070
So just like here,
but eventually

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:41.520
the answer that we
got was something

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.830
like the energy of the
particle divided by kT.

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:48.940
Once I exponentiate, I
find that the probability

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:54.370
to find the system in some
microstate is proportional to E

01:11:54.370 --> 01:12:01.250
to the minus of the energy of
that microstate divided by kT.

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:06.570
And of course, there's
a bunch of other things

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:11.206
that I have to eventually
put into a normalization that

01:12:11.206 --> 01:12:11.705
will cause.

01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:21.310
So in the canonical
prescription you sort of replace

01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:23.550
this throwing of
the dice and saying

01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:26.630
that everything is equivalent
to saying that well,

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:30.750
each microstates can have
some particular energy.

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:34.800
And the probabilities
are partitioned according

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.480
to the Boltzmann weights
of these energies.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.650
And clearly this quantity,
Z, the normalization

01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:48.630
is obtained by integrating
over the entire space

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.870
of microstates, or
summing over them

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:54.865
if they are discrete of this
factor of E to the minus beta

01:12:54.865 --> 01:13:01.370
H of mu S. And we'll use
this notation beta 1 over kT

01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:02.837
sometimes for simplicity.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:33.660
Now, the thing is that
thermodynamically, we

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:38.520
said that you can choose
any set of parameters,

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.070
as long as they are
independent, to describe

01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:45.510
the macroscopic equilibrium
state of the system.

01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:50.670
So what we did in the
microcanonical ensemble is

01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:54.330
we specified a number of
things, such as energy.

01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:56.805
And we derived the other
things, such as temperature.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.750
So here, in the
canonical ensemble,

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:07.349
we have stated what the
temperature of the system is.

01:14:07.349 --> 01:14:08.390
Well, then what happened?

01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:16.060
On one hand, maybe we have
to worry because energy

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.580
is constantly being
exchanged with the reservoir.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:25.770
And so the energy of the system
does not have a specific value.

01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:28.420
There's a probability for it.

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:36.740
So probability of
system having energy

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:44.940
epsilon-- it doesn't
have a fixed energy.

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.770
There is a probability
that it should have energy.

01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:49.850
And this probability,
let's say we indicate

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:55.610
with P epsilon given that
we know what temperature is.

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:58.920
Well, on one hand we
have this factor of E

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.980
to the minus epsilon over kT.

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:03.560
That comes from the [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:10.660
But there isn't a single
state that has that energy.

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:14.340
There's a whole
bunch of other states

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:18.770
of the system that
have that energy.

01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:23.740
So as I scan the
microstates, there

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:28.800
will be a huge number of them,
omega of epsilon in number,

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.740
that have this right energy.

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.600
And so that's the
probability of the energy.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.710
And I can write this
as E to the minus 1

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:42.610
over kT that I've called beta.

01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:44.730
I have epsilon.

01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:47.387
And then the log of
omega that I take

01:15:47.387 --> 01:15:52.580
in the numerator
is S divided by Kb.

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:57.620
I can take that Kb here and
write this as T S of epsilon.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.440
And so this kind of
should remind you

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.135
of something like a free energy.

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:14.980
But it tells you is
that this probability

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:22.310
to have some particular energy
is some kind of [? a form. ?]

01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:25.300
Now note that again for
something like a gas

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:30.360
or whatever, we expect typical
values of both the energy

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.000
and entropy to be
quantities that

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.700
are proportional to
the size of the system.

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:39.470
As the size of the system
becomes exponentially large,

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:42.140
we would expect that
this probability would

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:45.800
be one of those things
that has portions that

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.190
let's say are exponentially
larger than any other portion.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.720
There will be a factor of
E to the minus N something

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.870
that will really peak up,
let's say, the extremum

01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:02.800
and make the extremum
overwhelmingly more likely

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.770
than other places.

01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:08.450
Let's try to quantify
that a little bit better.

01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:14.130
Once we have a
probability, we can also

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:16.920
start calculating averages.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:22.566
So let's define what the
average energy of the system is.

01:17:22.566 --> 01:17:25.590
The average energy
of the system is

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:30.380
obtained by summing
over all microstates.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:34.020
The energy of that
microstate, the probability

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:40.580
of that microstate, which
is E to the minus beta H

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:44.900
microstate divided by the
partition function, which

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:48.400
is the sum-- OK,
the normalization,

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.760
which we will call the
partition function, which

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.074
is the sum over all
of these microstates.

01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:03.290
Now this is something
that we've already seen.

01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:08.180
If I look at this expression
in the denominator

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:13.610
that we call Z and has a
name, which is the partition

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:19.530
function, then it's
certainly a function of beta.

01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:24.610
If I take a derivative of Z with
respect to beta, what happens

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:28.050
I'll bring down a
factor of H over here.

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:33.610
So the numerator up to
a sine is the derivative

01:18:33.610 --> 01:18:36.330
of Z with respect to beta.

01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:41.580
And the denominator is 1 over
Z. And so this is none other

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:47.090
than minus the log Z
with respect to beta.

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:52.900
So OK, fine, so the mean
value of this probability

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:57.890
is given by some
expression such as this.

01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:07.850
Well, you can see that if I
were to repeat this process

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:11.980
and rather than
taking one derivative,

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:27.320
I will take n derivatives
and then divide by 1 over Z.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:33.000
Each time I do that, I will
bring down a factor of H.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:40.740
So this is going to give me
the average of H to the N.

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.490
The end moment of this
probability distribution

01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:46.890
of energy is obtainable
by this procedure.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:56.220
So now you recognize, oh, I've
seen things like such as this.

01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:59.560
So clearly this
partition function

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.080
is something that
generates the moments

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.920
by taking subsequent
derivatives.

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:09.360
I can generate different
moments of this distribution.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.570
But then there
was something else

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:16.040
that maybe this
should remind you,

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:19.450
which is that if there's
a quantity that generates

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:24.470
moments, then its log
generates cumulants.

01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:31.590
So you would say,
OK, the nth cumulant

01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:36.580
should be obtainable up to this
factor of minus 1 to the n,

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:41.630
as the nth derivative with
respect to the beta of logs.

01:20:45.887 --> 01:20:48.560
And it's very easy
to check that indeed

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.970
if I were to take
two derivatives,

01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:53.190
I will get the
expectation value of H

01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:58.080
squared minus the average
of H squared, et cetera.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:04.460
But the point is that
clearly this to log Z

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.730
is, again, something
that is extensive.

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:12.600
Another way of getting
the normalization-- I

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.600
guess I forgot to put
this 1 over Z here.

01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:25.670
So now it is a perfectly
normalized object.

01:21:25.670 --> 01:21:32.660
So another way to get
z would be to look

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.810
at the normalization
of the probability.

01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:39.570
I could integrate over epsilon
this factor of E to the minus

01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:45.580
beta epsilon minus
T S of epsilon.

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:51.710
And that would give
me Z. Now, again

01:21:51.710 --> 01:21:54.750
the quantities that appear
in the exponent, energy--

01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:57.010
entropy, their
difference, free energy--

01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:59.180
are quantities
that are extensive.

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:02.850
So this Z is going
to be dominated again

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.950
by where this peak is.

01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:08.370
And therefore, log of Z
will be proportional to log

01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:10.170
of what we have over here.

01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:12.660
And it be an extensive quantity.

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:16.720
So ultimately, my statement
is that this log of Z

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:23.510
is something that is order of N.

01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:26.560
So we are, again,
kind of reminiscent

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.290
of the central limit theorem.

01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:33.860
In a situation where we have
a probability distribution,

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:37.540
at large N, in which
all of the cumulants

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:42.150
are proportional to N. The
mean is proportional to N.

01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:45.690
The variance is proportional
to N. All of the cumulants

01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:48.010
are proportional
to N, which means

01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:51.420
that essentially the extent of
the fluctuations that you have

01:22:51.420 --> 01:23:00.380
over here are going to go the
order of the square root of N.

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:04.020
So the bridge, the thing
that again allows us,

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:09.130
while we have in principle in
the expression that we have

01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:13.540
said, a variable
energy for the system.

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:18.530
In fact, in the limit of
things becoming extensive,

01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:23.960
I know where that energy
is, up to fluctuations

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.680
or up to uncertainty
that is only

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.060
of the order of
square root of N.

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:32.580
And so the relative uncertainty
will vanish as the N goes

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:34.790
to infinity, limit
is approached.

01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:36.570
So although again
we have something

01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:39.410
that is in principle
probabilistic,

01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:41.990
again, in the
thermodynamic sense

01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:46.740
we can identify uniquely an
energy for our system as,

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.440
let's say, the mean value
or the most likely value.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.250
They're all the same thing
of the order of 1 over N.

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:58.680
And again, to be more
precise, the variance

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:05.050
is clearly the second derivative
of log Z. 1 derivative of a log

01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:07.560
Z is going to give
me the energy.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.483
So this is going to
be d by d beta up

01:24:10.483 --> 01:24:14.000
to a minus sign of the
energy or the expectation

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.820
value of the Hamiltonian,
which we identified

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.900
as the energy of the system.

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:21.615
The derivative with
respect to beta,

01:24:21.615 --> 01:24:25.320
I can write as kB T squared.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.530
The derivative of energy
with respect to T,

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:32.110
everything here we are doing
that conditions of no work.

01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:37.030
So the variance is
in fact kB T squared,

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:40.880
the heat capacity of the system.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.300
So the extent that these
fluctuations squared

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:50.680
is kB T squared times the
heat capacity the system.

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.790
OK, so next time
what we will do is

01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:57.490
we will calculate the
results for the ideal gas.

01:24:57.490 --> 01:24:59.790
First thing, the
canonical ensemble

01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:02.990
to show that we get exactly
the same macroscopic

01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:05.620
and microscopic descriptions.

01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:09.460
And then we look
at other ensembles.

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:11.250
And that will
conclude the segment

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:13.700
that we have on
statistical mechanics

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.387
of non-interacting systems.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.400
Let's try to find the center
of mass of a uniform object

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.790
like a uniform rod.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.560
And let's assume
this rod is length L,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.730
and we want to find
the center of mass.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.130
Now, before I begin
this calculation,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.020
you can probably
already guess that it's

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.990
going to be exactly in the
middle, and we'll verify that,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.390
but let's first define what
we mean by our center of mass

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.140
for discrete particles.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.190
Recall that this
was a sum over all

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.930
the particles in the system.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.560
So we'll take a label
J goes from 1 to N,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.980
and it was the mass of that
jth particle times the position

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.660
vector that jth particle
with respect to some origin,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.680
and we're dividing
that by j equals

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.050
from 1 to N of the total
mass in the system.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.920
Now, how do we
translate this equation

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.400
for a continuous system?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.870
And let me just again show
that we had chosen an origin.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.860
Here was our jth particle
of mass mj and rj.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.610
So what we want to do
is draw the analogy,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.600
and here's how it works-- that
for each discrete particle,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.910
we're going to look at that
as some mass element delta mj.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.100
Our vector rj will go to a
vector for this mass element.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.580
I'll just write it delta m.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.979
And our sum from
j goes from 1 to N

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.120
is actually going to go to
an integral over the body.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.670
So let's see how that looks.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.530
So first, we'll do it
with the total mass,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:58.660
m-- here we're summing
over j-- from 1 to N of mj.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.330
That goes to the
integral over the body.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.570
Now, the delta m,
when we take limits,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.805
because that's when an integral
goes, we'll write that as dm.

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:13.930
So that becomes a
limit over the body.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.960
And likewise, our
sum j goes from 1

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.765
to N of mj rj goes to an
integral over the body of dm

00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:28.360
vector r going to that element.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.110
So we can say in the
limit that this becomes

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.770
r going to that element.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.820
Now, that means that our
continuous expression

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.880
for the continuous
object is an integral

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.460
over the body of dm r to
that element dm divided

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.402
by an integral over
the body of dm.
